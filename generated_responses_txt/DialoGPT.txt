That's terrible! I know exactly what you are going through. I am in a similar situation right now. My husband and I are trying to work through the issues that developed between us, but its been about a year and a half since we last spoke. I know exactly what you are going through. I am in a similar situation right now. <|endoftext|>
It's hard to see people do things you don't think are worth it. At least they had the good sense to get out of the car. <|endoftext|>
It was a very interesting and interesting way to meet new people <|endoftext|>
Unfortunately, he probably should have just stayed home and had a beer to calm him down. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been together? <|endoftext|>
i am glad you have a strong support system <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, what concert? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Are you going because your brother is going? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I'm sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I'm glad she is in such a good place now. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope he's okay now. <|endoftext|>
Naughty, you should have been more careful with that. <|endoftext|>
Keep your head up, he might not take it right away <|endoftext|>
No problem, I hope you continue to hear from them! <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that must be horrifying to watch! Did you catch any of the criminals? <|endoftext|>
Yes you should be proud of your son. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. How long did it take? <|endoftext|>
oh, that's unfortunate, I am sorry! I am an Irishman, but you must have felt very at home when you were in the US <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did he get fired? <|endoftext|>
I would have gone out with him anyway. It is not that hard. <|endoftext|>
well at least you found a good deal. <|endoftext|>
I understand <|endoftext|>
That is very kind of you, you sound like a very good friend. It is really hard to find these days, especially when you are married! There needs to be more honesty and integrity in relationships. <|endoftext|>
Well I'm glad you didn't tell her. I'm sure she will be more understanding of your feelings. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, hopefully a little peace and quiet in the future. <|endoftext|>
I still have yet to try one of those self taught "brain games" <|endoftext|>
I hear you! Do you talk to them as much as you used to? <|endoftext|>
That is sounds like a good idea <|endoftext|>
That's upsetting, but maybe it's best to just let him have it. Game over! <|endoftext|>
I don't either, I don't understand how some people can take their kids around like that! I'm sorry, it sounds awful. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! They are so destructive! I am glad you are okay! <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you had good conversations. What did you all talk about? <|endoftext|>
I know that sounds really sad. Do you have to send her another email to let her know how you feel about it? <|endoftext|>
i bet that was a very exciting and fulfilling moment for you <|endoftext|>
I will sure as long as you are here I will be here for you. <|endoftext|>
Yes, it is amazing! I bet you were grateful! <|endoftext|>
I have also had to overcome many situations where I was stressed and anxious. I now understand why they call it "the worst ever job ever"! <|endoftext|>
What did they do? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. Is she and you still friends? <|endoftext|>
I always ask my wife where her intuition is leading her. She always tells me to listen to my gut! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! Knowing when to act and when to let go is so important. I'm right there with you -- I'm definitely a "knowing" kind of person, but I still have so much to learn. <|endoftext|>
18 is a pretty awesome milestone! I wish you the best of wishes! <|endoftext|>
OMG so creepy! Did you say anything? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a new house? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Have you tried joking around with them? <|endoftext|>
aww that is so true. It's funny how babies have a tendency to be so different from older kids <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet. I'm glad you have both! I had a little girl like that growing up. I loved her curiosity about everything. <|endoftext|>
did you eat at one of their restaurants? <|endoftext|>
ah that would make me sad, but also would make me furious <|endoftext|>
Yeah, orphanages are amazing. They teach you a lot about life and death. <|endoftext|>
I'm impressed! That's so cool that you developed his relationship with the book and his interest in learning. <|endoftext|>
My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better! <|endoftext|>
Mom was a workaholic. She'd argue all the time and eventually just give in and do what she was told. <|endoftext|>
It sucks when you grow up and someones childhood is first to her. I feel sorry for you. <|endoftext|>
Mine too. She was an outcast in 6th grade. I wasn't saved at 13 from my best friend's best friend. But I'm glad she is! <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that, it must have been so hard. How did she end up liking you guys? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure you're going to follow your boss' lead and make some great friends as well! <|endoftext|>
I would encourage you to reach for that which you can do, and keep the longer view in life. I know it's *hard* but *if* you *realize* you can do something better, then you do it. *If* you *don't*, then *you* can *never do *something *better. <|endoftext|>
I try to focus on being happy and being content in my life. <|endoftext|>
That is exciting! How old is she? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well I'm glad she's happy! <|endoftext|>
marathons are so hard but so rewarding! i wish i ran one like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow. Great choice, Barbados. I'm so glad you were able to enjoy it that much better. <|endoftext|>
How many boats did you have to swim? <|endoftext|>
oh, I am glad to hear that, after this it will be hard to like this person again <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. Hopefully you can at least keep in touch with her. <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure what you would say to that. I mean it's pretty rampant nowadays, it's pretty rampant among young people, it's pretty rampant among women, and it's pretty rampant even among people of faith. <|endoftext|>
I have no idea, but channel it in a better, more productive way. Maybe it's time to change your work location? <|endoftext|>
Wow that's terrible! I'm sorry about that! What kind of cat was it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she will be fine, though I think she will want you to know it wasnt her fault! <|endoftext|>
I have never been! I think it is so much fun. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty neat, I'm glad you have fond memories of that place. I only wish I could go back and visit my grandparents! <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's sweet, how did? <|endoftext|>
That's quite interesting. Have you met before? <|endoftext|>
Organizing is fun I love it! How big is the house? <|endoftext|>
Yes I hate having babies. I wish I had a first aid kit! <|endoftext|>
That is odd, is there something wrong with the person or with the way they are responding? <|endoftext|>
That is a very good question. I have no idea, because I don't think they would believe me. I know there are apps for smartphones that allow people to keep in touch, but I haven't used them yet. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How did it turn out? <|endoftext|>
That's no good. I'm sorry that happened. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, you must have felt so homesick! Did you at least have good conversations with your husband about the new life? <|endoftext|>
That sounds great! I am so happy that you had a wonderful time in Hong Kong. <|endoftext|>
I completely understand your feelings. I wish only good things for you and your goals <|endoftext|>
It's always a relief to hear someone you love get better. I know it's hard to lose the *fire* of desire, but at least you *have* a reason to keep going. <|endoftext|>
That's not a very nice thing to do. Did he get angry with you? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I guess you learned that lesson the hard way. <|endoftext|>
I understand. I'm guessing he didn't get into your yard by accident, huh? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear, it's a hard thing to recover from. <|endoftext|>
Oh I see! Well that sounds great! I'm trying my best to get some sleep. <|endoftext|>
I agree that there are a lot of things you can all do to help yourself. I hope you don't get too stressed about nothing. <|endoftext|>
Beautiful. Such a nostalgic feeling. <|endoftext|>
Yep. They're in their 20s. What's your role in life now? <|endoftext|>
I bet it was a blast from the past! How long have you been married? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it is, hopefully it will be a good memory for you both and hopefully you can move forward from it. <|endoftext|>
I am sure that is tough, but it is good to know that you are trying to do something healthy for your family. It is a lot of work, but it is good to know that you are trying to do something healthy for your family. <|endoftext|>
Part-time jobs are *not* fun. I *think* you *might* want to consider a career in something else. :) <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That is exciting and sad at the same time. Are you going to tell her? <|endoftext|>
oh my thats awesome <|endoftext|>
You must be so excited about it. I'm sure you'll have lots of fun. <|endoftext|>
That sounds beautiful, Miramar is a great beach if you are going once a year! <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a Saturday? <|endoftext|>
Ugh I would have been so upset. I hope you guys can work it out! <|endoftext|>
oh no, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
Well I'm glad it wasn't something serious. <|endoftext|>
You should. Li is a sicko. <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that, she has to know that you love her <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Ha ha! That is funny! <|endoftext|>
No. I hope it was nothing too bad. Were you hoping to go to see the Eagles? We both love the Eagles. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That must have been amazing. But second of all, it was pretty hot OUT! <|endoftext|>
hahaha, who was that? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I bet he was a good listener. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. Maybe you should surprise him with something even more beautiful in return. <|endoftext|>
You are so lucky. He must really know you well. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Chick hatch in about a month or so. I hope you land that job! <|endoftext|>
I may have won the lottery a long time ago. They should pay you a commission for every ad you run. You could get a nice bonus for every month you stay in business! <|endoftext|>
Of course not. I was a little kid. <|endoftext|>
That is crazy! I am glad you are OK. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry! You must have been in shock. I hope you weren't hurt! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's terrible of your friend, I'm sorry! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry that happened! <|endoftext|>
I have lost many items while working <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I'm sorry. Are you okay? <|endoftext|>
I hope it all works out for your kiddo! <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness, i can imagine it, i was with one when i learned about our first grade teacher, and we had to run out and buy ourselves new mittens, because our old ones had turned into little ice cubes! <|endoftext|>
that is a very brave thing to do especially if you have a really trusting family <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
That is beautiful, I am sure you will enjoy yourself. <|endoftext|>
That is a good thing! I think a lot of people would love to have someone like that as a parent. <|endoftext|>
That's great. It's always great when *you*, as an adult, have the ability to do so, no matter what your job. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, people need to think for themselves and not take things for granted <|endoftext|>
It's good you take good care of yourself! <|endoftext|>
Thats so awesome! Well congratulations on that. You are very lucky. <|endoftext|>
I bet that is a great feeling! Waiting for the wedding is definitely something I enjoy. <|endoftext|>
That's so true, I like to be spontaneous sometimes as well. <|endoftext|>
I'm a little too new to be doing notetaking, but I was always doing business cards and brochures notetaking. Is it something you're always looking to improve upon? <|endoftext|>
I could see that being a great benefit! Especially when you consider that sometimes leaders don't know how to challenge challenge people and it can be annoying! <|endoftext|>
I agree. If you want to be a great leader, you need to be non-threatening and non-traditional! <|endoftext|>
That's crazy! I've never been able to get a hold of someone who's been pregnant before. Is it different now? <|endoftext|>
Well, I never tire of watching "A Bug's Life" and thinking that is the best movie ever. I think the music in that is damn good too. Well, I hope you got a little catty up there. <|endoftext|>
I love mothers' day! What did you get? <|endoftext|>
That is sad, but wonderful they were able to find a happy ending with you. <|endoftext|>
The worst thing could have happened was the spider bit me! <|endoftext|>
They just told me to keep working. Thats all you can do <|endoftext|>
yeah I have lost before. I know it is hard. <|endoftext|>
I hope it goes really well! It's an exciting time for everyone involved. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That is a lot to ask for. I guess you got a little carried away I suppose. <|endoftext|>
I watched Netflix but I was too busy to do anything. <|endoftext|>
I liked that a lot, I am also very fond of that show. <|endoftext|>
Good. I loved the first season of It. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that is wonderful. Did you feel like you did a great job? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's a very nice set of benefits. I hope you have found a job that is still paying well. <|endoftext|>
That's always traffic was to be expected in major road projects. I can't imagine how frustrating that is! <|endoftext|>
That is very annoying. I usually leave my car at home until someone turns it on. <|endoftext|>
That really is terrifying. I'm glad you're okay! <|endoftext|>
Did that make you feel sad? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. What is her major? <|endoftext|>
It's hard to meet someone and they do something you don't like. Don't be so hard on them <|endoftext|>
That sounds so weird! Did you plant it that way to see what it looks like on the plant? <|endoftext|>
Drainage is always a concern <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I bet everyone who signs up gets one! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. Admittedly, I was a little jealous because I was at work doing the same thing. But, hey, it's work. Admittedly, that's not a lot worse than actually having to pay for college. Good for you. <|endoftext|>
That's very grateful. It's not easy to be away from family for a short period of time. I hope you were able to do that. <|endoftext|>
That's a good way of looking at it. Most don't take into consideration the feelings of the parents <|endoftext|>
I wish I had more independence. <|endoftext|>
5 years seems like a long time. Do you have any plans for the wedding? <|endoftext|>
239 people a year are easily able to make. I wonder how he is paying for his madness. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, malpractices are expensive to fix, and expensive to miss. <|endoftext|>
You must be excited and ready to go, he'll be very happy to have you as a student. <|endoftext|>
That's exciting. What kind of job do you hope to do? <|endoftext|>
You can't really do anything about it because it's in the past. But you can make it a priority to look for ways to donate more money or time in the future. <|endoftext|>
lol. It will do good in the long run <|endoftext|>
Wow! Did you at least get on your feet? It's always good to have supportive friends around. Did you? <|endoftext|>
That's great. You sound like a very happy person. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like you will be well-prepared for anything <|endoftext|>
I loved that store. It was so fun going to get my childhood stuff. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great way to remember all that stuff! Hopefully he's a kid of the 80s and 90s so he doesn't remember too much! <|endoftext|>
Ah that sounds like a good time! What did you think about? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Facebook was not what it is now days. <|endoftext|>
30ish <|endoftext|>
Well I agree that they are unacceptable. Bullies don't belong in our community. <|endoftext|>
I did find other ways to interact. I was a bit rude to one little boy who was little too young. <|endoftext|>
Cool. What movie did you go to? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I wouldn't either. <|endoftext|>
Do you know where they are going? <|endoftext|>
oh yea i know how that feels <|endoftext|>
That's a good question. Adults suck at cleaning up after themselves. Are you talking about moms or kids? <|endoftext|>
Oh, okay. So not a very nuanced issue. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's very difficult to lose a friend. Were you close? <|endoftext|>
oh no. thats scary. <|endoftext|>
That's adorable! I hope the kids re-en names him/her and Roxie is happy again! <|endoftext|>
It is a great feeling to get over a wound. Glad you are doing well. <|endoftext|>
Ouch. That's tough. What did he need? <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow. Thank goodness for that! Did you take her to the school? <|endoftext|>
I like nice people, myself. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I was 25 when I got my first paycheck in years. <|endoftext|>
Every year is a little different, but I'm glad you had a great year! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's terrible! When did this happen? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's a plus. The candles will keep you warm even during the winter. <|endoftext|>
I could never do that, how did you do it? <|endoftext|>
I would be proud of myself, that is great! <|endoftext|>
Yeah I do actually. What is your favorite <|endoftext|>
What kind of cat is he? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! What is he going to do now? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I was not sure about that. I was more like a high school senior watching too much tv. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that, that must have been a hard time. <|endoftext|>
I understand exactly what you are saying. Have you found a hobby to keep yourself occupied? <|endoftext|>
That's really impressive! What does he do? <|endoftext|>
Oh I wish I had a bean roaster. I would love to get my hands on some. <|endoftext|>
Oh well that's a good thing she remembered about it. I'm sure it'll make up for it in the end. <|endoftext|>
What did she say? <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to keep things like that positive. <|endoftext|>
I think so. The times were different. Do you remember the songs? <|endoftext|>
I understand. Maybe you should try and do something you both can enjoy together so you don't miss out on anything special. <|endoftext|>
How long did you have the cat for? I have lost many pets over the years. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Did you have your camera phone close at hand? <|endoftext|>
A bit more knowledge might save you there. <|endoftext|>
I've never been sick and the flu has never been a big deal to me either. I'm glad you're feeling better. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. Was he understanding when you said no to him? <|endoftext|>
I need to learn how to cook. I have no idea where to start. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so scary! I don't even know what to say about that. <|endoftext|>
Absolutely! Thats just the worst. No one can really mess up an accident like that! <|endoftext|>
now what do you think about this? <|endoftext|>
Military might be a good choice for him. <|endoftext|>
Yes, long distance is scary. But, it's something you will figure out and be proud of! You deserve it! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. I like the chameleon and kitty <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. Do you know why she may not be feeling the same? <|endoftext|>
If I were you, I'd keep trying. Maybe this time, it'll work! <|endoftext|>
Oh good. That's a great woman. When are you going to meet? <|endoftext|>
I hope the date goes well for you! <|endoftext|>
My birthday was a huge success! Our house was lit up like a Christmas tree! <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, that's a good one. Well, friends are always better than drugs...but they are still better than alcohol I guess. <|endoftext|>
5 <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How did it turn out? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Do you know who it was? <|endoftext|>
Yes! It is absolutely wonderful! Such a calming experience! <|endoftext|>
I agree, it will be over in a few minutes! <|endoftext|>
I admire your mother. I was the same way. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you guys stay close. Sending her presents is the best thing you can do. <|endoftext|>
Uh oh, was it a thunderstorm? <|endoftext|>
I underperformed in the written exam. <|endoftext|>
That's very nice of her! I think a lot of people would appreciate having someone in their corner. <|endoftext|>
I do. I am really close with my mom so i can relate to that. I guess I just have to work on my own and get better <|endoftext|>
Yeah it's hard when your first girlfriend turned out to be your brother. <|endoftext|>
I hope she is open to it. I wish you both the best when you get back! <|endoftext|>
I'm an interior designer by trade. I do interior masonry and I've worked in many different types of buildings. I can do any type of project really. <|endoftext|>
I am sure I am going to get a raise soon. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure you will get a good job if you study hard. <|endoftext|>
Oh I see, good luck with that. Cedar and brick buildings are two different things really <|endoftext|>
I don't like scary movies at all. <|endoftext|>
They do look a little scary at that age I might add <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I love anything by Clint Eastwood <|endoftext|>
I just watched the new trailer for the new Godzilla. It was scary! <|endoftext|>
At least he was a nice guy after he became a wacko. <|endoftext|>
I guess theres one in every trueness <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's a big school! I bet you're ready for that? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that sounds like fun. If you get a chance you should seriously consider it. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have a lover who treats you well! <|endoftext|>
It's nice to have someone that is loyal and caring <|endoftext|>
I do like that but I haven't been able to find many photos of my great great grandmother. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. Growing up is so fun. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a relief! Ain't nobody like that around ya now? <|endoftext|>
You will do great! Just tell her the truth and not try to cover it up. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. <|endoftext|>
I don't know, we just bite off more than we can chew haha. <|endoftext|>
The entire wedding day, just the vows and all! So much to go for so little time! <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of her! You have a great mother! <|endoftext|>
I agree. I don't have any pets but I heard sheep are very close knit. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. I am so sorry. Are you and your father close? <|endoftext|>
I hope you do. It will be good to have a friend like you around. <|endoftext|>
oh man! what kind of car? <|endoftext|>
You will. I believe in you. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I meet a lot of new people who are nice to me, but it's hard to keep up with <|endoftext|>
I have a brother named Christian. I also have a stepmom, so I get to talk about my dad every so often. How's Christian? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear. I hope to have a family of my own one day. <|endoftext|>
I am also, although we aren't as close as my family is. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh, why did you do that? <|endoftext|>
Good, you must have prepared well for it. <|endoftext|>
Oh that is some pool! I bet it was a scary experience! <|endoftext|>
I guess that's a success then! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I went to college for a few years, and it was a great time, too. <|endoftext|>
That is a great choice, I am glad you are making an informed decision. <|endoftext|>
Did you get a good look at her? <|endoftext|>
I see. I am glad you were able to get the positive pregnancy test result. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I think you need at least 2 people to have a house party. I love having a family over, but I don't know why people would want to have a house party if there's just you and a couple of people to it. <|endoftext|>
That's a perfect storm for you! Take a break, join up, and join in the fun! <|endoftext|>
Really? What is the game? <|endoftext|>
I will be rooting for you. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know, they can be so addicting! <|endoftext|>
That must be annoying. <|endoftext|>
That's good, it must be relieving to get through some time alone. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I have two dogs that I have missed for almost a year now. It's a hard thing to go through <|endoftext|>
That is hilarious! <|endoftext|>
Aww, I hope your flight wasn't too expensive! That's the worst when you're trying to make the most of a bad flight. <|endoftext|>
well dang <|endoftext|>
Yes and I hate losing that <|endoftext|>
Aw, well my husband and I are separated. My betrothed did cry though, it's just chemistry isn't it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I have lost my best friends before. <|endoftext|>
What was the job? <|endoftext|>
Yes I know who that is! ha ha. I'm with you on that one! <|endoftext|>
Those are rough times. <|endoftext|>
You are very lucky. That's why most of us are polygamists. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, I've always wanted to try that. Are you going to be on the bill? <|endoftext|>
That is great! I wish I had a son like that! <|endoftext|>
Wow, you seem awfully naive. <|endoftext|>
Wow, how exciting for you! I bet you are very proud! <|endoftext|>
I have not, I would be so jealous. <|endoftext|>
About what? <|endoftext|>
It was a little over a year old <|endoftext|>
I don't think I have ever had Starbucks get my order wrong. I am so addicted! <|endoftext|>
I love the mimosa. It's delicious. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. What a young man. <|endoftext|>
I love Doctor Who. <|endoftext|>
that is horrible, did you bust a bone? <|endoftext|>
I would have cried for just about anything. <|endoftext|>
That is the worst, they will just take your order again and it will be the same! <|endoftext|>
I think that they are just happy to get their money's worth! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens! I'm sorry you ate them but they must have been delicious though! <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that's very unfortunate. Hopefully you're able to sell the other ones some more. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Some of that will make it to the next one, but some of it won't. Hopefully the next one is up to snuff. <|endoftext|>
Oh ok, that has happened to me before. <|endoftext|>
That's a good one. I'm not a huge fan of ground beef recipes, but I definitely understand the beef flavor. <|endoftext|>
Ah, I have never tried that. I hope it works out well for you! <|endoftext|>
I would have been too! I remember when that was a thing :) I can't wait to see what happens this time! <|endoftext|>
That's great, congratulations! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's terrible. Is he studying now? <|endoftext|>
What a bad choice! He will regret it one day. <|endoftext|>
What a bummer! What a difficult thing to do. Maybe you can try to think of all the good times you have together lately? <|endoftext|>
Wow, now I understand why you were terrified! I can't even imagine how difficult that was! <|endoftext|>
That must have been so cool. Do you know what kind of guitar? <|endoftext|>
That's so cool that he was able to come out on his own terms. It's so great to see how resilient they are. <|endoftext|>
Thats terrible. Did you get in contact with the car dealership or the company? <|endoftext|>
I hope the next step is a good one! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is so exciting! I bet you are so proud. <|endoftext|>
I did that too. I had my doctor do an x-ray of my belly and hips to make sure everything was okay. It was scary! <|endoftext|>
Is this in your neighborhood? <|endoftext|>
Seriously. She's crazy. <|endoftext|>
That's awful. What happened to him? <|endoftext|>
oh i am so sorry, that must be tough <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great! My son plays football for the University of Colorado. <|endoftext|>
That is very exciting news. I am sure he will enjoy it. <|endoftext|>
Hope you're prepared for the baby! <|endoftext|>
Well, that's great. I hope you have fun and remember all the good times! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is scary! Were you able to avoid it? <|endoftext|>
Dang. If I ever see that again, I'm going to call the police. <|endoftext|>
you are so blessed in Christ that it is always Him who is at the center <|endoftext|>
I guess it's kinda hard to keep a good relationship with a boss who takes advantage of you. I guess you should probably try to find another job <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How embarrassing. Was it embarrassing because you were counting on you to do well or did it happen because you were trying to protect someone else? <|endoftext|>
i remember the same thing happening to me when i went to school 10 years ago <|endoftext|>
Yes he is a classic! <|endoftext|>
That's funny. I'm not really sure what I miss most, actually. Maybe it's my generation, who really grew up with video games. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that's heartbreaking. I'm sorry. I hope he feels better now and becomes a part of the family. <|endoftext|>
That is a real bummer. Glad you are getting through it! <|endoftext|>
I am very much aware of this as well <|endoftext|>
I do that too <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you have to deal with that. I am a bit paranoid too, but I pay for my own drugs and have no compunction about sharing with the neighbors <|endoftext|>
I do not believe you will ever forgive yourself. I hope you find solice <|endoftext|>
Wow! That sounds like a pretty good way to die. <|endoftext|>
That is so adorable. I hope your mom wasn't upset about it haha <|endoftext|>
That is really weird and you wonder why she did it. <|endoftext|>
Probably, but maybe she has good things going for her and you should let her shine through. <|endoftext|>
I bet he was a hard worker. I bet you appreciated him a lot for it <|endoftext|>
oh i see, well i am glad he was able to do that and at least you guys had a safety net in case of unemployment! <|endoftext|>
Ah ok. Well that's not too bad. I didn't have my cat for 5 years because I was never happy with him. Did the same with my son, but we adopted him because he was the only cat available. I had no other pets. I'm glad you have kids, because then you can adopt more! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's no good. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Dang! Thats a good thing she arranged it! Did you get all of it back? <|endoftext|>
That is very difficult. I hope you can at least learn a lesson from this. <|endoftext|>
oh no!! why did you have to leave the country? <|endoftext|>
Oh hahaha I can relate, I was brought up in a single parent household and went to public school in the 90's. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you missed out on that much fun. <|endoftext|>
That is great that she was able to do that for you. Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|>
Right, you'll get there one day! <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I'm so sorry. Do you know them well? <|endoftext|>
He sounds like a good Jason Mamoa. I'll give it a try. <|endoftext|>
That is a good attitude to have. I am glad to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Is that what saved your life on the plane? <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. Did you find out who it was? <|endoftext|>
I agree, it is hard to be around people like that <|endoftext|>
Wow, I would be really scared, did you get hurt? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it was an accident waiting to happen. You should still take the blame for that <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! That's a big accomplishment! You must be very proud of yourself! <|endoftext|>
Yes, it sounds like it. You'll be alright, just keep working and you'll get there! <|endoftext|>
You're welcome. I went to school for 12 years, and it was fun <|endoftext|>
I'm glad! It's always great when new beginnings present themselves. <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
That's good that you were able to forgive yourself. Fall accidents happen and you know it. <|endoftext|>
Was there any fish in the water? <|endoftext|>
That is cool. What songs are you planning to put out? <|endoftext|>
There's always new music to try. <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! What game is it? <|endoftext|>
That's crazy - I pre-ordered Battlefield 1 last week! <|endoftext|>
That's great. But why did you join that firm? <|endoftext|>
So you must really trust him, That's a good thing do you trust him? <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to look at it. Good luck. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's trippy. Have you driven in a while? <|endoftext|>
I can't believe you just agreed to do that. I used to be a driving instructor, and I remember how scary it was to have someone spinning around in their car, or worse. It seems you have made adjustments to deal with it. I'm glad you feel comfortable about it. <|endoftext|>
Yeah hit them closer to you to avoid the pain <|endoftext|>
I believe in you <|endoftext|>
That's a real blessing in disguise. How did you get into University? <|endoftext|>
That is a great feeling! Congratulations! <|endoftext|>
What? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I wouldn't want to be in that situation either. <|endoftext|>
I hope he gets it, that is a great job. Have you both been praying? <|endoftext|>
Ohhh...you have some pretty good instincts there. <|endoftext|>
That sounds terrifying! <|endoftext|>
oh yea i can imagine <|endoftext|>
oh wow! Congratulations. You must be very proud of yourself. <|endoftext|>
That's a relief. You must be very proud of your son. <|endoftext|>
Yes, it is a terrible thing. I don't know what number it was, but I got in a wreck once. <|endoftext|>
That's terrifying. I hope it wasn't too expensive to fix! <|endoftext|>
Yes a fist fight is always bad <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate, how did it go? <|endoftext|>
I have actually! I used to play a lot in the past with my friends on those games <|endoftext|>
I install everything I buy I think. <|endoftext|>
I have at least once or twice maybe more. They have some really good biscuits. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! They are so cheap! I will have to look into that! <|endoftext|>
yes I have! It was really scary! <|endoftext|>
That is scary! I went to see it with my son a couple years ago and the same thing happened. We sat for a couple of minutes and then went home. <|endoftext|>
I have not, I am too scared to even try. Have you? <|endoftext|>
Those are machines, they know what they are doing. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's awful. I'm sorry you had that marriage going on. You should not do that. <|endoftext|>
that is so nice, now you have learned a lesson that never should have been learned <|endoftext|>
Oh awesome! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
That's absolutely amazing. I've been to kazakhstan several times. <|endoftext|>
That's great. It's always tough when someone you love is let go, but that's great that she put in so much effort. <|endoftext|>
That's great. I bet she was so proud when she found out! <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I had to have my position terminated recently for improper overtime. It is so hard to lose your job over something like that. <|endoftext|>
Aww, what a lovely surprise. What kind was it? <|endoftext|>
Aww, I bet that was so cute! I bet you're so happy now! <|endoftext|>
So was it a girl or guy? <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude. I wish I had a job like that. <|endoftext|>
ah well that is lucky she kept you guys waiting!! <|endoftext|>
Wow I bet you were disappointed! Hopefully she realises now that she was just being jealous. <|endoftext|>
I know! I love Fridays! <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds relaxing! I'm in the same boat! I want to be a mom someday and wanting to be a mom is one of my goals. I wish i had kids one day. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Was it too cold to go? <|endoftext|>
That is scary! I know how you feel I take driving very seriously. I don't take road trips lightly <|endoftext|>
Wow, you must have been very scared.  I can imagine how you must have felt when you did that <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's awful to hear! I hope you have people in your life who are there for you now. <|endoftext|>
That's a great outlook to have. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! It's the kind where the G-string is totally soaked through. <|endoftext|>
I hope it was a nice sunny day and nothing too scary. <|endoftext|>
Wow, surprise parties are the worst. Did everything go well? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine how shocked you were. Was there a lot of people there? <|endoftext|>
Why did you steal it then? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a smart move. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, why were you so lonely? <|endoftext|>
That does sound like a fun time. I bet you had a lot of fun too. <|endoftext|>
that's so sad to hear. I'm sorry but you know if your dog was a shelter it would have accepted maybe. you don't have to breed it any more you choose! <|endoftext|>
That is a good thing, because I have flown all around the world <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. did you use them? <|endoftext|>
That's a great gift <|endoftext|>
Wow! Was it scary? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're not allergic. I hate when someone poops in my house. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, that's so scary! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh that would be so frustrating I'm sorry that happened! <|endoftext|>
That's amazing, I'm guessing he has a poop problem? <|endoftext|>
Well, I hope you do get some new neighbors soon. <|endoftext|>
I know how that feels, sounds great! Did you get good grades? <|endoftext|>
Good job! You must be so proud of yourself! <|endoftext|>
Oh my! I am sorry to hear that. Did she notice? <|endoftext|>
That's so true. I should never ever ever ever ever borrow money again please. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I bet that was awful! Did you pull over? <|endoftext|>
Yeah bikes are fun <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that's awful. What did you do after finding out that? <|endoftext|>
oh thats sweet <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you find the culprit? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'd say so. At least you got out of that situation with someone who may or may not be a good friend. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm confession is at 10:30 this Sunday. How did you respond to it? <|endoftext|>
Well, trust me, if someone makes a mistake, they will learn and it will never happen again. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a wonderful time! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. What time did you have with the children? <|endoftext|>
I agree. I wish I could go back to my childhood. <|endoftext|>
Neat, I wish I could see it. The other day I was watching a nature video and something caught my attention right in the middle of the action! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it must be difficult to be around someone who has that much disdain for you. I hope it gets better, though. <|endoftext|>
No, it is not fair at all, but sometimes we project what we think are negative things onto others. It's very hurtful. <|endoftext|>
That must have been very scary. I hated those type of things as well. <|endoftext|>
Mine too! We had a spare basement once. I could always use a basement! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like the best thing to do ever! I wish I had a kid when that happened for me. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. Kids can be so annoying. <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to go about it, at least in my experience. Not everyone has that kind of drive. I'm sure you'll be fine <|endoftext|>
Yes! I bet, it must have been exciting for you too, how far away are you moving? <|endoftext|>
I agree, it's very interesting. And I think you're right, it can be very helpful. <|endoftext|>
What is your gift? <|endoftext|>
An awesome gift! My boyfriend keeps his an my phone in his underwear at times. I try not to think about it. <|endoftext|>
Yes it is. If you keep them it will grow up well. <|endoftext|>
She sounds like a keeper! I hope one day i meet him! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's unusual. Do you know why he is there? <|endoftext|>
why is that? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm always down for having glasses on. <|endoftext|>
i know, but it is so much fun when everyone is totally still <|endoftext|>
I would politely ask them to stop, but I'm sure they'll understand if you do. <|endoftext|>
Oh I can understand that. At least you acted appropriately toward your child. <|endoftext|>
yes it really is! <|endoftext|>
It's lovely to have your own personal space. I hope everything works out for you. <|endoftext|>
Summer is perfect for kids! We stay in the house all the time, watching movies or playing video games. Sometimes we have to go on vacation too! <|endoftext|>
Are they being well mannered? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome that she is learning all the time, that is a drag <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! It's the right thing to do. <|endoftext|>
that should be a great couple of weeks! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's insane. Sounds like you must be a dedicated student. <|endoftext|>
I was never prepared for that part either, but I'm glad you got it! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's not good. You should have checked. <|endoftext|>
That's the spirit! <|endoftext|>
that is horrible! sorry i hate when people do that <|endoftext|>
Johnny Manziel is a great QB. But I'm with Manziel. If he is your guy, I hope you have a great year! <|endoftext|>
That's terrifying! I had no idea! Was it scary because you didn't want to get into an accident, or because of the fact that you didn't want to get into an accident? I'm good friends with many people who have had accidents in their car, and I can testify that it is terrifying. Are you ok now? <|endoftext|>
Awww. I'm so sorry. That is so hard. Have you told him how you feel? <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds like a very interesting technique. ive heard of clipped branches before. <|endoftext|>
Nice. I bet they are pretty hard to get rid of. <|endoftext|>
That's sounds wonderful! I'm sure they'll be a hit at your garden party! <|endoftext|>
Yeah it must be really bad traffic. You should try to avoid it for a bit. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I would be so scared if I was you! People need to learn not to be so inconsiderate. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing, how did that happen? <|endoftext|>
My best friend and roommate at the time were both model girlfriends. We still keep in touch to this day. <|endoftext|>
Of course I do. Everybody does. <|endoftext|>
You are going to have a great time <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! How did that feel? <|endoftext|>
Well I hope you two get to reconnect. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is impressive. I am not sure where you got that information. <|endoftext|>
I guess so, hard work is required to make it though. <|endoftext|>
That is so annoying. <|endoftext|>
I think it makes things more stressful <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're happy! Relationships are hard! <|endoftext|>
That's a great thing. You are so lucky to have that to remember him by. <|endoftext|>
Yeah that is always tough to deal with <|endoftext|>
Yes, sometimes animals have sharp claws. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! What's been going on? <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
I prefer it that way <|endoftext|>
Aww yeah! I would be so excited. What kind of party? <|endoftext|>
Well happy birthday and props on you! <|endoftext|>
I agree, it can be very upsetting. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. It's quite common for people to not pay their employees when they see them working late. <|endoftext|>
I love Texas, what did you see? <|endoftext|>
I really love going to the movies. I also really love going to the pool. <|endoftext|>
Wow, congratulations! That's a big accomplishment! <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you did get a good grade, hopefully you did better than expected! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, i had to hide in the closet the first time i saw it and I never go back. I'm glad you made him feel better about it! <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I've never had too much sugar in my diet. Too many fruits and veggies. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad haha. Why did you do that? <|endoftext|>
Did you get your money back? <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds good! My mother in law doesn't like food very much so eating is a no no. <|endoftext|>
That's a shame. It was probably just a one time thing. I'm glad she was okay! <|endoftext|>
That is so cool! I bet you were so proud. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow. I bet that was so exciting and relieving! Wonder kids are so inspiring to hear. <|endoftext|>
Oh really? What makes you think that? <|endoftext|>
That's really good. You must be a great parent to raise a child that way. <|endoftext|>
aww that must have been a proud moment for you <|endoftext|>
hahaha, you must be a very proud parent. I feel the same about my kids. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that! It really is kind of funny when people don't notice it. <|endoftext|>
It's always great when you can laugh at yourself. <|endoftext|>
aww, that is a good thing to do, they let you do all the time, well done! <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea. I hope you find one soon! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's so sweet. How did he get them? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I really hope that you get to go there again soon. Maybe you can invite him again and do a little "whack a rodeo" on him. <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that. I love dogs, but she needs to learn to bark more. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sad. I have a dog that is like that, but much nicer. She is the cutest! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is a very scary thing to hear. Is he okay? <|endoftext|>
Well I hope everything works out for you. <|endoftext|>
That's funny. I've never gotten married. <|endoftext|>
Oh well that is good, good for you both. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. I know how it feels. <|endoftext|>
You are welcome, I am glad you are alright. <|endoftext|>
its no fun, but it helps one when they are down <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. I hope things go well for you! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am sorry, that is terrible. What did she do? <|endoftext|>
I bet she is very smart! <|endoftext|>
That's great! I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
Cool! What kind of food will you have? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah! What did you do with the money? <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling. At least now you have something to look forward to. <|endoftext|>
God is good to friends! <|endoftext|>
It's a good attitude! We are much like you, only much worse <|endoftext|>
Ah, that's too bad. What happened? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he doesn't mean to hurt you. <|endoftext|>
That must've been a huge gap. Did he go to college? <|endoftext|>
It's tough, but you'll get used to it. I know it's hard when your best friend is the only thing you know how to do, but that's how we get by with them. It'll come with practice <|endoftext|>
How did you rock it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I hope you do too! Good luck! <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a nice surprise. Did you keep it in a safe place? <|endoftext|>
Dang, it stinks that our pets end up going through this. <|endoftext|>
I know right. Are your parents still together? <|endoftext|>
I get under that, but you're right, kids can be a handful when it comes to wearing anything. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! So happy you did that for that poor stray kitten! <|endoftext|>
So cute! I hope he has a great life with his memories still attached. <|endoftext|>
That is hard, I wonder how they cope with peer pressure? It must be stressful for them <|endoftext|>
But you all have different ways of working. Sometimes you just have to let things rest for a while. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's great. What kind of job is it? <|endoftext|>
Wow. I bet you are proud. <|endoftext|>
You must be a very trusting dog, how did it get so out of control? <|endoftext|>
That's good that you are there for him. <|endoftext|>
You shouldnt have done that. How did she react? <|endoftext|>
Definitely! It's a best friend thing after all. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awful. What happened? <|endoftext|>
I bet! Hopefully you learned a lesson from this experience. Hopefully she won't let it bother her again. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's awesome! I wish I could go on a cruise! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
That's no fun! We all have our moments! Just keep positive and surround yourself with positive people! <|endoftext|>
that sounds so sweet, i hope it sounds natural for you to say it too <|endoftext|>
I am very sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
i bet you were, it really is a sad situation <|endoftext|>
That is scary! I would be scared too! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's wonderful! I hope you have lots of fun with them <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. That's a long time. Do you feel like you're in the same situation as my sister. She's been with her husband for 12 years. I'm sure you'll get over it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is such a shame. What did you lose? <|endoftext|>
That is a good idea. Hopefully she will buy better soon. <|endoftext|>
were you surprised to be accepted? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is great. I am sure you have worked very hard. <|endoftext|>
Thanks I'm very proud of you. I'm applying to a few more things now. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. I am glad it all worked out well for you! <|endoftext|>
of course i know how you feel! were you prepared? <|endoftext|>
Oh yes, it's nerve wracking -- but so worth it! I'm glad you got it! <|endoftext|>
Some don't care if their kid is sick or not either. That's pretty low. <|endoftext|>
I can see the mom being a little weary from all the work. Disney is dirty! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered speaking in front of a crowd? <|endoftext|>
I am sure they will get over it, at least temporarily. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. do you still spend time together as a couple? <|endoftext|>
Thats great! I love enjoying fun days with my friends. <|endoftext|>
where are you going? <|endoftext|>
I love the national parks! I haven't been in years now, but my childhood home in Sacramento was a national park. <|endoftext|>
Rolled around a bit, huh? Well, I'm sure she didn't make it too far before you got to take care of her. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry that happened to you. Try not to let it happen again. <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet! I am glad you had a good day! <|endoftext|>
I dreamt that day. I slept in my car for a few days. <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of work! Yes and labs are fun but you know you are doing the right thing when the other person pays for the lab! <|endoftext|>
Then you must be a good boy or girl! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. Hopefully it won't be necessary. <|endoftext|>
I hope you get married! <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that's not too bad then! Good on you for being faithful! <|endoftext|>
I hope you get married! <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that's not too bad then! Good on you for being faithful! <|endoftext|>
I don't have a garden, but I hear the same thing you do. I wish I had some. What are you growing? <|endoftext|>
I hope you get married! <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that. I hope your car is still in the shop today. I would be so upset too. <|endoftext|>
they? that's not good, what was the item? <|endoftext|>
I hope so too, hopefully it is a one time thing. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. What happened? <|endoftext|>
I can see that. I have felt before and it can feel so alienating. I felt okay going to the store, but I felt weird the next day. Now I am a bit worried about my health and the next time I might want to think before I go there. <|endoftext|>
that's great. glad you were able to contribute to the team. <|endoftext|>
What did he represent? <|endoftext|>
That stinks. I hope she isn't too hard on you. <|endoftext|>
It can be hard to focus for some. I'm glad you were able to find time to do such a thing! <|endoftext|>
you need to look for a restaurant closer to you <|endoftext|>
Yes! Early retirement is the best possible future. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty nice. Do you have a dog? <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck and hope that you continue to find new uses for your old electronics! <|endoftext|>
was he excited to see you? <|endoftext|>
Wow, congrats, what did you end up doing instead? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're back too, that was a long time. <|endoftext|>
Oh I see, well I hope you get to spend more time with her! <|endoftext|>
I lost my mother as well. It's hard. <|endoftext|>
You are welcome, I am glad you are alright. <|endoftext|>
Wow the magnitude of the gender is truly amazing, I am glad you are okay <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. I have two boys myself, so I know how it feels. I hope you are happy! <|endoftext|>
thats a good position to be in <|endoftext|>
It's good to be consistent, but you don't get any breaks. You keep working. <|endoftext|>
What's the reason for his jealousy? <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude. I wish I had a truck. <|endoftext|>
Great! What are you going to do today? <|endoftext|>
I think that's a healthy way of looking at things. You'll be fine! <|endoftext|>
Thats good. She sounds healthy. <|endoftext|>
Morning sun is awesome. <|endoftext|>
That's so awesome. I'm impressed! <|endoftext|>
That's praiseworthy. In other words, you overcame them? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's lovely. How old is she <|endoftext|>
She is already quite a young girl <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe he'll understand. <|endoftext|>
I wish you can achieve success in your projects. <|endoftext|>
That's good! What kind of job are you looking for? <|endoftext|>
That is good. I am sure you will find something you like. <|endoftext|>
Well that is kind of lonely. I am happy for you though! <|endoftext|>
I understand that. Sometimes it is not in the cards though <|endoftext|>
wow. thats a bold move. how did it work out for you? <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure how to feel about that. <|endoftext|>
I love chocolate, what kind of chocolate bar was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I have no choice but to have diet or starve myself! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great. I bet he's feeling pretty hopeful about it. <|endoftext|>
i hope he can keep up the good work. <|endoftext|>
OMG. I think I would have passed out if I was you. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's good. What kind of car do you drive? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is awful. I know how you feel. Are you going to find it? <|endoftext|>
oh yes i agree <|endoftext|>
hachi. i bet you are <|endoftext|>
How cute! I'm so happy for you! <|endoftext|>
Oh, so you guys meet up at the airport? That's a smart move. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it'll get better <|endoftext|>
They may be annoyed with you, but it happens to people all the time. <|endoftext|>
That's absurd, they should make it so that only employees are allowed to use it. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. I hope you didn't catch it on video. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. I'm sure she really appreciated you taking care of her. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry. You must have felt terribly lonely. <|endoftext|>
I bet that is very boring. <|endoftext|>
Internal growth is something that is very important, a lot of people waste their time worrying about what other people think or what other people say. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you are talented, what did you studied? <|endoftext|>
You seem very responsible. <|endoftext|>
Thats what we do. Creating a happy life for our family. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I have lost many family members to cancer too. It is so hard. <|endoftext|>
Prayer is all you can do unless you find someone you trust who will pray for you. <|endoftext|>
Why are you getting cold feet? <|endoftext|>
You should do it if you're not broke. If you're broke, then why would you delay? <|endoftext|>
Awww, I'm so sorry. I hope you learn a lesson that makes you happy and gets you through the hard days tomorrow. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. It's good to have someone in your life who loves you. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe try joining a church or something! <|endoftext|>
I can imagine! It is just a game though, you should try to socialize during the day and play video games! <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I don't even know where to begin with you man. Just your average travel-induced stress. I don't even know how to begin. Good luck! <|endoftext|>
Yes, I hope they find the culprit and you can continue to enjoy your day off. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds amazing! Float trips are awesome! What kind of float <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's a pretty big win for you, because that's clearly not okay by them. <|endoftext|>
That is weird. Have you guys talked about it since? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry about that. Did you order pizza from a drive-thru or from a pizza parlor? <|endoftext|>
delivery girl are you ok? i hope you don't have to pay for that again <|endoftext|>
It was great. I had a great run this week. <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure I know. I'm just gonna go with it. <|endoftext|>
It was great. How was your work meeting? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I'm sure you had a great time! <|endoftext|>
Wow. I hope you were able to spot the thief before it was too late. <|endoftext|>
Oh really? It happens though, it's unavoidable! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. Did you get the job? <|endoftext|>
That's great that they're going at such a great pace. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds lonely. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
I meet a lot of new people in my city too. It can be tough at first, but once you get to know them a bit it's not bad. <|endoftext|>
Was she upset about it? <|endoftext|>
Do the dogs have friends at work? <|endoftext|>
what did you do <|endoftext|>
Ah, so you're the one getting in trouble. I would have done the same thing. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How did you end up doing getting on that boat? <|endoftext|>
I've done that before, it happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
That's cool, it's 'finer to dwell in the now' than to 'escape the now'." <|endoftext|>
I understand. It will hurt for a while, but it will be okay. <|endoftext|>
That does sound stressful. Were you able to have some fun? <|endoftext|>
were they right? <|endoftext|>
That's good, do you think you are going to get it? <|endoftext|>
I hope you get the job! <|endoftext|>
that's funny, I'm glad it wasn't you! <|endoftext|>
I don't think calling people out on their trash speaks well on them. I guess you're being nice <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I would be as well. Accidents happen but that is very rare <|endoftext|>
That's not good! First he has to haul your stuff to the post office, then he has to drive to your house to collect it. Sometimes he even has accidents. <|endoftext|>
how come? did you studied hard? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, is everything okay? <|endoftext|>
I bet it was a great time <|endoftext|>
That sounds great. It's always great to get out and about. <|endoftext|>
That's very nice of them. How long have you been with your parents? <|endoftext|>
I am sure that is a great feeling, and one that you would like to pursue in a more meaningful way. <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing. It sounds like you have a good relationship with your father. <|endoftext|>
I agree that! A loved one is in the wheelhouse right? <|endoftext|>
That is too bad. I wish you luck this time. <|endoftext|>
It can be embarrassing but it's better that you stay confident and positive. <|endoftext|>
I would try to appreciate my coworker too. the world would be a better place! <|endoftext|>
I am sure he should be proud of himself! <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's quite a bummer! But at least he'll always have a family member to call his own! <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to go about it. You don't have to physically keep him on TV, it's better for him to have something to keep him engaged. <|endoftext|>
I completely agree. I stole bread once, I stole socks a second time, I stole toys a third time, and I'm still doing it! I'm taking socks everywhere and making sure they get to the homeless people in the most efficient way. <|endoftext|>
I agree. It is unethical and in many cases, it is even murder. I hope that you are able to get your son into an academe that is more accomodating for him. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. Did you find him? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's so sad. I'm glad that your mother was there to take care of your dog. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sure you will be excited about that! How long has it been since you've seen her? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I hope she has a good experience during her pregnancy! <|endoftext|>
oh i hope it goes well! <|endoftext|>
Well, she's a nice person so I guess that has to be considered! I mean, she probably wasn't expecting to be in that predicament and I'm sure she has a really good heart. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I am very proud of her. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing. Nursing is a tough field. <|endoftext|>
that's so sad <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, I hate mine too <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How big is the tree in the treeyard? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's kind of generous. I doubt your neighbor would want to mess with a lawn either. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What happened? <|endoftext|>
Im the same way, I can't help it, I feel the same as you! I used to be a clean set of eyes for my parents, at least they were concerned about me and my well being <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, love it when it comes for sure <|endoftext|>
That is true. back then I was also very fortunate too <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's terrible. Did you find out who it was? <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I am so sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that stinks. Was it a really big dent? <|endoftext|>
ohhh Detective, I hope you find them soon. It's so annoying when that happens. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried to find a similar job elsewhere? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. You seem like a hard worker. <|endoftext|>
Wow, those things can break easily. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's the worst, when someone you just met laughs at you! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's rough. I bet that makes your life much easier. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that does sound really ticklish. Do you think the teacher has noticed? <|endoftext|>
I'm jealous! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
oh wow.. that sounds amazing! I have never been there <|endoftext|>
oh no! Did you have to go to the doctor <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you have to deal with that! I hope your condition will improve with time! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What was the prize? <|endoftext|>
Cool! What game did you play? <|endoftext|>
That is interesting. What does he usually talk about? <|endoftext|>
That's their choice, but you should be more direct with them. <|endoftext|>
Was it for something urgent? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, but everything will work out, if you really want to. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you feeling okay? <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear it. Maybe start a blog to keep yourself company. <|endoftext|>
That is great! What made you miss them? <|endoftext|>
I can only imagine how nostalgic that must have felt! <|endoftext|>
That is so scary! But a good thing that it was just a jolly! <|endoftext|>
How'd she react if you tried to kiss her? <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things go well for you in the future. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you are taking an interest in something new. I hope the new and different ideas come out better than before. <|endoftext|>
That does sound stressful I hope she'll understand <|endoftext|>
I think you will be fine! At least you will have someone to talk to who will be there for you regardless <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will be rich one day. <|endoftext|>
yea i know what you mean <|endoftext|>
That is why I do not want to have kids. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Mine sites are always scary. Mine sites are also really scary. I had to go that way once, mine went up the same way. Hope you are ok! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, me too. What happened? <|endoftext|>
That's great. I wish I had people like you in my life <|endoftext|>
I do. I'm in a same-sex marriage. It's great that you can do something so big as voting for a same-sex marriage bill, but I'm not sure that it's as bad as you think it is. <|endoftext|>
I bet you were glad to see your best friend over on Good Behavior. That's a good feeling <|endoftext|>
It's always great to have friends that are willing to help you out in times of need. It's a great feeling to know that you're lucky to have such a caring friend. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's impressive! <|endoftext|>
Haha, that's cool! Are you still with that band now? <|endoftext|>
I know, I know. Thats a shame because it devalues other people's time. But its our time too <|endoftext|>
I totally get you. I have a day job so I don't get to do all those trips to the store! <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet! Babies are so precious and taking a chance like that! <|endoftext|>
Ah, that's too bad. Maybe he'll give it another look. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I would have been so scared. Did you guys do anything? <|endoftext|>
That's good, hopefully the smaller one learns to be more trusting! <|endoftext|>
That's dog training, you must be proud of your dog <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah I rescue and do snuggle bears. It's a lot of work <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that sounds like a very responsible move on your part. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. Well at least he is okay now. <|endoftext|>
Yes, when I am feeling good I will usually get a bit of a Zen-like experience where I know everything is going right in the world and yet I am unaware of it. That seems to me to be one of the most beautiful things in life. <|endoftext|>
I definitely understand. I spend most of my time at work thinking about things like that...it's time consuming <|endoftext|>
Oh that's cool! How did the interview go? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's a pretty good outlook I'm sure. You'll have your job and your money back I'm sure. <|endoftext|>
I have. It is such a hassle. I used to have to file monthly but that was with me for the past 5 years. Is your work related to your disability? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
Not really, they are pretty annoying though. <|endoftext|>
i used to watch people talk about games when i was a child but when i was in a video game I was like what the heck lol <|endoftext|>
That's very nice of you. What kind of pets do you have? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better <|endoftext|>
That's great. Yes, driving is a dreaded subject even for people who are well-versed in it. <|endoftext|>
Indeed, and I'm sure you studied a lot. Smart kid. <|endoftext|>
Yuck, that sounds terrible. I hope you didn't get any food poisoning! <|endoftext|>
What shocked you about that? <|endoftext|>
None that I know of. Do you play? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun! I loved when I had a kid do that. How old is she? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How embarrassing. Did anyone see you strip? <|endoftext|>
did you tell them you threw them away? <|endoftext|>
i bet that was stressful <|endoftext|>
I agree. How many did it? <|endoftext|>
I love puppies what kind was it? <|endoftext|>
Ha, joy is the first one to me. The negative ones are before me too, I just ignore the positive ones. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I love memories like that. <|endoftext|>
That's a nice memory to have. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a huge confidence boost for sure! Science was just a means to an end after you won that case. <|endoftext|>
Sounds interesting. How did it do? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I have had that done many times to teach kids not to cry. How old is he? <|endoftext|>
I knew it was a bad time to be sad, but I'm glad you are doing well. You must have been strong for doing that. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I bet that was nice. I've been there too where they have a beach house that's awesome! <|endoftext|>
I'll bet you were excited! <|endoftext|>
He may be my son now, but I wish he was a little closer to me. <|endoftext|>
Yes, he still gets that a lot and it brings back so many memories. <|endoftext|>
That sucks, I really hope that you can, it would be a great feeling. <|endoftext|>
That's no good! Why did they have to cancel? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I went into my last year of college last month. I hope I can say the same soon! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's impressive. What kind of work does he do? <|endoftext|>
I'm so happy for him! <|endoftext|>
Yes I do. I have a daughter named Zahara. I want to be a man when I grow old. <|endoftext|>
Did you find anything interesting? <|endoftext|>
Old Beanie Babies are so much fun! I bet those guys were having a great time. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. I can't wait to bed a kid. They deserve it. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! That's unfortunate. Did she receive any money in the form of checks? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Is she okay? <|endoftext|>
that is one of the most horrifying things i have ever seen <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I'm glad to hear she is doing better now. <|endoftext|>
That;s terrible. I hope she feels better soon! <|endoftext|>
That's horrible, was the cat friendly? <|endoftext|>
That's so cool, you have to love them some time. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is a nightmare! What happened? <|endoftext|>
That is really scary! I'm so sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
That's good, you didn't have to yell at her. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you had to go through that <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, you can feel her excitement when you saw her first year of college! <|endoftext|>
I begrudge my friends too. We have vacation time, and then we have to work, so we have to be at our friends when we go. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, put food on the table or save for a vacation. <|endoftext|>
I like boys too. They are fun to be. <|endoftext|>
You got this kid! He'll be fine! <|endoftext|>
Oh! I have a few friends doing it as well. It really sounds like a great diet to follow. <|endoftext|>
That's really great. I was also looking forward to trying an app from the i, it sounds like you will have a blast! <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! I'm sure you are the luckiest woman on earth. <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean. My brother did the same with his dad, he's like a half step father. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! How long did it last for? <|endoftext|>
That is a really good thing. Do you still have in mind to have one? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a very, very long time ago. <|endoftext|>
hard work pays off <|endoftext|>
Wow that is great! I have my own journey too with my friend. We are trying to lose weight too. <|endoftext|>
Those are both admirable qualities to have, I'm sure! <|endoftext|>
Oh. I was raised on ice cream. I never liked it either. <|endoftext|>
Secondly, I think you might have to lower the calories too. I did last week.. 210 for a 16 oz can of tuna. <|endoftext|>
I am glad for you <|endoftext|>
I am so glad. What store did you shop at? <|endoftext|>
i hate driving in storms, especially when they form in the morning <|endoftext|>
Yes, I know what you mean. My mom used to do that all the time when I was younger. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you find out why he did it? <|endoftext|>
I hope it works out for you. Don't be too hard on your ex. It's hard for people to change when they don't have much of a choice. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I'm sorry! I hate toll booths! They're always so annoying and you have to stand in long lines. Did you try to leave early? <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! I'm glad it was all worth it though. I hope you two have a wonderful life together. <|endoftext|>
He is a good man! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! Did you confront him about the inaccurate information? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's terrible! Did you tell your half aunt? <|endoftext|>
Oh god. I can imagine how you feel. How did you respond? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That sounds pretty amazing. Did you go in the night? <|endoftext|>
Lol! Wow! I have always wanted to be a caveman. Wow! That is very interesting! I am sure it made you feel good to know that you are related to the cave man. <|endoftext|>
oh wow! that must have been a rollercoaster i bet! <|endoftext|>
Oh, well I'm sure it was a relief to have the change! I've been through similar. It will help you be a little more confident and let you know where I'm coming from! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's a relief! I bet you were grateful that they were able to find something wrong with the baby so easily! <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you bounced back! Healthy babies are so amazing <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry you have to go through that. I had a friend who had a dog that passed away from old age, and I thought maybe you have to live with that for a while. <|endoftext|>
i hope she has a good life, it sounds like that puppy had a good life <|endoftext|>
I do not like in the front. That is bad form. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, I have a friend who has the same situation and my heart aches for you. I hope things get resolved soon. <|endoftext|>
thats wonderful of you <|endoftext|>
Yea that is true for some it is not for others. I am glad you are able to see both ways! <|endoftext|>
Pets are great. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
I had a dog when it was young. He was a bundle of joy. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh I have a newborn also and I love him but he is only five so I feel you on that. <|endoftext|>
How long have you been in school? <|endoftext|>
Diet definitely has a big impact on weight. I hope they can figure out a way to make it stop <|endoftext|>
Wow! That was really far! I bet you were nervous about the trip! <|endoftext|>
Yea that's the worst. I feel like you should confront her about it. <|endoftext|>
I used to love playing Donkey Kong. <|endoftext|>
Those games were great back in the day! I remember playing Donkey Kong and playing the CD. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was scary <|endoftext|>
Woah! That must have been scary. Did you investigate it further? <|endoftext|>
That's great. I have two kids, and my favorite part about raising them is the ability to see where they will go as they grow up. It's a pretty cool thing to do. <|endoftext|>
That's really impressive. Good for her! <|endoftext|>
Well, you will have to ask your boss! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! Was the kitten okay? <|endoftext|>
Thank goodness she is yours again. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's amazing! You must be a very lucky person. <|endoftext|>
Did you have a boy or a girl? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that does sound scary! Have you actually gone anywhere to check to see if anything bad happened? <|endoftext|>
What was the pest? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's wonderful! Congratulations to him! When is the proposal? <|endoftext|>
You can exchange the rings in the future if you so desire. <|endoftext|>
What kind of car? <|endoftext|>
Those are pretty good. I just had an RAV4X. It was a nice car. You're right. I need a truck! <|endoftext|>
Oh, yeah that's a good thing. I like kids, but I'm not yet ready. I need a bit of time. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry! I just know it's going to be great! <|endoftext|>
Oh okay, sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a gift for him that is also from an established brand. <|endoftext|>
Yeah but still must be difficult for you. I'm sorry you're going through that <|endoftext|>
Oh... I'm sorry. That's quite expensive. I think it was just a scam. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel! I've been through it with my sister and it's devastating. Don't worry, everything will get better! <|endoftext|>
that's a lot of miles, I bet you could get by <|endoftext|>
I'm saving up for my own wedding, hopefully it goes well! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, how horrible. What did you guys end up doing? <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry, I think it's time for you to move on too. <|endoftext|>
MUCH BETTER! I am a grown adult and have opinions on everything! <|endoftext|>
Did you let her try it after? <|endoftext|>
She must be a brave girl! <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a stressful day. It will be easier next time. <|endoftext|>
That would be nice. Maybe you could get her a chair. <|endoftext|>
Have you joined before? <|endoftext|>
etc... you can't feel bad about it. You need to focus on you and your strengths (like my laptop or awesome shirt)) <|endoftext|>
that's so sweet, I'm glad it worked out for her! <|endoftext|>
That is a good plan. Will you be able to pay it off before the baby? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're getting some rest. Is this a job you enjoy? <|endoftext|>
You only live once, and if you do it right, you can do it again. <|endoftext|>
didn't find out until much later. lol <|endoftext|>
I bet. I hate to see people mistreated. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is gross. Did you change? <|endoftext|>
I was dealt a hand of cards by my parents. I moved away from them for a while and now live with my family. It's really hard, but you will get used to it. <|endoftext|>
Friends have their faults. Is she aware of it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Well maybe just don't tell her. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. Dad's can be like that. <|endoftext|>
That's a long time to be away. I am so sorry. <|endoftext|>
That is great. Does she want to be a painter? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good that you're encouraging her to share it with others! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, we all do. <|endoftext|>
That's okay, it's a good feeling to have <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing. I always feel like I'm always a day late for something, but I'm always positive and organised before I even get to bed! <|endoftext|>
I get that, I guess that makes sense. <|endoftext|>
Why? <|endoftext|>
escape? why did you leave? <|endoftext|>
Oh I am so sorry! I have lost many this way. I hope over time they become more fond of the quiet neighborhood. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll be fine! It's been five years since I've lost mine. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! surely you saw him coming! <|endoftext|>
haha that's okay! you can always try and get back in <|endoftext|>
That's ok <|endoftext|>
It happens sometimes ha <|endoftext|>
I hope you do well! Is it the first time you've taken it? <|endoftext|>
Was it a fighting game? <|endoftext|>
That is not good. I think you should not allow yourself to be hurt by anyone. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, you might have to wait longer. <|endoftext|>
oh no! Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
Well, at least you managed to find a new pair. You must have found yourself very popular. <|endoftext|>
Oh how exciting. Will you be hisawan name? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun! <|endoftext|>
Burritos are pretty much the worst. Did anyone else see you do that? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! Your only option is to find another job or find a new doctor <|endoftext|>
It was great. I had a great run this week. <|endoftext|>
Good for you. I hope it be another day like yesterday. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you had to deal with that. <|endoftext|>
Wow! Did you get hurt? <|endoftext|>
That's not a good thing! <|endoftext|>
That is good, do you have a wife and want to keep her name too? <|endoftext|>
I am forever sorry you didn't get to see her. You should have been so happy for her. <|endoftext|>
Just stay calm and collected, it will go well. <|endoftext|>
I hope you do well <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's cool! I love animals! The zoo is always a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
That sounds really exotic <|endoftext|>
That must be so frustrating. I hope everything ends up being okay at least for you. <|endoftext|>
I think you should but if you don't you will get in trouble. <|endoftext|>
thats a good choice i hope it works out for you <|endoftext|>
That's good! How long ago did you buy? <|endoftext|>
I know right. It's crazy how much everything costs now. <|endoftext|>
It's a good thing you had a lot of help! My mom and dad would just stare at me as I tried to put food on the table. <|endoftext|>
Oh, have you done one before? <|endoftext|>
Well that sounds interesting. Hope you do well! <|endoftext|>
That's great, how come? <|endoftext|>
That's cool. What house did you get? <|endoftext|>
Really? You have been saving for a long time? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is a pretty good car! I am jealous of you. <|endoftext|>
Nice, how much did she pay you? <|endoftext|>
I would have went with that too. Its a good feeling when you get something you really want and it works its magic <|endoftext|>
Congrats! That is one of the proudest things one can achieve. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will find one soon. I am still here when you consider that. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will get a good grade. Make sure you finish your assignments. <|endoftext|>
are you hoping the grade will be good for the rest of the semester? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's an experience you don't want to have. What made you do it? <|endoftext|>
Well maybe it's time to look for a new job. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. It's hard to watch kids grow up without a mom who relies on them for care. <|endoftext|>
What were you able to see? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What was wrong with it? I've never gone to a restaurant that wasn't clean. <|endoftext|>
I would return and get more <|endoftext|>
Yeah I visited when I was a child as well. It is always nice to go back to those places <|endoftext|>
I am not sure I believe that. I think my family moved around a lot and never spoke to them. <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome! Did you have any good memories of them? <|endoftext|>
Those were the best days! <|endoftext|>
Matthew was a very scary storm, but I'm glad you made it out. Were you huold to get a new place before it get's too dangerous? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds terrifying. I would've been so scared. <|endoftext|>
I've never had an appointment like that, did you end up going? <|endoftext|>
I hope the results come back and show that she is healthy. <|endoftext|>
That is so cool! Is it a kid's movie? <|endoftext|>
I have. It was actually pretty funny though. <|endoftext|>
I was in that situation when I had to attend my own funeral. It was very sad. <|endoftext|>
Is she a hoarder? <|endoftext|>
Wow. Did you feel like you had a talk with the doc? <|endoftext|>
I wouldif he was actually helping you I don't know, maybe even talked to you a lot? <|endoftext|>
I really hope he can learn to be more considerate! <|endoftext|>
Great! What subject is the big test in? <|endoftext|>
That's great that you're studying. For the job market? <|endoftext|>
That's great! What's your favorite thing about Alabama? <|endoftext|>
No, but I do love camping. <|endoftext|>
Wow! What a surprise! I bet you wanted something more for your special day. <|endoftext|>
Thats sweet though, hope thay work out for some good yall <|endoftext|>
I know. I have broken ones before. They are worth more than just money. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah I have heard of Kay before. They are known for making cute shoes. <|endoftext|>
That sucks. You know you can always get some more if you want. <|endoftext|>
Money can be replaced but that does not absolve you of any fault. <|endoftext|>
Whoa that is so sweet! Have you ever cheated on him? <|endoftext|>
That's a wise thing you know how to do. <|endoftext|>
I am the same way, mine is the same, i love them <|endoftext|>
Depends on what you want to do. I wouldn't feel conflicted at all. If it's something you're comfortable with I wouldn't tell them how you feel. <|endoftext|>
ohh, that's good to hear! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. I hope the pace of things will pick up soon. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am sorry. <|endoftext|>
I can see how that would be difficult to deal with. Maybe you can do some research on what other people think about depression. <|endoftext|>
That's nice. You're still loyal to your old workplace. <|endoftext|>
I would take that offer, even if it meant working for a boss who didn't pay you well. <|endoftext|>
She sounds wonderful! Did you get it!? <|endoftext|>
That is a problem! I wish I had a solution for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh that must have been terrifying! I hope you and your family made a nice dinner! <|endoftext|>
Yes, they are. We get them now and then too. I hate them. <|endoftext|>
Yeah! I love to water them and move the earth in permisions. What are some of your fav things in the garden? <|endoftext|>
I agree with that 100% <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a plan. Are you celebrating anything special? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun! I bet you guys are all excited for her! <|endoftext|>
If she's lying to you, it's best to just let it go and move on. If she's telling the truth, then she probably isn't as bad as you think. <|endoftext|>
That's so lame and mean. You knew he was lying, so why did you go along with it? <|endoftext|>
Well if its too late then thats what you will have to do. If it is true then thats what you should do instead of cheating. <|endoftext|>
Thats unfortunate, did you end up eating the food? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry that happened. Did you get it down with you? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is disgusting! I hope they changed their ways soon. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you have to deal with that! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's a huge behemoth, but I'm impressed you didn't feel guilty about it. I mean, it's an amazing picture, and you're doing good, right? <|endoftext|>
You can get a second one if you really want. <|endoftext|>
That's got to be one of the most annoying things you've ever done to her! <|endoftext|>
Okay, I totally understand. I always get really upset when people just give a vague reason like, "She won't let us in". Like I said, its a food place after all. <|endoftext|>
That is great, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
Well I hope you feel better -- and that you can find the good in life again -- soon. <|endoftext|>
Congrats! That is always a great feeling. <|endoftext|>
Did you speak to him about it? <|endoftext|>
That's a great realization! It's always nice to hear a financial news like that. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will! Keep your head up! <|endoftext|>
Some people are so inconsiderate. I'm sorry <|endoftext|>
I hear you. But I have a feeling this year will be the best year yet. <|endoftext|>
That's scary, were you and your family okay? <|endoftext|>
That's such a shame. Maybe the police will catch those guys. <|endoftext|>
That is awful, my parents had this same disease, I know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
I wouldn't take those drugs. They are just a way to relieve stress. <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness. that is terrible. are you taking them to the hospital? <|endoftext|>
i am soo sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. You should contact your local fire marshal to get it cleaned <|endoftext|>
Glad you were able to get it fixed. Still a little disgusting that you missed that opportunity to go to the trouble to go to the troublement. <|endoftext|>
Aww, I'm sorry to hear that. How did things go? <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. Are you still friends? <|endoftext|>
May as well, domestic abuse is terrible. I hope you have a plan B for dealing with it. <|endoftext|>
It's a learned behavior. I wouldn't advise kicking someone in the nose just because you disagree with them. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I don't think they understand that subtlety is sometimes more important than quantity. They seem to think that if they get me riled up, they're going to sound like the good sport I am the loud one. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, you should talk to your landlord about it and let them know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
I don't know, it's nerve racking waiting for them to know if it can be done or not. I hope it works out well for you! <|endoftext|>
That's great news! I am happy for you! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry <|endoftext|>
I hope so too, that's terrible! <|endoftext|>
I love breezy weather! It feels nice and balmy in the summer. Keep up the good work! <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea. I'm sure the grass will take better care of it then. <|endoftext|>
Don't be nervous. You can do it. <|endoftext|>
I think you have a lot of ground to learn <|endoftext|>
Why do you feel that way? <|endoftext|>
I loved that movie. I loved that book as well. I hope you still keep reading it after all these years! <|endoftext|>
Yeah it's always hard to imagine what an adult would do or say. <|endoftext|>
yeah they are not smart enough to understand right away what is best for them. so you have to give them space to figure it out <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? That must have been exciting. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I have never eaten there! I hope you was able to find something else <|endoftext|>
I hope you get a promotion! <|endoftext|>
That's always a good thing. I'm sure you learned a lot. <|endoftext|>
I agree, we need more people like you in the world. <|endoftext|>
Wow! Sometimes it's hard to appreciate when people do things we don't expect. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I can imagine so. Did you ever get stuck? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Did you kill it? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty funny! <|endoftext|>
Ah, I am sorry, I hope you can work it out well with her <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Im sure your family is proud :) <|endoftext|>
Sunshine is so calming and sweet <|endoftext|>
I've been in the retail industry for 15 years. <|endoftext|>
It would be if it wasn't for my boss being really mean to me. I'm sure if I talked to him I'd make him regret that. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's a good thing! <|endoftext|>
There's always next time! <|endoftext|>
Wow that's awesome! What made you so confident? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty nice. What kind of restaurant? <|endoftext|>
It is always a great feeling when someone recognizes you from work! <|endoftext|>
Oh man, you gotta take him somewhere special! <|endoftext|>
That's funny. I sort of gave my mom that look when I was a kid. I knew right then and there that something was wrong. <|endoftext|>
Brain is still developing so I'm sure you just need some time to get used to it. <|endoftext|>
I don't know if I could do that. I would have to think really fast. <|endoftext|>
oh yea i know how that is i leave it at the grocery store <|endoftext|>
That's a smart plan! I hope your son is able to ride with you again soon! <|endoftext|>
You're such a naughty girl! <|endoftext|>
That's good that she was understanding. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure if you talk to her more she'll understand. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! It's always important to be prepared when you're ready to leave. <|endoftext|>
I bet you were embarrassed. did you get angry at them? <|endoftext|>
how did it happen? <|endoftext|>
I used to be that way too but now I'm comfortable around other people. <|endoftext|>
Oh awesome! What are you going to do with the money? <|endoftext|>
That's great! How do you like your job now? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing. I am happy for you <|endoftext|>
Maybe. I wish you both the best! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Do you have any idea how much it is actually? <|endoftext|>
We do use natural gas though lol <|endoftext|>
Aww yea!! I hate when that happens. I hope you guys are having lots of fun. <|endoftext|>
thats cool. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! That's terrible! I'm sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I would love to be able to do that at a store! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you went through that. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. You should make it up to that person. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's awesome. How did you feel when you were a little kid? <|endoftext|>
I always wondered how Ramon got that promotion in the first place. <|endoftext|>
That's very stressful I have been there too. What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's quick. Is your baby doing well in terms of getting enough nutrition from the diet? <|endoftext|>
I hope the results back are good! <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I hope you find the one who is worth being with! Do you think you are ready? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure you wanted to study more. <|endoftext|>
I hope you have fun <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing, it must have been a huge success! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. That's neat. Are you going to take a tour? <|endoftext|>
You should reevaluate your life choices. You can reinvent yourself any way you want! <|endoftext|>
What ended up happening? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like you're moving in a positive direction. I'm working towards my own routine. <|endoftext|>
Yosh, I love food, I always try new things to eat. <|endoftext|>
That's a tough thing to commit to. I know how you feel though, you need to get fit for a reason. <|endoftext|>
Right. I binge on snacks when I'm hungry. I think that way the most <|endoftext|>
That is too bad. Insurance companies do not take responsibility for things like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's rough. Are you doing okay? <|endoftext|>
Ouch! That is a terrible feeling! You should tell him that you love him and that it was an accident! <|endoftext|>
It could be anything - dog, car, even shark teeth! <|endoftext|>
Oh, how exciting! What's she doing? <|endoftext|>
What a lovely present! I'm sure you'll always want to read it. <|endoftext|>
I hear ya.. I always had a side hustle but now I'm in the retail business. I'm happy to help you any way you need it. <|endoftext|>
I understand that, that is what I am doing now <|endoftext|>
awww. so cute. I hope he/she is a happy little thing. <|endoftext|>
I have a friend who has a car <|endoftext|>
That is a tough thing to deal with, I hope you get those things done! <|endoftext|>
oh wow, that sounds like a lot of hard work <|endoftext|>
Ah I see. Well you have to let them know how you feel. It's a destructive emotion to have to see another people lie being told to you day in and day out. Hopefully it will go away in the future! <|endoftext|>
That was very kind of you. I am glad she is back on track. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like you should've got angry as well. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that is unfortunate. Are you going to ask your friend again? <|endoftext|>
Oh tricycles are cool! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you going to have your portrait taken of her at the memorial? <|endoftext|>
That's great. 50 metres is very difficult. What kind of shoes did you bought? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure you have a lot of hard work ahead! <|endoftext|>
What kind of games do you like to play? <|endoftext|>
Oh ok. I had seen about players getting their hands on them through online gaming. I was a bit jealous. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I would have been too. What happened? <|endoftext|>
I don't understand, what is the object that is so scary? Maybe it's a good idea to go next time! <|endoftext|>
Awesome! What kind of car? <|endoftext|>
They always have the best deals. We have a really good one this year. <|endoftext|>
I didn't even know it was about a girl, but I loved it. I could never understand why people were into it, and I don't even enjoy watching movies anymore. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's so sweet. It's great when friends can create such great content together! <|endoftext|>
That is good, how come? <|endoftext|>
What are you feeling stuck in? <|endoftext|>
eww that is gross! <|endoftext|>
That's not nice. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I am happy for you, I am sure you will enjoy your new ride! <|endoftext|>
I bet that will feel good, you must be excited. <|endoftext|>
Nice! What will you do with the money? <|endoftext|>
I can understand that, that takes a lot of money to get right, I hope you get it all finished up soon. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry! You will find the right balance in no time! <|endoftext|>
Will you be spending money? <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sad. Is your cat being treated? <|endoftext|>
Oh I know how you feel. Animals don'tess like that. I had two box turtles die a few years ago. <|endoftext|>
That's no good. What happened? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. You will be able to get a new job soon enough! <|endoftext|>
oh thats cool, did it bring back good memories? <|endoftext|>
You must have been so happy for them. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's really cool. What was the wonderul surprise? <|endoftext|>
You're quite the gentleman. <|endoftext|>
That can be scary! What part of town? <|endoftext|>
All the best for this upcoming interview! <|endoftext|>
did you have to pay him back? <|endoftext|>
Thats a significant amount of time. I am sure he has reason to be angry with you. <|endoftext|>
oh no! how long did you have to wait? <|endoftext|>
Yeah you are right. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that sounds scary. What happened next? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine. SX70s are very nimble and agile to get away from things like that. I can't imagine the pain that would have been. <|endoftext|>
That's so fun! I used to collect a lot as a kid. Was there anything in particular that made you so excited about it? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I remember as well! Such a nostalgic feeling. <|endoftext|>
How did that turn out? <|endoftext|>
good luck <|endoftext|>
I've never seen it, but I've been told it's a great show! <|endoftext|>
Oh. I see. I guess that would be a little bit weird. <|endoftext|>
i love the becah, i like the sound of them though <|endoftext|>
I love when I can see the calm of the ocean! I wish I could see it too. <|endoftext|>
did you atleast confess to your cheating? <|endoftext|>
Im glad you didn't <|endoftext|>
That's nice of you. Have you ever danced before? <|endoftext|>
I hope you have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm so sorry! I hope your dog's memory lives on in some way! <|endoftext|>
Was she okay? I hope she has some help. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a close friend or family member that you can talk to about this? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. Tumourous sarcomas are the worst. <|endoftext|>
Oh how was it? <|endoftext|>
I really love the ocean and love to wave at people on the beach. <|endoftext|>
I love history and culture I should check it out. <|endoftext|>
Lin is a wonderful story teller. I bet you are going to have a blast <|endoftext|>
Oh, did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
I am sure it was. I am so glad you had the opportunity to share it with them. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's terrifying! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I heard a scary story about a ghost in the subway once or twice, but I always just let it go and go back home. <|endoftext|>
Aww, do you love her? <|endoftext|>
I am sure she would love that. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you get away from it? <|endoftext|>
Nice, I bet you were glad when you got out <|endoftext|>
Did you ever play the harp? <|endoftext|>
Dont let it get to you that much, its still a dream to have. <|endoftext|>
What did you get them to do? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty impressive! I would have laughed if I was in your shoes. <|endoftext|>
Dead mice are nasty! Did you put them in your food? <|endoftext|>
Did you at least make it to the end? <|endoftext|>
Why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
5 <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a bummer. Did your Mother in law don't want you to come in? <|endoftext|>
That's great. I'm glad she was able to visit you and not your family. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are they seeing each other again? <|endoftext|>
I guess you should, there is nothing you can do at this point. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's creepy! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I would have sat whomever it was closer to you. Did you ever get to talk to him after?? <|endoftext|>
All right then, all done! <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude. You should be proud of the work you're doing and the ability you have. <|endoftext|>
you went abroad? <|endoftext|>
I bet. Socializing is such a big part of life. I am so jealous of you. <|endoftext|>
That sounds lonely. How was the food? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm not sure what I would do if I were in your shoes. <|endoftext|>
Oh thats a shame. Did you apologize? <|endoftext|>
oh no, kiss the girl not the most popular one lol <|endoftext|>
Dang that sounds like a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's sweet of her! How did you react? <|endoftext|>
I bet that did good to clear you mood. <|endoftext|>
Why were you so nervous? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad youre doing better. Hopefully the meeting gets cancelled and you can get back on track! <|endoftext|>
oh thats a cool thing <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. I don't mean to sound flippant, but some things are just too great to contemplate. I wish you the best in the future! <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened? <|endoftext|>
No, I talked about it at least. How are you handling it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any dogs of your own? <|endoftext|>
How old is he? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that is a relief. Aww, that's gross! <|endoftext|>
It feels good when you can celebrate your accomplishments! <|endoftext|>
i know the feeling. i wish i could dance. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. I always get scared by snakes. What do you do about them? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you didn't get hurt. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty neat. How did it work out for you in the end? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you have much to be proud of. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens, because I think mold would be one of the first things to go, and it's one of those foods that anyone wants to avoid even if they don't mind the mold. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You shouldn't have been so careless, either. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that is so sad. My dog passed away a few years ago, too. <|endoftext|>
That is hard, I am sure. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that! I know that must be so hard. <|endoftext|>
It will get easier <|endoftext|>
Fake news hurts the audience. It makes it difficult to understand. <|endoftext|>
I know. It's sensational. It's the news we don't get. <|endoftext|>
I've never had any of that, but my little nephew said he wanted it when he was a baby. How old is he? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome how old is she <|endoftext|>
That's terrible, I'm sorry. Are you doing better now? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, hope things go well for you now. <|endoftext|>
I love Aldi! I think it's cleaner and they have the freshest food. <|endoftext|>
I will be checking them out! <|endoftext|>
I'm not too familiar with them but I've always wanted to live in Southern California. <|endoftext|>
I am hoping for you! I hate jury duty <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. What happened to him? I just can't imagine. <|endoftext|>
oh my god, is he changing his lifestyle to live longer? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. Did you already see her? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, I don't know what I would do if she died. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I am sure you will be fine. I have a few goals coming up and I get distracted easily. <|endoftext|>
Double shifts are always good <|endoftext|>
I did not know they would release such a good show. I love it. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will do great! I saw it a few weeks ago and I was so impressed! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm glad she's doing better! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's a heck of a story. I hope you're ok! <|endoftext|>
Why did you join a different kind of crew? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure you've worked hard, and I'm sure you've achieved what you set your mind to! <|endoftext|>
Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow. That looks amazing. I'm so proud of you! <|endoftext|>
wow. proud of your son, hu? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. How long ago was he killed? <|endoftext|>
Its okay, you will grow and learn. <|endoftext|>
Oh really? Did you have to walk that back? <|endoftext|>
Did you have to hide anything from your family? <|endoftext|>
That would be nice if you could just move into their house. <|endoftext|>
I understand. I hope she decides right away not to send you more remittances. <|endoftext|>
That sucks! How did she do? <|endoftext|>
hahaha I would have yelled too! <|endoftext|>
That's a great feeling to have. It's quite hot out, and I'm sure you're having a great time. <|endoftext|>
I love it here in Colorado. I don't do tomatoes but I play with the seeds in the harvester. Do you work in a garden? <|endoftext|>
Who is he? <|endoftext|>
I love concerts. It's always a joy to attend. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun! How old is she? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun! I will have to get down there one day. <|endoftext|>
That is not a good situation. Have you had any issues with that? <|endoftext|>
It is a great place to find meaning and strength. <|endoftext|>
I am a student. My kids are almost three. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sad. I'm sure you will a day comes where you don't want to remember it. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I have that too, I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm glad you're okay though! <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that would be really hard. Did you have anyone to help you relax? Or were you alone? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Why were you nervous? <|endoftext|>
Well, I am sure you will be able to find another job that will be more beneficial for you and equally rewarding! <|endoftext|>
Mine are half paid off too. I'm glad to hear that she got it paid off for you guys. <|endoftext|>
Absolutely! It's all about the personal journey you choose to share with her. If you're not feeling well, it's hard to stay motivated. <|endoftext|>
Why were you territorial? <|endoftext|>
Jealousy is a hard thing to overcome. I hope you can heal from that somehow. <|endoftext|>
Oh! I bet that was fun! How old is she? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's even longer than you had to wait for the baby. I hope you have a good time with them and that you have a great time with them and their babies! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? <|endoftext|>
he sounds like a jerk <|endoftext|>
wow! i was also expecting it, but not as much. what happened? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I just started working out. I'm so jealous! <|endoftext|>
That's an amazing news. I am so happy for your daughter. <|endoftext|>
Yes! Her hard work paying off; that's a wonderful feeling! <|endoftext|>
I've been there. I guess the best way to go through this is to make a list and keep it close to your heart. Maybe it's time to get another dog? <|endoftext|>
yea its hard to not put yourself in their shoes <|endoftext|>
That's exciting! What did you guys do? <|endoftext|>
oh thats cool <|endoftext|>
Did you end up getting the high score? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good! If you worked hard it would have happened for you. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. I wish you had more time to spend with her. <|endoftext|>
That's a real bummer. Hope you'll be better! <|endoftext|>
that is scary i wish i had somewhere to be safe <|endoftext|>
Aww, I'm sorry. Do they still have your dog? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. My aunt and uncle are both in their forties and it's very hard to see them and it's not easy for them to fight for what they have. It's not easy for their kids either. <|endoftext|>
What happened to him? <|endoftext|>
That would be great to have a friend that is willing to help. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I am really sorry to hear that. It is very hard to lose weight in a group. What are you doing to lose more? <|endoftext|>
I guess so and that's what counts <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! What did you guys do? <|endoftext|>
That's definitely a win! It's hard to find something like that nowadays where everyone is so focused on material things. <|endoftext|>
wow that's a lot of money <|endoftext|>
Ah, so they're scared of missing out? I would be too. I'd cancel right now! <|endoftext|>
You must be lonely. That's crazy! Hold on to each other. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun! I'm sure it was great <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
good luck with that <|endoftext|>
I would have if I was you! I hope you didn't get bit! <|endoftext|>
Did you do that because you wanted to or because you were angry? <|endoftext|>
That would be fun, I live in Florida <|endoftext|>
sounds like a good time <|endoftext|>
That's not fair! Do you tell him how you feel? <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea. Where can I find them? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that, I know how that can be. I hope you can cope with it somehow. <|endoftext|>
oh no that is so bad, i am sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I hope you didn't give up! <|endoftext|>
Values do not lie, they are there to be decieved <|endoftext|>
oh thats nice <|endoftext|>
I'm sure that will be great. <|endoftext|>
Cross country skiing is definitely something I would like to try! <|endoftext|>
That is good, hope it keeps like that <|endoftext|>
That is a good thing to hope for! I am sure you and your family will be fine. <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad she'll understand that it's her problem, and she'll ask God for forgiveness for drinking so many times. <|endoftext|>
Do you think she will agree to it? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! I know how hard it can be to find a partner who wants to support your active lifestyle. I hope you continue to be happy! <|endoftext|>
Yes 22 years is a long time to be together! <|endoftext|>
Oh yes! I love whales and would love to see one again! <|endoftext|>
I used to watch some scary movies as a kid. Now I am more scared. <|endoftext|>
ohh, ok then <|endoftext|>
Wow that is a biggie! <|endoftext|>
what do you think will happen if the house is let go? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, what kind of car? <|endoftext|>
that's a nice ride! <|endoftext|>
That must have been a very proud moment for you. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|>
Why did you do that? <|endoftext|>
Just tell them the truth and don't sugarcoat it. If it's too good to be true, it's not good to be honest. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. Do you all usually go to the same place? Or do you have your own? <|endoftext|>
awww that is awesome that you were able to see them that long ago... i hope you have been able to reconnect with them <|endoftext|>
Curious to know what kind of friends you had. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it will be helpful <|endoftext|>
Yeah I love scary movies! What was it? <|endoftext|>
That's funny. I think it means young earth <|endoftext|>
I love the feeling when a loved one does that for you. It's the best feeling in the world. <|endoftext|>
I've never been to a private bed and breakfast. I think they sound chirpy and fancy. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I can't imagine how you feel. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you had a companion like her. <|endoftext|>
What is he going to do about illegal immigration? <|endoftext|>
well you can rest assured knowing your president is no longer in office. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry that happened. I hope you're able to recover fully. <|endoftext|>
I hope it's just a phase. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. How do you feel about it now? <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm glad you made it okay. I'm sure you appreciate the challenge. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Haha, seems like you are right. Maybe *you* can put your project in the past *so* it doesn't bother you so much. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I have bees in my house as well. They are very friendly. I would try and keep them away from me and my stuff. <|endoftext|>
I feel you on that! I still have to fend for myself as I live in the country. <|endoftext|>
You are a brave soul. I am glad you are being well prepared. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm pretty sure of it. I wouldn't sleep with a light on anyway. :) Sounds terrifying! I hope you didn't get a nightmare in the morning! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of horses do you have? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I bet that was fun to look at. Did you get a chance to look at it yet when you took it to the store? <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a great feeling. <|endoftext|>
That's a shame, but you will learn to love them when you get used to them. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, how did it go after that? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will do it again <|endoftext|>
Oh man- that's awesome! I've never heard of a green-eyed monster before! Does he like golfing? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know how you feel. If you just played for money, you wouldn't have to do anything! <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! Where are you moving to? <|endoftext|>
sounds nice, i hope you have fun <|endoftext|>
It's good to get some rest in between jobs. <|endoftext|>
Zen and the art of relaxation, I should visit my neighbor to practice. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
Thank goodness it was nothing serious. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. What did you do instead? <|endoftext|>
It is very hard to change people's mindsets. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. It's okay. Most people don't know how to present. <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. I'm glad you didn't get burned. <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet! I wish I was able to be as selfless as you. <|endoftext|>
That's cool. I love my city too, has it ever had a bad grunge band? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I do love golf and will be sure to go to holes of heat. I am a member of PGA Tour and can vouch for you. <|endoftext|>
That's awful! I bet that was frightening. I can't stand wasps, so I can't imagine how you must have felt. <|endoftext|>
I will cut your neck with a razor if you try to poison me with that. <|endoftext|>
That's really mean. You should really grow your contacts so that like in reality people react well to your kindness. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it was hard to lose those people but I hope it was an easy process. <|endoftext|>
I miss those days too. I think about them sometimes. <|endoftext|>
you know what life is really like, its not what you know, its what you do that matters <|endoftext|>
That's a great way to look at it. I am proud of what you do <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great job! I'm happy for you! <|endoftext|>
I wish I had a friend like that. It's always disappointing to wait for someone. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, did you two ever become friends? <|endoftext|>
Sort of rude but understandable. <|endoftext|>
Ohh thats a steal. <|endoftext|>
Wow! Cool how long have you been playing? <|endoftext|>
That's great! Congratulations. Did you study hard? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that it helps a lot to have a good group of friends <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that sounds like a really big deal. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of good things you can do for the neighborhood. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that sounds terrifying! What happened? <|endoftext|>
Did you get any response back from anyone about the possesiblility of reaching it? <|endoftext|>
I bet you're nervous. I know how that is. Will you be able to keep in touch? <|endoftext|>
No, I meant to say that it was a very far away place. <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow! That's so annoying, but funny at the same time! <|endoftext|>
I have no opinion on that at all. <|endoftext|>
I agree. You should always be cautious and talk to a friend before driving <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. What are you studying in? <|endoftext|>
I have actually. I applied and was rejected. So I learned a lot. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did the storm cause any damage? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you are safe too! As long as you have electricity you are fine! <|endoftext|>
I was close to him. He was a great guy. <|endoftext|>
That's true. I used to be a pretty good swimmer, but then I caught a terrible case of the flu and now I'm dead. <|endoftext|>
Did you complain to your supervisor? <|endoftext|>
oh, thats a nice thing to have to be a good worker. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I love taking my kids to amusement parks. What kind of theme? <|endoftext|>
I love Disneyland. I have been to both Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of money, do you save it all? <|endoftext|>
That is excellent! I am glad that you have a place to go to when things get bad! <|endoftext|>
That sounds wonderful! How old is she? <|endoftext|>
I did when I was a kid. I loved the little fat one in the tree with the snow on his bare chest. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How long had it been since you had seen it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What kind of dog do you have? That's sad, hopefully you can get that kennel trained soon. <|endoftext|>
What shows do you like the best? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. I hope you don't feel sad. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun! <|endoftext|>
I went to Williamsburg. I forgot Tampa was right next to me. Is that a bad pier or a good pier? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I have one that was sick when she was a little kid. And I still get sick now and then. <|endoftext|>
oh thats gross, did you pick it up again? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that's no fun at all. Did he get mad? <|endoftext|>
That's lucky! It's a sign of a loyal dog. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I love dogs! Thats so awesome. I wish I had a dog too <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you without any roof space? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
That must have been very nice. <|endoftext|>
Oh yes, they can be very sentimental. I hope you keep them. <|endoftext|>
That is exciting! Are you a big hockey fan? <|endoftext|>
That is so awesome, I wish I had a family like that. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! How old is she <|endoftext|>
Awww, I love girls stealing the show! I'm glad she's doing well at home, she'll be watching over you like a hawk. <|endoftext|>
Keep your head up! Don't give up! <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet of him! <|endoftext|>
That's great you had someone to help him out. <|endoftext|>
I hope you do well and get a job that is right for you! <|endoftext|>
Good luck! <|endoftext|>
oh no! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I guess that means there's something really good in that <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. What kind of retail does she do? <|endoftext|>
Wow that sounds like a lot of cool stuff. I wish I could visit one of those <|endoftext|>
You should be out there helping her! Don't you just love your wife so much? <|endoftext|>
Oh that must be very lonely. I am also separated by race and color. I moved to the US and sometimes travel with my husband too. It can be very isolating. <|endoftext|>
Well that's wonderful. I visited Turkey as a kid and had a lot of fun doing so <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck! I have heard the capital is beautiful. <|endoftext|>
That is really tough to deal with, i hope you are better now! <|endoftext|>
That is great to hear! I am sure it will get better. <|endoftext|>
Yes, that is very sad. I used to think that too, but now realize that everyone makes terrible decisions sometimes. <|endoftext|>
I hope so too, hopefully in the next couple of years <|endoftext|>
How did you find out? <|endoftext|>
I see.. hope it goes well for you guys! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's a shame. What was the situation? <|endoftext|>
I don't know if I could ever justify risking my own life. I would much rather die than live at all. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I hope that they are in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. Maybe you don't need to take her to the doctor? <|endoftext|>
I think that most people would find a better job after passive searching. Don't feel bad, it's part of life! <|endoftext|>
I see, there are a lot of people out there who have it so easy. It's time to join them. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I remember when that was my goal too. I now have a sister. it's an interesting dynamic. How old is she <|endoftext|>
That's still pretty young for a first date. A lot of people would say they like a beer before they go into a dive bar. She sounds like a really good person. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of hard work! You're doing something that is not only fulfilling, but also fulfilling for your family. <|endoftext|>
OH no. I hate the summer. <|endoftext|>
Yeah. I probably would have passed out from the weightlessness if I were you. <|endoftext|>
That's what friends are for! <|endoftext|>
I will definitely will! You will feel so good afterwards! <|endoftext|>
I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food <|endoftext|>
I love recipes! I especially love fitness recipes. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I get migraines myself. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been hard. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's good! fair enough. I hope she is alright now. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. What makes you thankful for your mother? <|endoftext|>
Not that I'm aware of. I see my dad once a year. <|endoftext|>
Cool, I like those too <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds so cool. I love the racing on those shows, especially when the cars were super fast! <|endoftext|>
Ew, that's unfortunate. Flip flops are flimsy things, so it shouldn't have been a problem. <|endoftext|>
sorry about your shoes she's a pain <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What did she make? <|endoftext|>
That sounds delicious! I'm sorry, how did that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
I love any and all types of food! <|endoftext|>
That really sucks honestly. I'm so sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
I know but it will all work out. If you both stay the course it will all work out. <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! What did you eat? <|endoftext|>
I love melt in your mouth food. I haven't had roast chicken in a long time. I love how versatile it is. <|endoftext|>
Thats great news. Will you be able to take it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it will be worth it in the end <|endoftext|>
I love kids too! Do you have any more of your own? <|endoftext|>
I do. Do you have any <|endoftext|>
How exciting! I am jealous of you. I need to get away from it all soon <|endoftext|>
Wow! How exciting! I've never been outside of the country either. When do you go? <|endoftext|>
That was nice of them. What did they do to celebrate? <|endoftext|>
Sushi is my favorite food <|endoftext|>
haha yea i can just imagine lol <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great trip! It's always nice to ride in the weather. <|endoftext|>
I do visit the parks in the city but it is really dark and you have to be really careful because people can see you. <|endoftext|>
That's sad, you must be lonely. Maybe you should get out and meet some friends? <|endoftext|>
I bet that brings back a lot of memories. How long has it been since you've seen him? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine you have a lot of those in the wild. So true. <|endoftext|>
I am so glad you are getting the life you want! Adventure is the greatest thing in the world. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, I'm in a similar situation right now. It's hard to find the right car, especially for something as small as a car! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it will be. It's just a matter of him being confident and you being patient. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I know what you mean, I love mine so much! <|endoftext|>
I have a brother, but he's pretty young so we don't get to see them a lot. I'm happy to hear he'll have a fulfilling career in nursing, if he sticks it out! <|endoftext|>
That is always a nice surprise <|endoftext|>
yes your friend is lucky to have you <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I understand. I was raised in AL. There are so many similarities between living far away from family and home and living away from the state you're used to. I could understand your point. <|endoftext|>
Yes, Every time I wish to go I find myself thinking about how nice it would be to go, but then I wish to stay and try to think of ways to make it happen. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's kind of exciting though don't you think? <|endoftext|>
That is very good of you to say. I am sure she will love you even if you don't commit! <|endoftext|>
Wow, what was the play about? <|endoftext|>
Yea, it's good to see your close friend gets some support from you. <|endoftext|>
I think that could be a major cause of anxiety! I feel like that's what brought me to the hospital for stress. <|endoftext|>
No problem! I wish you all the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What kind of sauce? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I always feel much better when making things myself. <|endoftext|>
I hope so, that's great! What type of training did you do? <|endoftext|>
I hope you get a raise soon <|endoftext|>
Yes! It is an amazing feeling, and I am sure you are anxious as well! I can imagine! <|endoftext|>
thats good, birth is very stressful position <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What were they scary videos? <|endoftext|>
I certainly can't. I don't know how anyone could be scared of heights. <|endoftext|>
I can't wait for the regular season to start. Is that when the bowls are? <|endoftext|>
lol. Crimson Tide and Jack Kent mods. <|endoftext|>
Yikes that's cool. I like to go to the skate park when I'm not taking my kids to school. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, well at least it wasn't a lie. That's impressive, but scary the truth could be out there. <|endoftext|>
That's very nice of your friend. What restaurant? <|endoftext|>
I bet it will be fine. You are lucky! <|endoftext|>
I bet you did great on it! It's always good to see someone who cares about their work. <|endoftext|>
congratulations! that's always a great feeling! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened? <|endoftext|>
That is really rough. I am so sorry! I wish the best for them! <|endoftext|>
wow thats great! <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude to have! I hope to get to that point soon! <|endoftext|>
i can imagine how you would have felt <|endoftext|>
Do you live in an area where Boko Haram is active? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, did the police catch you? <|endoftext|>
It happens to everyone, you never know until you try <|endoftext|>
That is great that you are there for them. Is it a bad flu to go? <|endoftext|>
No, he's doing great. His lungs are really strong and he's doing a great job. I'm sure if you just keep working him harder and harder, he'll get better! <|endoftext|>
That's great. You must have worked hard to get there. <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude. I'm sure you deserved it. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What movie? <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to go. I really hate when people do that. <|endoftext|>
You must have been nervous. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm sure the interview was not that hard! It's great when you can get a new job and not worry about the interview at all. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate being neighborly with dogs. Did you ask your neighbor to put him in the car so you could go out? I would have asked your neighbor to put him in the car and hopped out right then <|endoftext|>
Uh oh, I hope she's okay. Do you think she'll be ok next time? <|endoftext|>
are you ok? I hope you didn't lose any more bone. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure that was a very sad experience. <|endoftext|>
That's great. I was just saying yesterday that it's amazing to have a child who is so self-aware. I wish I had a child like that in me! <|endoftext|>
That's great, I hope he gets cleansed! <|endoftext|>
Wow. That's really not fair. Did you two make up? <|endoftext|>
I see! Well, I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I have lost many this past year too. sorry to hear that happened to you! <|endoftext|>
Well I'm glad he was okay! <|endoftext|>
Oh I bet that was a great time for you. <|endoftext|>
Absolutely. You deserve to be congratulated on graduating. <|endoftext|>
Wow that is not cool! are you going to get a new one? <|endoftext|>
Yeah - I have found that if you remember the old days it makes them more appealing <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry. Are you okay. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear that. I've been through rough times by having to get used to not being with my family. <|endoftext|>
Oh man that's awkward. Was that a pleasant surprise? <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have good siblings! <|endoftext|>
Yes, he should not have any regrets now! That is a good thing. <|endoftext|>
That is a great way to think about it. I hope you have more children in you so you can have that same response one day. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that happened to me actually! I hate the fair! It's so noisy, and you always have to be looking over your shoulder at everyone <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm glad you're with someone you really like, though. I hate when that happens. <|endoftext|>
Well that is good. Sometimes you get lucky. <|endoftext|>
That's still pretty small. How many of them did you invite? <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that. You must have been devastated. I have lost both of mine. It's so hard. <|endoftext|>
I understand how you feel and I can also understand how you feel compassionately. I lost both of my parents last year and it was very hard. It took quite a while for the pain to go away. I hope you can be there for your parents as they grieve. <|endoftext|>
I agree. I had a great job before I started work. <|endoftext|>
wow thats awesome <|endoftext|>
That's so true. I always feel grateful for anything, even if I don't personally use it. <|endoftext|>
That's impressive, how do you think you did? <|endoftext|>
I would be too! Do you have a case manager? <|endoftext|>
I am sure it was worth it. <|endoftext|>
Was it a surprise at all? <|endoftext|>
That's a good age to have a career. Are you still at work? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Have you tried driving back and seeing them? <|endoftext|>
I hope it goes well! Take lots of pictures, so he'll remember it. <|endoftext|>
What show is that? <|endoftext|>
i have never seen that movie <|endoftext|>
i also love showing people how to do something, but i dont always get how to <|endoftext|>
I am glad it worked out for you! <|endoftext|>
Where are you going <|endoftext|>
I like them too. Usually they are very comfortable. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did she turn you down? <|endoftext|>
Well I hope you can find somewhere else that isn't where she wanted to go. <|endoftext|>
wow. i wish i could be like you. i dread sunday <|endoftext|>
I hear you! I also have a huge grassy field that I've had to grow a fence around. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you do not have enough sun. <|endoftext|>
That is a great attitude to have! Not too many people are faithful like that. <|endoftext|>
That must be nerve wracking, must make you very protective of him <|endoftext|>
That sounds terrible. How did you react? <|endoftext|>
Yea a blow out like that is no fun. I hope it wasn't too bad and you both can move on from it. <|endoftext|>
What does she do that is so cool? <|endoftext|>
wow, congrats, you must be so proud of her <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. Is she okay now? <|endoftext|>
Very good. I hope she is okay now. <|endoftext|>
What is wrong with your job <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. I wish I could work at home. <|endoftext|>
That is great, I hope it will be next year as well! <|endoftext|>
That is really smart of you! <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. Some movies really should not be watched by people with a big brain! <|endoftext|>
Did you get hurt? <|endoftext|>
I think you are worried about the bonus. What will he get? <|endoftext|>
I think you are worried about the bonus. What will he get? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that sounds lonely. How are you doing alone? <|endoftext|>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I just finished a year now and a half and I feel like it is now or never. Are you worried about that? My kids are 2 and 3 <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I have two kids and they're almost through their second year. It's wonderful when they can go to school and make friends they'll love. <|endoftext|>
i agree. my mom is 94 and she still likes to play with the kids whenever she can <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Was it a car? <|endoftext|>
Dang that is hardcore. I would have been so pissed! <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That's great! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! How did she know it was a friend of hers? <|endoftext|>
I wouldn't do it. If they're going to treat you like that, you should probably not confront them. But maybe you can talk to that coworker's supervisor and see what you can do. <|endoftext|>
Was it worth it? <|endoftext|>
That's funny. I lived with my parents when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
What did they do? <|endoftext|>
That is understandable. I have had some pretty bad bosses. <|endoftext|>
I've never heard of it, but it sounds like a great movie! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's a lock. He's a great singer. <|endoftext|>
That's never a good thing to go into a situation like that. Were you more mad at someone else or yourself? <|endoftext|>
Hitting a taxi or limousine is a bad habit. You should get a better car. <|endoftext|>
What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
Just be your best self and you'll be fine. It happens to the best of us! <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, I can understand that. It's not easy to be in a relationship with someone you really like kissing. Did you tell her? <|endoftext|>
Well, I am sure she will be better in the future <|endoftext|>
Oh no. How soon after? <|endoftext|>
that is great, glad it worked out for you <|endoftext|>
Oh really? That's amazing! How did it turn out? <|endoftext|>
Sweet! you're a good parent! <|endoftext|>
That's very nice to hear! I wish I had a boss like that. <|endoftext|>
That's an amazing thing <|endoftext|>
oh those were the good old days <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a nightmare. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. It is the early part of the morning that is at fault. If you wake up early and have enough sleep you should be fine though! <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I think it's time for a change! <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting! I'm sure that's going to be a lot of work, but you can get another one if you want. <|endoftext|>
Nice! I hope it looks great! <|endoftext|>
That's nice of you. What did you plans look like? <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that.. she will need insulin more so keep that on her <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. I know that is really hard on you but maybe you can make it up to them? <|endoftext|>
You should tell her that if she's not happy with you. <|endoftext|>
aw how old is she really? <|endoftext|>
Wow, I can finally see I have had enough of yours. <|endoftext|>
Wow, she is pretty good at math. I am sure she did great. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! I'm glad you gave them back! <|endoftext|>
Oh nice, how do you think you'd do? <|endoftext|>
I bet it makes the interview process a lot easier! <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a fun surprise! Did you take a lot of photos? <|endoftext|>
That's very sweet, I'm happy you are taking the time to do that. <|endoftext|>
Where did he go? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. If it's not too bad, you can try dating again in the future. <|endoftext|>
That's great! you must feel so confident. are you nervous? <|endoftext|>
I can understand, it can be tough to land those jobs! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I guess you didn't have too many left? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that sounds delicious and sweet! You know they can't really call it a birthday unless its delicious! <|endoftext|>
Why did she leave you? <|endoftext|>
Who was right? <|endoftext|>
Oh, any reason why? <|endoftext|>
At least you are taking an interest in her. I would have probably been more interested in her hobbies. <|endoftext|>
Good for you, I hope you get the job and make some friends along the way! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's pretty cool. Did you get a degree? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh god, I hope you went to the toilet and came out okay. <|endoftext|>
That's a long time to be away from your parents. I'm so sorry you had to go through that! Is he still alive? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you finally did the right thing and that it wasn't too scary. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How old do you think your car is? Mine is 26. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will be fine <|endoftext|>
That's awful. Did you give it to her? <|endoftext|>
I know how it is. It's hard to come back from that. I know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
thats great you were able to get married. <|endoftext|>
That's cool! Did you just start going to a store together? <|endoftext|>
OH no. Did you report her to the professor? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad it worked out for you! I know that was a difficult situation to be in. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow! That's exciting! Are you excited? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun. what kind of work will you be doing <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. How did you get your car started? <|endoftext|>
i do love an older ride <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I would have been terrified! <|endoftext|>
Oh my, did it come out of nowhere or did you lean on something? <|endoftext|>
Same here. I missed the beach and the dogs. What are you doing now? <|endoftext|>
I remember those days! <|endoftext|>
wow thats a good plan <|endoftext|>
really? you think you got it? <|endoftext|>
How many days a week do you teach her? <|endoftext|>
That's funny. I guess she is still a baby. I guess she doesn't know any better. <|endoftext|>
Oh that must be very hard. You must be a great parent to raise a daughter who is completely self-sufficient. <|endoftext|>
oh i bet it will still be fine <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry. How long did you have him for? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, i also feel that way sometimes <|endoftext|>
Aww, that will be a bit boring, are you going out or sitting around thinking what to do? <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
I'm not really a horror fan myself. What was the film about? <|endoftext|>
Were they scary? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's awesome! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Wow! I've never been on a cruise, but it sounds like it's going to be great. I love cruises. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope she has a good time <|endoftext|>
That's very nice, I hope you like it. <|endoftext|>
Oh, do you think you'll get rained out? <|endoftext|>
I wish I had a place to eat. My apartment is always full of food lol <|endoftext|>
I hate horror movies. So am I. But I like thrillers and gothic movies. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah that is a classic! I bet you were scared! <|endoftext|>
Oh my! I have some of that stuff too. My great grandmother wrote a lot of letters to me when we were young. <|endoftext|>
That's great. I'm glad you still have her! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry! It happens to the best of us! What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh. It is so scary when that happens. I feel bad for the guy who got hurt. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? Why is that? <|endoftext|>
I am happy for her! I bet you're a great girlfriend to him! <|endoftext|>
you must be devastated. was he in trouble before? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. You can always get a new one. <|endoftext|>
Oh I know how that goes. Is it a completely new field? <|endoftext|>
That is true, but the opportunity is great and all <|endoftext|>
That must have been hard. I hope they came home safe. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine. They sound like terrible people on the news. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's nice. I'm not used to the German language, very difficult for me as well. <|endoftext|>
It's good that you're always looking for new ways to help. I really like video games. <|endoftext|>
That is tough. Is she coming back with you? <|endoftext|>
Im excited for you! Enjoy your day! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, why are you getting cold feet? <|endoftext|>
If you're unhappy in Alpharetta you should consider moving to Southaven or Forsyth. Those are both great cities! <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's terrible. Did you guys get a refund? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's the way the world works sometimes. <|endoftext|>
That's impressive, I can't stand boring movies. I always want something different. <|endoftext|>
Oh the aliens! Oh my world! You should be excited! <|endoftext|>
It sure is! I miss the days of having to work for pay! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's a good time to spread the word and get people to stop smoking. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I love meat, how is it now? <|endoftext|>
Awww, that is so sweet! I had a lab with me today and he was so sweet, he'd sit and play all day for me! <|endoftext|>
Do you have any other dogs yet? <|endoftext|>
Well you should not have to deal with people when you have your own. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you will find a place to call your forever home! <|endoftext|>
I hope you have a great experience there! <|endoftext|>
Did you end up having a change? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure that stress would have been worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
Yeah they should know better than to challenge you like that. <|endoftext|>
Is it because they're not committing much fraud? <|endoftext|>
Good for you, it's very dangerous to go abroad. <|endoftext|>
I went to Disney World. <|endoftext|>
sorry about that, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh poor you. I hate when that happens. Was it a ghost? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, but that's not a crime. <|endoftext|>
You're right, we've all been there! <|endoftext|>
You did good. I think you'll have to say good-bye to delayed gratification one day. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I always make a list before I leave so I don't forget anything as I'm driving. <|endoftext|>
That's great. What makes you so confident? <|endoftext|>
I bet you were! How old are you? <|endoftext|>
Nice! It's always nice to get a change whenever you get one. <|endoftext|>
Oh, what happened? Did you go home after that? <|endoftext|>
Well, then you need to make a plan to avoid it in the future. Maybe go to a strip club where your wife can't go? <|endoftext|>
Oh really? Me too, I can't stand scary movies. <|endoftext|>
You should have just run away. <|endoftext|>
I don't blame you. I am sure you will be ready for a baby when you are ready. <|endoftext|>
all that is really important, you should be proud of your mother for being a great mom! <|endoftext|>
That's good. How long do you think it'll take for you to read it? <|endoftext|>
Well, if you asked her again today, she might pick something else! <|endoftext|>
I agree, in most cases it makes perfect sense. In some cases you get two sets of in-laws. <|endoftext|>
Thats great! I have a few and they are always so easy to take care of <|endoftext|>
That's got to be tough. My sister's kid is the same way, only he's in his 20s. It's so hard to teach kids from the get go that it's OK to be responsible! <|endoftext|>
If he is careful, that might be the difference maker you need. <|endoftext|>
That was very lucky! Hopefully she doesn't notice the party is only for you and you keep the jewelry! <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that is really cool, hopefully she will enjoy it! <|endoftext|>
That is good. How long have you been married? <|endoftext|>
I hope you have many more years of happy memories. <|endoftext|>
I hear you! I hate bugs!!! They eat up my socks clean! <|endoftext|>
oh yea i can relate lol <|endoftext|>
Why couldn't you go? <|endoftext|>
Did you get in trouble? <|endoftext|>
That is understandable. Did you ever find her again? <|endoftext|>
That does sound great, I hope she is a healthy adult now! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's good! Are you going to see it already? <|endoftext|>
I have never seen it <|endoftext|>
Food is the best for people, and homeless people often don't have much so it's very heart warming to see. Do you know what happened to her? Have you helped them since? <|endoftext|>
They're my friends, they keep my things safe. <|endoftext|>
That's so cool! Did you solve it? <|endoftext|>
I really wish I had one like that! I think they are really beautiful. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you have fun and be safe! <|endoftext|>
oh thats cool <|endoftext|>
Oh I drink coffee! I do that all the time! <|endoftext|>
I do everything to. My favorite game is Mario Kart. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Hopefully the results will be worth the effort you put into it. <|endoftext|>
Good to hear. Are you going to a hospital? <|endoftext|>
That's so great! I'm sure you were so proud. <|endoftext|>
It's good to see that you care about your dog. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm glad youre getting some rest. <|endoftext|>
it is! i love to swim and be in the pool. i also do a lot of cardio. <|endoftext|>
That can be a very happy thing. Having a family to lean on. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you ask her why she did it? <|endoftext|>
I love Phil Collins. I actually have a blind date for the summer. Is it gonna be a girl or boy concert? <|endoftext|>
I remember those games too, they were fun <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know how that goes. <|endoftext|>
I think you need to be more specific and specific, and use google to help you figure it out. You can google things like, what is the distance from your nose to the ground, and you should be able to find a calculator that will help you. <|endoftext|>
I don't know, I'm sorry you experienced that. <|endoftext|>
I am sure it was a bummer but hopefully you made it out ok. <|endoftext|>
Streaming sucks because you need to be online all the time, and it's expensive to be online all the time. <|endoftext|>
What is an extra charge? <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's great. Is she planning on going to college? <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow! That is a very spontaneous and lovely way of expressing yourself. I bet she is going to have a blast! <|endoftext|>
if she's a butthurt loser like you, I'm sure she's probably just trying to prove something to you. i'm sure it'll work out for you! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you can trust her again. I hope you find happiness together. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I have never been to a grocery store! I would have been hungry! lol <|endoftext|>
I haven't, but if it's lean meat, I'm inclined to give it a chance. <|endoftext|>
Do you keep her tong bed when you shower? <|endoftext|>
I can agree with that.  My dog does that all the time <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Are you feeling okay? <|endoftext|>
I guess you should hope and pray that he does too! <|endoftext|>
that is a bad smell <|endoftext|>
That's kind of funny. How did she react when you go through life so empty? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Why is it so quiet? <|endoftext|>
That's so true. I wish I had a dog like that. <|endoftext|>
Is she going to be okay? Is she going to be able to walk again? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be hard. <|endoftext|>
I have a cat that loves to cause issues too. I try to train it not to go so easy on people. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I bet that was embarrassing! <|endoftext|>
That's a pretty slow progress. I wish there is something I can do to help. <|endoftext|>
I hope you are successful in the future. I will be trying again for that reason. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's a shame. Perhaps you could find a friend or family member who can watch it with you. <|endoftext|>
Oh! A musical! I've never seen one before! <|endoftext|>
wow, that is a mean thing to do, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
Well maybe it has something to do with your age. It's happened to me before. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Was she really busy? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that sounds terrible. Half an hour is a long time. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty great. Do you have a lot of experience with unemployment? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I'm sure it'll be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. What's wrong with it? <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I'm glad she's finally out of the closet. <|endoftext|>
That's not good, do you see a camp in your area? <|endoftext|>
That is great. I do the same at my church. <|endoftext|>
Oh really? What did he do? <|endoftext|>
wow. whoops. did you make a point to tell him who he was? <|endoftext|>
I agree, how long have you two been together? Does she know you're cheating? <|endoftext|>
I would like to but I am scared for my food. Are you? <|endoftext|>
It's nice to have a plan B for emergencies <|endoftext|>
Tonight? I'm so sorry. I hope you can find the peace that you deserve. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. How many hours a day do you guys spend together? <|endoftext|>
you can do it.  you just have to be a tad bit jealous. <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you. Grandma is a lucky lady too! <|endoftext|>
I can imagine how you would feel that way. <|endoftext|>
oh yea i know the feeling, its always crowded when you go <|endoftext|>
I know right, at first it's hard to get into as I'm not used to the city life. I hope you continue to see the light soon! <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! How exciting! <|endoftext|>
That's cool. I think you'll be fine. <|endoftext|>
well that must have been a lot of work, well done <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear that. Hopefully when you hear from them, they're really happy too! <|endoftext|>
wow, they are so smart! how old are they? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so sweet. <|endoftext|>
Must he be a boss man? <|endoftext|>
haha. good for you. you should celebrate with a drink or something <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! You must be very sad about this. <|endoftext|>
Good luck! Do you have any new positions lined up? <|endoftext|>
That's great! congratulations on that! What will you be doing? <|endoftext|>
I have and I accepted. What is your dream job? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a juicy subject to me! But, I'm sure you guys will have a great time together! <|endoftext|>
Yes guys, talk to her! She is a great person! <|endoftext|>
That's...interesting. How did that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
Kids are so precious. I hope he has a good visit! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I know Keurig really well, my grandparents used to use this one. It was a big part of the family. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Maybe you can find a new coffee shop soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds tough, but also kind of exciting. Do you have any friends or family to join you? <|endoftext|>
wow that's really good! I'm glad you did that for your studying so thoroughly <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Does she have a collar tied around her neck? <|endoftext|>
oh thats sweet <|endoftext|>
That is horrible. I hope he gets better! <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I'm sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. I bet you were so happy! Was she excited about it? <|endoftext|>
wow. thats crazy <|endoftext|>
That's a good attitude. I'm sure you will do well. <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure about the first one - mine started a couple of weeks ago. <|endoftext|>
That's cool! Was there anything in there? <|endoftext|>
I agree, it's always nice to look back on your childhood. It can be nostalgic. <|endoftext|>
aha, that's a good one! <|endoftext|>
haha you are just crazy if you do that <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, a tornado watch is in effect for that city too! Are you in a dangerous area? <|endoftext|>
I hate when those kind of things happen! I'm glad you're okay though. <|endoftext|>
What type of dog is she? <|endoftext|>
That's a pretty name. How old is she? <|endoftext|>
That's a pretty name. How old is she? <|endoftext|>
That's so rude! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I would be so mad, you could get a new car and still have the car painted the same! <|endoftext|>
Oh god, that sounds so scary! <|endoftext|>
What is the name of the new dog? <|endoftext|>
You must be a very smart person to be so confident. I hope you do well. <|endoftext|>
Well i can imagine <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to think of it. It's nice to have those feelings, even if you don't need them right away. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I have no idea what I would do without a garden! Could you maybe grow some veggies for me? <|endoftext|>
That's great that someone out there was helpful. <|endoftext|>
Wow. You should buy a chainsaw some time. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is so proud of him! What a young man. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's awesome. I mean, it's not as difficult as I thought it would be, and it can pay well! <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome! I love going to Disneyworld <|endoftext|>
I am going to Cali for the summer. I have never been to Colorado. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I know that feeling, squeamish at best, and embarrassed by the whole situation at worst. I hope you weren't embarrassed about it in the least! <|endoftext|>
I bet! I would get in trouble too! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's terrible, I've been there too, they don't seem to want to be in the know about your problems. <|endoftext|>
yup! iiger does an awesome job! <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. It is very annoying when that happens. <|endoftext|>
I don't know, I've heard so many stories like that. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like you and your friends were ready and willing to help. I bet you had a good time while you were away. <|endoftext|>
i'm glad it wasn't much of a problem, but it must have been a stressful time for you <|endoftext|>
That's very sweet! What did you get in the mail? <|endoftext|>
You deserve something like that, too! <|endoftext|>
will you be taking a nap? <|endoftext|>
Diet is so important, what is it? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's exciting! Is it a girl or boy? <|endoftext|>
Thats so good. I wish friends all the best while you are away. <|endoftext|>
i am so sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
That's good you're there for him. Maybe you can put him in charge of the house and let him help with the chores. <|endoftext|>
aww that's so nice! were you surprised? <|endoftext|>
that's so nice of them! That's a nice way to start the holiday spirit <|endoftext|>
I hope you did too! are you prepared for the next class? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's so dedication! I love it when people stick to a schedule like that. Studying is a lot of work, but getting prepared for interviews or whatever <|endoftext|>
Aw, yes! thanx more power to you! <|endoftext|>
He must be smart! <|endoftext|>
I hope it comes soon <|endoftext|>
Well I hope you good luck! <|endoftext|>
Oh that sucks. Did he cancel? <|endoftext|>
I think he was like, sleeping or something. <|endoftext|>
Oh yea? What's happening tomorrow? <|endoftext|>
I felt like that when I got married. I didn't realize how great it would be for the first few days. <|endoftext|>
How long were you together? That's so sad. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. Try not to let it get the best of you, love is relative. <|endoftext|>
where were you flying> <|endoftext|>
Thats amazing! I would be nervous too flying in the first place. Did you land softly or did you trip over something? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Do you know what you can do to get better known? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go somewhere with more sunshine? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's really awesome! How did they do that? <|endoftext|>
What great parents! That's hard to find these days. <|endoftext|>
i have never won a wag, sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Yes! It is in the stomach that matters the most. <|endoftext|>
I hate spiders! Get the spray can and spray the living daylights out of that thing! <|endoftext|>
I am no longer afraid of spiders. I have seen them in the movie "It's Always Sunny in Delaware" <|endoftext|>
I love video games, what is your favorite game? <|endoftext|>
I agree, what is your favorite game to play? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. What did they end up cooking? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you didn't have to deal with it. I know how it feels to be on the fence about something. <|endoftext|>
That's aweseome. Did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you feel better now that you are home. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's a pretty impressive thing to see! How old is he? <|endoftext|>
I am sure it is nothing wrong with your relationship <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I am so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
its funny how times have changed.. but its not fair to them or you to wait forever for your parents to get better <|endoftext|>
Aw, I bet. It's always amazing to see your childhood come to fruition. <|endoftext|>
That's a long time ago for me. <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary! How much did it cost to get fixed? <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea. There's a good chance for you to hit something and kill someone. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I hope it does not eat your things. <|endoftext|>
If the power is out for more than a few minutes, you should definitely call your phone company to see what can be done about it. <|endoftext|>
That is amazing! How old were you when you were born? <|endoftext|>
Did you ask her why she did that? <|endoftext|>
What makes you say that? <|endoftext|>
That is a wonderful thing. I wish I had a friend like you. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's awful. I'm so sorry. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you have had to overcome your fear! They are very scary. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's scary! I'm glad you came back safely. Sounds like you did fine though. <|endoftext|>
Was it for a reason you could understand? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, are you alright? <|endoftext|>
How come you were afraid? <|endoftext|>
I guess going by yourself can sometimes be an experience. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice to have! Too many women just want to be around guys! <|endoftext|>
That's a great setup. I hope the right one is found soon. <|endoftext|>
What is your friend doing to get to your party? <|endoftext|>
I think it is time for you to move on <|endoftext|>
That's a good sign! Are you feeling better? <|endoftext|>
What did you have for Thanksgiving? <|endoftext|>
That is great, how long have you been married? <|endoftext|>
That's amazing, keep up the good work! <|endoftext|>
That is very lucky! I always get tips when I scratch. <|endoftext|>
Im happy for you! I have never won anything before <|endoftext|>
What an amazing gesture! I would love some popcorn to celebrate! <|endoftext|>
Sounds fair to me. I hate when those things happen. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's terrible. The weather should have been perfect during your vacation! <|endoftext|>
I know right. We can only wish our neighbors would stop living so close to us. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Congratulations. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
You should be proud of your accomplishment. <|endoftext|>
That is awful! Were you okay? <|endoftext|>
I wish I had a friend like you. I hope you were able to recover well! <|endoftext|>
Is that because he's not feeling well? <|endoftext|>
i do too, i wish i could get out of bed and not think about life <|endoftext|>
Wow, I'm really jealous of you! I moved to Indonesia for school, so I've only been to the east coast recently. How are you adjusting? <|endoftext|>
I live in Boston, so I've been there before. I visited there for the holidays and loved it! <|endoftext|>
Yes that is a really bad thing to do. I don't know how people can love someone so much when they do that. <|endoftext|>
I think it is just the same annoying thing as "what happened"? <|endoftext|>
I haven't seen any in years. But I have heard they are getting good reviews. <|endoftext|>
I see, enjoy them and move on. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's definitely a no no. Especially in public with children. <|endoftext|>
I've had some so far, I'm sure you can hold on to them if you're careful! <|endoftext|>
That's quite a gift! Was it expensive? <|endoftext|>
Well sure is, doesn't hurt that you have a great wife and a great son! <|endoftext|>
That is what makes the streets so dangerous. <|endoftext|>
That's great, I'm glad you're getting enough sleep! <|endoftext|>
won't you be too embarrassed? don't worry about it <|endoftext|>
That is sweet. Disney is a beautiful place. <|endoftext|>
I heard they are notorious for interviewing candidates for long. I hope it was a good fit <|endoftext|>
Awesome. That's great news. I am happy for you. <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! Are you going with family? <|endoftext|>
What will you do while you're gone? <|endoftext|>
Congrats! What kind of car did you get? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is a pretty good deal. You are a lucky man! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty nice of them. They sound like good people. <|endoftext|>
I hope you find something! <|endoftext|>
It's amazing how people can be so considerate when they expect nothing in return. A lot of charities are just annoying and self-centered. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's not fair! What did you do instead? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm glad you're learning something new and exciting! <|endoftext|>
Me too, like, why is he waiting for you? <|endoftext|>
I've been there! How long has it been? <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. I'm sorry. Do you talk often? <|endoftext|>
I hope you two make it back safely. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I wish I had a goal to walk to. <|endoftext|>
That makes sense. I am glad you have found someone. <|endoftext|>
I don't either, so I try to stay away from them all. <|endoftext|>
It's like you said, we are the product of circumstances beyond our control. <|endoftext|>
I bet! College is such a great time! What are you most excited about? <|endoftext|>
I bet that made you feel bad, you should make it up to her. <|endoftext|>
What is it? Someone gave it to you! <|endoftext|>
That's so bad I thought it was just the volume <|endoftext|>
That must be very hard. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, I have been there too. What steps do you and she need to take to get her back on track? <|endoftext|>
Yes! That is what we need in this country. instead of tearing down others <|endoftext|>
You are being very thoughtful. I wish my parents would allow me to do that. <|endoftext|>
That must have been lonely. How did you feel when you got there? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you learned a lesson from this. You will never have a perfect project, but you should at least try. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, where did she go? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. My dogs died a year and a half ago, and I am still waiting for the best time to get another one. <|endoftext|>
That's really good to hear. Is he in college? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's impressive. What does he do? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it is. People are just too cruel to pets. <|endoftext|>
That's quite a few times in your life. I'm glad you're okay, but I'm sorry you feel that way. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Did you get eaten? <|endoftext|>
That's a good bunch of friends to have around. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. Did she pass away? <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I'm glad she will always be remembered that way. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so painful! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I know the difficulty of having to take a young one to the dentist. <|endoftext|>
Co sleeping? That's co saving even <|endoftext|>
I hear you! I'm sure you feel better with the feet on the floor. <|endoftext|>
Are you going to go with them? <|endoftext|>
That's so nice. I wish I were there too. <|endoftext|>
I do too! I need to get back to the country myself. <|endoftext|>
How nice of them! What did you get? <|endoftext|>
That sounds good. <|endoftext|>
Oh I know, It's even worse when it's dark. <|endoftext|>
Are you going to go somewhere else? <|endoftext|>
Hahahah I'm an anorak too! I like the dark, but I'm scared of heights. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that, I try to keep to myself too <|endoftext|>
Do you have a dog? I rescued a dog from a shelter. <|endoftext|>
wow, thats so cool! I really wish the kitties had that option <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope no one was without power! Are you able to get back online? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad it was an accident! <|endoftext|>
That's awful. Did it break it? <|endoftext|>
I can understand that <|endoftext|>
oh, i have never had a bowl of cereal <|endoftext|>
Yeah I hate that. I think it's better to eat something than watch it, even if it's just a sandwich. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so relaxing! <|endoftext|>
I love rain too! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is awful. I hope your okay! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. Well, I hope some one helps you out. <|endoftext|>
That must have been a very exciting time for you. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is insane! Have you ever done it before or is it your first time? <|endoftext|>
I actually live in Nashville and I can tell you that it is one of the best cities in the US. It's got a rich history going all the way back to the 1700's. It is also very walkable too. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god! That's awesome! <|endoftext|>
I guess if the person is close to me I can understand the need to be cautious. I wish more people would be a bit more considerate. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's ok <|endoftext|>
Oh I see, it was anomaly and the mailman will get to you soon enough <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope you realize your full potential as a human being by now! <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I would be so scared to go into that. You need to go to your local, the schools are all around the place and you can't really go in and out. <|endoftext|>
Oh boy, that's a big presentation. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
oh now that's interesting <|endoftext|>
I have. It's a tough one. <|endoftext|>
That's so not cool! Have you thought about telling her about how you felt? <|endoftext|>
MOammy, thats awesome. Did you guys have a good relationship? <|endoftext|>
Yes, You should be grateful, dont worry about it. <|endoftext|>
that's awful! how long ago was that? <|endoftext|>
That's so awesome! I wish I had a husband like that! <|endoftext|>
That's great! What did you get them? <|endoftext|>
Is it because you have a new baby? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I've been there. It's crazy how busy it can be after a long shopping day. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. What were they going wrong? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry about that. Do you feel better now? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. What a lucky guy. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that would be the worst part, because you can't help but look back and laugh about it. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, there's always the chance that something even more amazing will come along, so it's best to just enjoy the present that you have. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I heard the same thing happened with me. I always have to check for the best possible deals first! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, definitely. I always try to hide the drinks from the kids when I buy them, but they love to see it and eat it! lol <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry about that! Did you not like it? <|endoftext|>
That sounds pretty gross! I would have had to have been spoon-feeding it to my son. <|endoftext|>
Nice, I hope he gets it! <|endoftext|>
We used to be the luckiest people in the world. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you had to go through that, but it's an important life lesson to learn. <|endoftext|>
That's a great way to make a lot of money. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds embarrassing at the time, but it must have been embarrassing in a good way. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's horrible! I bet that was a lot of stomping. <|endoftext|>
Calc is one of the hardest things to study. I am terrible with it <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's quite the dedication. You guys must have a very good connection. <|endoftext|>
What did she do? <|endoftext|>
Did you hear a thing or not? <|endoftext|>
Becoming what you want to be is the only way to go forward. I thank you for your wisdom. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Algebra is hard! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. That is an extremely tough decision to make. Best of luck deciding which school to attend! <|endoftext|>
that happens <|endoftext|>
... and then what? <|endoftext|>
I can understand, you don't have to be mean to other people, thats fair I guess. <|endoftext|>
I know right. The internet has made it so that anyone can see a movie or watch a TV show in a couple of minutes. It was really only a couple of years ago that I didn't even have access to the internet. <|endoftext|>
Matter of fact, I'm looking forward to the new game every week <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I know it's unpleasant to miss out on some great amusement during the winter, but it's a good time to come back in the spring. -wizard <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel! Mine are finally at the park we grew up in! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I'm sure it's going to be a great time and you'll be living a life you're passionate about. <|endoftext|>
Oh you're an amazing person, congratulations! <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. What is going on? <|endoftext|>
What Medal did you receive? <|endoftext|>
I dont blame you! I love bowling but kids are so much fun! <|endoftext|>
I love to bowl but also hate it when the other players try to take my stuff! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty scary. Have you called the police? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Do you play with them often? <|endoftext|>
You cant facetime it or video chat it. I havent played since i was a kid. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I bet that was embarrassing. It sounds like it was a lot of fun though. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Are you okay? <|endoftext|>
Yea I guess so, but you never know what she might do and how resilient they are. I hope she's open to healing. <|endoftext|>
Ah that's the thing about growing up, sometimes you have to make the hard decisions to move on up. <|endoftext|>
That is true, you need to get out and meet new people, you never know anything will go wrong, never! <|endoftext|>
I have been there, it will be alright <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of hours, I hope you do well in it <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you are, glad you feel more prepared! <|endoftext|>
It's hard to procrastinate but it's even harder to not do it. I might just keep my fingers crossed for you! <|endoftext|>
Great, I'm sure you feel wonderful! <|endoftext|>
I'm a bowling champion myself! <|endoftext|>
That is heartbreaking. How old is he? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry, can you make him some food? <|endoftext|>
What game is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh okay, okay, I guess that explains it. Have you ever played warcraft? <|endoftext|>
That is very frustrating to hear, I hope they can work it out! <|endoftext|>
you don't get any pampering <|endoftext|>
That's a shame. I live in a place with no storms and it being so hot. <|endoftext|>
Man that actually makes me more scared. I would be bit right away. <|endoftext|>
my god those are the best days to be a student <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope to have better control over my procrastination next time. <|endoftext|>
That's very nice! What did you think when you heard it? <|endoftext|>
I am sure they were! It is sad that we did not have many more years like that. <|endoftext|>
Well if you compare yourself to him it might sway you in his direction. Use him as a bowler's bible would be a great idea. <|endoftext|>
You should go ahead and bowl with him then, you never know if he is up for it! <|endoftext|>
Are you excited about it? <|endoftext|>
Oh yes, I know that feeling well. I have a hard time getting jobs in general. I hope you do well though! <|endoftext|>
That's no good! How are you going to make sure that you're not being tricked again? <|endoftext|>
It's a good thing you got a second chance. <|endoftext|>
Oh that does suck! I love going without my friends, but being away for long periods of time is sometimes needed to get my mind off things. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I hope you had a great time and you can make it up to them. <|endoftext|>
Well maybe he has been searching for one of those for a while now <|endoftext|>
That's cool. I've never had a boyfriend who isn't into gtfo. lol <|endoftext|>
It never hurts to try, do you have savings to raise the money? <|endoftext|>
do you have any luck in searching for a new one? <|endoftext|>
wow, that is crazy! they are so careless <|endoftext|>
That's the worst, especially when people lose their homes and can't get back to it. <|endoftext|>
That's awful! You should take someone else to help you fix it! <|endoftext|>
ate a new one soon buddy <|endoftext|>
I'm not even sure if that's even cool or not. Just make sure you give good feedback and don't overthink it. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, try to think positive! Life is really unfair sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Dogsit is an art form! Did you have any luck getting the stuff off of your clothes? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, dogs can live with humans for a long time, but they can't trust anyone. <|endoftext|>
I have never been into rap. Did you continue to listen? <|endoftext|>
/lol/ is the worst, but at least you're safe! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry. What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
Well that's very sweet of him. I bet you were surprised. <|endoftext|>
I was in the army. I know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
What kind of country is ours? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty awesome. What made it so good? <|endoftext|>
That's great! What kind of car did it have? <|endoftext|>
Aww, my parents aren't either. But, I bet they're proud of you for breaking away from the pack! <|endoftext|>
That is good. You can rest assured that your aunt and uncles are there for you no matter what. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh, that's so gross! Do you clean them up? <|endoftext|>
I can only imagine! That's a pretty typical response. Is it a nice car, or one that is difficult to drive? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's quite a trip. Were you able to stay with them? <|endoftext|>
thats good <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know what you mean. <|endoftext|>
I go to college in the fall. It was an easy process because I had to have both feet squared away. <|endoftext|>
You sound confident. What team are you on? <|endoftext|>
I hope you can find the motivation to keep up the good work! <|endoftext|>
Ain't that the truth. Wouldn't a ride of that nature make you sick? <|endoftext|>
High speeds are fun. I bet you had a good time <|endoftext|>
That must have been a pleasant surprise! You must be very grateful and happy about it now! <|endoftext|>
Oh, well I'm glad it worked out for you! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Were you able to get her to a doctor quickly and get her to a better table? <|endoftext|>
Panic is understandable. I would have been terrified! <|endoftext|>
That is not good. Have you tried to get in touch with them? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Login problems are never good. <|endoftext|>
Me too, I hate when that happens. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Maybe you can try and eat more? <|endoftext|>
Oh no what was it? Did you get in trouble? <|endoftext|>
That is pretty spooky. I would have wanted to talk to the owner and get him to recall the hairdryer. <|endoftext|>
That's so nerve racking. What were you nervous about? <|endoftext|>
I see, so it all worked out for you? <|endoftext|>
I"m sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I'm really happy for you. Do you have any other siblings? <|endoftext|>
That's great! It's always nice to get a yes from a loved one. <|endoftext|>
I hope so, too! Get out and meet some new people. <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing! I always carry a spare pair with me too. <|endoftext|>
Yes, you should be more prepared in case they do. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! What will you be doing? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool, I'm sure you will do a great job! <|endoftext|>
You will very soon! I bet you are so excited about that <|endoftext|>
I am thinking of getting an SUV. Please tell me that you are not afraid of trucks <|endoftext|>
How long has it been since you've been out? <|endoftext|>
what are you studying? <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude. I'm glad you're enjoying life now. <|endoftext|>
That sounds delicious, I should go visit my grandma <|endoftext|>
Good because now you have something to look forward to. <|endoftext|>
I hope you have lots of fun in college! <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. I know that if I had a baby I would want another gal also. <|endoftext|>
It can be hard to recognize the bad in a moment, but that's part of being an adult. Looking back is important. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I imagine that you will enjoy that. How long have you been friends with this couple? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's pretty cool. It's good they you are able to support your coworkers soently. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh, a used one? That's a bit expensive. <|endoftext|>
That is nice of her. It's nice you have that kind of relationship <|endoftext|>
Oh no, are they away at war? <|endoftext|>
I see. Well, I hope you guys have a good time and it sounds like a great time. <|endoftext|>
That sounds relaxing! <|endoftext|>
That's really great! I bet his family was happy about that. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, that was a real bummer. Have your dogs been found yet? <|endoftext|>
That's so awesome! What more can you get from your friends? <|endoftext|>
oh.. that is a bit odd. But maybe you had a good reason to do that. <|endoftext|>
Oh I love they also make a wonderful rescue shephard. They're very sweet. <|endoftext|>
Is that a long time? I hope she is enjoying the change. <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you! <|endoftext|>
Wow that is awesome, I can never have kids. <|endoftext|>
That is amazing. I am so happy for you <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I am the same way. What did she do that made you feel bad? <|endoftext|>
That is true, it is nice to hear someone is taking their time deciding on a future together. <|endoftext|>
how did it go? <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds really mean. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh, was he better when you saw him? <|endoftext|>
That is a sweet thing to do. I wish you all the best with your new husband. <|endoftext|>
Wait what? What are you waiting for? <|endoftext|>
But at least you at least know when they will be in. I am a bit worried that you will miss one too many train services. <|endoftext|>
They deserve a loyal companion. How old do you think she is? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I bet he is a great companion to have. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. I love cats but I don't like how they hunt in the dark. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's too bad. But, it happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
Wow. That's awful. Are you alright? <|endoftext|>
Did the other two victims aren't anyone you know? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry. How long did you have him for? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry that you had to lose that member of your family. Do you miss them? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you try to make friends? <|endoftext|>
It's a good feeling to have someone you can talk to. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's pretty cool! <|endoftext|>
I don't have a car, but I know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
That must be really sad. Why don't they come visit you? <|endoftext|>
that makes sense but you do have to have a job and things <|endoftext|>
What did you put in it? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I hope you can find something similar for your home. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry. That can be traumatic. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
It's great to have someone who cares for you <|endoftext|>
What did you do to celebrate? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, what was it? <|endoftext|>
I own a cat too <|endoftext|>
Wow. A car is a lot of money. How did she afford it? <|endoftext|>
I love Ford sedans! What kind are you getting? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
That's annoying. Do you talk to them atleast? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. Did they go on to college? <|endoftext|>
Oh man! Do you think they are up to no good? It sounds like they are messing with you. <|endoftext|>
Did the movie not start? <|endoftext|>
I think you got scared, how did you end up doing it? <|endoftext|>
thats important to you <|endoftext|>
Oh wow I had no idea! I hope you have a good time! <|endoftext|>
Oh that is horrible. Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
Oh man! How old is she? <|endoftext|>
I have never seen it, but I understand. I hope you win an Oscar that way. <|endoftext|>
I didn't know about it. Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|>
Oh I love the beach! I haven't been in two weeks! two weeks is a long time to be vacationing! <|endoftext|>
Well that's always good to hear! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
wow thats awesome, were you guys together a long time? <|endoftext|>
I love candy! Did you make a lot of money from it? <|endoftext|>
Haha, I know just how you feel. I always have to give it a go even when its cloudy. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! I wish I had a wife like that in my life. <|endoftext|>
Well, it's always good to hear about successful people and their amazing lives. I hope that you pass successfully and that you meet someone great! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Does he need to get a new one? <|endoftext|>
I bet he will be able to pay you back for the time you spent. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds like it's going to be exciting. I bet you're eager to get started. <|endoftext|>
That's really good. Sometimes it's helpful to practice with a friend, even if you don't think you can do it. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's not surprising. How come? <|endoftext|>
I talked to one recently and told him to get a moped! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened? <|endoftext|>
I guess that wasn't such a good place to be then <|endoftext|>
No, but i hope that you will be able to remarry soon. <|endoftext|>
I did until I was 13. Then I went to college so I had to wait a while longer. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! It will probably take some time for the pain and sadness to really go away. I hope you feel better soon. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's sad. At least you have time to yourself now. <|endoftext|>
That's so crazy! I never did that. Where did you guys go? <|endoftext|>
Oh well that's a great surprise! <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's a bummer! On the bright side, it means your daughter has learned to be a responsible adult! <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. I don't blame you one bit. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I've been there. That's so scary! I hate looking at stuff like that, and I hope you can pull through ok. <|endoftext|>
I would have paid more but it's not like anyone can resist a free drink. <|endoftext|>
That's great! The beach is a great place to relax! <|endoftext|>
I can imagine! You will never be able to go somewhere like that again. <|endoftext|>
oh yea i can imagine, sounds terrible <|endoftext|>
I would laugh as much as you, but I would know that it wasn't a good moment. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry about that, how did it happen? <|endoftext|>
I feel you. I am going to the doctor for a check up next month. My gums are rotting out too. Its not good. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, thats no fun at all. I really hope you don't hurt his ego by making him do what youre not ready for. <|endoftext|>
Thats a good idea <|endoftext|>
That is nice of you to do. Do you do that often? <|endoftext|>
Oh, hahaha, was it good though? <|endoftext|>
sorry about that, what happened? <|endoftext|>
You should go with him then <|endoftext|>
That's great! You must be so proud of her! <|endoftext|>
I try to do the same <|endoftext|>
That sounds wonderful. You are so lucky. <|endoftext|>
Wow! I am very happy for you! <|endoftext|>
That's so awesome. I wish I had a storage building. Was there a lot of pictures in there? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun! I bet you have a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
Oh man! AC's are terrible. We had AC's back in the day when I was in high school. We moved the breaker panel and changed the AC's every month. We had an AC from an old van when we were away <|endoftext|>
That is so gross! I hate flies! <|endoftext|>
wow. that is exciting. hopefully, you will have a great time and not so much as know each other. i hope all goes well for you all <|endoftext|>
Exactly. The money is always right before everyone else. <|endoftext|>
running is a major drag. i know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
I work at a fitness center and also take care of dogs. What kind of dog do you have? <|endoftext|>
Oh my! What happened? Oh my! I've only got one big surprise for you! <|endoftext|>
that's so sweet of him, it's nice to have someone that you can trust and a relationship like that. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. What made it great? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope he likes them! <|endoftext|>
Yep, kids get crazy when they're young <|endoftext|>
i'm happy for her! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's lightning fast! We live in the middle of nowhere and get lightning here pretty regularly. <|endoftext|>
What a coincidence! I love when that happens, my family is always so supportive. <|endoftext|>
That is good, how long do you think it took for the rains to stop? <|endoftext|>
I think tonight is a really good night to have a baby. Night time is perfect for babies! <|endoftext|>
Dang, what's the next best thing? <|endoftext|>
I wish you good luck! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Why? <|endoftext|>
Bosses are the worst, they should be afraid of you. Is your bossannon understanding him? <|endoftext|>
That is great. It is always so relaxing and fun to go to the beach. <|endoftext|>
I love going to DisneySea. <|endoftext|>
thats awesome! when is the last time she did that? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I have a dog who looooves to cuddle. I think it's her cuddling. I'm happy for you! <|endoftext|>
That can be tough. Did you have a bad experience living with them? <|endoftext|>
20 years is a long time to remember all the good times. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Do your teammates know that? <|endoftext|>
It's so refreshing to see someone that serious about the game. <|endoftext|>
That's the worst, the thinking that something bad has happened and then the attack immediately following. I always try to think about positive things in life and nothing bad will happen <|endoftext|>
oh wow that is impressive, i would be careful what you wish for.. infections are horrible <|endoftext|>
oh no im sorry to hear that goodbye. my condolences to you on his passing. you will always have his memory <|endoftext|>
Im glad, thanks for telling me about my dad. He is a saint. <|endoftext|>
I totally know the feeling! I have a friend like that too. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. One day we will look back on this and be proud of how we treated each other. <|endoftext|>
Oh, me too! That's terrible! Did your friend give you a present at least? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's not good at all. I don't know what I would do if I were in your shoes. <|endoftext|>
Oh, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's even worse. I would have bee so annoyed! <|endoftext|>
haha, thats great! <|endoftext|>
Ha ha! They are so cute! Do you have any of them at the moment? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I have had that happen many times. <|endoftext|>
That's so annoying. Did you ask them why they got a refund but your friend didn't? <|endoftext|>
oh, that stinks, but at least you had a water bottle to drink <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I guess they didn't check often enough. <|endoftext|>
It is crazy to hear sometimes, but luckily nothing happened to you! <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're alright, that sounds scary! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. That's almost impossible to do. Did you get an A? <|endoftext|>
That's a little alarming but okay - you're probably more worried about her than she knows. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I know that feeling! I get that all the time, especially if it's something urgent. I think you should try and relax and not do anything too exciting. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's too bad. I hope you didn't have to pay for any additional work! <|endoftext|>
No, but once in a while I had issues with them, so in that sense I am familiar with the feeling. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was embarrassing. Yeah, I understand how you feel. <|endoftext|>
I love metal, what was your favorite metal band? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. It's really hard to break up over something like that. <|endoftext|>
Yes, sometimes you have to "give it all" <|endoftext|>
I can see how that would be fun, but only if you're super super super into him <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I hope he is okay now <|endoftext|>
That is so terrible. I am so sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I love that movie <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I love dressing up as my favorite characters to see what everyone thinks! <|endoftext|>
That's kind of wild... Did you two have a good time? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun! It's always good to meet new people and have a good time doing so. <|endoftext|>
Haha, you're right. I love NYC and Manhattan too! <|endoftext|>
Whoa. I'm really sorry. Do you have any sentimental value to it? <|endoftext|>
All the best for you both <|endoftext|>
I understand, but it is difficult to let go <|endoftext|>
Is she married? <|endoftext|>
Yeah. I don't like heights much either. <|endoftext|>
I think its natural since we are lower animals. Did something give? <|endoftext|>
That sounds pretty spooky. What's the name of the music band that was set to perform? <|endoftext|>
I bet. I don't know how they catch people running a business that big! <|endoftext|>
ugh, that's horrible, how did she feel about it? <|endoftext|>
It's unfortunate. I'm sure you miss her a lot. <|endoftext|>
I was also a bit scared. I liked to be in control of the situation by making sure that the things I had were never stolen. <|endoftext|>
That is such a great idea! If you're nervous, have your friend call you in a few days and you can come with them. They'll be happy to help you figure it out! <|endoftext|>
I bet you feel bad about that. Sisters have a snore. <|endoftext|>
That may be true, but it is not her fault either. She is just like you and I in that sense. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a really great one. Did you win? <|endoftext|>
Well, that's the spirit! If you win the second game, you can play the first game for free the next! Pure capitalism! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's gonna be so fun! <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
where are you going <|endoftext|>
I would be so excited to go <|endoftext|>
Oh.. wow.. That break isnt that bad. I am glad you got to spend time with her again. <|endoftext|>
I hope you feel better soon. Maybe take a vacation to somewhere picturesque. <|endoftext|>
haha how did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's great. Knowing you trained so hard, I'm sure you got good grades. <|endoftext|>
oh no.. i am so sorry about you then <|endoftext|>
oh I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can see them soon. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear it. It's great to see so much optimism and faith in your ability to turn things around! <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah that sounds pretty nice. I bet you're going to have a lot of fun. <|endoftext|>
That's great news. What kind of job was it? <|endoftext|>
I would totally freak out if I were you! Are you in the United States? <|endoftext|>
I bet you were shocked! I am sure that was a huge surprise! <|endoftext|>
Table tennis is a game of skill. Congratulations to both friend and table! <|endoftext|>
That can be one of the most frustrating things about college. Did you find a scholarship candidate that meets your qualifications? <|endoftext|>
That's true. I'm sure your family can also be a lot of help to you in certain situations. <|endoftext|>
Yes, things will. You just have to believe in yourself and believe in your relationship with God. <|endoftext|>
What a wonderful gift for such a stressful time in your life! You should cherish it! <|endoftext|>
That's great. What did she major in? <|endoftext|>
You must be a proud parent. I'm so happy for your daughter. <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way. <|endoftext|>
It takes time to hone your skills. You should try to get some alone time too. <|endoftext|>
Oh I hope he wasn't hurting anyone! That's a funny image. <|endoftext|>
Yeah... but it is the thing to do. <|endoftext|>
I am happy for you, that is wonderful! <|endoftext|>
I'm happy for you. I'm sure the new addition to the family is going to be a blast. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's lucky of them, it's nice tooweh your parents! <|endoftext|>
Will you be able to revisit that day in the future? <|endoftext|>
That must have been wonderful. You must have felt very comfortable. <|endoftext|>
That's cool. I lived with my family for a few months at a friends <|endoftext|>
That is great. Sounds like she has a brave new world to conquer. <|endoftext|>
Oh that is a tough situation. <|endoftext|>
Why not? What happened? <|endoftext|>
So you're not trusting your parents, are you? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is crazy! I guess it is no good if they don't keep up with your insurance. <|endoftext|>
That's really cool. I've never had anything like that before. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
I am happy for you. I am sure that was a good feeling <|endoftext|>
That is amazing, were you nervous taking it? <|endoftext|>
Oh I have been there before. Layovers are brutal. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I hope it wasn't anything too bad like cat stealing. <|endoftext|>
ohwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That must be exciting and scary at the same time. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you have fun! <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun! I bet you got caught up in the moment afterwards. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I wonder if they let you sleep in the water. I'd love to be out in the ocean. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. Was she able to get him back? <|endoftext|>
How old is he? <|endoftext|>
Oh I know how that is. Did you talk to her? <|endoftext|>
Well I hope she is coming back to visit you soon. <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness that is horrible. were you able to sleep in your house that night? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I've had that happen to me before. Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That is fantastic! I am so happy for you, what will he name? <|endoftext|>
How old are your kids? <|endoftext|>
That's very hard. It's very preventable. I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sad. I only have two close friends, and I often times meet people from afar. I wish we had more friends like you guys. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty brave. How did the class react? <|endoftext|>
that's awesome! I'm so happy you went with her! <|endoftext|>
I don't like elevators either. That's why I don't want one. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds scary! <|endoftext|>
Well that's wonderful. I'm glad you're enjoying your life. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. Are you vacationing? <|endoftext|>
Wow that is pretty bad. I wonder if he was trying to get a baby laughing faceoff <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds scary! I hope it wasn't too hard to fix it the next day. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that's so important, how did it go? <|endoftext|>
That is great. I hope he gets the job! <|endoftext|>
oh no, i do that all the time <|endoftext|>
it is for sure. But don't let it get you down. You are only human. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great time, have you been on the internet lately? <|endoftext|>
I did see a play about it a while back. It was pretty good. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, you should be proud of yourself. <|endoftext|>
Well, I hope you'll have another arty career. <|endoftext|>
That is bad. Did you waste your auditioning for that job? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that doesn't sound good. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I always stay on edge at my home town too. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, those places are notorious for their smoking and drinking. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened next? <|endoftext|>
Well, that's a good sign. It's nice to have a friend who is open and honest. I hope you keep that friendship! <|endoftext|>
That's great! I moved a couple of years ago and it was a bumpy ride. <|endoftext|>
That must be very difficult. I am sure you have a great plan for him. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. What were you going to do? <|endoftext|>
That's great. Its not always easy to make ends meet, but it sure is easier than not keeping up. <|endoftext|>
oh no, that is awful, what did you do after? <|endoftext|>
Sure, I'm sure your dad is proud of you. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's exciting! Congratulations! You must be a great parent to raise a son who went to that prestigious school! <|endoftext|>
now that is a positive thing <|endoftext|>
That's rude. Did you try talking to them? <|endoftext|>
That's no fun. I bet it was embarrassing then. <|endoftext|>
Oh really? You should make a sign that says out loud, "Hi there, you are the only one I see around here" <|endoftext|>
It's always a good feeling when people notice you have friends. <|endoftext|>
Swimming is fun. But be careful, too much salt in the pool can be bad for you. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so nice! I love swimming. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! I'm sure she misses you. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I bet she is happier now! <|endoftext|>
That is good. What is the reason behind it? <|endoftext|>
I love my friends that are forgiving. If they don't mind helping, there's no need to be perfect. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Did you get a lot of presents? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you got it <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's a terrible thing to experience. Is the tree strong? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're OK. My mom was like that too, she would just sleep on the couch after every glass. <|endoftext|>
that's great news! good for you taking good care of your pet <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she appreciated it! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Why did they leave you? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. Are you happy with her? <|endoftext|>
I would say you should be proud of that, even though its probably a good thing he has a boss that will help him live a high life. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that doesn't sound very nice. Is it even a scam? <|endoftext|>
That's gross. Did you contact the restaurant? <|endoftext|>
That's very good of them. <|endoftext|>
did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
I have never been on one. I would love to though <|endoftext|>
That is terrible, what did he do? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's hard to tell if a friend is sincere in their intentions. Maybe you can give him a call? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you act lonely because you don't make friends easily? <|endoftext|>
I think people will be more open minded and will accept you instead of being afraid of what others will think. <|endoftext|>
That's not a good thing to be jealous about. How did you guys meet? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can get through it. If you think you can, you can do it! <|endoftext|>
Do you enjoy watching horror movies now? <|endoftext|>
Well, hopefully you learned your lesson and now your riding a monday morning! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, hope it starts to go well soon. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. How long were you together? <|endoftext|>
It was a very long time ago. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun! I love the beach! <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a nice thunderstorm to look at. <|endoftext|>
I understand that. It is very annoying when someone talks down to you. <|endoftext|>
You can of course talk to me. <|endoftext|>
That's always a great feeling! I love when my family comes together for the holidays! What are some good things that happen when you all eat dinner together? <|endoftext|>
That is usually a good habit to have. <|endoftext|>
That sounds fun! Did you have a great time? <|endoftext|>
Are you going out again? <|endoftext|>
I am the same way! I don't put up with that crap. <|endoftext|>
I guess we will see! <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
You could always go to a counselors office or something. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, did you find out who did it? <|endoftext|>
I am sure it will all work out. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I would have been so annoyed! Sounds like she might be on her period. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
I agree, but sometimes people are much worse. Like when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
I know it's hard when someone you love is taking advantage of you. Are you doing okay? <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! You must be determined! <|endoftext|>
Oh I hope it goes well! That's where my friends come in. <|endoftext|>
I don't think anyone enjoys going to the dentist. <|endoftext|>
It really does. I hope you are able to conquer your fear in the end <|endoftext|>
That's great. He must be a great person. <|endoftext|>
I hope you do get it soon. <|endoftext|>
I would though but I hate the thought of waiting. Too bad they're only legal in certain states. <|endoftext|>
That is wild! Damn good timing, Sox fans! <|endoftext|>
That is great, it sounds like you have a lot of faith in him! <|endoftext|>
Ohhhh, that's such good news. I can't wait to get my hands on a new car. Are you going to get a new one? <|endoftext|>
Truck loads of reliable reliable trucks! Odysseys are the best. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that must be awful. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of you, I hope it gets better over time for him. <|endoftext|>
Scotland is a very nice place to live I am sure! <|endoftext|>
I see, so it's not the same thing. I'm not sure which is better. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm not sure about that. I think it's from Scotland. That's a really good whiskies. I hope you find it! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, cheese is made in the south and made in the south right? There's a lot of people from there making it good too. <|endoftext|>
I know this pain. My brother would be in a better place if he was able to find a better job. <|endoftext|>
oh, i see, i am happy for you <|endoftext|>
Thats a bummer. Maybe you can reschedule. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds terrifying! I hope you stay safe. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. Have you tried to make it a regular thing? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully the two of you can get some sun in return. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. I am glad it was a nice day for you. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, and no one seems to agree on how to fix the problem. <|endoftext|>
Yes, we have to be more careful not to let our differences separate us even from family. <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that. are you feeling at peace now? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's hard to lose loved ones. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. It's hard to lose someone so close to you. Is there any way to make it up to her? <|endoftext|>
Uh oh. Did they have a good trip planned? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun do you love the artist? <|endoftext|>
I know them from high school. They are my favorite band. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's unusual. Some people just don't deliver. I hope you guys deliver on time andura <|endoftext|>
You have to be patient. You are toast if you don't get it done in a timely fashion! <|endoftext|>
Oh how nice. Are you excited? <|endoftext|>
That's a great feeling, mine too. We just went through a school year recently and had to fly back and forth from one school to the next. School year is always so much fun and you never know what surprises or paraphernalia you'll get back. Mine was a mix of both joy and worry. <|endoftext|>
Was it a vacation? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! I went to VA last month and I am glad you went there because I always wished I went there just to be around the pool! <|endoftext|>
Awww, I bet that was a blast for you guys! <|endoftext|>
Wow that would be exciting to win! <|endoftext|>
i bet! <|endoftext|>
how much does he get? <|endoftext|>
I never thought about watercooling, so I can only imagine how awesome it is! <|endoftext|>
Oh that is very exciting. What did you guys do? <|endoftext|>
woweee he has done a great job! i'm so happy <|endoftext|>
That's no good! What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
I think it's all luck. Everyone seems to want something though. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! That sounds like a lot of work! I'm sure it'll be worth it in the end! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you are, thanks for the suggestion! <|endoftext|>
I work 12 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. I feel like that's somewhat deserved since I'm in a more remote location. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's a tough friend to fight with. What do you usually do? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you can rewind time and get another dog <|endoftext|>
That's great that your doctor was willing to try it! Is it working well for you? <|endoftext|>
I hope you do too! I think being on one for a bit will deflower the baby in your belly. <|endoftext|>
That is so scary! My first tornado was scary too when it happened. I don't know what caused it, but I always try to be safe even in tornados. <|endoftext|>
I hope you're able to get your money back! <|endoftext|>
Oh, how nice of him! I bet you got one cheap! <|endoftext|>
Well hopefully you have a new one too! I am sure you would love it had you known ahead of time. <|endoftext|>
I love the holidays, too! <|endoftext|>
Can you bring it back? <|endoftext|>
That's lovely! How long have you known her? <|endoftext|>
It is nice to have someone that love us like that <|endoftext|>
That's so disappointing. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that. <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm sure she will be a better parent for it <|endoftext|>
Oh great! I bet you were thrilled! <|endoftext|>
He should be proud of you as well! <|endoftext|>
That's very sweet of you. Is she very upset about it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you would be fine if you had choices. I'm glad you were able to have a pet over an extended period of time. It must have been very rewarding! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's nice of her. What was the secret? <|endoftext|>
I bet. I am sorry you felt that way. <|endoftext|>
Did you go out and check what it was? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad it turned out to be a shadow. <|endoftext|>
That sounds lovely. It's lovely to be able to enjoy the quiet time while you're able to share everything with your family. <|endoftext|>
Will you be going on a stag do? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. RIP my best friend Riley. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure that it does but it does not make it any easier. Riley must be having a tough time. <|endoftext|>
That's his right as long as you're not involved in that situation! I hope she understands! <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that's terrible! I'm glad she got that over with so quickly, though! <|endoftext|>
That sounds very interesting, what is the diet? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry you have to deal with that <|endoftext|>
That is very frustrating, I hope you tried to work around her <|endoftext|>
I say just let it go and if she forgets about it it's not too bad. If she doesn't she's just going to find out it's not that big of a deal. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. I hope the cat was in a safe place at that point. <|endoftext|>
Awwww! I love cats, I can't imagine how you feel. I hope she's been feeling better lately! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! What will you do with the winnings? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're able to get the job back soon. <|endoftext|>
thats awesome <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's terrible. Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you felt that way. Is she no longer a friend? If so, I would advise not to be too hard on yourself! <|endoftext|>
yes i know thats why i put my daughter in a movie to get some rest <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that would be pretty embarassing. <|endoftext|>
Oh I get that, but I'm sure it wasn't that bad compared to other towns she's lived in! <|endoftext|>
I hope it doesn't happen again! <|endoftext|>
oh boy, were you expecting her? <|endoftext|>
Well most road trips end up being worse than this! <|endoftext|>
hard work pays of <|endoftext|>
Okay! I think you will get it if you hard work. I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
Oh I love hockey! Are you a fan? <|endoftext|>
That is a great shame. My parents used to play video games together but I always had other things in life. <|endoftext|>
Aww! I bet that was embarrassing. Do you usually catch them? <|endoftext|>
I cant imagine what would have happened if that small dog hit someone. I would have run to the other side of the road! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I know your pain so well. <|endoftext|>
It's okay to be mad, it will make you appreciate him more. <|endoftext|>
you should call up a few friends and hang out <|endoftext|>
I agree, you need to be more careful and don't forget your dinner!! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great news. Anything in particular? <|endoftext|>
wow, thats so exciting <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I bet she is excited. Does she want to go to college? <|endoftext|>
Woah, that's a bad feeling. We all do it. <|endoftext|>
I can understand your situation. But, it will get better. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Have you checked into alternative means of propulsion? <|endoftext|>
but why would you want to carry it instead of just a pepper spray <|endoftext|>
That's a very sad thing. I haven't seen the movie, but I've heard it's very funny. <|endoftext|>
i love modern day girly dramas <|endoftext|>
Oh sweet. I hope tomorrow is better. <|endoftext|>
Thats amazing. Kids grow up so fast. I bet you are so proud of her! <|endoftext|>
That will be nice, the trip is long. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. That's wonderful. I wish you the best of luck! Do you love your new home? <|endoftext|>
Oh, how was that experience for you? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. Do you feel like she's growing up quickly? <|endoftext|>
I hope it went well. What are you going to do next? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! Did they give you a voucher for a alternate time? <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, you must be very nervous about him. <|endoftext|>
awww that's so sweet. I bet he is so happy now! <|endoftext|>
oh no, were you at work at that time? <|endoftext|>
It's hard to believe that it was only $2 a minute. <|endoftext|>
Yay! Congrats! I know that's an exciting time in a woman's life! <|endoftext|>
Nature does that sometimes, I think it was really nice. <|endoftext|>
Really? That's cool. Do you go as a girl or boy? <|endoftext|>
I would never be able to play that game, because the doctor would come in and tell you how to do it, and you'd be like "oh i understand" lol <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! I can only imagine how devastating that is! I'm so sorry! <|endoftext|>
That is great that you were able to make it through. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, did you find your friend? <|endoftext|>
Old Chevys are great, do you have any dreams of one day owning one? <|endoftext|>
Oh how exciting. You definitely will meet a lot of people while you're on vacation. <|endoftext|>
That's great that she's prepared so well. <|endoftext|>
I had never heard of it. Was it good? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you didn't want to watch it, but it is gore! <|endoftext|>
Oh, yeah that sounds really sad. How did it make you feel? <|endoftext|>
Old friends are the best. It's hard to go through life without them. <|endoftext|>
I would ask the land trust about that and they will look into it. <|endoftext|>
thanks <|endoftext|>
What did he buy? <|endoftext|>
Yikes. I would be too. I hate it when people do that! <|endoftext|>
Wow, you must be proud. How old is she. <|endoftext|>
Wow that is a nice ride! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun. What are you planning on doing there? <|endoftext|>
Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome! What are you guys going to do there? <|endoftext|>
That's a really tough game. I bet you two will have a great time. <|endoftext|>
Are you married? That's awful. <|endoftext|>
I hope you can learn to treat others with decency and decorum. <|endoftext|>
That's very sweet. Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry about that. Are you going to go up to his gravesite and say a few prayers? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's amazing! How much were you hoping for? <|endoftext|>
Well, that's a good solution. You've got such high credit cardholders on you! <|endoftext|>
how wonderful! what did he do? <|endoftext|>
That is very cool, what was the award for? <|endoftext|>
That is funny. I bet you feel bad. <|endoftext|>
Thats a terrible coworker! Get back at her! <|endoftext|>
That is no good at all. I hope you guys work it out! <|endoftext|>
Awww that was so selfish of them!! I'm sorry! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, we all deserve to have a happy family. <|endoftext|>
how embarassing! you must have felt terrible! you should have hid! <|endoftext|>
Understandable, hopefully you learned from this experience? <|endoftext|>
That's really something to be thankful for. A lot of people can't even afford to retire. <|endoftext|>
That's great. I hope you have a lot of fun this year! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you okay? <|endoftext|>
I am so happy that I am not rich anymore! <|endoftext|>
Is there something you can do to keep yourself company? <|endoftext|>
No, it isn't. <|endoftext|>
I know how that is. I have 3 kids and they are almost all off to college. It's going to be a tough transition <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling. My kids were all scattered all around the house when I was growing up. <|endoftext|>
That's great. The ACT is a great way to get a degree. I hope you did well. <|endoftext|>
it's fine, attend school if you want to get a good grade <|endoftext|>
What a nice surprise. Where were you all going? <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! It's really nice here and I bet you guys had a great time! <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Did you realize where you went wrong? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's so bad. You had to be punished for that, what a terrible person! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds awesome! What're you going there for? <|endoftext|>
Yeah it does here too. The humidity is brutal. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's amazing! How much was it for? <|endoftext|>
Well it's still a lot of money! I bet you were thrilled about winning it! <|endoftext|>
That's incredibly frustrating! Have you tried calling them? Or sending them a polite email? <|endoftext|>
You should! They are not hard to train for, and they are a lot of fun! You will feel so much better after! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. How are you holding up? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you had to go through that. <|endoftext|>
sounds terrible but at least he is safe <|endoftext|>
im sorry, i hope you are able to re-establish a relationship <|endoftext|>
That's great! Life is really can make you feel good sometimes. <|endoftext|>
I am married. I have a wonderful wife also. <|endoftext|>
What was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's such a thoughtful gift! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What a horrible thing to happen <|endoftext|>
That's great! What happened next? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow I would be upset too. Did your daughter give you a reason why she was upset? <|endoftext|>
I really hope he will be fine! I know what a rough job it is and all but I'm sure you do an amazing job. <|endoftext|>
I have not, but I do love the show! <|endoftext|>
Yeah they're pretty cool. I'm curious to see if you did by doing a test or not. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible, did you have fun playing there? <|endoftext|>
I can't wait to die and go to heaven. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you going to make it up to her? <|endoftext|>
Well hopefully it will pass and you can get back to work as soon as possible. <|endoftext|>
That is nice to hear! I hope you two are a happy couple! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, no one should have a pet. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. My husband and I had one of those. It gets really frustrating. <|endoftext|>
That's the worst. Do you think your parents are tired too? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's so exciting. What will you do for him? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you two have a great time together! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, the holidays bring up a lot of memories. I think the best part about the holidays is that no matter where you are in the world, you can find others who share your same feelings. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, or maybe you'd have an amazing time <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's scary! Are you at least okay? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry about that, it is terrible. <|endoftext|>
I love Mario Kart! What is the new mode in? <|endoftext|>
I have never played that game. <|endoftext|>
Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. HR is so important these days. <|endoftext|>
That's a great idea for a house. I don't like having things piled high or piled down. <|endoftext|>
That is very annoying, you should not be able to do that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Have you guys talked? Were you in a bad relationship before? <|endoftext|>
I would do that, I just don't know where I am going. <|endoftext|>
That is a great accomplishment! <|endoftext|>
I didn't think diapers would be that expensive! I wish I could afford them. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he'll turn out awesome! <|endoftext|>
You should buy her a pet and a new life, even if it's just a toy! <|endoftext|>
That's a good plan. What are you going to study? <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of money! I wish I had a few years like that. <|endoftext|>
What game was it? <|endoftext|>
Little gestures are sometimes really meaningful. <|endoftext|>
Aw how cute! Lion King is pretty cute. <|endoftext|>
awww that's so sweet. I hope it turns out great! <|endoftext|>
5 <|endoftext|>
oh what did they move to? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's a sad time. <|endoftext|>
oh, I am sorry to hear that. What is wrong? <|endoftext|>
That would be terrible. I am sorry you have to go through that. <|endoftext|>
What makes you feel that way? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry for that, my family is like that too <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. Do you have a roomate? <|endoftext|>
Wow! I bet it is! I've never been over there - what's your favorite thing about it? <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that. how is he going to pay for the dentist? <|endoftext|>
What a great friend! I'm glad he's got a great caregiver now lol <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Are you taking any dogs with you? <|endoftext|>
I bet you were shocked when it happened! To be honest, I did not even knew birth mothers felt pain until I was 2! <|endoftext|>
It is so annoying when that happens. At least there is electricity during the storms. <|endoftext|>
Do you have any plans for this upcoming weekend? <|endoftext|>
Did you try to find who it belonged to? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's so sad. I hope it gets better! <|endoftext|>
That's always so scary, I hate spiders! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's the worst, I think. Maybe you can get some spray bottle and use it to spray the spider with water. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I hope you do well. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you will do well if you studied hard! <|endoftext|>
I always give them before the speech starts <|endoftext|>
I understand. You will be in a better mood when you give a good speech. <|endoftext|>
Did you receive a refund for the items? <|endoftext|>
I hope your weekends go better than hers! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. How long have you two been married? <|endoftext|>
I agree, honesty is the best. If you let jealousy take over, you will end up miserable! <|endoftext|>
That's terrifying, so many people have evacuated before? <|endoftext|>
oh thats good <|endoftext|>
That is really frustrating. Did you get charged extra for the connecting flight? <|endoftext|>
that is a load of bs! where did you get yours? <|endoftext|>
Congrats! You must be so proud of yourself! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
i used to fish as a kid, the water is beautiful <|endoftext|>
Great, how about you? <|endoftext|>
I am sure there was no food in particular that you wanted to talk about. <|endoftext|>
Oh, did you apologize to him? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it was only a joke! <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. I wouldn't be in this kinda car if it wasn't for iNews. <|endoftext|>
wow thatres nothing like true love, i bet, <|endoftext|>
Haha yeah, that's a cute name. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Don't people just hate dirty dishes? <|endoftext|>
That's very jealous! Sorry. ha ha <|endoftext|>
That's great. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you two made it home safely. <|endoftext|>
I guess you're right. It's hard when you're young and don't understand the night life. I wish I had a friend like you back then. <|endoftext|>
That is not ok I know but I guess it is part of life <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
That's a bummer. Hope it won't be too expensive to replace. <|endoftext|>
That is too bad. I am sure things will look better for you when you get back to being independent. <|endoftext|>
That's a terrible thing to see happen. Did they apologize to you? <|endoftext|>
Are you sure they were not going to harm you? <|endoftext|>
That sounds great! I have never been to the canyon. <|endoftext|>
that's always been my favorite part of filmmaking. <|endoftext|>
Whoa that's impressive. Did you guys have a backing track? <|endoftext|>
No, no problem at all. What kind of music do they play? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I have always wanted to get into the sport, but have been too shy to even try. What helped you? <|endoftext|>
I've never been bowled before. I have a bad back and can't really walk very well, so I can't really do spin bowling. Is it fun? <|endoftext|>
That is so gross. I hope it wasn't germs! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, we talked to them after they had gone for at least 5-10 minutes. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! How long did it take to get to this point? <|endoftext|>
I hope it is, good luck. <|endoftext|>
I beg your forgiveness. I was never strong like that. <|endoftext|>
I am a positive person myself, I have been through so much with my depression. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What subject is this in? <|endoftext|>
You're right. I often hear parents say they sacrificed so they could have their kids. I hope you apply to as many schools as you can. <|endoftext|>
That's great, it must be quite nice there. <|endoftext|>
That is quite an amazing shift. I wonder how it happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it didn't hurt too bad. <|endoftext|>
That's quite impressive. I'd be interested to hear more about the ball. <|endoftext|>
Totally. He is only 13. <|endoftext|>
I hope he does too! That would be nice! <|endoftext|>
Nice, what kind of car is it? <|endoftext|>
That's good! I hope you find a good car too! <|endoftext|>
Yeah - I love hits from the 60s and 70s. I can't believe I forgot that. What music was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh I've never heard of those people. Anyway, that sounds like a lot of music! <|endoftext|>
That's so scary! Is he okay? <|endoftext|>
I am sure they will be fine <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I only have one apartment - hopefully I'll get to that point soon! <|endoftext|>
That sounds wonderful. Hope you enjoy your peace. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. Maybe next time you'll be more careful. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful that you all get to catch up. What's been going on in your family? <|endoftext|>
I bet you are, I would be too. I moved to a small town a few hours away from my house and it was always nice to have people come in and talk to. <|endoftext|>
That is great, how did it feel? <|endoftext|>
indeed it does! i wish i could go back to work that fast <|endoftext|>
what do you do for work? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure you will do great! Keep your head up and whatever happens, happens. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I love bowling because it's so much fun. I played once, but it was cool because everyone was having a good time <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, I hope he gets a scholarship soon to play sports. <|endoftext|>
What was the noise made from? <|endoftext|>
I hope it didn't take you forever to find it! <|endoftext|>
It's just been a really nice friendship. Have you tried talking to your boss about it? <|endoftext|>
it might, but if it is that bad always end up taking up too much of your time <|endoftext|>
oh no, did you try to go back? <|endoftext|>
Well that's funny and terrifying at the same time. I hope you're able to get it fixed! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's awesome! Tell me about it!! <|endoftext|>
I am sure they will have a great time. <|endoftext|>
Yeah. It's nice to think about the good ol' days <|endoftext|>
I'm sure that is a hard thing to deal with <|endoftext|>
That is great, do you know what job you are going for yet? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I know how you feel. I wish life was that simple. <|endoftext|>
I would've freaked out! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That is scary! Thank god it was over with and your neighbor is okay too! <|endoftext|>
Ah thats a shame, I bet you feel better now that you did that. <|endoftext|>
I agree, your health is important <|endoftext|>
Wow, they are so entitled. <|endoftext|>
Chevy drivers are the worst, they are always in the shop trying to fix things like new tires or cables. <|endoftext|>
Craigslist is a very volatile place. I'm sure someone out there is out there looking for a phone, but you have to be careful. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that sounds lonely. I'm sorry to hear that. hopefully you can find a new home for him. <|endoftext|>
That sounds very exciting. What kind of forest? <|endoftext|>
It will get better with time. I'm sure it will improve for you if you stay patient. <|endoftext|>
OH no. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Dude! That sucks! I bet you are pissed off! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a pretty good life. You deserve to be celebrated. <|endoftext|>
I really hope that you get that eventually. I don't know how people can live without their loved ones. <|endoftext|>
I actually made a rash and I used the patterns too! <|endoftext|>
That is my goal too, to have a baby in 5 years <|endoftext|>
I arranged a trip to Cali a few years ago and it didn't go well. But everything happens for a reason. I hope you guys did well and that things work out well in the future. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I remember the days of the telephone. I spent a lot of money on telephone calls too, but it was all worth it in the end. I hope you two will meet again <|endoftext|>
That's a great thing to hear. I wish I could go back to be with my family. <|endoftext|>
That's great. I try to be more aware of the things that are around me these days. <|endoftext|>
That is amazing. You must be a very good dog groomer. <|endoftext|>
I have a few dogs. I love them but they get really sad when they have to go hungry <|endoftext|>
college? <|endoftext|>
Yea. I feel that way when my daughter goes to school. <|endoftext|>
I know it can be hard to change how people see you but it will happen eventually. Just be patient! <|endoftext|>
That's not fair. I am sorry you feel that way. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will! I once had to cancel all of my classes because I could not afford to pay for them. <|endoftext|>
keep your head up! i am sure you can manage it <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Mine just got a car! I'm so jealous! <|endoftext|>
Those are great cars to have! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. What kind of car? <|endoftext|>
Those are nice cars! I have a Fiesta george and love it! <|endoftext|>
Oh my! I hate when that happens. It makes me feel like I need to hide who I am, lol. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's so sad. Do you have a party planned for it? <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome <|endoftext|>
That's great! What made you feel better about yourself? <|endoftext|>
That's great, good for you! <|endoftext|>
That's really great! I shopivled for a while at a pawn shop and learned a lot. Did the same at a used car lot. <|endoftext|>
I just love Dragon tongue beans. I wish I could have some of those back home. <|endoftext|>
That's a very good idea. I'll have to try them sometime! <|endoftext|>
That's really cool. I've never been near an organic store, but I've heard organic is bad for the environment. Maybe you should try an organic store when you go back. <|endoftext|>
Why did he scare you? <|endoftext|>
I can see why you were scared! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty impressive for someone that looks like he's been working out a lot. Do you know if he's recuperating from it yet? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. What caused him to do that? <|endoftext|>
I totally understand. I'm a terrible driver and am never very good at paying attention. <|endoftext|>
I hope the resources you provide to the police force help you in this endeavor. <|endoftext|>
Oh I see, you have a great grandmother! <|endoftext|>
That's nice! You must have a special connection with her. <|endoftext|>
That's incredible, congratulations! <|endoftext|>
sounds like a great night <|endoftext|>
yes, in school it can be hard to figure it all out <|endoftext|>
That's true.  I was scared to take that exam because I didn't know if I would pass. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's smart. You'd think someone who owns all of your valuables would be more considerate! <|endoftext|>
Yeah! You're right. I always feel content when everything is all said and done. <|endoftext|>
That's great. How old is he? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's impressive! I actually had a friend who was like that, so I was proud of you for being so fluent! <|endoftext|>
I bet it was a nice surprise! Did you have any items in your living room that they might have left behind? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, in three weeks time she'll be out and about with the world. <|endoftext|>
That is so amazing! What breed? <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that. I think all cats are good pets though I am sure it had a lot of good memories when it was younger. I hope it returns safely <|endoftext|>
That's really sad. Long term relationships are so hard to recover from. I hope she's doing better now! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. Good for her. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I've never tried that before. I'm glad you've found it! <|endoftext|>
I haven't watched that much on Hulu, but I heard it's a good show! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Did he stop? <|endoftext|>
well i hope it wasn't! poor kitty <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. How old are they? <|endoftext|>
i hope it goes quickly for you <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! Was it a surprise from someone you knew or just someone you were close to? <|endoftext|>
i bet it was i bet your so happy <|endoftext|>
Ohhhh now that's very exciting. I hope they get there before the weekend runs out. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure everything will work out for the best. <|endoftext|>
I hear you. I'm always making a big deal out of it <|endoftext|>
I know right. Some people just don't know how to take care of others. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun, I loved decorating the Christmases back when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
That is true. Nowadays people just want to get stuff done online. <|endoftext|>
Oh yes! I think my sister does as well, she's the same way. I spent a lot of money on a cruise once <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of money! <|endoftext|>
Are you moving to a new house? <|endoftext|>
I went there for the first time when I was 14 and loved it! I still love going and the food is amazing. <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm glad that everything was ready. It's always good to prepare for a hurricane. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. I hope you guys have a great vacation! <|endoftext|>
That's great! Are they having any fun? <|endoftext|>
I have a wonderful family too. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Is she getting better? <|endoftext|>
That would be a bummer, sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. I know how you feel. I left my parents when I was 13 years old. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. I had such a great experience as well. My parents are still around, and I visit them quite often. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you were able to get some good help. That's what we call family in cell service. <|endoftext|>
That's really nice that you had someone to help you. Sounds like you had a great time! <|endoftext|>
Has it been stressful? <|endoftext|>
rush to judgment day or verdict? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! It's always good to see people on an even keel when things are quiet. <|endoftext|>
aging is a tough thing to deal with. my sister said if you treat yourself when you are old and there is nothing you regret about your old age, then the old will look like a child <|endoftext|>
That's always nice. What songs did you end up getting? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. I bet you were having fun on the dancefloor. <|endoftext|>
How did you do? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you did awesome. You'll crush it if you work hard enough. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? I can't wait until I have to get back into golf. I know how much work that can be! <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure what he is playing in, but I hope he is good! <|endoftext|>
I can imagine! I always hated golf. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that sounds like a great experience. I'd love to do skydiving for a living. <|endoftext|>
Oh! Well to be honest, i have never heard of it. <|endoftext|>
Some people are always better at having things planned out. That's great! I'm sure you are super organized! <|endoftext|>
oh yea i was a boy scout as well <|endoftext|>
That is a bummer. What did you do then? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know what you mean. I have yet to find a place that's quiet but has a lot of space. It's hard to find when you're trying to fix a place but it's even harder when you don't know what to do with it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that is unfortunate. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it gets better! <|endoftext|>
So you are peace you have an outside speace? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. You really will miss him there. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! What did you study? <|endoftext|>
At the very least it gives you a reason to keep going <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you are happy for her! <|endoftext|>
that's great! I'm sure she'll be proud of you for doing that. <|endoftext|>
oh neat. Clean the house, get back in the game. <|endoftext|>
That's good. I'm glad you came home in good shape. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's terrible. Was there no one around to help? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine. I would be so messed up. <|endoftext|>
Oh, what happened? I'm sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of things. I'm sorry you had to go through that, hopefully next time you have better luck. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! that is horrible. Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
oh no! i hope you didnt feel too bad about it <|endoftext|>
How is she holding up? <|endoftext|>
I hope it continues <|endoftext|>
i can imagine how you were feeling. were you nervous? <|endoftext|>
Yikes, sounds like a crazy friend. Well, I'm glad you finally understand your situation. <|endoftext|>
I know right. Renting is a pretty bad thing. I hate it. <|endoftext|>
I went to Disneyworld once. It was super fun! <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, I'm sure you'll make it. It's always exciting to cross country. <|endoftext|>
It must have been very nerve wracking, but so worth it. I am glad you were able to get through it! <|endoftext|>
How long did she need to stay in bed? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. I'm sure you are relieved. <|endoftext|>
I'm in college and summer is my favorite season. I'm glad to hear that school is back to being the same for you. <|endoftext|>
i would have been upset and not in the mood to work as well <|endoftext|>
I would be too. I don't have a lot of faith in people having a good life without a certain amount of food. <|endoftext|>
What a bummer! I hope she recovers well! <|endoftext|>
Yea, especially when you're a smaller team and have to play for something bigger. I like it this way, so I'm hoping for my brother to be a winner one day. <|endoftext|>
I agree, I feel like I need to do something about it soon. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! What has been wonderful? <|endoftext|>
Wow that's awesome! Congratulations. That's a big money advance. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear that. Is this your family? <|endoftext|>
I lost my grand mal as well. I just can't imagine leaving those to fend for themselves. <|endoftext|>
Aw, I bet that is lonely. You must miss him a lot. <|endoftext|>
I am glad! You must be excited about that. <|endoftext|>
Oh that must be tough! Did you two make plans to meet somewhere? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. I wish you the best of luck in the future. <|endoftext|>
Were you able to do anything to help with the loan? <|endoftext|>
Of all the people you've met, that's the one that's the biggest help during these tough times. I wish you the best with this and anything else that comes your way. <|endoftext|>
Do you live far away from them? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
They're scary! Do you have any family members that do? <|endoftext|>
I guess that's the best way to look at it. <|endoftext|>
That is very thoughtful of her. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's so annoying. But, it's good that you were able to meet everyone else's special someone. <|endoftext|>
That's not cool, what's wrong with being annoying to your sister? <|endoftext|>
Youngsters can be so exciting, do you have any plans for him now that he's old enough? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, did you get out and help her up? <|endoftext|>
Well she will know better than to do that again <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Did you try to comb it? <|endoftext|>
I really hope that you guys got your name cleared from the DVD, it could have been someone else. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Did you tell him how you felt about it? <|endoftext|>
oh wow, you should have known better <|endoftext|>
Really? Was it an important meeting? <|endoftext|>
That's nice of him! What does he give you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that you had to miss seeing him. I'm also sorry that you had to miss seeing your pooch. Are you going to get another dog? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am glad he is not suffering anymore. <|endoftext|>
I just got a cat. She's wonderful. <|endoftext|>
I do. I mean it when you say you love her, you should do it. <|endoftext|>
Oh I don't blame you! Most cooks wouldn't worry about scare tactics on my part. I'd probably be cooking the same old same old over and over again. <|endoftext|>
That's a new one! <|endoftext|>
How come? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome, i have been studying Algebra since grade 12, so i understand <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's great! Do you have a timer next time? <|endoftext|>
That's a good plan. I hope you do well and get a good grade. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Are you nervous? I'm sure she will be understanding. <|endoftext|>
No problem. Best of luck! <|endoftext|>
Sounds pretty fun! I love caverns and waterfalls! <|endoftext|>
Well it's good to hear that you were okay. It's rare to make it to the other side unscathed. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, are you alright now? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a good idea! I am sure you will see results real soon. <|endoftext|>
No. But i do feel scared sometimes. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry that happened to you! That can be so scary! <|endoftext|>
That is no good, how did she die? <|endoftext|>
I can't imagine how hard that is. I'm so sorry. <|endoftext|>
That is pretty insane. What is "inactive" money? <|endoftext|>
I guess you can only do so much and only use it for so long. I would just stop right there. <|endoftext|>
Yes and it was because of an issue with them. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry for your loss. I know how that is. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I loved him when I had one. Have you? <|endoftext|>
I hate poo in the house, I don't even <|endoftext|>
That's a smart idea. I always melt it in a microwave or in my Deep Freeze bag. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is not fun! What did you end up buying instead? <|endoftext|>
Why didn't you? <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Did he love her? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, I know how you feel. All you can do is stay positive and help as much as you can. <|endoftext|>
Oh god! I hate it when that happens! I have had those happen too in the past, they are not fun. Have you called your power company to help? <|endoftext|>
i bet that was a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
That sounds very fulfilling <|endoftext|>
oh damn, were you able to find a ride? <|endoftext|>
That's great, I'm glad it turned out that way. <|endoftext|>
Did you find out who stole it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, those missed connections can really hurt your morale. Are you going to reschedule? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is quite unfortunate. Can you reschedule with someone? <|endoftext|>
What kind of music did he play? <|endoftext|>
Holy moly, that would make me cry! So sad! <|endoftext|>
What kind of situation did you handle well? <|endoftext|>
oh no. What a disgusting thing to witness <|endoftext|>
That's disgusting. How old do you think your son is? <|endoftext|>
It's a learned behavior. You should never be able to prod him anymore. <|endoftext|>
How did you feel when you saw the end result? <|endoftext|>
Oh that is awesome! I bet it will be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
That's embarrassing, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
well everyone wins! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! What did it contain? <|endoftext|>
That is disgusting, i can't believe that was his birthday <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's exciting. Did you study hard? <|endoftext|>
That's so awesome! Congrats! <|endoftext|>
Yes, I know that feeling. At least you have someone to talk to who understands. <|endoftext|>
That really is a good way to be. I don't know how you guys get along though. <|endoftext|>
how is it going? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear. I hope she continues to get better. <|endoftext|>
I love Christmas. Are you going to have a party? <|endoftext|>
yeah it is! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty crappy, did you get bribed? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so sad. I am so sorry. Did someone else start the car? <|endoftext|>
lights off <|endoftext|>
wouldnt that do the trick? <|endoftext|>
That's really exciting! I hope it goes well for you! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you will! <|endoftext|>
Are you excited? <|endoftext|>
I sure hope they are for the best! <|endoftext|>
What is the cat's name? <|endoftext|>
maybe he is a puppy, me too, some people are crazy about them <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! That's awesome! I started college in Jan. of this year. I am officially crushed. <|endoftext|>
Five is awesome! I only have one more class to take. <|endoftext|>
harmony please try again later <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. It's probably because you were kind and honest. <|endoftext|>
That is where you should go, maybe you will see her in person! <|endoftext|>
oh well that is a positive, do you plan on going back? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
What was the movie? Ring odyssey? <|endoftext|>
Last I heard, the last bear cub was born in South Africa. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am glad you were okay! I am glad you didn't have to pay a fine. <|endoftext|>
I am glad you are okay <|endoftext|>
That's nice of her, maybe you should have returned it instead of criticizing your co-worker. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. Well, I hope you didn't get in trouble. It's hard to steal stuff sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Oh my. That is not good. Did you give him the money? <|endoftext|>
May I ask what the items were? <|endoftext|>
That's a great way to look at it. I'm sure it's much easier than trying to change your diet or exercise routine. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you were able to conquer your fear! Taping really works and makes you feel less scary! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a good habit to have. <|endoftext|>
That is great. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that sounds terrible. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so awesome, are you going again next year? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did they eventually get into it? <|endoftext|>
The best way is to just be and let the world do all the talking. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you have to go through that! <|endoftext|>
I would be mad, too! How did they do that?? <|endoftext|>
Wow! What a pleasant surprise. Maybe you can trade bar tips for a month, and I'm down for free? <|endoftext|>
That's a great memory. I'm sure it's very nice. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, I have been there too many times. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Have you done a cavity test and found one? If you think you have, you should probably go to the dentist. <|endoftext|>
Oh. Yeah. I didn't know that was even allowed under the newbook. I think they had a policy of not permitting that kind of behavior. <|endoftext|>
That is nasty! I bet you were very angry. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry. Was she okay? Hopefully she won't need any casts or anything. <|endoftext|>
That's very lucky of you to support her like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did your cat make it out? <|endoftext|>
I'm not really a fan of animals either. But I will say that I am an animal lover <|endoftext|>
How much can you lift? <|endoftext|>
That is a waste, but a way to get some exercise. <|endoftext|>
Yeah there is. Maybe try and think about one thing at a time. <|endoftext|>
investigations and legal matters are very scary and nerve wrecking. i can't imagine going through that. <|endoftext|>
That's great. Did you pick your favorite numero uno? <|endoftext|>
oh ok... well maybe if you save up a little at a time! <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! Did you go in particular to see it? I've never been to a play at all. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so amazing! I will have to try it out! <|endoftext|>
I love puppies what kind did you get? <|endoftext|>
Nice! What kind of dog is she? <|endoftext|>
Dang! Those are metal fans I bet. Did you guys go to a concert Grill? <|endoftext|>
I used to think of those days when I was younger when I thinking of my grandma and how she worked at McDonalds. <|endoftext|>
I love dogs, what kind did you get? <|endoftext|>
Awww, I've got to have a german shepherd some day, they're so cute! <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! That's the worst. How did you fight off the goose? <|endoftext|>
I understand. Those little things can mean the difference between a good and a great friend. <|endoftext|>
oh gross! what did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm glad you didn't trip over it, that would've been a horrible scrape. <|endoftext|>
Oh gosh! what did you do? <|endoftext|>
I can only imagine how frustrating that is. Did you try the grocery store? <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I'm sure you'll get it eventually! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's not good. What was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh gross! I wonder how it got there <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That can be so scary! I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
how fast were you crossing? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I can't wait to hear it! <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow. I didn't know that was coming. I hope you have fun though! <|endoftext|>
I love cutting in to lines, are we supposed to talk on the line? <|endoftext|>
I've been there. It's crazy how many big malls closed in the last year or so. <|endoftext|>
math is tough <|endoftext|>
I'm sure if you practice enough it will become instinct. <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds lovely! I bet that brings back a lot of memories. <|endoftext|>
Oh man. It's always nice to see old friends in their prime. <|endoftext|>
Oh nice. I love baseball. Did you like the game? <|endoftext|>
I'm so jealous of you! I live in the US and Canada, so I have never been to Mexico. I feel like i should visit there, even though its said as one of the most dangerous countries in the world. <|endoftext|>
What did you find? <|endoftext|>
I agree, a waste of money indeed! Well, I hope you have taught her not to do that anymore. Sounds like she's got a learning disability. <|endoftext|>
That is not good, did you file a police report? <|endoftext|>
so you're in a better place then I am lol <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I just got my new car today and it was even better than I had anticipated! <|endoftext|>
Oh, I seen those before, they are fun cars! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you did well. Are you planning to retake it? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations. That's a lot of money. <|endoftext|>
Oh, yeah. Did you do well? <|endoftext|>
It's worth it though <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's terrible! Hopefully no one noticed or it would have been expensive to fix. <|endoftext|>
Did you get lucky and not get stolen? <|endoftext|>
I agree with that 100% <|endoftext|>
I believe that happened too. I hope you guys are able to go back and celebrate. <|endoftext|>
What did she do to make you proud? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that'spireship.com <|endoftext|>
I don't sweat the hours, I just focus on getting the job done. You should try to do the same. <|endoftext|>
That sounds relaxing. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear. What are the clubs? <|endoftext|>
Ah, so you will be able to work part time? <|endoftext|>
That sounds very aggravating. I think I would rather just not go back. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a pain. Do you have any way to get them to pick up? <|endoftext|>
What was it? <|endoftext|>
Wow that's disgusting, I would have been so angry. <|endoftext|>
what do you think will happen? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear. How old is she now? <|endoftext|>
Aw, man. That's so nice. Sometimes I feel like we're so trusting of our loved ones, that it's easy to let things like that spoil our fun. I'm sorry I can't take that away from you. <|endoftext|>
Well that's good that you are being nice to him. It's bad when your boss pays for your drinks. <|endoftext|>
That is a shame. What happened? <|endoftext|>
If you put your mind to it, it can happen. I pray for everyone involved <|endoftext|>
I love to play mine too! <|endoftext|>
Oh. I understand. Anger can sometimes get the best of us. <|endoftext|>
What state do you live in? <|endoftext|>
oh thats good. micro brewing sounds good. <|endoftext|>
i know that feeling, dude <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a bad girl, but I guess girls can be pretty mean! <|endoftext|>
So sad to hear that. Is there any other personality he had that you could have? <|endoftext|>
I bet he appreciates you all a lot. He sure does! <|endoftext|>
That was very thoughtful of them. Did you feel nervous? <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. Thanks for everything! <|endoftext|>
Nice! Are they grown up now? <|endoftext|>
It is good to wildlife. I find it is safer to be around them. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that can be a long time. How will you be coping? <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! How did it go? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's not good. Are you going to stay the same? <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm happy for him and hope you have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Oh man! He sounds bossy. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's too bad. That would be a pain in the rear. <|endoftext|>
That sounds terrible! Did you clean it up? <|endoftext|>
Thank goodness it wasn't something serious. <|endoftext|>
Amazing! What kind of job? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of things in life, I'm sure he will find a job that will keep him occupied. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's amazing! What have you got going on? <|endoftext|>
That's good! It's always good to get something to eat before going to bed. Soup is always the best! <|endoftext|>
I bet that was really stressful. I hope they eventually did. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I haven't had that happen yet, but I'm sure that's frustrating. <|endoftext|>
They must be having a big family. <|endoftext|>
I am so jealous of you - get out and explore some of those countries or get a vacation? <|endoftext|>
Will you be able to drive to the hospital? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you two will have the time of your life <|endoftext|>
Family is important <|endoftext|>
They just said you were trying "to save more money" or something along those lines. I'm not sure if that's even good or redundant or how you even know if that's even the best money thing to do. <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude. Luck is in your favor, and they in yours. <|endoftext|>
Did you love her there? <|endoftext|>
How old is she? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry! I hope you get the job! <|endoftext|>
hahaha never heard of him. Dont give up hope! <|endoftext|>
Well you can at least get some new stuff now isn'tcha? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like you might have to explain <|endoftext|>
That must be tough. Have you tried to keep in touch with her? <|endoftext|>
You'll get to see her again this weekend? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sure it was just an inch or so, though. <|endoftext|>
That is scary, sounds like a good idea. He probably won't listen to you after that. <|endoftext|>
mosquitos are evil <|endoftext|>
Did you ever find any? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I'm glad she gave it to you though. I just don't like spiders that are larger than a room! <|endoftext|>
No, not when you have fun! I'm so glad you're safe. <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! Are you nervous? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, BASE jumping, roller coasters, and jet fighters are just a few of the extreme things you can do. <|endoftext|>
That's the worst, especially when you have coffee and have to drink it later. <|endoftext|>
Yuck <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I've never had that surgery. I'm so sorry you're going through so much trouble to fix something that seems impossible. <|endoftext|>
It will probably be ok. They did a good job with you <|endoftext|>
Does your friend live far away from you? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you have someone like that in your life. <|endoftext|>
I agree. I don't have a cell phone but I understand. <|endoftext|>
Oh gosh. Is youtube on your phone? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that, that is always so hard. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sad. I hope you're okay! <|endoftext|>
Oh I feel that way sometimes too <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you had a good time! <|endoftext|>
What a wonderful feeling! you must be so excited! <|endoftext|>
We ignore them but we do nothing about it. Sounds like you need to do something about the noise level in the cell. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you're proud <|endoftext|>
I hope you can get another dog then! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you will get in! <|endoftext|>
That is so scary! I hate bugs too. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish you all the luck! <|endoftext|>
That's really impressive, I imagine you must be very excited and relieved. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Unemployment can be really tough on families. <|endoftext|>
Yes, that's the spirit. We get so caught up in the moment, it can sometimes obscure how the world really is. <|endoftext|>
That is a great destination, have you been there before? <|endoftext|>
Awesome! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Wow! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Did you ever get a new one? <|endoftext|>
What did you do during that week? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a good plan. I'm sure the new neighbors will be happy to help you move in. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That must have been embarrassing! <|endoftext|>
Oh, well I hope you learned a lesson from that experience! <|endoftext|>
Aww, that'sussenothing. Did you find anything interesting? <|endoftext|>
I bet it was! Especially since it's the middle of summer. <|endoftext|>
What happened to him? I have a dog myself. <|endoftext|>
I hope you two have a good time! <|endoftext|>
He's going to Beacon in no time. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, It's the happiest when it's all said and done. <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting! How long has it been in the works? <|endoftext|>
I bet it was very cute and cuddly. <|endoftext|>
i hate when my dog does that too, i would have a heart attack <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's a pretty common hobby for kids. It's a lot of work but so fun. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's an important appointment. How does he feel about it? <|endoftext|>
You are so lucky to have a devoted and happy pet! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you have any sandwiches with it? <|endoftext|>
Yea thats quite scary! Its OK to have quirks sometimes! I used to have a cat that I lovingly called "Cherish" she is such a sweetheart! <|endoftext|>
What was the resturaunt? Did you go hungry? <|endoftext|>
Costly or what? I don't know...obviously, it wasn't delicious! <|endoftext|>
that could be rough, maybe try to have a good time and not worry about it <|endoftext|>
Well that's very admirable of you. It's good you have a higher standard than others. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of work! How did he do it? <|endoftext|>
That's great, I hope he has a happy marriage and a great life. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I understand. I would be feeling the same way if it happened to me. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened? <|endoftext|>
Yeah that would have been really cool. I'm sure everyone has their moments. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden? <|endoftext|>
Yes, it can be scary when you have to call someone you don't trust, but I'm glad you have a safe place to stay now. <|endoftext|>
Oh my! I'm so sorry! Were you able to find her at least? <|endoftext|>
oh no. that is awful. i hope she is alright now <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you can do it though! <|endoftext|>
That's great! Standing always hurts the most <|endoftext|>
I've never done it. I'm terrified! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that is amazing! I am so happy for your brother! <|endoftext|>
That sounds great! What kind is it? <|endoftext|>
Oh I love to watch movies too! What movie do you have going? <|endoftext|>
oh no.. did it taste funny? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I bet that was scary! Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
Be yourself and if it goes well you will be fine. <|endoftext|>
That's great. Good for you. Has your role call to action been filled? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that you have such good memories. What kind of memories? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Well, if it's a male friend of a female friend, I guess it makes sense. It's hard to determine if a relationship is healthy until you don't have it. I hope you guys can find a resolution to the issue! <|endoftext|>
oh thats nice of you. <|endoftext|>
Aww that's so sweet! I love animals! What kind of puppy was it? <|endoftext|>
I may just get a cat myself. My dog is going to be a puppy, lol. <|endoftext|>
Wow Ebay is notorious for its wild increases in prices. You might want to consider other options before spending so much money on something you don't trust. <|endoftext|>
I understand. I'm saving up for a house myself. <|endoftext|>
yeah ate too many i think that is the worst thing ever <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm sorry. It'll happen for you someday! <|endoftext|>
Oh poor thing, I'm sorry to hear that. Is he awake right now? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that may help. That's a very sweet gift. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun. Cool. <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm sure you can still make some good memories. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, that must be exciting! I bet you're psyched too <|endoftext|>
I do love watching soccer, but I always stop to play baseball or basketball! <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How did you react? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, bear you through it all. <|endoftext|>
Were they part of the animal? <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, I've never killed a bird but my gut tells me you shouldn't. Do you know what kind of poisons you can put in them to kill them? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I know, it is sad <|endoftext|>
I would too. they sound very dangerous <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What was it? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine how annoying that is! <|endoftext|>
That's good! What happened to the borrowed money? <|endoftext|>
That's good. It sounds like you are in good stead for the future. <|endoftext|>
Wow, what a devious fellow. You should have put the blindfold on him and run. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's so sweet. <|endoftext|>
It's pretty creepy actually. I could never fly one of those. I hate airplanes and helicopters the most. <|endoftext|>
Drones are fun, but they could be a very bad idea. There must be some way to tell that. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's very annoying when she's right. I hate it with every fiber of my being. <|endoftext|>
Wow I hope it was nothing too serious. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. What is the cause of death? <|endoftext|>
oh wow thats good news. i had a similar situation with a similar age. so far nothing out of the ordinary. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that is <|endoftext|>
Well that's worrying <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness, that is horrible. the smell is so bad that it almost hurts to go outside, the fumes can even be fatal <|endoftext|>
you're not being a bad boyfriend, it's just unfortunate <|endoftext|>
What kind of kit did you bring? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's terrible, I'm so sorry! <|endoftext|>
Oh awesome, what degree are you doing? <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of brain power, very impressive! <|endoftext|>
I havent done that in ages. Was it too hard? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I can imagine how you would feel as well. I bet it was hard to stay down, huh? <|endoftext|>
I guess you get what you deserve then. Denver is a resort for the wealthy. <|endoftext|>
There will be plenty of time for family fun and work fun at the very least. <|endoftext|>
I was so sad to hear that. I lost my cat a few years ago. It is so hard to lose a beloved pet. <|endoftext|>
I was thinking that too. They seem to take forever in getting the money to pay my vet bills. <|endoftext|>
oh no! i hope you had good insurance and didnt have any problems <|endoftext|>
I had the same experience when I was a kid. It was awesome. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I bet that was devastating. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow, that's amazing. You must be so proud of her! <|endoftext|>
I do not like the weather much, but the food was good <|endoftext|>
I can understand that <|endoftext|>
I haven't seen that one yet, I hope it is good! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you are okay! I would be too <|endoftext|>
What kind of policies do you have? <|endoftext|>
Yeah it really is. I was worried that maybe they had a down payment on a house and didn't have the money for an insurance policy. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, how did you manage to eat it? <|endoftext|>
oh i know right <|endoftext|>
I hope it wasn't serious! <|endoftext|>
Being stressed makes it hard to plan or accomplish even the simplest things. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's terrible. I'm so sorry! Hopefully your dog isn't lost forever, because that's a terrible thing to happen. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I hope you find him! <|endoftext|>
That's really messed up, did you try to contact him? <|endoftext|>
That is rough! I am sorry! Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
It's always nice when you can make generous offers. Maybe they will match next time. <|endoftext|>
You never know until you try! <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I'm sure you are excited! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Active duty is a great career to have. I hope he enjoys it! <|endoftext|>
That's sad, I bet you were disappointed in that, too! <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. I know many people would enjoy a burger that had a hair in it, though. <|endoftext|>
Ouch! I hope it wasn't too bad! <|endoftext|>
That is true, I've never done that. <|endoftext|>
Did you go see it again? <|endoftext|>
I would have kept the knife with you at all times. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I love dogs, what kind of dog? <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that is so annoying. I hate when people are driving cars that are way out in the open. It causes a lot of upset for everyone involved. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that sounds amazing! I don't do pizza by myself, i tend to eat a lot of food pizza shaped. <|endoftext|>
won't you be happy to do it again? <|endoftext|>
That's great, I've never been in a situation like that. <|endoftext|>
That's so good. I need to get on that, too. Will you be able to do it? <|endoftext|>
that sounds amazing, it's really an exciting time for you <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I hope you do well <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I hope you find him. <|endoftext|>
Yeah that is true, that is pretty horrible. <|endoftext|>
I totally know the feeling when you finally get one! <|endoftext|>
That is such a hassle to have to pay so many different things. Are you thinking about getting a new one? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! <|endoftext|>
Alaska State University, I must admit I had not heard of them before. I work in Boston so I know what it's like to be stressed. <|endoftext|>
That's great. At least you can say you gave her the scholarship. <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to go. It's usually pretty courteous since the worker never sees the favor come in his/her paycheck. <|endoftext|>
He'll do great! I'm sure he'll be fine. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. He must feel the same way. <|endoftext|>
Exactly! When you watch too many horror movies it becomes ingrained in you like cancer. <|endoftext|>
I bet! I think he's got a good chance at winning. <|endoftext|>
I feel you. Sometimes we have to make do with what we have. <|endoftext|>
I used to do the same thing when I was in middle school. I had so much free time I didn't have time to sleep! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how you feel, I've been there too <|endoftext|>
That's not bad! I am glad you are doing well in there. Are you studying for a test? <|endoftext|>
awww! that's so sweet! is he doing something special? <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to keep them occupied! <|endoftext|>
I will def be getting some filters soon! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I'm sorry! I hope you were able to get a similar job elsewhere. <|endoftext|>
That's how many cups of coffee I had this morning! Did you have coffee too? <|endoftext|>
Oh yes, I didn't know those nails had claws. My husband always bites me when I try to lick them. <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear that. Did you have a raise and a new job? <|endoftext|>
You are lucky to have such a caring father! <|endoftext|>
That's always nice, how did it make you feel? <|endoftext|>
wow. thats great <|endoftext|>
That is awful! Did you have to go to the doctor? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that sounds like a really bad infection. I'm glad you're okay, though! <|endoftext|>
That is some crazy roommate. I hope you told her on the way out. <|endoftext|>
Lactose is not good for the digestive system, so I understand why you would want to delay! I hope you can eat it again soon! <|endoftext|>
That's crazy. <|endoftext|>
That is a bummer, but hopefully everything goes well for you <|endoftext|>
I hope so, that is so much to deal with <|endoftext|>
That's actually quite interesting, did you ever try to pet it? <|endoftext|>
I hope you didn't hurt it at all! <|endoftext|>
I bet you will do great! Get as much rest as you can before the exam. <|endoftext|>
I think you will do fine. You sound very confident. <|endoftext|>
Oh my that is terrible. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm sure it's going to be hard to process and process and break up with someone you're so close to. But, at the end of the day, we just get our bits and we move on. <|endoftext|>
Yes, it is always good to have a backup plan in case <|endoftext|>
I would have done the same thing! <|endoftext|>
Absolutely! I'm sorry you have to deal with that. <|endoftext|>
If he is that young you better teach him not to do that again! <|endoftext|>
No way! They are the worst! I am terrified to death of them! <|endoftext|>
I hate that can you imagine it happening again? <|endoftext|>
You must be very proud of her. Maybe you could show her how to draw so she can learn! <|endoftext|>
That is pretty immature of you. I don't think I would ever draw an anime character, because they're so childish by nature. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. She seems really good with kids. <|endoftext|>
I'm so happy for you! You'll have a great time together! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. How old are you? <|endoftext|>
I really hope you do! Stage two is extremely tough and I'm sure you will be very strong. I would be very apprehensive as well. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's pretty spooky. Whatledeeping? <|endoftext|>
I don't blame you at all. I would have been terrified. <|endoftext|>
That's awful. What did he have done? <|endoftext|>
I hope it gets better! I for one am having a ton of pain now and will probably be going through the appointment tomorrow. I hope it gets better <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I know how hard this can be and how much you really love your wife. I wish you the best. <|endoftext|>
Absolutely! If you're worried about that then you haven't thought about the long term effects of cancer. I hope you find the answers you're looking for! <|endoftext|>
Oh the summer days. Was it fun? <|endoftext|>
I have wanted to play that all my life. My mom always had all my games. <|endoftext|>
how did it go? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. That sounds terrible. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! How did they do that? Is it safe and effective? <|endoftext|>
It's okay, you have amazing achievements to your name! That's what makes him proud! <|endoftext|>
That sounds lonely, I am sorry <|endoftext|>
That is a lot of movies, how many did you see? <|endoftext|>
Oh, did he mean to do that? <|endoftext|>
Is he a sweet kid? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I mean he's a crazy guy, but I guess sometimes you have to take a stand. <|endoftext|>
I understand. Sorry. Midterms are always so nerve racking. <|endoftext|>
What were you doing after using the restroom? <|endoftext|>
I am sure if you told your husband he could have done it for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that is terrible. What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
I would talk to, and forgive her, but only if she changes her ways. It's hard to forgive someone who does something you trust them to do, when you know they'll honor it. <|endoftext|>
What was it that made you so passionate about supporting your Uncle Bill? <|endoftext|>
You sound like a great friend. <|endoftext|>
I am sure he did not get a high grade. He just did not meet the standard set by the teachers. <|endoftext|>
Well I hope you can find solace in knowing that your loved one is safe and sound! <|endoftext|>
Yes! I found that even my 8 year old could speak. <|endoftext|>
lp, but you are right, philosophy is a very interesting subject. It is a very western thing to be a citizen, but to be interested in it one has to delving deep in one's family and culture <|endoftext|>
Ah ok. I am the same way. Olympia body builder. Did you try the diet? <|endoftext|>
Only those with the strongest of stomachs! Sounds like you're the kind of guy who'd enjoy that! <|endoftext|>
That's great that he was able to take care of you! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. I'm sure that was an awful experience for you. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's sweet. Do you have a great relationship with your mother? <|endoftext|>
At least you have loving, caring and loyal wife to keep you company <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Is she upset about something? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good of her. I hope she is no longer a bad dog, she could cause serious accidents! <|endoftext|>
You must be proud. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I feel for you. I was a student there, and I loved it, but the kids were terrible. <|endoftext|>
That's really frustrating. Have you talked to your boss about it? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should bring it up to HR. <|endoftext|>
aww. Im sorry for your loss. How long did it take for the cat to pass? <|endoftext|>
I hope he/she find what they are looking for again. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Was he the one that you wanted? <|endoftext|>
I hope it works out for you, if it ever does. If you're single, it's easier said than done. If you're married, it's much easier said than done. Take your time and know you have a lot of great people in your future. <|endoftext|>
I love pies. Do you have a recipe? <|endoftext|>
I love apple pie! I can't stand the sauce. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. <|endoftext|>
I agree with that <|endoftext|>
i love camping, so do I! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a wonderful sleep. <|endoftext|>
It's always dangerous to spend the night out alone. I'm glad you're okay! <|endoftext|>
I'm glad it almost started a fire. Do you know what caused it? <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure how much money you'll make, but I'd definitely be worried about that. <|endoftext|>
can't say i'm a fan but i hope the tensions will cool down <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Is it in danger of being stolen? <|endoftext|>
That's good! I'm glad people can trust you like that. <|endoftext|>
sad <|endoftext|>
Well that is a shame to hear. Hopefully you are able to get through it. Do you have family in the area that can help? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better. <|endoftext|>
those are good too <|endoftext|>
happiness comes and goes. keep it up <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. That is some good health! I hope tomorrow is like today. I need to work on my diet too. <|endoftext|>
Dude that is so paranoid I bet it would be scary to loose your family. <|endoftext|>
I didn't know they still had those. I laughed hard when I read that. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do great! Is it for something important? <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I hope you get a new one, good luck! <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure it's much needed clean. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I'm actually in a place where they're remodeling the kitchen, so I might have to move again <|endoftext|>
That's impressive. How old is she <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's great to find out that your child is truly yours. <|endoftext|>
Moving into a new place can be stressful. I hope you are doing a good job. <|endoftext|>
Ugh I don't have anywhere to go but I'm staying put anyway. <|endoftext|>
wow, that sounds scary, i hope everything goes well, i am sure you will be happy <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful to hear. It's been a lot of work to put off for them, but it's been really fun! <|endoftext|>
Yes, I used to fantasy watch so many movies when I was kid. <|endoftext|>
I love my life now! I should explore that some time. <|endoftext|>
Ah yes, time flies when you're young and your parents are still around. <|endoftext|>
I know that is hard, but you definitely should try to find them. It would be a waste of space if you don't. <|endoftext|>
Wow! What a good person. You are very lucky. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no that's so nice of him! I wonder how much he was able to lift? <|endoftext|>
That is sounds like a lot of fun! I know that was a long time ago, but I remember when turtles were my favorite <|endoftext|>
hopefully it works out for you <|endoftext|>
i love reading as well <|endoftext|>
Music is always a great way to pass the time and can also bring in new perspectives. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry about that! Have you tried to go to that place? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is scary! I lived in a place like that when I was younger. I remember the woods behind our house. You could always be out in the middle of nowhere. <|endoftext|>
Moving back to your parents place was once a fun adventure. It seems like a mess now however, but who knows what the future may hold. <|endoftext|>
What is it about where you live that pulls you back? <|endoftext|>
Do you have dogs of any kind? <|endoftext|>
awww. mewtwo is such a great movie. i loved the first one too. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's a pretty wild coincidence. Did you actually go? <|endoftext|>
That is pretty funny! <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. I have been there and know how it feels. <|endoftext|>
That's very nice of you. I actually have a local charity as well, but they're much better at getting good people than your local charity. I use their online form! <|endoftext|>
Wow! How! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What are you going to do with the money? <|endoftext|>
haha. Good. You'll be glad you did that <|endoftext|>
oh no. did you look like a sad person? <|endoftext|>
I can feel your pain. My sister was killed in a house fire years ago, and my great grandmother was one of the first people I prayed for after that <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I have had that happen too, and it is a pain to get them fixed <|endoftext|>
I would have been too. Did you talk to him about it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah? What was the prize? <|endoftext|>
That's not too bad. What kind of competition was it? <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds good <|endoftext|>
Haha. I always make sure to go to the stores that have drive thrus so I don't have to wait for long lines. <|endoftext|>
It is. I don't have any family in nursing. I had to come to the hospital <|endoftext|>
I can't imagine <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I bet you are super excited. I've never been to my parents. <|endoftext|>
oh boy <|endoftext|>
That's a great thing to hear! It's a big accomplishment to be making in this world! <|endoftext|>
It's always great to find someone who is willing to work hard and hopefully achieve success. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun! Are you going any friends or family? <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! How proud of you were you would have been mad? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did he topple over? <|endoftext|>
i bet you are, i have never been camping <|endoftext|>
That's nice. What kind of tent did you get? <|endoftext|>
Cool, whose gaming tournament is it? <|endoftext|>
Oh nice. What is your game mode. <|endoftext|>
skydiving is so exciting for you. how long do you think it will be before you take them skydiving? <|endoftext|>
oh wow! congrats! <|endoftext|>
That's great! Did you have problems with that, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
twelve steps is a good long walk. i am scared of heights but good luck! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I'd love to be able to go to a road that wasn't closed. Are they going to pay for road resurfacing? <|endoftext|>
That is not fun at all. I am sorry you have to deal with that. <|endoftext|>
That's good! Bids are always good but I hope you win. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! What is it you are after? <|endoftext|>
Was the dog hurt? <|endoftext|>
That's great, I hope it doesn't bite you anymore! <|endoftext|>
yes. my car isnt very good now also. technology is supposed to make things better not worse. <|endoftext|>
They are almost identical to me haha. <|endoftext|>
Wow, you are so lucky! I bet it was delicious! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it was! I love those cookies. <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing. Do you have a job? <|endoftext|>
I've never had too many carbs in my diet. I try to eat more vegetables now and then. <|endoftext|>
i understand. I think I saw that when I was little <|endoftext|>
I've never been into video games. What's the name of the game? <|endoftext|>
I love going to new countries. It's always nice to go somewhere you haven't been before. <|endoftext|>
That is true. I love those things too! I hope you find your new hometown. <|endoftext|>
That's so gross! Why do you do that? <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way! I don't let them do that anymore! <|endoftext|>
I have never seen one of those. I hope you are able to find one soon. <|endoftext|>
I agree. They just drive like zombies. <|endoftext|>
I dont give two shits about those types of things <|endoftext|>
oh no, that's a terrible thing to experience. were you able to bring it back? <|endoftext|>
I know, I've been in those kinds of situations before. I'm lucky the paramedics arrived on time! <|endoftext|>
Oh. What were you going to eat there? <|endoftext|>
Yeah it seems worth it so you are in good shape. I would be a little apprehensive about it if I were you. I hope you can enjoy it! <|endoftext|>
That sounds wonderful! I want to get my food made in a kitchen by the Indian kitchen and have it made right here in the area you guys live. I want delicious food all the time. <|endoftext|>
That sounds wonderful! My grandmother was ave like that too. <|endoftext|>
You must be excited! <|endoftext|>
That is so exciting! I am sure you have a lot of hard work ahead! <|endoftext|>
I've heard this before. It sounds like a war is going on inside your neighbor's house. Do you think they're giving the police a fair shake? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine how frustrating that can be. I'm glad you're safe. <|endoftext|>
I have a bad feeling about this. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. Sounds like they've lost their nerve, if that's any consolation. I hope you get it fixed, quick! <|endoftext|>
I agree. You have to take advantage of the moment. <|endoftext|>
oh thats awesome, i was a little jealous <|endoftext|>
I hope so too! That would be awesome. <|endoftext|>
That is great! I am so happy for you <|endoftext|>
That's really great - it'll be a great place to live for sure. <|endoftext|>
I do but it gets lonely when you have to share it. Have you ever moved to a co-ed unit? <|endoftext|>
Oh gross! Did you touch it? <|endoftext|>
I would feel the same way, that is one of my favorite things about going to the movies is the food and the bugs. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's pretty impressive! It's early days for sure, but I'm sure you'll be fine! <|endoftext|>
Well, that sounds like a plan! I hope you see music when you least expect it! <|endoftext|>
That is great. I have one now for the office. <|endoftext|>
That HP? I've never been impressed by them. <|endoftext|>
Nice, I haven't had a delivery in forever. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine! That's why I stay home. <|endoftext|>
What movie was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh. I didn't know that. Well I hope you find happiness! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! Count to ten and you're good to go! I bet you're so proud of him. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's crazy how some things are just so ingrained in us, that it's hard to break them. <|endoftext|>
Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
Did it hurt bad? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, does that upset you? I bet you are super embarrassed! <|endoftext|>
I would be too. Could you call up the old friends? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! My cats used to do that. How annoying. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Did you get to go on many tours? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I got you. I also loved Italy and Germany. <|endoftext|>
wow that's great! Did everything seem new? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I didn't realize aliens visited. <|endoftext|>
I get it, it was an unexpected surprise! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I never did that because I'm too afraid of mosquitos. Was it worth it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's always so aggravating when you have to be customer service oriented. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you get a needle's finger? <|endoftext|>
I understand. What did you do iced up <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that! What is wrong with him? <|endoftext|>
i understand how you feel <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you had to go through that. <|endoftext|>
Where are you moving to? <|endoftext|>
Oh that should be a great year then! I'm ready for it myself. <|endoftext|>
I agree. That is why I don't like New York too much. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I just hope they don't follow you around for too long. <|endoftext|>
Is there anything out there for you to go to? <|endoftext|>
Thats really sweet, I think its sad when they go and don't come back. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible, did you check your pack before heading out? <|endoftext|>
That's cool! Collectibles are some of my favorite things in life. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, is it not a normal holiday? <|endoftext|>
i hope you will be able to get to your vet and get your dog boarded. that way you can get some relief from your kathy <|endoftext|>
That's a good attitude. I bet you'll get it eventually though! <|endoftext|>
It is always good to find something better, I always try to find a internship or summer job as my next one. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Will it be at the fair? <|endoftext|>
Are you trying to get your hands on one of those? <|endoftext|>
There must be a place for everyone in life. <|endoftext|>
That's a very long time. Why not buy a new house? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I have never been out in the country. <|endoftext|>
That sounds grand! I believe I would have passed out if I was you. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet of them. How old is your family? <|endoftext|>
I hope you get to see them more often in the future! <|endoftext|>
Do you have long legs <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. I would think that would be a clue that you were not wearing them the right way. <|endoftext|>
uh oh! I'm not sure what you are trying to do. I hope it works for you! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of work, I'll need to start getting ready for a new job as well. You'll know when the time is right. <|endoftext|>
You must be excited and anxious about it. <|endoftext|>
hopefully you do not have to worry about that <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's always the worst. Luckily there are always wider seats available in most Starbucks. <|endoftext|>
That's good. You should be more careful next time. <|endoftext|>
wow that is amazing, how did you do it? <|endoftext|>
That's great! You must be a brilliant person. <|endoftext|>
Do you ever think of your mom watching over you? <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I'm so sorry to hear that. I have a fear of cars, too. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is so awful. Did you make it back with everything? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, did they just leave it at your door or did they leave a note or anything? <|endoftext|>
That doesn't sound good. Is it too soon to expect results? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine it must have been really scary for you. <|endoftext|>
That's incredible, I wonder how it feels to bench press that weight? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I am sure that was a lot of work! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I have always wanted to go to one! Did you enjoy your time there? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! You should thank your cat for having such a caring personality by having them visit you often. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, what is that felt like? <|endoftext|>
I bet. I can't believe some people are afraid of spiders. WHY? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is so gross. I have a cat too and it makes my stomach turn. <|endoftext|>
That is a bummer, glad you're not stuck with it! <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. Did you take the cat to get it fixed? <|endoftext|>
I hope you get to have another dog soon. My girlfriend's cat too, she's battling breast cancer. She's so sweet and sweet. <|endoftext|>
How does it make you feel now that you have forgotten the words? <|endoftext|>
I can agree with that <|endoftext|>
Were you able to find out what it was? <|endoftext|>
It's okay, armadillos are cute. They are sneaky. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. How did you handle it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's awful. I'm glad it's not hurting anyone, and you can fly again soon. <|endoftext|>
You should really go there, you won't regret it <|endoftext|>
Sounds delicious. What will you be cooking? <|endoftext|>
Nice! That's the most important thing right about now! <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you have a wonderful time. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry! What are you going to do about it? <|endoftext|>
That's disgusting! How can you tell your boss about this? <|endoftext|>
That must be very annoying. I'm sorry you're having such a hard time. <|endoftext|>
Have you ever thought about setting up a group? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, that sounds terrible. We adopted a dog from the shelter last week and he is fine now. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I bet she felt bad about getting sick there. I'm sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
I hope everything comes back good for her. I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
That's a great experience. I wish you two the best! <|endoftext|>
It's always nice when you have someone cooking for you. I love it when they show appreciation and appreciation and appreciation! <|endoftext|>
Will he be impressed? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that sounds bad. Where are you living? <|endoftext|>
Yes, very true. You do you? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's bad. I hope he's okay. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow. What were you doing after you finished eating? <|endoftext|>
That's some good news! I'm sure your family will be over soon to help out. <|endoftext|>
Yes, just a little goes a long way. I usually add two or three cloves. <|endoftext|>
Nice! What kind of clothing did you buy? <|endoftext|>
If you get noticed, good luck! I think you have a bright future ahead of you! <|endoftext|>
That's so annoying. Did you take him to the vet? <|endoftext|>
What kind of dog is it? <|endoftext|>
Well, that is great. You deserve to be thanked for all that you did. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I've had to deal with that. Is it an office job? <|endoftext|>
I love water parks! Are you going alone or with a group? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I bet they will love it when they get home as well! <|endoftext|>
That's lovely! I love cats! <|endoftext|>
That is purring, that is a good thing <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! What a nice gesture! <|endoftext|>
That's great, it'll be wonderful to have those memories with her in the future. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful news. Congratulations! <|endoftext|>
You will be so happy to have a new member of the family <|endoftext|>
Well that would be a real bummer! What are your thoughts on this? <|endoftext|>
That's sounds bad. Is he upset about it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Were you close to your cat? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it is sad when you lose a pet, but luckily most pets eventually find their forever homes. <|endoftext|>
I really do admire your passion, I can imagine that it has prepared her for the next step! <|endoftext|>
That sounds so impressive! <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry. How did it happen? <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a good feeling <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness, that must have been frightening <|endoftext|>
That's scary, I always hate falling asleep to scary things. <|endoftext|>
oh no! I hope no one else found out about it. <|endoftext|>
Lol that is funny. I have dealt with something similar before. <|endoftext|>
do you feel like you are prepared? <|endoftext|>
Wow, I bet that will be a slam dunk! <|endoftext|>
ewww. was it a hair ball of some sort? <|endoftext|>
Perhaps try the lemon grass essential oil found in lemon balm. It has scalar properties and dissolves stubborn hair. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty funny. I used to have those kind of shoes as well. <|endoftext|>
I felt like that with my parents when I was younger. They were just being annoying and rude all the time. <|endoftext|>
Pizza is my favorite food. What kind did you get? <|endoftext|>
uh oh...did someone cut your spider? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you find her? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you made it there. It must have been a very scary experience. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Did you end up winning the gun fight? <|endoftext|>
Well you can still run a decent race. <|endoftext|>
Oh, how did that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
I guess that makes sense, I guess the church has little to do with it all <|endoftext|>
That's always fun! What did you have in dangina? <|endoftext|>
I could just imagine being in that place too. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god! I would have been so scared. Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
oh yea did you catch him? <|endoftext|>
oh no! did he apologize? <|endoftext|>
I hope the cat is okay now. <|endoftext|>
Why did he start playing music instead of shutting up? <|endoftext|>
How did he react? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's funny. Did you tackle the dog? <|endoftext|>
I am sure it will. You just have to wait and pray for it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, did you return it? <|endoftext|>
That's the unfortunate part about having kids - they always seem to come in handy. <|endoftext|>
That's nice. What did you get? <|endoftext|>
It's nice to have someone who is so down to earth <|endoftext|>
That's a no no! Have you had any dealings with the tax collectors? <|endoftext|>
There's always a way to move. <|endoftext|>
That's true. I try to be as true to myself as I can be. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I do but she won't let me borrow any money, she wants me to buy her things. <|endoftext|>
That's great, did you use his or her services? <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear it went smoothly. I hope your nails look amazing in the new dress! <|endoftext|>
Have you tried to talk to her? Sometimes women won't return stolen items, so it's best to be safe when giving good Samaritans money. <|endoftext|>
Don't be discouraged if she doesn't speak a word of English. You can always go to the second grade. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry! I've done things I regret and still think about. But it's better this way, it never hurts to try. <|endoftext|>
What are you going to do about it? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I love roller coasters. <|endoftext|>
Is it too expensive for you? <|endoftext|>
Why Kavanaugh? I thought your dog was a guard dog. <|endoftext|>
I was on the phone service when it happened, i was on the phone for over an hour, when they finally got back to me, i told them what happened and they apologized. I hope that they will be more diligent in the future when dealing with phone companies. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you can think of it as putting your dog to sleep when your at night. <|endoftext|>
set aside a certain amount of time, i believe that is the key to success <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I used to live in an old geezer's country when I was a kid. I miss that old time. <|endoftext|>
That is amazing. You must have felt very happy when you saw all those people that weekend <|endoftext|>
I do use to, it was simpler then social media. <|endoftext|>
I like watching a lot of movies. What movie do you like watching most? <|endoftext|>
I've never had a day off of work so I'm not sure what to do with an extra hour. Do you have any friends around that can help make you a nice cake? <|endoftext|>
I can't even imagine how hard that is! I would hate to have to go through that! <|endoftext|>
That sounds so good. How long did it take? <|endoftext|>
yea i know how you feel <|endoftext|>
aw how cute! what year did you turn? <|endoftext|>
Just be careful when driving and have a safe journey! <|endoftext|>
That is very trusting. Jobs are always hard to find these days. <|endoftext|>
That is a good attitude! <|endoftext|>
oh no. that's terrible <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's no fun! <|endoftext|>
what kinda pain it hurt? <|endoftext|>
Well its alright. I am sure your day went better than it could have without you! <|endoftext|>
I haven't the slightest! I love video games! <|endoftext|>
It's coming out in the fall. I've never played it before. <|endoftext|>
That is annoying <|endoftext|>
It's a beautiful thing to see someone so selfless. You deserve to be happy about that. <|endoftext|>
I am really happy about that. I had great summers but had to start moving again. So far so good <|endoftext|>
Yes, make sure you work hard and don't give up! <|endoftext|>
Good. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Congrats! <|endoftext|>
I bet that was scary. Did you make it out okay? <|endoftext|>
I would be furious as well, you should fire him immediately! <|endoftext|>
Used to be a lot of times. What games are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, my kids love them too. I haven't played in a while, but I've seen all my friends play them. I think my dad would love to borrow them. <|endoftext|>
It's been a roller coaster ride, but I am happy now that I can say that. <|endoftext|>
Well hopefully it's a great opportunity for you as well! <|endoftext|>
Did you give her your key? <|endoftext|>
Well that's pretty bad of you. Maybe she should hang it up and find something else? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I love Chinese food, I think you should have ordered it. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that must have been a pain. <|endoftext|>
I do notjacued that, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hate to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a very hard thing to go through. I am glad you are moving on. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty adventurous of them, how did it go? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good to hear. I'm sure you will be OK and that the experience will make you proud. <|endoftext|>
Good to hear that you are prepared. Is it for a hourly wage job or a salary? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine it must have been terrifying for you. <|endoftext|>
That is a nice thing to do. What kind of bar was it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, sometimes you've just got to move on. <|endoftext|>
How come? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I am glad you are fine, however scary the endeavor was. <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing to teach them. I'm sure they'll grow up to be nicer. <|endoftext|>
I don't know if you should talk to the teachers or principal. I think you should ask for help but also make sure you aren't alone. <|endoftext|>
I think so but I'm not sure. I mean I love video games but I'm not really into the production. <|endoftext|>
That is pretty cool. I played FIFA on a supercomputer in college. It was crazy! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you going out and having fun with her again? <|endoftext|>
Dang, hopefully it is that type of fun for all of you! <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds so sweet! I love family reunions. <|endoftext|>
That's really good! I bet it brings up a lot of good stuff too. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I've been trying to sell off my stake in ice cream, I'm hoping that you can help me out. <|endoftext|>
That's a good attitude. I wish my company would just give in to me. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that must have been stressful. How old is she? <|endoftext|>
My daughter is older than me by 3 years. She was a baby when I was married. <|endoftext|>
What are cryptokitties? <|endoftext|>
Well as long as you said you'll pay and he does! I would never lose my cat! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's so cool! I'd love to go someday! <|endoftext|>
life is short <|endoftext|>
sounds like a nightmare <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a day that will be remembered for a long time. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
I couldn't- my husband just hit on me, so I guess I'm the only one he's rejected. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. I hope you were able to sell well and get the speech over with. <|endoftext|>
You are very lucky, and very wise <|endoftext|>
Are you enjoying it? <|endoftext|>
I wish I had a job like that <|endoftext|>
Oh awesome! I am sure that will be a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Weather can always be worse than expected. I'm sorry you had to endure that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Is that a good reason to get a new one? <|endoftext|>
Wow! How did that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! I wish I could nap like that! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great time. Did you guys catch up on old times? <|endoftext|>
Anyway, you can get some new socks or a hat or something else to wear while you wait. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I'm so sorry. That is awful. Were you able to tell them your friend had been killed? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry you had to go through that. <|endoftext|>
That is very sweet. How did she do that? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, hopefully it brings good exposure for you, and maybe you can make some more money. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Your marriage sounds great! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. I hope you enjoy your new partner! <|endoftext|>
That really sucks. Did you find it? <|endoftext|>
No no, that's crazy talk. If someone in your group is doing something weird, you should call the police. <|endoftext|>
That's a great food bank! I'm glad to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That's always great when you can get together with like-minded people. I'm always happy to see people making fun of others in their communities! <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! It seems that your marriage is keeping the life of the family fine. <|endoftext|>
It's a good place to be. I'm glad to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I try not to think to much about kitchen sanitation when I go out to eat. <|endoftext|>
I hate oil. It cleans your engine cool though. <|endoftext|>
That really sucks. You might consider getting a new one made if you already have an old one. <|endoftext|>
I understand, maybe you can pay for it yourself? <|endoftext|>
That sounds painful! Did it hurt like a bug. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no. Do you think it will ever happen to you again? <|endoftext|>
That's just cool, I bet they were happy to see you drunk <|endoftext|>
I can relate to that. It's so annoying when it takes forever! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, sometimes glimmers of wisdom like that can help you see things a little bit more holistically. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is always tough. <|endoftext|>
I wish I had a dog like that <|endoftext|>
That's a great idea. Do you think you'll go swimmingly <|endoftext|>
Oh sounds fun! I like boats. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a very trusting friend <|endoftext|>
Don't beat yourself up. Plenty of people can't buy a truck and still be happy. You can't compare yourself to them. They are doing fine independently. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, things you can't always get with money. <|endoftext|>
That's good that you're prepared! What is the project? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. I'm sure you got it all sorted out after the fact! <|endoftext|>
that's the spirit. you must savor each and every one of your birthday treats. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that sucks! I hope you get what you need. <|endoftext|>
That's great. It must be so much easier to find good doctors in the MD school? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, that sounds terrible. Do you feel better now? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry you had to lose that much. Are you eating more healthy now? <|endoftext|>
It shouldn't be a big deal. It takes a lot of practice. <|endoftext|>
Just think positive thoughts! Maybe it will go well! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! do you wish you had taken the day off? <|endoftext|>
I'm happy for you. I hope you remember it fondly. <|endoftext|>
That's great. Do you have a doctor who can help you figure out the problems? <|endoftext|>
I bet you are so happy about that! <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I had a pet when I was younger and I still feel sad for it. <|endoftext|>
Oh yes, my parents are usually dead when they are in their forties. But I had a great aunt who was 43 when she got her. She loved to read and was having a career fall apart when she was 32. It's crazy how much our parents let us down when we are young. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
That is good. I wish I had a reliable car. <|endoftext|>
That's sweet. How long have you two been married? <|endoftext|>
That's a great way to remember him. <|endoftext|>
Ugh, that's broken news! Did you run into any glass? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Congratulations. What did you do with the money? <|endoftext|>
Oh how exciting! Are you excited to go? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's a big plan, are you worried about going because of the danger? <|endoftext|>
That's so cool. Is it a good knife? <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have a great friend like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh, well hopefully this age when you can finally have children will come soon. <|endoftext|>
That's very good to hear. My own situation is not great, but I have not lost hope either. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. What did you have to do? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you passed the mock interview. <|endoftext|>
uh. did you ever get another car? <|endoftext|>
I guess in a way you are glad it was over well that it wasn't. I hope you feel better and your confidence increases going forward. <|endoftext|>
I used to be a person that had so much control over things. I am so lucky to have learned that during diving <|endoftext|>
That is hard to grasp. How did you find out you couldn't veto? <|endoftext|>
That's interesting. I've never heard of him. <|endoftext|>
That's cool. What was your favorite? <|endoftext|>
oh yea i know that feeling <|endoftext|>
lol well at least you can always find the other one later! <|endoftext|>
Dance moves? How are they like? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see! Well good luck! I am sure you know what you have to do. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How did you manage to manage to get them down again so quickly? <|endoftext|>
did you catch up? <|endoftext|>
What happens? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you had good qualities, bad qualities, are good qualities and bad qualities, you don't know. Maybe you just needed a change of pace. <|endoftext|>
What is helped by where you started? <|endoftext|>
That is very true <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea. I think it will help my stock go up a bit too. <|endoftext|>
wow that is really low <|endoftext|>
That's a shame, at least you can learn from it. At least you know what you can do to improve. <|endoftext|>
It must be so hard to drink that much! <|endoftext|>
Yeah but you deserve to be there. <|endoftext|>
Nice! How did you do on it? <|endoftext|>
What did you do to relieve the stress? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did it hurt? <|endoftext|>
I hope he learns his lesson. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow! That's pretty bad. Did you confront him? <|endoftext|>
Oh okay well that's a good move then! I hope you can keep her when you rehanging. <|endoftext|>
Ugh tell me about it. i have done that about 100 times. <|endoftext|>
Dang well it sounds like it was a good decision! <|endoftext|>
Did you have any left over money? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I can understand that. <|endoftext|>
Wow! I have never been able to even get close to that. I am so jealous of you. <|endoftext|>
No kidding! I'm glad you're attiring yourself to impress your date! <|endoftext|>
I hav neeat! I hav neeat! <|endoftext|>
You should buy yourself a new computer and join an online group to keep yourself occupied for once. <|endoftext|>
I used to smoke, but have been trying to give it up for now. <|endoftext|>
I love fantasy, it can transport us to another time <|endoftext|>
Did you take the dare? <|endoftext|>
That's about as hard as it can get! The cemetery challenge is very real. I passed mine but had to come back because I was so tired. <|endoftext|>
I really enjoy getting things done. Do you work? <|endoftext|>
I could never do that. I always feel like I'm going broke and it always seems to happen when I try to do too much at once. <|endoftext|>
It's always nice to get out and get active. <|endoftext|>
Those are good fitness goals! Keep them alive, I bet. <|endoftext|>
Did you punish your cat? <|endoftext|>
That's veryicum <|endoftext|>
Did you have to go to the hospital? <|endoftext|>
Oh, cysts are nasty things! I hope you are okay! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I know that must be difficult. Did you two move on from it? <|endoftext|>
He sounds like a real workaholic! #sorrydidyoubreakup <|endoftext|>
yea i know what you mean <|endoftext|>
It's hard to know what to do with sadness. I'm glad you're exploring! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Those animals are horrible! I am so sorry that happened to you! <|endoftext|>
That's too bad, hopefully the rot doesn't spread to the rest of the house. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I eat junk food all the time. <|endoftext|>
Just a few slices of bread a day sounds like a good idea. Don't despair... You can always try dieting in the gym. <|endoftext|>
It is very interesting. The themes and message are very different there from here. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
that is so cute. what was the puppies name? <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful, I bet you are so proud of them. <|endoftext|>
Easier said than done <|endoftext|>
That's pretty funny <|endoftext|>
I am not a fan of cloves of any kind. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, now you should be more careful in future. <|endoftext|>
oh my! what a bummer! did you go and find it? <|endoftext|>
I see. Well, I hope you are able to stay dry next time! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you get in trouble? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I guess I would get some too. Maybe you won't get bad karma, but I hope you get some for future crimes you may commit! <|endoftext|>
Was she trying on different dresses? <|endoftext|>
I cant even imagine how frustrating that must have been. I am glad you are in a different car though. <|endoftext|>
Ouch, no pun intended, I've had that happen. It's a pretty typical dentist story, but it gets worse. They won't tell you why they did it, but it's always the same thing. You need to see the doctor. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. You should get a coverage next time. <|endoftext|>
I am sure it has its downsides too. <|endoftext|>
Well, thank you for telling me. I need to learn more! <|endoftext|>
I hear you! I love taking my dog for a walk. It is so peaceful and you don't have to worry about them getting out of position or things like that. Have you done that a lot in the past? <|endoftext|>
Ah, well rest assured, you will wake up soon enough and remember it for all the wrong reasons! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did he survive? <|endoftext|>
So you had a big party for him to remember him by? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How did you feel when you forgot to go to class? <|endoftext|>
I agree, I don't take vacations enough these days! <|endoftext|>
That's always fun to look back on old memories. <|endoftext|>
I understand. But you also have to appreciate the time that has passed and the wonderful things that have happened. <|endoftext|>
Glad to hear that, it's an important step in the process <|endoftext|>
You must be so relieved and happy. I am glad to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great kid, you're a good parent! <|endoftext|>
That's good. Well, I hope it wasn't too bad. <|endoftext|>
that's the whole idea behind the gym <|endoftext|>
That's the best feeling. <|endoftext|>
oh no what did you do <|endoftext|>
It happens to the best of us. I'm sure it's an unfortunate situation. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's awesome. How long did you train for that? <|endoftext|>
Lol, that's great. I am sure you are good at it! <|endoftext|>
That's inspiring! What made you want to learn how to do meditation? <|endoftext|>
Great! That's much! I usually sit to play video games. <|endoftext|>
oh no! did you confront him about it? <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. Dating is hard. I had a guy dump me because he was with someone else. I knew I had to get over it somehow. <|endoftext|>
Thats a great friend you have! Have you been playing tennis for a long time? <|endoftext|>
That is good, you must be proud of yourself <|endoftext|>
being dishonest to you? what was the reason? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Congrats on that baby. Hopefully it will be having happy times. <|endoftext|>
I agree. I wish I could go back to that time. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun! Happy birthday to you! <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. How did it happen? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure that you did well, it's just that you'll never know until you try <|endoftext|>
That's great that you feel so good. Do you go often? <|endoftext|>
I think it has to do with your level of competition. If you're on a team or competing in a league then you definitely have to win. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. How is it going? <|endoftext|>
Oh that is harsh. I guess if you know someone with an extremist political bent then that makes you an extremist in their eyes. I have friends who are on both ends of that spectrum and I worry about them. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I had a dog for the same reason. 13 years is a long time. I had mine for 8 years. It's just one more thing to worry about. <|endoftext|>
I was also a bit apprehensive. First of all, dogs are just amazing. I am not sure how we would cope with their constant barking and how we would feel about it. I am also not a big fan of dogs barking so much. I was thinking about something else. <|endoftext|>
I understand how you feel. I had the same feeling when I lost my grandmother. I am so sorry you went through that feeling. <|endoftext|>
I honestly hope so too, it's hard when things like that happen. <|endoftext|>
Wow! I am sorry to hear that. Cats are precious like that. I'm glad you found her again. <|endoftext|>
I hope you feel better. I really loved my cancer pet too <|endoftext|>
What happened to the cat? Did it run away? <|endoftext|>
Aw I love cats, I would have loved that <|endoftext|>
Why were you so worried? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
Yes, I know that feeling well, because summer classes are over and I'm done with mine too! <|endoftext|>
I think that all the time, but I try to get some rest on break. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! So you both must have been pretty nervous. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope your boyfriend gets better with the verbal part of the relationship. <|endoftext|>
What kind of dress did you buy? <|endoftext|>
Lol. That's funny. Well, I hope you show them you care by wearing it with pride. <|endoftext|>
it sounds like you're taking it seriously <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! I wish I had invented an uphill machine. I worked out once when I was a teenager. <|endoftext|>
How exciting! What kind of opportunity is it? <|endoftext|>
Well, I hope it's a great experience! <|endoftext|>
I always feel prepared for them, how did you do? <|endoftext|>
Well you must have been very prepared if you were able to do that. <|endoftext|>
oh no <|endoftext|>
I had to take a bus to the beach after that. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's awful. What did you tell them? <|endoftext|>
I am glad that you have a friend like that! <|endoftext|>
That's nice. Do you enjoy just relaxing? <|endoftext|>
I'm jealous of you! That sounds like an amazing night! <|endoftext|>
That would be so scary! Do you think the police are able to find you? <|endoftext|>
I can understand that! I wish only I could wake up and feel at peace. <|endoftext|>
Are you going to be in one soon? <|endoftext|>
That is crazy. I don't know how you can get money like that <|endoftext|>
That's wise. the holidays are the best. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. Well it's good you could spread the wealth around. It sounds like your a good steward of the purse! <|endoftext|>
It's always nice to have a chat with people you don't see everyday. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so sweet, I remember moving away too when I was young. Did you get to see her often? <|endoftext|>
I bet you were very anxious and annoyed. What did you do on your appointment? <|endoftext|>
They do that to you all the time. It's disgusting. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. What's been going on? <|endoftext|>
You will I'm sure. Just stay positive! <|endoftext|>
I agree. I feel that way when someone else does something I don't like. <|endoftext|>
its very sad <|endoftext|>
oh now that is very interesting, i have never gotten a message from an inactive group <|endoftext|>
I think that's completely reasonable to be concerned about. Even if it's a little scary at first. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun! Are you nervous about it? <|endoftext|>
Practice is always good, but an actual climb I would be afraid to do. <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary <|endoftext|>
I feel like you are in a different dream. What is your dream haunt? <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness, i would be so tired as well <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
I'm so happy for your new born! Good for you! <|endoftext|>
It sounds like you have a great wife and great doctor! <|endoftext|>
thats great! good for you man <|endoftext|>
olympics or bank heists? <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling.I was out in college when I started feeling lonely. <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea, I hope it goes well! <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that would be difficult <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should try juggling while you sleep. <|endoftext|>
you deserve her for that <|endoftext|>
I do. Have you told your significant other? <|endoftext|>
Oh I know, that is always a good thing. What are some of your favorite types to see? <|endoftext|>
Oh, those pesky flying ants are the worst! <|endoftext|>
Thats great, I feel that way when I get positive vibes from my family <|endoftext|>
I hope so too, it's so nice to feel for others <|endoftext|>
Oh that's nice of them. Sounds like they had a good time! <|endoftext|>
OH. That's a long drive. I hope you have fun <|endoftext|>
That's car trouble! Are you going to be ok? <|endoftext|>
Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
Do you mean that you miss her? <|endoftext|>
I hope you can mend their heart and mend all their hurts. <|endoftext|>
I think she is very smart and has had a very hard time bonding with you two. What do you recommend you do? <|endoftext|>
I am glad she is learning and learning is key <|endoftext|>
That is nice! I love to go every summer with my kids. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Time flies! <|endoftext|>
A tumor? That's quite worrying. Have you talked to her about it yet? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you have to part ways with her. You might consider getting another rat, I'm sure she would appreciate some new toys! <|endoftext|>
Aw I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I agree. We all need to rest and deal with the past. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that sucks. You were probably pretty sad about that. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry it happened to you. <|endoftext|>
Oh, so what then? <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have plenty of time and life goes around. I hope that you do well in school and have a great career ahead! <|endoftext|>
That's great. What album is it? <|endoftext|>
Wow that's quite a way to go. I wish I had a car. <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting! I've never heard of Madagascar, what is it like there? <|endoftext|>
wow that is interesting <|endoftext|>
Yes it is. We need to be as prepared as possible. <|endoftext|>
It is so great to have a supportive and caring family! <|endoftext|>
Nothing too exciting, is it? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you were fine. Did you go on any rides? <|endoftext|>
oh no that is not good.. did you punish him? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's a gross thing to do. <|endoftext|>
Oh how sad. How old was she when she passed away? <|endoftext|>
that is very kind <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful. It was really nice when you got the compliments and money was on the table <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. Do you have any traditions that you want to teach them? <|endoftext|>
I think you will have a blast. It will be your own, but you will meet a lot of new people. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. What's wrong? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, I hope she can live a happy and productive old age. I wish you all the best with your research! <|endoftext|>
You can do that. I know it might be hard, but it's a great way to start <|endoftext|>
That sounds slow moving. <|endoftext|>
Moderation is key, I'm glad you were able to get home. I know how it feels when you think you've been in that situation many times but it always comes back to planning for the future. <|endoftext|>
That's really great! You seem like a good partner to have! What's been going on? <|endoftext|>
I really do. I wish all the best in his future. <|endoftext|>
oh. I guess the world doesn't work that way. sometimes we have to do what we have to do to survive! <|endoftext|>
Haha that's awesome! Meh, I don't have a care in the world lol <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh, that is so disgusting! Did you say anything? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. It's not always easy when those around you are struggling. Take time to grieve and be there for your friend. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's an embarrassing thing to happen. Did anyone judge you? <|endoftext|>
What did she do? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That would be a great idea! Trick your butler into thinking he won the lottery? I've never tried that. Have you? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. Well prank or no prank, I'm sure your cousin will forgive you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I would be jealous and let me know what you did! <|endoftext|>
If- hopefully- you both can make it up here. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Are you going to use it? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun! What did you eat and where did you go? <|endoftext|>
oh really? <|endoftext|>
It's a big step for her- it'll be exciting to watch her grow! <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. That's a big deal! <|endoftext|>
Ahh - I've been there. Sometimes it's better to break things than to learn from them. <|endoftext|>
Oh god, I hate hurricanes. <|endoftext|>
Thats great. I hope you had AC when you got ready to leave. lightning can be very dangerous. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible, did you have to evacuate? <|endoftext|>
That's a very good reason. I'm sorry you don't like meat. Sounds like you have a very good reason. <|endoftext|>
Oh, you have a long time to wait... <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's crazy! Did she get into trouble? <|endoftext|>
Wow. That's a long time to be sitting in front of a TV all day. <|endoftext|>
What is the certification exam for? <|endoftext|>
You should- good luck with that. <|endoftext|>
Awe, that's sad. Are you having doubts and worries... about her? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's awesome. What does your new manager do? <|endoftext|>
You are very lucky to have such a caring father. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no I'm sorry to hear that. Are you alright? <|endoftext|>
I understand that. I have been in your situation before too, hope you feel better! <|endoftext|>
Take a chance and go to a coffee shop or bar. <|endoftext|>
That really sucks I feel. I usually want to hang out with a few people a night, but I'm not always able to. Maybe you can try going to a Pub or something where you can meet people who will be more welcoming? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, did you study better? <|endoftext|>
It happens to the best of us. Just know that it is temporary and you will be fine <|endoftext|>
Awww what a pointless thing to do! What song? <|endoftext|>
Did your wife ever do it to you? <|endoftext|>
4 colors? I have never used that many colors. <|endoftext|>
What kind of pens? <|endoftext|>
What's wrong with it? <|endoftext|>
I hope it does well! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, were you able to take her place? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I still have hope that you can make it soon! <|endoftext|>
Woah! I bet that was a nightmare. Was she able to clean it up after herself? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I can see the photo op. Sounds like fun! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine! I hope it stops soon! <|endoftext|>
I remember when mine started back then too! Makes me feel good when I think of those good times with my kids <|endoftext|>
I miss those days too. I hope you have good years ahead! <|endoftext|>
Really? <|endoftext|>
Dang. I guess if you can't eat ice cream how else are you going to go about doing so? <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I'm so sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
It's funny, I was thinking the same thing just a couple weeks ago. I was heading to the grocery store, when I heard the car coming, I realized I should have put my helmet on or get out of the way. I hit the brakes hard, but I didn't hit anyone. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I have never eaten there. Was she upset about it? <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of you. Nights are always nice but it's nice when you can just help out and get to know the people around you. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! I am sure you will find a better job though. I have faith. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it will happen eventually, just stay patient and believe in yourself! <|endoftext|>
Oh? What book was it? <|endoftext|>
What was the color? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, when is your birthday? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I know that can be very hard when you're not expecting much. <|endoftext|>
i agree with you <|endoftext|>
I get that, but i'm sure you have a lot of simpler stories to tell. <|endoftext|>
OH no! I love swimming but I am a little afraid of being stared at in public places. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it was embarrassing for you, but it's the truth. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. Maybe he's jealous. <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing, I bet she feels better when she gets done to rest. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. What an amazing man. <|endoftext|>
grandpa clocks? my grandma had one that would tell time if you pressed the back and forth <|endoftext|>
Did he fix it or just leave it sitting there? <|endoftext|>
That's the best kind, an honest friend in time of need. <|endoftext|>
im sorry, that sounds terrible <|endoftext|>
That's funny. You probably need to go to the bathroom more. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! It's good to help the animals and to show my appreciation for their care! <|endoftext|>
That is so true! I live in a city and a country house and I have a big enough backyard that I can take our shed in and we have our bear and our cat. We even have our king parrot :) <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! We are so happy about that! We have a parrot from an older bird <|endoftext|>
That's so cute! I had a parrot named Peppa. She was so sweet and cuddly! <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's the worst. How did you find out? <|endoftext|>
No problem, honesty is a great thing. I am glad you are being comfortable with the situation. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's great that you were able to help him quit! Sounds like you really believe in him. <|endoftext|>
Oh man. I bet that was annoying. I'm glad you're ok! <|endoftext|>
I completely understand. Daughters are so smart and curious. <|endoftext|>
It happens. I think it's in our blood. Just let them make their own decisions. <|endoftext|>
What sounds like a lot of cool stuff <|endoftext|>
Those are both great games, I have not played them in a while. I hope you have a great night! <|endoftext|>
that's horrible, did you try to find another job? <|endoftext|>
I can only imagine <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. How did you find the courage to do that? <|endoftext|>
im sorry, i know that feeling but it will pass in time, i wish you the best <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun! What kind of boat? <|endoftext|>
I would be so scared to ride one of those in those conditions. I can't imagine how expensive. I hope you are able to find a ride similar to yours that doesn't have that issue. <|endoftext|>
Bowie tubing sounds fun! I have never been tubing. Maybe you should do a benefit for your favorite charity. <|endoftext|>
I know but I'm sure it'll be exciting to catch up then. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I understand that. Sometimes it's hard to know where friendships will be placed in the future, but I think LoaningMusic to friends is a good idea. <|endoftext|>
That's very kind of you. I'm glad you at least gave her that back. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! Were you worried someone might steal your dog? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. :( I hope you can find something that can help you and get you through this tough time. <|endoftext|>
skateboarder kids are so fun <|endoftext|>
I totally understand. It's a profession that requires a certain amount of courage. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's a bummer. What did you guys do? <|endoftext|>
It's so nice to hear! Kids grow so fast. That's so true. <|endoftext|>
What a jerk! I feel sorry for you. <|endoftext|>
I guess so, you will never know until you try. Good luck! <|endoftext|>
Did you get caught? <|endoftext|>
That is really gross. Did you ask him why he did that? <|endoftext|>
My parents have both had MS, and both of them struggled with the difficulty of the alcohol. My father is a social worker, and my mother is an interior designer. I learned early on that you don't want to drive yourself crazy trying to find the best solution for people with MS. <|endoftext|>
I prefer those kind of remedies <|endoftext|>
That's cool! What kind of car? <|endoftext|>
Thats sounds like fun! I love my new Ruger 10/22! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a bummer! Did you file a police report? <|endoftext|>
lol. That's sad. I have no car either. I'm happy you at least have some form of transportation <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet of you! I'm always so nervous to bring someone along for help! It can be scary when you don't know what to do! <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry. That's so sad. <|endoftext|>
He must be adorable. I didn't get to take him in until 3rd grade. <|endoftext|>
How interesting. You should try to find the girl and get her to meet you. <|endoftext|>
Wow that sounds amazing, hope you all have a great time! <|endoftext|>
That's nice, what's the first commandment? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that is nostalgic. How old are they now? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a tough setup. Are they both loving it so far? <|endoftext|>
Oh my god! I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened? <|endoftext|>
sounds a bit scary <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness, i can eat food all day long! <|endoftext|>
I don't know about you, but I don't need an armageddon waiting for me when I can just get out of the way. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Will this be resolved? <|endoftext|>
That's so bad! Custody should be returned to the mother. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Are you excited? <|endoftext|>
You should feel good about tomorrow. <|endoftext|>
Wow! Are you excited? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that would help. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. Is she nervous about going to school? <|endoftext|>
That is sweet, I am sure that makes you feel better. <|endoftext|>
thats nice of you, did you enjoy the experience? <|endoftext|>
Oh dear. Did something bad happen? <|endoftext|>
Aw, poor thing, I hope he gets better! <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry. That is so hard. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sweet! What's his name? <|endoftext|>
Awww I feel for you! My mom used to have a cat she slept with my brother's dog as well. It's sad when family turns on that way. <|endoftext|>
Cello is a very complicated instrument. Did you practice a lot? <|endoftext|>
wow thats a long time. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's a terrible thing to witness. Were the people you were with anything abusive? <|endoftext|>
It happens. Have to be careful sometimes. <|endoftext|>
That is not a good decision. I hope you find a new partner. <|endoftext|>
That is not good. Did you find him a new job? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's awful! I hope you can work it out with him. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's not a job for the faint of heart! I think you should tell him that if he's going to keep his promise! <|endoftext|>
oh man that is a bummer! Im sorry to hear that! Will you get it fixed? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you had to go through that. Hopefully you were able to get it all taken care of though. <|endoftext|>
That was nice of you. I bet he did a good job. <|endoftext|>
Awwww. My kids are totes amazing when they are little. <|endoftext|>
5 <|endoftext|>
Wow that sounds fishy. What do you think killed the fish? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow I could not sleep last night thinking about it. Kill me now! <|endoftext|>
I would be too! I don't like the sport of soccer myself, but I am sure you will be nervous. I mean, you are playing a game, right? <|endoftext|>
fine, go ahead <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's awful. I rented a roomate's room and my dog bit my mom in the night in the morning. I thought it was a trick. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! That's terrifying! Are you feeling better now? <|endoftext|>
That is a great friend. I like to bet on football games too. <|endoftext|>
He has to change if he's losing that much! I'm sure you made your money back. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? Why is that? <|endoftext|>
That's all you can do I think. Hopefully marriage is a lot easier after this as opposed to after you both school each other. Glad you get it done! <|endoftext|>
were you afraid? <|endoftext|>
I can't even imagine the pain you went through when you had that happen. <|endoftext|>
It's a thought process many of us have had. Maybe you should borrow one from a friend instead. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's okay. There's plenty of other fish in the sea! <|endoftext|>
that is so awesome! it's a big accomplishment to be so young. are you doing well in life? <|endoftext|>
That is true, it must be hard when you have a pet that is faithful and obedient and loyal like a dog <|endoftext|>
ooh, that is awful. i luckily never had any damage <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is not ok you should make sure that they don't do that again. <|endoftext|>
Aw sorry to hear that. I love animals! What kind of bunny did you get? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I wish you rest. <|endoftext|>
thats awesome, are you planning a reunion this weekend? <|endoftext|>
Me too! Do you have a day job? <|endoftext|>
i love the zoo, i also went to one but it was really crowded and the people there were mean to the animals <|endoftext|>
It is so creepy. I would hate to have to deal with that every day. <|endoftext|>
Washington, D.C. is a completely different planet than where I live. I bet you were nervous about the whole "free" thing. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
I haven't heard much about social security lately. I hope you get involved and make a change for the better! <|endoftext|>
thats cool <|endoftext|>
Well maybe you'll get the chance to do that. I hope it's something you really enjoy. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That is mean! How did you deal with it? Was he a good student? <|endoftext|>
Wow. What a wacko! I would never do that to a student! <|endoftext|>
That's great! What do you do? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so exciting! I wish I could go to a forester to model my own house! <|endoftext|>
Yeah. It's always great when a friend wins over a rival, but that's how it works. <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome, I've never been there <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool, what kind of sword was it <|endoftext|>
I bet it was! I hate when people talk over me in class. I always feel like I'm being drowned out. <|endoftext|>
Is there a particular reason you're doing that? <|endoftext|>
I like to be prepared for any situation. <|endoftext|>
They didn't even leave a note! I don't understand how they don't want the car on the road. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you are okay. That's a pretty terrifying thing to experience. <|endoftext|>
What a joy! I bet you were so proud of her. <|endoftext|>
I love surprises like that! What kind of surprise was it? <|endoftext|>
What did he buy? <|endoftext|>
I bet he will, you have been a very good friend! <|endoftext|>
That's absolutely horrible. How did that happen? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you were upset. I have had to deal with things like that in my family. <|endoftext|>
I hope it's good news! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure once you hear back you can't wait to hear. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, do you have any idea what you could have done? <|endoftext|>
I hope you get it <|endoftext|>
That sounds really disgusting. <|endoftext|>
oh yea i can imagine <|endoftext|>
Where are you moving to? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's exciting! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I read a lot in the library, especially if I had time for it. <|endoftext|>
Well you can always try to get a promotion next time! <|endoftext|>
What kind of dog was it? <|endoftext|>
She was a big dog in the past. She's had a lot of bad ones in her lifetime. Always a shame when you have to take in a dog who isn't what you would consider to be a good dog. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Congratulations! I'm sure you deserve it. <|endoftext|>
That's great. You can get one any day now if you work hard. <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I'm sure you'll do great! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you will! For someone so highly placed, it's always a great feeling to get promoted. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. What happened to it? <|endoftext|>
oh no, is he okay <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear that. Good for you, hard work pays off. <|endoftext|>
Oh, you're not afraid of the dark, my friend? Fear no more! Darkness is just a thing of the past. Your job is to sell stuff, not scare people away with your fear! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! One day I hope to be able to do something like that. What was the problem you were trying to solve? <|endoftext|>
That's great news. What kind of job? <|endoftext|>
Wow! Statistics aren't very smart. <|endoftext|>
That's very sad, I'm sorry to hear that. How did it feel when you had to part ways? <|endoftext|>
I hope you can find a great new job soon! <|endoftext|>
That's so refreshing in a time of year when so many people seem to be getting rid of everything. Good for you. <|endoftext|>
I agree. Maybe you should try something new again! <|endoftext|>
I understand. The weather will dictate whether or not you should get out the umbrella. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's been raining a lot here lately. We should look to get some shade in. <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness that is horrible! i am so sorry <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry that happened to you! <|endoftext|>
Is that your gear that you usually get when preparing for a disaster? <|endoftext|>
That's a nice place to live, sounds like a nice place to live, doesn't seem like much of anything. I'm glad you're enjoying your life here. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of her! <|endoftext|>
She will keep on giving because there is no other person like her. <|endoftext|>
That's gluten free, that's amazing you are gluten free! I'm always curious as to what the heck you do that for a living <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I'm glad you have some medicine with you to help with that. <|endoftext|>
That sounds delicious! I think we all know diet coles is bad for you... <|endoftext|>
That's good they were just fine. It's a good job and you should be proud of them. <|endoftext|>
teens are so sweet and caring <|endoftext|>
I would like to do that but I am not sure purging is healthy for you <|endoftext|>
They must have been delicious! I hope you feel better about yourself. <|endoftext|>
That sounds great. I'm glad you get to treat her like your wife. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. Well you live and thou live. I say live long and prosper. <|endoftext|>
That is pretty nice huh? I am glad you are happy about that! <|endoftext|>
I hope he does too! I would be so nervous! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he has a plan B for getting your attention. <|endoftext|>
You must feel for her! Her loss is your gain. If she is drowning in debt, there is no way I'm going to let her keep spinning up those business debts. She sounds like a wonderful person. <|endoftext|>
That's a great idea! I wish you the best of luck in your endeavor! <|endoftext|>
That would make life so much easier. Do you know your neighbor that well? <|endoftext|>
Sweet. I have always wanted a Subaru. <|endoftext|>
I hope you can get it all done this month! <|endoftext|>
That's sounds like a really good plan. I hope it works out for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry! Sometimes we're taught that taking a diaper is shameful and shameful to do. I'm positive she'll learn soon enough! <|endoftext|>
Oh, so it was your sister who was the problem! I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That is so nice of you. What kind of toy? <|endoftext|>
He'll have so much fun! You'll have a lot of new friends and you'll also have some old ones. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! I'm sure you will enjoy it! Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
I am happy for you, I hope you have a great time and are able to go above and beyond! <|endoftext|>
Oh, how sweet. I hope he was alright and everything was ok- <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! I hope he is okay! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I think we all have our demons. <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful. I hope you feel more confident in the future. <|endoftext|>
Oh really? Thats not good for you <|endoftext|>
I will take that over a chocolate chaser, but still. That is pretty good. <|endoftext|>
awww, that's so sweet. were you able to hold back the tears? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's so sweet. <|endoftext|>
That is nice of you. How did you feel when she said she would help? <|endoftext|>
I bet you're a great dad! Sounds like you have a lot of passion for the game. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's horrible. What happened? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry you had to go through that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's terrible. What has she been diagnosed with? <|endoftext|>
I hope she makes a full recovery. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! I love pets! What kind of cat do you have? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a good night to me. I love cats <|endoftext|>
Nice, do you think you got it? <|endoftext|>
Just take it one day at a time. If you really want to know, then I would encourage you to find someone that communicates with you and be honest with them. If they love you, then they will be happy to hear about it. <|endoftext|>
That sounds really nice. Did you enjoy yourself and get to decompress a bit? <|endoftext|>
I imagine that you have a pool and beach house where you could go. I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is a no go area on Grounds Out. <|endoftext|>
I hope they at least cleaned it up for you. <|endoftext|>
Did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
That's good! I'm sure she'll be a lot happier here. <|endoftext|>
That's a really good thing. Not having work is a lot of extra help. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Disability is very tough. I was hoping for a better deal too. <|endoftext|>
That's really interesting! What did you and the therapist have in common? <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. It can be annoying though. <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful! It is wonderful to have them learning in your class <|endoftext|>
It happens more often then you think. I can't stand silence any longer! <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that sucks. Where did you guys fly in? <|endoftext|>
The internet is a great thing it opens up so much choice. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine how you felt. What did you end up buying? <|endoftext|>
That is annoying. I wonder if they had any policies about this. <|endoftext|>
Oh, how was it? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Are you doing better now? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like great fun! It's always great to have new friends! <|endoftext|>
If you're in the US, make sure you get a work visa for it. <|endoftext|>
Thats great. Did you enjoy the time? <|endoftext|>
i get where you are, i wish all the missing people luck and send you all the best news <|endoftext|>
I don't follow. I made a facebook event for us to meet up and I just found out about this and made a Go Fund Me page. I hope we can work something out! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I've been there! Did she say how much she spent? I'm sure she felt bad, but it happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you have to deal with that. I am sure she will come clean eventually. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow. That's awful. What did she do? <|endoftext|>
lol. I am sorry. I guess a lot of people don't realize how bad a lot of these animals keep. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad, women should be grateful for the things that men do for us <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Family is important <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you have to deal with that. <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about being so selfless? <|endoftext|>
You should be more careful next time. <|endoftext|>
I hope the results are good and the doctor had no idea anything was wrong. <|endoftext|>
I am glad it was safely apprehended <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's so sad. How old is he? <|endoftext|>
That really sucks. I hope you guys are able to work it out and be happy together in time. <|endoftext|>
That is very nice of you. I bet they are having a ball. <|endoftext|>
I went to college for a few years, but I don't play any sports. <|endoftext|>
That is nice. I love fishing. Do you go fishing a lot? <|endoftext|>
I have never even heard of stink bait <|endoftext|>
Good for you! I love playing dominos <|endoftext|>
Breweries are fun to visit as well! <|endoftext|>
Why are you nervous about it <|endoftext|>
That is nerve wracking, how long does it take? <|endoftext|>
Well Happy Birthday. I do hope you get it. What was the gift? <|endoftext|>
I hope you get a good one! What kind of camera do you have? <|endoftext|>
That sounds horrible. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
You should go to the pool or try and play video games! <|endoftext|>
That sounds wonderful! I love to spend time out in the country. I have a collection I lovish known as the "Tent Pouples." We've got a bunch of bug spray, a couple of quarts of bug spray soup, and a couple of liters of bug spray yogurt. Do you love the outdoors? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you are prepared! <|endoftext|>
what did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's funny. The printer should have been calibrated already since it's noise is so annoying. <|endoftext|>
Do you live in an apartment or a house? <|endoftext|>
It really is! I hate streets and traffic <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's funny. I think the guilt and fear was too much for some people. <|endoftext|>
I bet you were! Did the interview end up going well? <|endoftext|>
I could see that being a positive thing. <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing, because then you don't have to eat so much! <|endoftext|>
I feel you. My favorite is the brownies ones. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that is nostalgic. How does that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
That's so cute! I want one of those! <|endoftext|>
How fun! What kind of games do you teach her? <|endoftext|>
I played that a lot as a kid. Then I got into racing games. Now I play Minecraft and asphalt racing are my favorites. <|endoftext|>
I hate Dean's onions. They are gross. <|endoftext|>
I may just have to pick some up myself! I've always wanted a Lexus. <|endoftext|>
Congrats! That's great! I hope you get it! <|endoftext|>
That's great. Good luck. <|endoftext|>
I hope you get it! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure that's a relief, but sometimes it's nice to relax like that. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. I bet you're really passionate about that. <|endoftext|>
That is so horrible. Did you know the people who ran that farm? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you have to deal with that. I hope you get those people arrested and put in cages. <|endoftext|>
You were there as a kid? <|endoftext|>
You'll never know until you try, but if you're a die-hard fan, it might make you rethink the value of the professional level. <|endoftext|>
I get that, I hate school days, especially when it's rush hour. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine it's been a lot of fun, and you're grateful for the quiet but realize how lucky you are not having them around. <|endoftext|>
That's great you have grandchildren! You will miss them when they grow up! <|endoftext|>
Oh, no that is gross. The smell is also gross. <|endoftext|>
Yeah they don't just walk around and look silly in my house. I always try to make it fun for them <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of people for one thing. <|endoftext|>
I totally know the feeling. I rescue and care for many animals and have many more friends that are good friends too. I hope you feel better soon. <|endoftext|>
That is a good thing. I know it is hard to find good forever homes for some animals. <|endoftext|>
It is insane that people still pay bail for these people in many states! Jail is the real death sentence! <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's so nice of him, coach, you must really enjoy having your kids coach <|endoftext|>
What a great way to start the year, such a positive start! <|endoftext|>
I hope they had a good time! <|endoftext|>
Lol! That's so sweet. I wish I had a boyfriend like you. <|endoftext|>
They're in their early twenties. I've got a bunch of old black & white movies laying around from when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
that's terrible are you going to stay at home? and what will happen if you don't? <|endoftext|>
I understand. It will be worse next time. Maybe you should try one of those distraction apps. <|endoftext|>
That husky is pretty sweet. Did you try recapturing it? <|endoftext|>
That is scary! I bet you didn't enjoy it as much as you'd think! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, how old was she? <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that is so sad. Is she in a better place now? <|endoftext|>
That's great she's just getting her hands on better technology! I think kids these days are so preoccupied with technology that they don't often notice when an adult is using it to get them things they don't want or need. <|endoftext|>
i agree. Kids grow up so fast. It's nice to have memories of them. <|endoftext|>
Well, that is terrible. Is she able to pay the band fee yet? <|endoftext|>
Yeah that's happened to me before. It's even worse when it's raining! <|endoftext|>
That's great. Sometimes things are more expensive to get right the first time. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's always nice to have a good friend in a difficult situation. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's weird. I recently moved and I don't really have any pets either. <|endoftext|>
Why did you and not someone else? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. I hope the charge is returned. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! I hate when that happens. What movie was it? <|endoftext|>
That sounds really exciting! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I would be too. Did he give you a reason why he forgot to turn in? <|endoftext|>
I hope he eventually gets better <|endoftext|>
You must really like working from home, do you find it easier than working from work? <|endoftext|>
That's funny, kids love things that are merchandise, like video games. <|endoftext|>
Do you have any other butterflies? <|endoftext|>
It's a man's world, isn't it. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no I hope you didn't get any nasty stools. Worms are the worst. <|endoftext|>
You should try Ben and Jerry's. They have an apple that's like a fruit upside down. <|endoftext|>
What happened next? <|endoftext|>
Did you try to talk to her? <|endoftext|>
What breed is it? <|endoftext|>
I love dogs! I am going to have a dog in due time. She will be a part of your family. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's okay! Everyone does it. We're just not proud of it. <|endoftext|>
It's okay to be thankful for the things you have. I wish you the best of luck in the future. <|endoftext|>
I hate snakes! I wish I had a pet! They are gross! <|endoftext|>
Yeah but you cant help but see it and try to forget it. Life isfull of moments like that <|endoftext|>
I am sure it will be fine <|endoftext|>
Awesome! What kind of bonus? <|endoftext|>
oh thats cool <|endoftext|>
That sucks. I'm sorry. Maybe you can find a different friend to hang with? <|endoftext|>
I think you will have a great time <|endoftext|>
What was the photo of? <|endoftext|>
That's an awesome name! I'm glad it worked out well for you! <|endoftext|>
How could your dog be able to eat that? I assume that when it comes to diapers it's all or nothing. <|endoftext|>
Hahaha, yeah I wouldn't either. That is nasty. <|endoftext|>
Did you try to talk to him? <|endoftext|>
That's a shame. What keeps you awake at night? <|endoftext|>
Awesome, when is the interview scheduled for? <|endoftext|>
Just be yourself. Don't let anyone mess with you. <|endoftext|>
That's always tough, was it for work? <|endoftext|>
I remember when that happened. I was in a shop pressing the buttons when the car just started skidding right into the ditch. I quickly got out of the car and went to the driver's side door. I yelled at the guy and tried to calm him down. He was having technical difficulties and probably lost control of the car, I think. I'm glad you were able to get out of the way and into the house. Skirting more cars is never a good thing, though. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Did he actually win any money? <|endoftext|>
Take your time and enjoy the day! <|endoftext|>
Oh my. Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
oh my god, i would've been so scared, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's sad. I'm sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I remember how happy he could make you when you were little. I know the feeling now. <|endoftext|>
oh that's cool, was he able to sing well? <|endoftext|>
Oh I see. Well that's a good sign. It's a shame that people can't just be social when they're drunk. <|endoftext|>
congratulations! You did well. What grade did you get? <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear you did well <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what song is it? <|endoftext|>
Does she know it's you? <|endoftext|>
All the best for your future and your role aswell! <|endoftext|>
I am studying social work. I have always wanted to work in social work. <|endoftext|>
oh no that is terrible, how did they react? <|endoftext|>
That's okay. I think a lot of people don't realize how important a good haircut is. <|endoftext|>
What do you plan to do with the car? <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry. That's not a good look. <|endoftext|>
Are you going to college for a year? <|endoftext|>
I did Graphic Design when I was younger. I hope I can find a job that utilizes my skills! <|endoftext|>
oh i see, did he do a good job in the past? <|endoftext|>
That's great news. You both should be grateful for each other's help. <|endoftext|>
That is a real bummer. Maybe she can find something at a garage sale? <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. School is always a tough time <|endoftext|>
What do you suggest? <|endoftext|>
It is good to have a family to lean on. I hope your dad is as understanding as you are. <|endoftext|>
That really sucks. Are you able to go to the movies and such? <|endoftext|>
That's always a good thing <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that is so sad. Have you tried to console him? <|endoftext|>
Well that's what kids do, they do get tired of it! Maybe you should leave him be? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a little irritating, isn't it? I can't stand waiting for things to end! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a blessing. Mothers do that all the time, I'm sure. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. Do you have any fond memories of her? <|endoftext|>
She will always love you over what you think or say <|endoftext|>
I am glad you have time to spend with her. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's the best way to go about it. I'm sure it will be nice when they're grown up and can fly themselves. <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. I think you should tell them but not how or why. They should understand that you don't want them to keep secrets. <|endoftext|>
Wow! Did the doctor give a reason for the emergency C-section? Ultrasounds are usually the first thing people think of when they think of Cesarean. Ultrasound is usually the last thing people think of when they think of Cesarean. Ultrasound is usually the last thing people think of when they think of Cesarean. <|endoftext|>
Three years is a long time to be scared. I'm glad it turned out fine. <|endoftext|>
Wow that's amazing! I don't know if I could ever play Grim Dawn. <|endoftext|>
Holy smokes! DN every service you can get your hands on. I'm playing World of Warcraft, keep up the good work! <|endoftext|>
That's a lovely room. What's wrong? <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow, that is pretty gross! I hope you took her outside and sprayed her with water. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you weren't dehydrated as well! <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I'm glad you didn't have much to drink! That can get really bad. <|endoftext|>
oh no, that's a terrible feeling. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations on her education! What is she studying? <|endoftext|>
I am sure she will be better off without you. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's horrible. I hope you are getting better! <|endoftext|>
MS is horrible! I am so sorry! I hope you are okay! <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry! I know how you feel, losing a child is a huge deal. I hope you're holding on to her like a glove. <|endoftext|>
Yeah but maybe she was scared to tell you. <|endoftext|>
Is she ok? <|endoftext|>
I hope you feel better soon. <|endoftext|>
What kind of test <|endoftext|>
That's so nice! Tonight will be a good night to relax! <|endoftext|>
That's always fun to hear old favorites. Was the song you were listening to? <|endoftext|>
I used to love watching old movies. Now I am much more careful when I watch them. <|endoftext|>
That's sad. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine. I'm glad you found comfort in your grief. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I'm so sorry. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great time. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so good! <|endoftext|>
I can imagine. But you did great! <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. You want to be able to trust people at all costs. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I wish I could find a way to stop too. Is there one on the market? <|endoftext|>
I understand that. But you also need to realize that once you give in to the temptation, it's almost over. So you won't repeat it! <|endoftext|>
It's nerve wracking, isn't it. Just wait patiently and they will come around. <|endoftext|>
Well keep your head up and it won't be such a hard wait <|endoftext|>
Aww! That's infuriating! What did you find in there? <|endoftext|>
Well, sometimes teenagers can get so wound up about things, it's best to let them have their little quirks. <|endoftext|>
I love pie! What did you eat? <|endoftext|>
Oh I see, good luck with that. I hope it works for you! <|endoftext|>
oh yea im sure you were embarassed. was he a good guy? <|endoftext|>
That's ok. I'm sure she will forgive you <|endoftext|>
That's not good! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's good. I might have to look at that. <|endoftext|>
I bet! I remember those day so vividly. How old are they now? <|endoftext|>
Maybe try gambling? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did someone make you aware that you were about to miss her? <|endoftext|>
I would have forgot I had left a message on my wife's answering machine. lol <|endoftext|>
That must have been a very nostalgic time for you. <|endoftext|>
That will be fun! I've never been to far away from home. I hope you have fun! <|endoftext|>
I feel you! I've never flown before. I'm afraid of flying myself! <|endoftext|>
Was it really scary? <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sad. How did your grandpa take to losing a pet? <|endoftext|>
I can understand, but you will always have that special bond between you, I think <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
Now you should be more careful in the future. <|endoftext|>
I bet you were very happy to receive it. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. Is she still alive and well? <|endoftext|>
what that all means?? what that even means!! <|endoftext|>
It's great to hear that you worked so hard to get such a good result! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
I used to play football in middle school and high school, but we never really focused on the intensity level. <|endoftext|>
That sounds great, I hope you have a safe and fun time <|endoftext|>
I feel bad because I had been trying to diet. you should put the treats in a bag and take it with you when you go <|endoftext|>
Whats the secret to stopping cravings? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I know that can be a stressful situation. Did you have it relocated? <|endoftext|>
I'm positive it will. I wish you the best of luck! Sending positive vibes your way! <|endoftext|>
Was she okay with that? <|endoftext|>
That's a real good thing. Some people are less than stellar. <|endoftext|>
That is so awful. I am so glad that she is okay. That is a car that you have. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am sorry. <|endoftext|>
That's great that your sister came to help you. <|endoftext|>
I bet you were really happy! <|endoftext|>
That's always scary, the plane starts shaking and you have to quickly get off the plane. <|endoftext|>
That's good, how did she handle it? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that is not good, how did you end up meeting again? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure it was a big mistake. <|endoftext|>
Oh nice! I bet that was nice. Do you love your new home? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I bet it was a relief to have someone to chew on your dog again. <|endoftext|>
Ah I know that can be tiresome. I hope you can find something that is a little less of a workout in the morning. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, the ones you get after you take the curb test are usually the best. I can't wait to take the curb test myself. <|endoftext|>
Oh, how did it go? <|endoftext|>
Yikes, hopefully it does not happen again. <|endoftext|>
what did she do? <|endoftext|>
Tomatoes are a favorite of mine. They are so good <|endoftext|>
That's great that she's happy. Is she excited? <|endoftext|>
Oh you must be so excited! I hope you have fun! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's kind of cool... adopted or rescued? <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I have an dog that I have been trying to adopt for the past few years. I'm also trying to adopt a cat from the pet store today. It's so hard to give up on a pet <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did it start shaking? <|endoftext|>
That makes sense, you should do what you can to make space for them. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing. I'd imagine he's a good co-worker. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that! Hopefully he stops there! <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
That's exciting! I hope you get the job! <|endoftext|>
Yes that's a smart move! What charity is your favorite? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you have a good start and that you find all of the little ones! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. Did you guys do anything special? <|endoftext|>
Well, that's... interesting. I may want to find a travel agency that arranges trips for my family. We could do it <|endoftext|>
yes, we have a lot of feasts there. <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way! I love the thrill of going back to visit fam <|endoftext|>
I must have missed it. Are you proud of him? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Well i hope it wasnt too bad. <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about it? <|endoftext|>
I would be proud if I were you. I am just waiting for the Japanese version of the English Defence Test. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Are you still looking for the job? <|endoftext|>
I hope the interview goes well! <|endoftext|>
What movie was it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it is. I visited when I was a kid and had a blast. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, that is a tough position to be in <|endoftext|>
thats a good idea <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did the dog do something to upset your mood? <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! I'm happy you were able to meet her! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. Do you think you will be fired? <|endoftext|>
I understand the importance of a good schedule, but it's just as important to have the discipline to make sure it stays good. Are you able to continue to squeeze in extra days because it makes you feel good? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I have a bunch of candy chip cookies. <|endoftext|>
I'll bet. The grandmas are like the best when you visit them <|endoftext|>
oh no, that's awful <|endoftext|>
oh thats cool <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's the worst! Did you get into stocks again? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like you're in good shape. What's your fpr exercise routine? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that must have been frustrating. You should take him to the vet for a check up. <|endoftext|>
That's good, I'm glad he's doing better! <|endoftext|>
Nice! That's impressive! I tried Cantonese when I was in college and it was terrible. I tried it during summer vacation and it was so fun. I am terrible at some spoken languages. <|endoftext|>
I'm in the same boat! Most of the time I'm not working on anything concrete but when I do I'm not sure if I'm actually fulfilling my role as a co-worker or just fulfilling my personal time <|endoftext|>
That's new! Did you hurt yourself? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll get it soon. Keep at it! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like fun! What are you going to do on the beach? <|endoftext|>
That's a great plan. I hope you have fun. <|endoftext|>
oh yea me too. Its Sunday anyway <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you get it back? <|endoftext|>
what a bummer! I hope you can at least get something new. <|endoftext|>
That's a nice surprise. Do you get to wear it often? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you didn't get hurt! <|endoftext|>
I cannot wait to go to lunch with my boss and discuss life. Things we both seem to really care about. <|endoftext|>
What kind of taco did you get? <|endoftext|>
That's great. Is it a lot better than you were before? <|endoftext|>
ok carry on <|endoftext|>
That is a real bummer. I am sure you can come up with an alternative. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it will. You're very lucky! <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude to have! I'm sure it'll be ok. <|endoftext|>
Oh my! I love the feeling of nostalgia. That is so fun! Did it bring back any good memories? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun. I wish my kids were that talented. <|endoftext|>
Oh! I hope it isn't too expensive. <|endoftext|>
Yikes, that's terrible. What kind of cord was it? <|endoftext|>
oh i bet that would have been a nice day <|endoftext|>
Yeah, extra days off are always nice. I bet you were glad you didn't have to work. Hard work usually comes at a cost. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I bet you came out of bed and immediately started working. Genius. <|endoftext|>
You are excited about this new opportunity? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, good luck with your education! <|endoftext|>
That will be fun! How old is he? <|endoftext|>
That's funny, and I guess my favorite play is checkers. <|endoftext|>
Whats your credentials? <|endoftext|>
I would be so excited as well. jobs are really important <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's exciting! What a good opportunity to get ahead! <|endoftext|>
You definitely should be optimistic. I know how hard it can be to lose a pet. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened after? <|endoftext|>
That's sweet. What kind of treat did the clerk give you? <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
well be positive and everything will work out great in the end! <|endoftext|>
You're welcome. When you're ready, I'm always there. <|endoftext|>
That's awful. Have you gone to anyone for help? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you will be able to go in the future if you make a new friend <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting! What position does he play? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that's a pretty cool story. Glad you're having fun. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's terrible. Did you confront her about it? <|endoftext|>
I guess now you know why I love holidays so much! That's a sweet moment. <|endoftext|>
You should be. Thats great. <|endoftext|>
Wow, how nostalgic. I used to have a Nintendo 64 in my parents' basement when I was younger. <|endoftext|>
Nice, I used to have the xbox one and it was amazing! <|endoftext|>
Yes. I'm sorry. I hope it gets better. <|endoftext|>
That is kinda scary though. I'm sure it wasn't your fault. <|endoftext|>
it's normal to have issues that you don't want to talk about, its healthy to be willing to be open and honest about any issues that you have <|endoftext|>
Jebodiah, I am sure you are wonderful Uncle. I hope you have good news for me! I have herpes and you are so wonderful! <|endoftext|>
I believe in snake oil. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's so sad. What did they find? <|endoftext|>
That's good! I'm glad it was nothing serious. I'm still a little anxious about the whole situation. <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary! Did you get out ok? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I hope you didn't get into that accident. Did he go with you? <|endoftext|>
Sure, tell me about it. I haven't had that happen to me. <|endoftext|>
Well at least you know what to do now! Good job keeping your cool like that! <|endoftext|>
That is good, it is so important to be prepared. <|endoftext|>
If it is a good deal I might check it out! <|endoftext|>
That's awful. Was she in the water when it happened? <|endoftext|>
That's a good girl. I wish the best for you all. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that doesn't sound good. Are you all right? <|endoftext|>
I would have called and rescheduled but I was young and dumb and thought it was just fun. Hopefully things work out for you in the future! <|endoftext|>
He doesn't have to tweet? <|endoftext|>
What does he need to take it away from them? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful that you were able to enjoy so many memories. It's always good to think about the good old days! <|endoftext|>
I am glad you can always look back. <|endoftext|>
oh yea did you like it? <|endoftext|>
oh, sounds like a good flight, glad you're ok! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's pretty cool. What were you studying? <|endoftext|>
I bet that was fun, you must have really liked it there. <|endoftext|>
Glass eyes can be quite terrifying. Was she a big part of your family? <|endoftext|>
龍狼女食! <|endoftext|>
I love Halloween. Are you going yet? <|endoftext|>
Universal is killer, I love Universal theme parks. <|endoftext|>
That's good. You're lucky to be in that company. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that's terrible. Sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened? <|endoftext|>
oh congratulations, you are a nice person <|endoftext|>
That's great. What type of job did you get? <|endoftext|>
That's great, what kind of job did you get? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I hope you are ok? <|endoftext|>
I can't imagine how nerve racking that must have been. I'm glad you're okay. <|endoftext|>
how did it go? <|endoftext|>
That is so nice! <|endoftext|>
that is awesome! i hope you get it! <|endoftext|>
I liked dogs more because they are cute and they have a heart like humans do. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Was it a local problem or was it the fault of the plant? <|endoftext|>
haha i bet that is so annoying <|endoftext|>
That's interesting. What was the prize? <|endoftext|>
Oh that would be so cool! I bet you were so excited. <|endoftext|>
oh, that's nice, I bet that was a pleasant surprise. <|endoftext|>
Ouch! That's a scary thing to happen! Did they offer you any money in compensation? <|endoftext|>
aww man! I would be so excited and nervous! I hope you don't have to sell up and give up though! <|endoftext|>
oh no what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh cool! I've never played that game, but sounds like fun! <|endoftext|>
I know, it is hard to differentiate the two. <|endoftext|>
I agree that is a very serious issue. <|endoftext|>
I don't know Putin that well, but I do know he was a tsar at one point. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Was it old or young? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, maybe you can get another job? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
oh man that's the worst. i would have walked out <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! Were you able to finish the project? <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. I hate it when that happens and it's your fault! <|endoftext|>
oh no. that happened to the Packers last year <|endoftext|>
LOLANS! I love it <|endoftext|>
You should probably go get treated for that. <|endoftext|>
I hope it is not too expensive to fix. <|endoftext|>
I have never seen a magic show myself. Why do you think people are into it? <|endoftext|>
I used to do that all the time in elementary school. It was so fun. <|endoftext|>
Great, I hope you do well. <|endoftext|>
Are you going to U of I? <|endoftext|>
I bet you were proud of that. <|endoftext|>
That is good, did you end up having a few more? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's so nice! What did you all eat? <|endoftext|>
Aw, you guys sound like a good bunch, you should make sure to thank her regularly for the next few years! <|endoftext|>
That is a very interesting thing to go through. How old are your parents? <|endoftext|>
That's really sad, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can get a ride? <|endoftext|>
40000 dollars?? That's a lot of money. Glad she got them. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's so awesome of your aunt! She must really care! <|endoftext|>
Was there something you were doing to relax you? <|endoftext|>
It's nice to have a schedule sometimes. I hope you have fun in person <|endoftext|>
That can be so hard on the health. I hope it doesn't put you off? <|endoftext|>
Ouch, sounds like your mom is the tough one! I'm glad you have something to look forward to, keep your head up, etc. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, that's a great family you have. <|endoftext|>
I am very happy that you got to keep some! <|endoftext|>
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I know it must have been very difficult for you. <|endoftext|>
yeah all the time. i can barely talk to her <|endoftext|>
Oh man! That's really annoying! <|endoftext|>
That's quite the demolition, glad you're ok! <|endoftext|>
That's great! What kind of paper? <|endoftext|>
That's amazing. You should celebrate with a drink or a nice dinner out or something fun! <|endoftext|>
What was it? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun! I hope you guys have a lot of fun in Hawaii! <|endoftext|>
I love cats. I had no idea they were so hard to adopt. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Congratulations to both of you! <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! That's a tough decision. I hope you're able to find a new home for them! Do you have other pets? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well I'm sorry it didn't turn out as well as you hoped. <|endoftext|>
oh, that sounds fun, how did it go? <|endoftext|>
That's scary! I hope you get to say something to him so he knows you care about him. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! how did he react? <|endoftext|>
I probably would have had the same reaction, but I would have thanked him anyway. I don't know if he knows or not though, since he just smiles and wavers at you and goes back to work the next day. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I went into the nursing industry, and while it wasn't as lucrative, it was still a good investment. <|endoftext|>
It's so rewarding, isn't it? <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful! What did you do with it? <|endoftext|>
Do you have any favorite memory of your mom? <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I hate it when they do that! Did it turn out ok? <|endoftext|>
Yea but you go back again and again. <|endoftext|>
It's a difficult situation. How smoking affects your family should be a priority for you. I'm glad that he's being helped by his health care team. <|endoftext|>
That's very true. There's no choice though, you should tell them you want him to keep the job or you're leaving. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? How long have you been friends? <|endoftext|>
What are you studying to be? <|endoftext|>
thats terrible <|endoftext|>
I think people think they know someone when they are not. Are you sure? <|endoftext|>
I bet you were. I was in high school when I last saw a girlfriend. She left us, but we reconnected 2 years later. <|endoftext|>
I had a great time at college too. I hope you have time to decompress before you start school. <|endoftext|>
That's bittersweet. How long will you be friends? <|endoftext|>
You are lucky to have that to remind you <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I have a trick for that! Just use glue! <|endoftext|>
I would be worried about that too, lost keys are a nightmare. <|endoftext|>
That's odd. What made you curious? <|endoftext|>
I hope the next one is the one that works out for you! <|endoftext|>
I would have told her that you don't talk to your supervisor. <|endoftext|>
I am glad you have a supervisor who is a good friend. That is a recipe for success I think. <|endoftext|>
What was the exception? <|endoftext|>
That's a ton of money! Well I hope you guys can use that as a means to promote your band! <|endoftext|>
That's great! Congrats! I know how much it means to have achieved something like that. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I bet you are so proud. <|endoftext|>
Oh, so you're trusting them with your life and all of your belongings? <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow! That's something I can only imagine you had to be very desperate for. I'm so happy you got one! <|endoftext|>
oh thats sweet.. do you still keep the photo album <|endoftext|>
Do you still keep in touch with those days? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you got on the horse, you must have been very scared. <|endoftext|>
I am sure it was embarrassing but I am really glad that you have some rest now. <|endoftext|>
I have never been rollerblading, but if it is fun for you and your friends, then go for it! <|endoftext|>
Dang.. I would have cried for a couple of minutes. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that hard. I hope he's alright. It's good you have someone to talk to when you're away. <|endoftext|>
That's very true. Sometimes it can be hard to find that when you're used to group time. I'm happy you adapt and finding your own time. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you are feeling uncertain. You will get the job. <|endoftext|>
It will make you feel better. Maybe a glass of wine after dinner would be a good idea. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll be fine. There are lots of jobs out there now. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! Do you get to do any sports together? <|endoftext|>
oh no, that's terrible. is the dog ok? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you made it home. I am sure your dog is okay. <|endoftext|>
What was the purpose of the tattoo? <|endoftext|>
Blood makes my blood run cold! I hope your son is okay too <|endoftext|>
That's awesome to hear! It's good to love in your marriage. That makes it so much stronger. <|endoftext|>
Ah, I have never had Taco Bell, but I love them. I bet he was very happy about it! <|endoftext|>
That's really great to hear! <|endoftext|>
Congrats! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I agree, people often do not realize that music can bring people together. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great time. I loved my dad when he was alive and miss him dearly. <|endoftext|>
I love stuffed animals. That's one of my favorite pastimes. <|endoftext|>
It is nice to know that there is still people that care about our pets <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did he survive? <|endoftext|>
Aww man. I'm sorry. I hope you're able to cope. <|endoftext|>
That is such a bummer! <|endoftext|>
Yeah i would have been pretty furious as well <|endoftext|>
That's really tough, but I understand your grief. I have lost both of my parents, so I know the pain. I will pray for you and your family, and I hope everything is okay. <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful to hear. I hope it goes well for you. <|endoftext|>
Video games is my escape from work! <|endoftext|>
I have never seen that show. I think it was cancelled after one season. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I am really sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe ask for a promotion then? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That must have been embarrassing. Were you okay? <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! Are you okay? <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of you. Is he going to be okay? <|endoftext|>
I love noodle soup. What did you eat? <|endoftext|>
That's annoying. Do you think the manager noticed? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty neat. I'm glad you managed to relax so much after something like that. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's really impressive! I'm sure you've worked very hard. What's the meeting about? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds exciting! I hope you do well and make lots of money! <|endoftext|>
oh no! did you confront him about it? <|endoftext|>
I think that's part of being a man, to be able to be with a woman. It's hard when your partner isn't happy with you! <|endoftext|>
I know it sucks, but he doesn't have your best interests at heart. Look, you did this for a reason. <|endoftext|>
That's cool, sounds like a great relationship. I met a girl yesterday, we're very similar in age and everything, if anything <|endoftext|>
I sure hope you did well. Maybe you will get a better grade next semester. <|endoftext|>
best of luck! what do you plan on doing on your own? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I know how that feels. Did it die? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry that happened to you. Is your dog okay now? <|endoftext|>
That is lovely. I visited one recently. It was beautiful. <|endoftext|>
Ah, that makes sense. I take my daughter to see my parents as well. The kids are precious <|endoftext|>
That's amazing. I've never had the chance to try out a new cake, but I'm sure it will be a hit at your house! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like she is ahead of the game. <|endoftext|>
Your mother is a force to be reckoned with. <|endoftext|>
That's a great feeling to have. I know how you feel, it's just the truth. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine. What an exciting time that must have been! <|endoftext|>
thats awesome, what is he doing in an aerospace engineering? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that! My parents did the same way, and it was one of the most difficult things we did. <|endoftext|>
I bet you feel much better now. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling for sure. But it will be different when he starts working at the wheel! <|endoftext|>
That's amazing, what kind of aerospace does he want to study? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I bet that was nice and relaxing! The beach is always my favorite when I'm home alone! <|endoftext|>
Absolutely, and all the while you'll have time to enjoy your time in the country. I love the country too! <|endoftext|>
Oh, What a surprise. What is it you're bringing him next week? <|endoftext|>
Great! I bet he deserves it! That's so nice of you taking the initiative and making him happy! <|endoftext|>
That's great! What will you do while he's gone? <|endoftext|>
That is a long time but I bet you both enjoy each other's company. <|endoftext|>
Oh I remember that feeling too, I lived with my parents when I went to school <|endoftext|>
He will have time for you when you make him <|endoftext|>
That's great! Team Leaders are responsible for the entire team, so you are taking charge! That sounds like a great role to give your baby! Congrats! <|endoftext|>
Very true, hopefully in the future you can reward your hard work with reward. <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad she didn't take you out! Mine are almost all grown now and we ride bikes too! <|endoftext|>
I am sure with all the stress that goes with that, it is hard to think of the good times! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
What a bummer! What a great trip you had! You can't always go it alone! <|endoftext|>
If you can manage an awesome wedding, then PACK it up next time. I hate wedding dresses that are too short. <|endoftext|>
Wow! Did you tell your friend? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's too bad. I've been through that myself. I hope you find happiness together with her. <|endoftext|>
Did you get scared? <|endoftext|>
I hope so too! I love animals and I bet that experience changed your life forever. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's so sweet. You must have been so excited! <|endoftext|>
Yeah you can live vicariously through your friends too <|endoftext|>
Oh, no, what did you say to respond to that? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I was trying to be a bit more diplomatic and not say a word at all. I'm pleased to have found a new partner and hope for a long lasting one! <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that is a scary thing to wake up to dawn. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know that shadow can be a blessing in disguise. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's not something you normally hear about. I'm glad you didn't though, that's a really great thing to do. I can relate, I'm currently in a bit of a financial bind, as I don't have any savings either, so I'm really struggling right now. All I have is what my fiance has saved for me, and he's working hard to put food on the table too. <|endoftext|>
I see, there's plenty of good ones around. <|endoftext|>
i love birthdays like that! <|endoftext|>
That is really special. I am also expecting a boy, hopefully he has the same life as you do. <|endoftext|>
It can be hard to stay aligned sometimes. I know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
That is true. I was born with light skin and brown eyes and have always been looked down upon. <|endoftext|>
Wow, how exciting. What made you so nervous? <|endoftext|>
I hope it isn't too bad, are you going to buy a new one? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's so nice of you. I'm sure they're a very nice bunch. <|endoftext|>
It is wonderful to have their support. I wish you all the best! <|endoftext|>
Aw, I bet you were. I was also dreading the process. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
ha ha ha. You did great. You will do great next time. <|endoftext|>
Oh thats great! Did you get to meet the people in the cards? <|endoftext|>
I throw cards out all the time. It's just something I'm not good at. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful you have such a great Family! <|endoftext|>
Lol I hope it's nothing too bad! I don't know what my family looks like, lol. <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's a mild fall for sure. I'm glad you are okay. <|endoftext|>
It's alright. Do you trust your friend? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's the worst. I've seen that happen a bunch. <|endoftext|>
oh um.. what play? <|endoftext|>
Ah, well I am glad you came through that unscathed! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty awesome! I imagine with all the driving experience she'll have pretty good things coming up. <|endoftext|>
That's a nice surprise! She'll be a lot braver and better at holding a conversation about things like that! <|endoftext|>
That's great. Maybe it will pay off for her when she gets her license. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I do hope she gets a license soon! <|endoftext|>
That sounds frustrating. What are you going to do about it? <|endoftext|>
I will pray for you! <|endoftext|>
is it for a big money offer or for a vacation home? <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to keep in contact! <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I've also been through a lot of things. I don't like to let the past get the best of it. <|endoftext|>
I hope it works out for you! <|endoftext|>
That is great. I am an Aerospace Engineer so I know what you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
That is so great! I treasure every moment with them because it is so fulfilling to watch them grow and because it is so exciting to share them your love with them <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I have a job out too and my husband is worried about getting lost too. So he and I are going out to look for ourselves! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a really exciting time is coming up with a fun weekend plan around it. <|endoftext|>
Sorry about that. My condolences to your family. They must be so sad. <|endoftext|>
Oh, well I'm sure your mom is in a better place. At least you have your dad to lean on in times of need. I hope you're able to find peace at least. <|endoftext|>
Yup 96 is a very long life for a first world country. I guess it makes you appreciate every single day. I'm proud of you for being able to accomplish what you did! <|endoftext|>
That's so hard. I'm really sorry. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! What kind are you going to play? <|endoftext|>
That's fun, I've never played that game. <|endoftext|>
That's sad, I'm glad to hear your mother is there for you. <|endoftext|>
I think its even worse when you consider the ages. When you consider all the situations they are at and the amount of care that is taken of them <|endoftext|>
You are lucky! The weekend is the best! <|endoftext|>
It really does sound like a nightmare. <|endoftext|>
aww that's awesome, how long has it been since you have had a friend from across the continent? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. I wish I had some friends like you and Lucien. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! I love kittens and would be so happy for them to have no-collar life. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing. I love dogs, and this was definitely a keeper for me. <|endoftext|>
What baby bird? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. Do you feel guilty about it? <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a scary waiting game. Did you get to see? <|endoftext|>
That's great, it's always good to have things to look forward to over the summer. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry, that must be terrible. <|endoftext|>
Oh heck no! Maybe you can invite her again next time you guys get together? <|endoftext|>
Oh ok. Well at least you woke up with a good impression. <|endoftext|>
Yea! Have fun! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty terrible. Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
I would sit in a dark room. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I guess from a social standpoint it is worse, but I suppose you have to work and have to pay rent and such. I just don't understand how people can live like that. <|endoftext|>
Good. I would have been too. Did you get your money back? <|endoftext|>
Thats a good story. <|endoftext|>
I just went to a few brain games recently. Nice to know that there are still people who care <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful. Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! Harry Potter is my favorite author. I am sure you will have a great time. <|endoftext|>
I sure hope it does! I have a feeling it will! <|endoftext|>
I hope you do get in, you deserve it! <|endoftext|>
Oh, yes, the first one is always the best, but I understand the excitement. When will the second one be released? <|endoftext|>
Very cool, I too have a love for cooking. I was always the kids kid when it came to cooking <|endoftext|>
oh really? was the other person taller? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's embarrassing, but it happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
I bet you are proud of him <|endoftext|>
I hope he feels better! <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. How long have you two been tegether? <|endoftext|>
Do you have any dreams about her? <|endoftext|>
Aww! I bet you were mad! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it was a mistake that you made. How did it make you feel? <|endoftext|>
How did you find out that you weren't paying your rent? <|endoftext|>
That is great to hear! I'm sure he will enjoy being around you <|endoftext|>
Was it flat or did it go flat? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. Awareness is the best thing you can do for your kids. I hope they recognize it too. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, how long have you guys been friends? <|endoftext|>
I love trying to coax girlfriend's out. I bet that feels good! <|endoftext|>
Why did you steal things from them? <|endoftext|>
those are really fun to play with <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass away? <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear that! <|endoftext|>
I was fifteen. I think I was sick when I think of this. <|endoftext|>
Maybe not, but you know it's a new start, right? Maybe it is. I'm sure it is. <|endoftext|>
That is nice of you, cats are so cute <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's no good at all. Did you ever find them? <|endoftext|>
5 <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! How did it feel? <|endoftext|>
Was it hard to get them back? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, and that's the best way to make someone feel at ease. <|endoftext|>
Yuck! I don't think I would do that. And I wouldn't want to either! <|endoftext|>
thats awesome! <|endoftext|>
oh no, that's a terrible feeling, i am sorry you feel so guilty about it <|endoftext|>
oh sorry to hear that then <|endoftext|>
Yes, it is frustrating to have someone that tries to make you do things that you don't want to do. <|endoftext|>
If you ever feel like you're not good at something, just pick yourself up up and do better the next day. It'll make up for it. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, I've had both. Especially when you have to clean them up a lot. <|endoftext|>
I don't think anyone can argue with that! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I always get a bad feeling when that happens. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's normal to have dreams in the morning. Sometimes it's from memories. Have you thought about it? <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I sweat on my abs, so I recommend getting those sharpening done! You need to get those sharper blades in those areas, so you can shave those stubble hairs! <|endoftext|>
Yes, I hope you continue to improve! <|endoftext|>
Wow! That sounds like a lot of fun! I've never been able to afford a skydiving ticket, but I know how hard it can be to put your money where your mouth is! <|endoftext|>
That's my favorite thing to hear when I'm eating out. It's like you're having a meal that someone else prepared! <|endoftext|>
I am so glad to hear that! What makes you so happy about your life now? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. What album is it? <|endoftext|>
What are some of the possibilities? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. I don't know if I would be able to learn to swim or not. <|endoftext|>
That's very true. I wish I could go myself. <|endoftext|>
I bet it is. You seem really excited about it. <|endoftext|>
Yea being alone is good for some, but I would be sad and lonely. I hope you get that from your friends and family. <|endoftext|>
Im glad to hear it. <|endoftext|>
Over your fear of controlling things is over you. I used to be like that as well. <|endoftext|>
That is true <|endoftext|>
Wow I am so glad to hear that. You must have a fulfilling childhood! <|endoftext|>
Great! I wish you good luck with that. <|endoftext|>
That sounds nice! What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it will, it's hurricane season in Florida! <|endoftext|>
Wow. I am so sorry to hear that. Was it a new house? Did you rebuild it? <|endoftext|>
That's so scary. I'm glad you're okay now! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is a good thing that you were able to make it! <|endoftext|>
That's good. My daughter got her cat a few weeks ago - her first kitten! <|endoftext|>
Aww that's terrible! String ties are a death sentence, I bet. <|endoftext|>
Everything but the knife - I think. <|endoftext|>
I absolutely agree! Have you been practicing? <|endoftext|>
That's quite true! I am worried about you. Will you be ok? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. I don't like to take a break either. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just need a break from all that busyness. <|endoftext|>
What was the name of the popular kid? <|endoftext|>
Try and have fun and let others know if you need anything! <|endoftext|>
I've never done that, but I bet it felt good! Did you get a break on the pain? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you did good. Did you have to go again? <|endoftext|>
haha that's a smart move! good luck! <|endoftext|>
Where are you taking it, honey? I might have to take a trip up to my front door this weekend to get some fresh grass-fed beef. <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure what you mean? Scammy sounds bad. <|endoftext|>
I would never take them for money. They are just a front <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great that you have a daughter like that! Did she have trouble even trying to open it? <|endoftext|>
thats crazy! i hate when people can install things like that in their own homes! <|endoftext|>
I like oldies, but I'm more of a rock and roll fan. <|endoftext|>
Oh I got a high five for that! <|endoftext|>
Wow, you must have been excited and taken with glee by licensees like that. I bet you drove safe and happily. <|endoftext|>
I've never driven a car. I'm too scared of driving a car. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's terrible! Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
What a surprise. You might want to hide the card and not show it to anyone. <|endoftext|>
I agree, what do you miss most about selling? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it was. I'm glad that person had to learn their lesson. <|endoftext|>
Ohh thats not good, Did you tell him why did he have to go again? <|endoftext|>
that can be hard! I hope she gets better! <|endoftext|>
I've never heard the name "fake religious services" lol. <|endoftext|>
I agree. People are dumb, trust me on this one. <|endoftext|>
pricky. why are you nervous? <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have prepared so much. Maybe you can talk to the HR department about it. <|endoftext|>
Man that was so annoying! I hope you got it all cleaned up. <|endoftext|>
I agree. You should call your local police department and see what they can do. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. That must be sad. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sure you'll get good grades, just stay calm and collected! <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's when it happened to me. I had a nightmare about it. <|endoftext|>
ohh, that's bad. Did you tell the police? <|endoftext|>
That sounds cool. I would love to have one someday. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! You must be excited and full of joy! <|endoftext|>
I am so glad to hear you are prepared. I am guessing you must be one of the lucky ones then. <|endoftext|>
Me too, Christmas was an awesome time. <|endoftext|>
I always worry about squirrels <|endoftext|>
I would have freaked out. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you had to see that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad it wasn't a lot more damage. I know some people like to leave them with the restaurant. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! What did it look like? <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I love candy. It's like heaven in the moment. <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! I remember when my daughter was sick. I was so proud of her! <|endoftext|>
Defenitly, I hope she will let you know how it goes! My daughter forgot to turn the lights off in the house we share with her and she kept waking me up with her actions! <|endoftext|>
It's great that he found it and not one single brick! <|endoftext|>
Wow, you sure did that! But it must have been fun to watch him fill the huge pot up. <|endoftext|>
that is not good, are you planning to reschedule? <|endoftext|>
That is really frustrating. Maybe next month can be worked off as well! <|endoftext|>
That is a very good thing. I am glad you get to enjoy it as much as you do. <|endoftext|>
You're very lucky! <|endoftext|>
oh gross, did you try to kill it? <|endoftext|>
I live in the midwest so I know what common is. I've only seen one or two in my life. <|endoftext|>
Oh good luck! I bet you will do great! What is the subject? <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. You must be well prepared if you're studying so that's a good sign! <|endoftext|>
