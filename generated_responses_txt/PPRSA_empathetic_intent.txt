What happened?
That's really scary! Did they have insurance?
Sure. What happened?
I can! The worst thing happened was that he would not seat belt. I was sitting and it was obvious that he wasn't!
That's too bad. I hope things get better soon.
I hope it's not to hard for you to move on.
What concert?
That's awesome! What concert was it?
Oh, that's so sad! I'm sorry :( Was she a newborn at the time?
I hate to hear that! That's so sad to hear about how people didn't care.
That's a bad thing?
I'm sorry to hear that.  It must have hurt so bad.  Are you two still talking?
That is sad. I hope he can too!
I'm sorry to hear that. I know what that is like.
Oh man sounds really scary! I'm glad you're safe though!
Oh no! You want to be the police or fireman? lol...
That is awesome, my parents are about to get back to us too!!
That sounds awesome! I bet your going to have a lot of catching up to do!
What a jerk. Why July 4th? Why not 4 20th???
That sounds like a real problem
Wowza! What a bummer indeed. What'd you do in the other direction to get your $275?
I am sorry, that sounds terrible
Did he take it too far?
She probably realized it after the fact and you were just being cruel! I'm sorry.
Aww that's so sweet!
Aww, I'm sorry to hear that! Babies can be a lot of energy sinkers.
Why is that?
Have you thought about doing it locally?
That really irks me too. Why don't parents discipline their children. That would stop the problem in schools somehow.
That's so sad and I feel sorry that happened. I hope you talked to your friend and resolved to work with him to help keep his discipline.
Oh that's so gross! I think all bugs are gross but bees and scorpions I hate them
That's good. It's good to have people you know that are there for you no matter what
That's understandable, it can be quite shocking when someone turns their back on you
That must have made you feel so happy, congratulations on your children!
That is wonderful that you felt this way. You are blessed
Oh absolutely! That is why I love having a second job, because you never know when it will come, and you never know when you might have to use it. But I totally get you :) What was it, though?
I'm sorry you have to deal with that stress
What happened?
That's terrible. I am so sorry about her loss. I lost my mother last year.
That's pretty great! I'm a lot the same. intuition is so important!
That's awesome. Sometimes intuition can be so much more than we realize
That is so sweet!  What a great friend he must be.
That sounds wonderful.  You are so lucky to have such supportive friends!
I'm so sorry. You could always start to get into more relationships, try online dating, or find a hobby eventually.
I'm so sorry that you have to deal with that.  Do you have any advice?
I can definitely see where you're coming from. Mine are the same way! Except my oldest is an out of towner, and while she's gone, my 2 youngest have become more open and interesting and adventurous.
I remember that with my own kids. Except my daughter is 3 and they're 2 and 4 now. I think mine are 6 and 8
oh my lord, did you go to any?  I would never go after work
that is a good point, did you go earlier? maybe you had busy day
Wow that sounds very sad :( how did it end up?
That is a really cool experience. Did the kid grow up to become an interesting person?
That's a really great attitude. You sound like a great partner!
I honestly dont know. My mom was pretty stubborn at one point, so Im guessing she found it difficult also. I dont think i really understand it with my husband though.
What did you do
Oh I'm so sorry! I'm glad you weren't treated that bad though.
Oh man, I feel so sorry for your loss.  I can relate...I'm so sorry you had to go through that.  It's never good when a parent dies, but it's better if they're happy and at peace.
That's great! It's always nice to get a good example to work off!
I am also very lucky! I am a hard worker but I am not a great worker in general.
I just tell people I'm tired of the world and want to make it better for everyone and do what I think is right, but it can get kind of dark too. I don't know how to do it in my own life.
How many months is it now?
That's awesome - how's the baby?
Oh wow! I can only imagine! How far did you run?
Wow! That sounds like an amazing achievement! How far did you run?
Wow! That's an amazing feat! How far did you run?
I'm glad it was not you, that is very hurtful!
That is sad. I wonder if she was mistreated in some way. Maybe by you or your "side kick"?
Yes! That's a very real and real problem. I think it's really bad how little people know and how much they don't care about issues faced by children
I always try to imagine if I went to school to be a bully, instead of going to jail for it I instead focused on becoming a doctorate
That's terrible. I'm sure she really appreciated it. Did she say anything to you about it?
Aww, poor thing, I hope she made it. Cats take a toll on us.
That is so exciting!!  I have to admit.. I have not been to Disneyland in sooooo many years!
That's so fun!!!  I love Tucson!
Must have been exciting! How old was he and how long has it been since you have seen him?
Wow, that's really awesome that you spoke with him again! Was he excited?
That sounds great! organizing can be fun.  What are some of your favorite things to have in an organizehed house?
Yeah, we have a big family. Not new but baby crazy!
whys that
That's a really good idea. We could use the extra money we would make from emails to pay for our online bills!
I'm sorry to hear about that. Did everything get worked out, or is she still dealing with some issues?
That's not good. Did you end up calming the situation or did you just fight more?
That is sad. How old is he now?
Wow! How wonderful. It is good to have people around you that care about you.
I have felt that before as well
Thank you. That's encouraging
Sometimes you have to be prepared.
I can understand that
That is so mean!  What did you do?
That's nice. It's nice to know that there are good people out there that teach kids things
Do you exercise?
Yes, it is difficult to maintain a healthy diet every day because you never stop trying new foods and people.
Yes, kids grow so quickly!  Do you have pictures you could keep in mind for them when they're all young again?
No, they are in their twenties, but I still miss when they were babies!
It is such a beautiful feeling isn't it! How beautiful!
i bet it was a nice day for both of you
I can totally understand that. I have two kids, and it is hard to make household chores a chore for them.
Part-time jobs can be nice, especially when it's not as crazy as a 9-5 job with no benefits.  I hope you keep that balance
That's cool. What did you think of them?
Aww that's cute! That must have felt nostalgic!
That sounds really fun!  Where are you going?
That's going to be so relaxing! I wish we had a place like that.
Did she end up going anyway?
Oh no! Did she end up having a nice dinner?
I would be scared too! What did you guys do?
What was scary about that?
No. What happened?
Oh man that's a bummer! I bet she felt embarrassed!
What happened?
Oh no!  Was your co-worker a female?  That stuff freaks me out!
No, what concert was it?
Did you try telling them it was raining inside?
Did it smell?
Did you ask him or confront him about it?
That sounds wonderful. What an awesome husband!
That sounds wonderful.  What a thoughtful surprise!  Did he give you anything in return?
That's funny! Well they have to come out of their eggs at some point right?
Oh I am sure it was, was he a salesman?
No
I'm glad you made it out ok and I hope he didn't hurt you. But that sounds like an awful experience.
Yea, that isn't a good sign. Are you guys still friends?
That sounds like a terrible friend. I am truly sorry for your friend and hope he learns his lesson.
Oh no! That sounds so stressful! What did you have to do the next day?
Oh my gosh you had to throw away a lot of food?
Oh, well that's his problem, not yours! If you were in a committed relationship you'd want your piece to come from someone you like.
I'm so sorry, that sounds awful. I hope she can forgive you for it though.
Wow, that's incredibly sad! How did you two meet? Sounds like it must have taken a while!
hahaha, that is hilarious! Maybe she should have worn a diaper maybe? lol! Good story for when you become a parent!
That sounds wonderful! Where will you be going?
That sounds amazing! I have always wanted to live at the Gulf!
That's awesome to hear! I'm glad to hear that she was determined. You sound like an amazing parent!
Wow that's great, she has determined to do what she wants and be accepted by someone.
It is annoying especially in a shopping center parking lot. People need to be more considerate
Yeah that's not a good thing. Are carts included in the grocery store?
That's so sweet!  How far in the future did you have your son?
I am so excited for you!  I am sure that made your day.
That's so wonderful! Flow is so fun! I'm glad you love it! What do you do for a living?
I'm not familiar with that term, but I'm familiar with the idea!
I agree with you on all terms. Leaders know people will listen to them. It's the ability to communicate that matters.
leaders know people like this are exactly the same as they see on the news everyday. It's a sad fact and they know it benefits them and they don't care about anyone else
That is awesome. I love theshed
ha ha ha. that's funny. I'm from chicago and have always wanted to go to the shed. do you mean the chicago zoo?
I am happy mothers day is approaching!  Did something good happen?
That's great! It is amazing how moments like that give you so much and a warm sense of accomplishment!
I don't know. I'm still up in the night.
I'm not sure, I thought I was being evaluated but I guess it was nothing. I guess it's best not to think about it too much.
Not yet. I think I will though.
That's really awesome!  Congratulations to your family!  I'm sure they are excited, too.  What are you guys going to do when you're both old enough to drive?
That's really cool of her, I'm happy for you guys!
No, I am so bored.
Netflix is my guilty pleasure! I watch shows whenever I can. I am sure I will watch this tonight!
Is it a good movie?
That's great! Did they award your win?
wow thats awesome!! you deserved that money
I'm glad it got better for you!  I know how that is.
I know! I hate how rush hour traffic feels like, how does it not get any better
Grudges are always a bad thing.  What was the issue?
Yeah, I think that's how I felt too, although they're much scarier now for me. I hated that movie so much when I was young.
She must be so proud of her!  What do you think went into it?
That's wonderful!  It's nice when you have supportive friends like that.  I'm still pretty terrible in school myself.
Did you bananas get you brown bananas?
That's a relief! What are you going to do with the brown banana?
Oh how did that work out for you.  Did you find one.
Congratulations! I would love to have a puppy! What kind of puppy did you get?
That was really nice of them!
That is a great story!  It sounds like they really care about you!
That's great.  It feels so good to be independent and to not have shack normal responsibilty.
Congratulations on your future engagement!
That is really impressive for someone his age!  How does he treat his family?
Those things really matter sometimes. A surgeon who is only 32 is still very young and probably won't be a doctor for very long. I think the real question is, is he a good enough surgeon to make that kind of money?
Do you think they understand what you are trying to communicate?
That's awesome! What kind of doctor are you going to see?
Nothing really... just moved into this apartment by my self without any help.
You could but they don't seem to be very helpful.
Wow, that's nice. It sounds like your best friend is a good person.
Wow, that's quite a while. Glad you guys stuck to it.
That is a lot of space! My family would fight to the death to have just one cat. lol
Oh man! The 90s were the best! What do you miss the most about your time there?
Oh man! The 90's and the 90s were the best. Did you have a show that came on that you watched?
I love it nostalgic
I know what you mean! I was in high school, so anything that came on during that time really brought back memories of me and my friends.
I was a child in the 80's. I know that feel, I felt like a kid during the 80s! What was the show/musician?
I'm sorry you feel that way, I think it's pretty cool how our political discourse shapes our own personal values, and how our bullying works in that regard.
Yes! I always try to tell the kids that it's not right to bully other kids but it's wrong when a bully calls me a names. And I'm a teacher. So I had to tell the kids that!
I didn't get to see it but my sister loves the incredibles. I'll need to see to get to that one.
That's cool that you enjoyed it. What movie is it?
What are they taking from you?
That sucks.  You might be able to try distancing yourself from them.
Exactly! And it makes me so frustrated because it seems like they think their bosses will clean up after themselves.
I always keep my room a mess. Always. And I'm the kind of person who will yell at the elderly for no reason. It's weird.
That is a very sad time in your life.
Oh my gosh. That is so sad. How are you holding up?
That's cute. How old is Roxie?
That's really nice of you! Roxie is an awesome name!
Did you get one?
That was so awesome! You must have been so happy and relieved.
What a lovely person! I hope you two have a wonderful life together!
Yes! I had plans planned for my brother one year. It was a lot of fun
Yes I do have plans for my husband. He really is a good planner. We had plans for a beach weekend this year as well.
That sounds terrible!
Rainy days can be fun. Do you do any favors to keep yourself occupied?
How did that turn out
wow you must be very proud of yourself
I do. I have a cat. A big one! A very large cat. And also 12 dogs!
I have one cat and one dog! Love them. You're not kidding. Night owls can drive you crazy.
Congrats! You must be so happy and proud!
Congrats! It's such an amazing experience, isn't it.
I've been there! It is definitely an awful feeling leaving a loved one but it's part of life and you need both to do well. How did you handle the breakup?
I am so sorry. I have been through that too. It's just the worst when it feels like no one is ever gonna make it.
How young is he?
Wow. He's got great talent and drive!
Mhmm.. yeah it is difficult to let things like that bother you sometimes. I have lost a few good friends because of this necklace as well. Don't worry.
Haha, well that's okay, you can get those feelings heal with time. It was just a harmless little necklace.
I am sure you were proud of that and wanted to show her you care and that your congratulations were well received.
yes, it happens to me often. its an eerie feeling. like a time machine.
Yeah, I sometimes drive back through those times too. It is nice to get out though.
I'm so sorry to hear about your cat. Was it really lost, or was someone else really keeping him company?
That's so sad! I'm sorry for your loss.
I am so very sorry to hear that. It is always tough to lose someone.
Yeah I got hit pretty bad with the fleeb. He always tried to help me and was like my life depends on it and I need to take it!
I am sorry to hear that.
Oh wow that's awful! Sushi is great though.
What! How could they do that to you??
What!? That is so cruel! I am glad your friend was nice enough to bring you a drink afterwards to celebrate!
That's too bad to here. Why did it happen?
I'm sorry.  Do you know if there are any other good options?
Well its a good idea at least
It's a good idea. You will enjoy it a lot.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things work out for the best!
I am sorry to hear about that! I hope things work out for you!
That sounds hopeful! Has she been trying out for a few years?
That's good! She has to be interested in you at some point! It's always better to get out there.
I dont have a birthday but I have a lot of great times at parties and what not
That sounds amazing!  I am just over the hill ineed to drink tequila but my family always makes me a bottle.
What do you mean by 5?
Why did she bring it up
Oh my gosh! Are you ok?
Oh, that is scary! I am glad you are ok!
Yes, it is wonderful.
I do not like warm fronts.
That's what we called mom for. Good that you're there for her.
That is so nice of her! You guys sound like a pair of parents you could spend the rest of your life with.
Nothing went wrong I was just really embarassed, especially since it was my job to interview for.
What happened? I'm scared to death of course.
That's awesome, it's lovely to have help from your mother! What kind of a good mother you must have.
I do love my mom. What kind of a car is it?
Oh no! Have you talked to her and let her know how you feel?
I hope she comes back okay!  I'm so sorry you feel sad about it.  Are you traveling to see her?
I am a stay at home mom and work from home. My son is going to be in a high demand so it's going to be really hard to manage
I'm self-employed with my own car and hired help to assist. Sometimes it can be a pain, but it's totally managable if needed
I bet you'll be fine
I'm sure that with enough study and determination, you can go far! What do you like to do in the field?
What movies do you watch?
Have you watched any recently? I watched the original The Ring and the bite ofman. both were very terrifying
I like romantic movies. I don't know I am too introverted.
I really like horror and action movies the best. I don't know what it it it but the Grudge, especially the scene with the girl and her family.
You shouldn't feel bad. He is a role model.
There is no better man then we can all agree on Donald Trump. He is the worst.
That is great news to hear!
That is great, I bet it is a great school too
That must be a great feeling, I am glad to hear it!
That's wonderful! It's nice to feel like someone in a relationship is following their heart!
Yes, some are great others are annoying to look at.
I haven't seen any pictures in a very long time.
That's too bad. Maybe she'll find someone else
You can't let it bite you. Just do it!
How many minutes?
About six month.  I've just been really sick, and it's taken a toll on my health
I bet she went a little crazy, huh?
Your mom is an amazing person! She sounds like a wonderful mother.
Oh, that's very sad! I am sorry for your father.
I'm so sorry to hear about that! health is just a part of life
Why is that made you so jealous>
I am sure you will
That is wonderful! I am so happy to hear about such happy couples! I am a same with my partner and we have been together for almost 15 years now! ( unofficial ))
I do! I have a special relationship with my husband. She's a beautiful person and I'm sure I would want the same treatment from you :) It's nice to hear your story. Do you feel like you can share this special relationship with this new person?
That's really great! How many people do they have?
I have a great family. Everyone I have met has been amazing! :)
Why do you think you feel guilty?
Why did you do that?  Was it out of necessity?
Oh man! I hope they didn't give you a fright. Did you find them again?
Hahahaha, thats so funny! Well, it is true that if one doesn't know what they see, they don't know what they don't want! But, I'm sure you had a pretty good reason for that towel, too!
Congradulations! I am so happy for you! Now I am going back to college myself.
That's very exciting! I'm sure the weather will be similar, and it'll be cheaper to live in theWest.  I'm also a big fan of the West Coast.  Do you love your home?
Where did you go for the visitations
Oh no!  I'm glad you were able to find out quickly!  It must have been frustrating!
I completely agree.  I feel overwhelmed with all the stuff I have to do!  What am I doing right?  Do I even have enough room?
I totally know the feeling! My husband has been gone for a month now. I'm bored, too. I wish we had a pool or something to do!
That's awesome! When do you get it?
Ps4 is really expensive, is it possible to get a cheaper one?
You know you can always ask for a food credit at grocery stores.  My mom and dad both do that and it works wonders.
That's a smart strategy, smart cookie!
Oh, well I'm sure that'll go by quickly. Do you have any animals? Dogs?
That's too bad. Maybe you should get a dog to help?
That is pretty funny though
That sounds awful!
I'm sorry to hear it. You do have more experience than me, so I'm sure you deserve the promotion! What industry do you work in?
I think I have. Sometimes life really does throw you curve ball. It is better to take chances and be patient though!
That's terrible, did you two ever meet?
Oh no! I'm so sorry for your loss. Were they together for a very long time?
That's awesome! I wish I was as successful.
You must be one of the luckiest people I have ever met
That's too bad! I'm sorry you had to go through that.  How is everything going?
Well you did just disconnect? disconnect from who and why?
Who said 8 months? That's a lot of time!
What a rascal! Did you scold him to pay for it?
What an idiot! How could he do such a thing?!
What did he do? Is he flirting?
No, I haven't, but I'm sure she is out there! Is he a nice person?
Not really. You?
It was my 20s!! But I still felt nervous. It's not like it's a daunting situation or anything
I hate when Starbucks does that! Have you tried contacting them about it?
I love starbucks but I get so annoyed with that coffee shop - it's just so expensive! I like a good dark chocolate like caramel frappacinos or creme de mentele. But I do get so annoyed when they mistreat my order :(
That's awesome! What did he study?
That is great news! You must have really been happy.
Oh no!  That's horrible!  Did you get it fixed?
Did you end up finding out where the pizza shop had stolen the pizza?
They know you are vegan because they have a vegan service!
They probably don't want to pay for all that work!
Oh no that's not right! You may want to replace the cookies.
Oh, I see. I think you may have to be a bit careful in the future.
Oh no! I hate it when that happens! Are you okay though?
Oh no! That's terrible! Did anyone else see what had happened?
Which recipe?
That's a smart idea! I'm a bit worried about cooking in the future though
That's cool, what did he get right for the reveal?
That's great, what a happy and courageous choice for you!
I'm sorry. That's no good at all
That's frustrating, isn't it. Football is a great game to play, but study and play your own games if you're passionate.
What's the subject?
Good for you, I'm glad you passed!
I bet you got a huge smile on your face when you saw it. Did he do anything cool with it?
That must've made you very happy and also curious.
Oh my, that sounds very dangerous! How did you manage to start it?
I hate car problems! It is always the people who don't take responsibility that end up with thousands of dollar bills in repairs!
Oh my gosh, that's amazing! Congratulations
That is crazy, first one out, then last one out?
That is so creepy. Have you heard what it says in your head?
That would really freaked me out!
Why did he get prison?
That's absolutely terrible! Bahamas is a beautiful place to be...and I'm sure it's much nicer in person. I'm sorry for your loss. But I hope you're able to visit him soon again.
Wow, that's great! I bet he worked very hard to get to that stage!
Wow, congratulations to him! That's an achievement that will last a lot of time!
3 months?!  That is some really tight planning ahead!  You must be exhausted.
That is very exciting! Do you have any tips for me when he is born?
Did it do any damage?
Maybe you shouldn't have stolen them in the first place! Chasing people is one of those bad decisions Batman makes
Thats right! Everything in life is just just made for him and we are purpose built to make him happy!
What a nice person you are! I'm so glad that you have someone like that in your life.
Oh no!  I hope they weren't too embarrassed!
Oh that must've been embarrassing! I'm sure it happens to everyone!
What is he like in general?
What is the name of your channel?
I'm so sorry to hear about your dog. You did the right thing by keeping him around for a long life
That's too bad. I wonder what was in the recall?
Less than you?
I agree, it's nice to be grateful
Did anything get stolen or did anything actually happen?
Jesus saves me from a lot of things. I wouldn't worry about it.
Oh no!  I remember that happened to me too, except the one at the gym wasn't mine.
I love that movie!  How many kids do you have now?
Oh my god. That's so sad.
hahaha that's so mean and mean! But maybe she just needed a break!
That must be mind blowing to know that he had a caretaker job in a way, that's an incredible feat.  Makes me wonder, what other jobs do they have that require a caretaker?
Wow that's pretty impressive for someone who doesn't even know how to manage a job.
Wow! Sounds like a disciplined and well-rounded man. You are very lucky to have someone like that in your life!
That's terrible.  I'm so sorry you had to experience that.
That's a pretty bad thing to do.  I can understand if you were trying to be professional but at least do some courtesy.  I would feel awful for upsetting your friend.
Who is she to assume you did wrong?
Where did she originally come from though if you don't mind me asking?
PE fail is no good!   Why weren't you able to take them showering together?
PE is pretty tough. I went to public school for awhile and hated it. Then I switched to private and I loved it.
That's pretty cool. I was homeschooled my whole life.
That's interesting. I wonder why they didn't just ask you?
I'm so sorry you had to go through that. It's hard when you know you've got a loved one in there.
What depression do you have? I'm sorry you haven't come out of it yet.
adapt or die
What color is the bracelet?
That's terrible. I don't know how people can do that to each other.
That is very unfortunate. I am sorry for your loss
Did the police catch the guy?
Did he get in a car accident?
That's amazing! That's an accomplishment that you and me can both appreciate. Congratulations!
That's fantastic!  Masters degree's are very impressive!  Congratulations on your successful masters' program!
I'm sure it will be a rewarding career!
That is a good thing.  What is your occupation now?
What was the sacrificed for?
how long did it last?
It happens to the best of us, don't feel guilty!
Why don't you try listening to new songs/band members?
Yeah true. I listen to a lot but I don't make good music.
What game is it?
I love a good far cry
That's awesome, congratulations on your recent success!
That's great. Congratulations. You've done well so you must be very excited and proud of yourself!
Wow, I guess you have to be very persistent and persistent to get that position.
Have you been able to get another one?
Have you tried to do it sitting down?
I feel you there. Sometimes I'm a little anxious to drive because of it.
What happened if you can't tell me about the past?
That's awesome.  I'm glad to hear that.  I'm also still at the college education system trying to get my degree.  So, not much change for me :)
That's awesome! Congratulations! What are you studying right now?
That must have been scary! What did you do?
what did you do
That is good news! I'm sure he will
That's good news. I'm glad to hear about the job interview. Is it for a big company?
Oh no. How did you end up in that situation?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were you up too?
Oh, congratulations! That's a great accomplishment!
Congratulations! I bet you're excited. What kind of degree did you get?
Yes, my car broke down recently and my friends and I were driving.  It was intense.  Were you there?
Oh wow, that sounds terrible! I've never been on one either, but I always stay on the road. What kind of wreck happened?
Yes, I've been scraped on a soccer field, shoved my face into a table, and had a couple of beer guts in the process.
Yes, I have. fist fights are very uncomfortable. fist fighting has happened to me as well, it's not the worst thing
I think I have, I remember playing it as a kid. I enjoyed that game a lot!
I did when I was young.  I played EverQuest when I was little too
I have not, though I hear a good review. Why would you want to?
No, I have not... I do like the taste of their new shakes, though. That's a good point.
Yes, it is terrifying.
Wow that sounds terrifying, I'm glad you're not going to get it anymore!
Yes, many times. I don?t remember which one though.
I have never rode one.
That's a bummer.  I hope he didn't take any blame for your decision.
Oh my gosh that sounds horrible!  I am so sorry!  Are you okay?
Where are you going? I hope everything goes as planned!
Wow, I'm so happy for you! I'm going to go to South Korea myself. I hope they are bringing lots of snacks and tea!
She sounds like a great girlfriend! How long did she work for you?
that is a good story
yes they really dont, is she teaching at a public school?
That sounds like fun. Was it a boy or a girl?
That is so sweet! I have two rescue puppies. You are very lucky
Wow. What did you do? ignored? How did you react?
Thats cool.. Sometimes drunk people are more attractive..
That's not cool, did you eventually find one?
Oh wow. That's some dedication.
Me too!!! Its been crazy long! What are you doing this weekend
I know what you mean. I am a stay-at-home mom, and my son is just 3 and a half so I have to go out and spend my time outside with him to stay cool. It's hard when they aren't home with you!
Oh no, that's awful, what did you have planned on going with him?
Oh wow that must have really stumped you.
Home was the best place!
im so sorry to hear that, why was it so hard?
That's good. It's nice to have supportive parents
Rain is the worse.
Nice, were you able to enjoy the weather? I live in FL and it never really pours unless it's super hot.
What did she end up planning?
That's sounds like fun. Did you get everything accomplished at the party then?
Did it get on him, or no? Did you return it?
Did you atleast return the favor at least?
I'm sorry! That must be hard. Are you going to stay alone?
I'm glad she took you out on the business trip! How was the TV watching you?
That's too bad. Have you tried putting up another sign?
That's too bad. Maybe there's a local rescue in your area that can help you out?
That's really awesome.  It's nice that she cares about her family.  Did you buy anything cool?
She must really be a nice mom!
Did anyone get hurt on the ride?
Haha sounds super intense! How'd it go over with everyone?
That must've felt so weird.
Oh that's super awkward! Yeah I can understand why it might make you upset. Work stuff is never fun
I have had that happen. I don't even know why.
That's terrible! Have you tried to get him up and to ground him/her?
Congratulations! You must be excited and proud all at the same time!
Congratulations! You deserve it for taking such a great stand!
Did she notice after a while?
Did she notice after a while?
That sounds scary!  Did you follow him home to tell his parents?  That sounds like somebody who is mentally tough and could handle himself!
Lol.  That has happened to me before.
Oh no, how gross! What was it??
That's a nice story, I'm happy you had such a happy ending!
Oh no! I would be too! Did you ask him why?
I would be so mad.  Is your house that dirty?
Oh, that's awful! But sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
Apologizing to the mother can be seen as being kind of disrespectful.
Sounds like a great time!  I'm glad you had a good time!
I understand why it took you so long to share it.
I agree.  Do you have a wonderful opinion?
Yeah, people don't realize just how beautiful nature is!
ya that always give me the feeling too.  people really need to be more open and honest
Sometimes I have the feeling as well that someone out of my life is just out to get me. It is hard to know who or what I really reflect when I'm not on top of it all. But that can be defamed.
Yeah as a adult I was terrified as well
Where do you live? Kansas?
Oh my, did it rain and make the place uninhabitable?
I understand that completely, I think it is because our kids take forever to warm up to something new
It's a great point. We all have our reasons to be frustrated and irate. But I think it's good to focus on those things instead of crying about yours.
Where did you guys end up going?? I'm guessing Australia?
I agree! Where did you guys go?
What is it?
What kind of phone was it
That's really great that you have that kind of gift!  What was the occasion?
That is awesome. My parents worked just as hard to get a baby as I did. It is good to work for a company that does something about that.
That is so sweet!! I am an armed guard too and we love to go to the range!!
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that! Have you researched what different types of glasses you can use? Perhaps some prescription help you see better?
i can imagine how horrible it must be to have no vision
That's pretty normal behavior for grocery stores.
That does not seem very nice
Haha I'm sure he'll get some sleep soon
I can imagine it was super frustrating! How did it go after?
What do you do to meet them each year?
I work all summer and yes, I do get company! It's nice to be able to spend time with family. Do you work at a salon?
That's awesome. I have a 8th grader and 2yo. They'll be fine
That's awesome. My daughter is in 1st and 2nd grade now. They really are ahead of the curve.
That is a great feeling, it is good to be financially independent!
I know the feeling. My husband struggled to pay off the last dollar on his last check, but he's finally paid all of em down.
Oh wow! Did you get a good score on it?
That is awesome!  What bar exam were you taking?
That is very nice of the baby to not pay!
That's awesome! Babies tickets are really cheap! What did you end up naming him?
That is so mean of him.
That's so sweet! I'm glad he's understanding! Does he do it more than other girls?
Driving is scary! I was the same way. Did you get into many accidents while driving?
I am so sorry to hear about your dad getting into an accident. Was he ok?
You must grow these plants very quickly! I am a tomato plant collector and I can not imagine the work you must do!
That is quite impressive!
How many do you have?
Yeah I've noticed that too, seems like there are so many drivers on the roads. Makes me very nervous!
Where I live most of the town has bad drivers too.  I try to keep speed down as much as possible.  Any idea why the bad drivers are so rampant in this town?
I have met a few of those before.  It can be fun though.
Through a game called Mine craft.
You sound very nice then. I'm glad that you care for everyone.
I care for everyone, but I focus on the important things first.
That is so exciting! Do you have any idea what's going to happen or why she would be with you so long?
Oh wow, I'm really glad that didn't go too badly.  Do you have things worked out?
How lucky! I need a new job!
Wow she must have worked really hard to get a great job then!
I hate when that happens. I always make her go in her room when I get home so she doesn't do it when I'm out again.
Thats disgusting, I would complain to someone about that immediately!
Being with someone tight makes you a better person. Being with someone less makes you an enabler. Being with a partner tight makes you a better person in my opinion!
That is awesome. Husbands are so important in relationships.
I can understand that. It can be very depressing.
Oh yeah that is super crazy! I would be mad too. ha
That's great! What's going on?
I'm right there with you, man. I've been in a horrible situation where I've been out homeless for 14 months and now I'm finally in one piece. At least you can still do whatever you want, right?!
That's pretty awesome. I'm in the same boat. I work at home now, barely able to survive, and am just fine doing what I love. I don't have to work at a place where people actually like working.
Where'd all of them come from.
You would have been pretty joyful!
I agree, but maybe there is a positive in remembering what happened.
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.  Were you able to make it up to her?
It's a pretty nice city! What did you do there?
I love San Antonio too! I went to the pool.
Congrats! That sounds exciting! Which college?
Congrats! That is so exciting! You must be so happy.
I understand that. I threw up in my room yesterday.
I am sorry, I hope he/she feels okay! Do you have any advice to share?
Oh no! Did he fall on his own legos too?
That's really frustrating! Did it take away from the fun?
That sounds delicious. I haven't had it at all, what is it?
I loveQDoba. It's so expensive, but their enchiladas are amazing!
That's so cool. Do you know why he choose to learn that?
That is crazy! I bet you were over the moon when you read about that.
Oh, what did he do to impress you so much?
Wow that's great! Has he been working long hours at least?
You must've been so proud! That's so awesome!
that's so sweet!  He must've really enjoyed that.  He must've been so happy
That's terrible! What was the subject?? Were you trying to break the ice by making a joke or by giving a thoughtful and detailed speech?
That's okay, most of the time when people are trying something a little ridiculous they'll just go home and cry about it the rest of the time.
Do your dogs like the place where you live?
Dog parks are really fun!  If you like walking around and playing with dogs, go for it.
That is so sweet.  What did you plant?
That's really nice!  What did you plant?
That is really annoying, maybe you should talk to her about it?
That's a bummer. Maybe she should buy a new one?
What do they call for?
What situation are you in right now, and how do you feel that it is a little inappropriate?
Those were the days!
That's great you were able to get to spend time together.  Did you meet at the wedding?
Oh my goodness. I am so sorry to hear about your mother. Are you okay?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear. I know exactly how you feel. I lost both my parents.
I'm so glad you found the job you wanted. You sound confident.
That is great. It is common to be apprehensive when you have so much on offer.
What did she do to deserve that?
Wow, that's really scolding for a 9 year old!
When is the test?
That's wonderful!  Is it a new place?
That's awesome! I know that's a struggle.
That's awesome! It's always nice to be able to make some money in the mean time!
What angels do you have?
That is wonderful that you have friends like that in this life!
I'm sorry, how do you punish children?
12 year old is still a kid though right? right?!
You know what they say, 5 years is a lonesome road.
Sometimes you got to do what you gotta do. Forcing someone to do something versus just you being able to.
Oh thats great, Did you get it?
That's awesome! What kind of job did you apply for?
OH! That is so cool! I remember those blanket's were very pricey! I'm glad you got to hold on to one!
Oh no, did you get a new blanket?
Yeah I wish I could go back to school but I'm not sure what I should do
I think you're spot on! My daughter has been stressing out shopping, and it seems everyone goes through a lot of different things!
That's so kind of you! Poor animals are the hardest workers we have in this world.
That's a name I haven't heard in awhile. Is he old (or perhaps just slow)??
Yeah it really is. I can only imagine
That's how I feel, too, but then the guilt is hard to escape
Congratulations! That's great news!
That is awesome news! You must be so happy!
That's too bad. What kind of dog do they have?
I'm sorry to hear that, hope everything goes well with the vet
Its okay. Everyone makes dumb mistakes like that. Its part of life
You should tell her and let her know you did this!
Yeah that's the worst. I know how it feels to get yelled at over a mistake you didn't do but get rewarded for it. I would feel so guilty if that was me
I do! I get warnings like that all the time! People think that doing their job well means doing their job well! It's ridiculous!
That sounds awesome, i've always wanted to go to alaska!
I have heard that about alaskas, I hope its nice!
You are so right
Oh wow! That's a lovely poem.
What ever happened?
That's pretty terrifying! How'd it get past the fence?
That's so sad. I hope he's doing okay?
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you are taking the time to be there for her.
That's great! What did you enjoy about your day?
That's great news! I'm happy for you and your family
I'm so sorry! What was it that happened to her?  Did you talk to her about it/
That's really a bummer, I hope it's not too expensive!  It's happened to us before.
award for what? if you win you get 20$ off a $150 order
That's so nice of what they say, hard work pays of
Thank you so much! I'm really excited, but yeah, I'm definitely feeling a lot of apprehension about leaving my current job!
Thank you very much.  I'm really anxious and worried.
did you get the job?
Ones where you have to talk to people a lot? Those suck.
i agree with that one percent! Some parents think they know best but really don't
Lol, that's awful. Did you ask her to stop, or did you have to pick it up yourself?
I'm sorry you feel that way
I'm sorry that it's so hard for you. Have you tried setting up an outside organization to help?
That's really sad.  I used to be like that too, but I've been able to turn it around
That is great, I wish I had kids.
Where are you going?
That's gotrasta. How do you like it? Are you going with anyone?
Oh no! Were you able to find her? That must have been a bit scary.
Ewwwwwwwwwww. I hope she didn't suffer too much from the mess.
Yea it's been raining here too and it's so hot I feel ya! What kind of cat do ya got?
That sounds awesome!  What are you watching on Netflix right now?  Netflix original?
How did it go than?
Those are always nerve racking but once the call is over and the paycheck is coming, it shouldn't be too bad!
That's good to hear! How long have you been with your partner?
People are sometimes very loyal.
Your welcome. What do you like about this place
Why nothing?
Your welcome. Do you feel better?
Why nothing?!?!?!?
Oh that sounds so fun.
That sounds very pleasant! I wish I could attend a garden festival!
What was the mistake?
Wow! What did they offer you?
That is a complaint against the city or the provider? I would try to speak to someone higher up about that
What happened?
That's sad to here but I have been there before too.
Aww, I'm glad for you! What made you want to be a rep for them specifically?
That is awesome. What was your rep name?
Who is she?
I'm sure that's how you feel during a holiday vacation, though!  Was it the movies, TV shows, pets, or other things that kept you lonely?
What is it?  Are you going to ask for a different kind of bread?
Where are you going to get your favorite dish?
That sounds amazing! I need to learn how to swim!
That is a nice place to live.
I bet that was amazing!!
Congrats! That sounds like an awesome time!
Long?  Tell me more...is she single?
That's great! Did she visit you?
I'm sorry to hear about that. Losing a parent is a very hard thing to deal with, I'm sure.
I'm sorry you went through that. Losing a loved one is one the most painful things that can happen in life.
Wow, that's shocking! How big was the baby?
Awe, that's so sweet! Congratulations on the little one!
That is good, I am glad you remain faithful. How long have you been married?
That's great. How did you guys form?
thats cool
What truck did they get?
That's great!  Anything special on today that you'd like to hear?
Good for you! I am happy to hear that you are feeling that way
I hope she feels better soon. Is it a cold or a fever?
That's terrible! Is she better?
Wow. That's pretty neat. What caused you to see a tree, and how big was it?
Wow. That is quite interesting
That's awesome! How old is she?
Wow that's awesome! She must be a great talent
Oh no, what has he done to make you feel that way?
its tough but you have got to love who they love
I'm sure you'll get something you're needing, what's the matter?
That's good, I'm in education and I love IT so I know the demand for that field is going to be high
Aww, that's too bad. Maybe you can hang out on campus during that time?
I feel ya. Well, I hope you have fun in your new house :)
That sounds so exciting! Which one are you? I'm excited for you!
That must have been so shocking! What happened?
hahaha oh man, you and me both.
hahaha, you are funny my man. Do not worry. Your diet will backfire and you'll look great!
Oh that is great. I bet he is so relieved!
I'm so happy to hear that! It's great that he's finding a good job and being able to support his family!
I bet you wanted to puke a little. Did you ask her why?
That must have annoyed you a lot!
Maybe you should buy a new one?
I am sorry to hear that! Maybe you could find a new one?
Wow that's exciting, it's always nice to catch up with old friends
wow. that is so nice. I hope you have a good time.
Where did you end up flying to her after she came back?
I'm glad you were able to make it back! Where are you going?
Oh wow! That's pretty rude. Were they trying to get some work done or what happened?
That is so annoying!  Call management next time and let me know if it happens again.  I work at home and would LOVE for people to wake me up early so I can get some things done!
Oh no! Did you tell him about it at least?
Oh my gosh! Did you laugh or nah? I would be so mortified!
That sucks. Are yo going to be ok?
Aww.  That stinks.  You need some hobbies.
That's very good advice, thanks for sharing!
That's so great you went that route. What blew your doors off?
That's good that you worked it out. I think it is important to remember that it is your blood and not some other imagined thing.
I am happy that you are taking things seriously.
Oh, that's so awful! I'm sorry! I've been through that too. My husband had the same thing happen and it can really be upsetting.
I'm so sorry you're going through this horrible experience! I pray for your family as well.
I'm sure cold feet are good for you.  What are your main reasons for wanting to move?
I have the same feeling. I'm starting to doubt myself as well when I think about the cost.
wow that sounds like a nice day, what do you want to learn?
That is a good goal! I'm glad you have something you are passionate about to do.
I'm so lonely. I wish I had kids.
I'll always be your friend if you're still around.
Where did she go?
Oh no, where did she go? That's awesome to hear she's back though!
That's awesome. Where will you be going?
That sounds like fun!  Are you going with anyone?
That sounds awful! Did the wedding get cancelled?
That sounds like a tough job, hopefully she grew out of it.
Ohhh no. Did they not apologize to you after?
That was nice of her. Did you buy her a pizza after she gave you one?
It was pretty alright. How about you?
I'm not sure what your name is. But I want to congratulate you on your day since it went really well :) My name is Yoko.
It was okay how was your day.
I am happy to hear that. What made your day special, "go on"?
That's funny, I had something similar happen at a wedding, but the bride pretended not to notice because she was in another room.
Ouch! I hate that happening. But, at least, you had some socks! I hope you didn't feel like a doofus in public!
How did it go after they called you in for interview?
Nice. Are you a bit nervous about it?
What does she study?
It can be tough but as long as you make the effort it shouldn't be so bad!  Did you get a good start in school doing the move?
Where were y'alls places when you guys went?
Awe, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe she will visit you in person next time? Or perhaps take you out to a movie or something?
Oh no! How come you almost got into an argument, and if you did, I'm sorry that it didn't end up well? Are you guys still friends.
Wow that sounds very tense! Did the other person apologize to you?
Oh no! How did that happen??
What happened?
Adult apartments are so nice!  I stayed in one for a few months during college.  I loved it!
I can totally relate. I wish I didn't have to live with parents right now. I don't want to be a parent and have to deal with that every day anymore.
did you get loud?
That does sound pretty crazy!
Nice! What kind of job did you apply for?
That's great. I hope you get the job!
haha that's okay! We've all done that before
That happens to me all the time too! It's okay.
Are the police involved?
The mailman doesn't do much if the police don't do anything.
I hope they help you and give you a good idea what is happening.
How did it go after all that?
That's wonderful. I can tell a lot about my childhood as well because I live in an area that was mostly flood plainned during that time period.
I love ice cream! I grew up in MN and was exposed to a fair amount of mid western corn syrup so I'm always a little sad to go back to MN and not see my home state
That's so cool! You must be very excited to have that kind of experience.
That's very sweet of them! You must be really happy with their help.
That is a great attitude to have. You sound like you really love your life.
That is really great you have friends like that.
Oh no! I'm so sorry, I'm sure you are devastated.
I'm so sorry! I know how frustrating it can be!
I am trying. Its hard not to be though when you see all these hot girls at work.
I am trying to be better but it is hard.
Will he stay at home if you leave him there?
oh yea i can relate.. my wife got a dog about a month ago and hes still a puppy at 13 weeks old. he never listens and just stares at you lol
Stealing is wrong? what are you doing to steal?
Stealing is stealing. regardless of circumstances you are still breaking the law
Oh no! That's a shame. You must have been devastated.
That sucks, i hope you atleast got a little reward for that.
How sweet! I bet she is excited to see you
What an amazing and exciting time!  That's an amazing and scary experience!  When is she due?  That's amazing!  How exciting for you! ha ha
That's scary! Do they have the results yet? Are they clear/
A pathodiologist :) I'm so curious what it is that's making me so nervous! lol
Absolutely! I'm not usually one for boasting...but this was unexpected and something I really worked hard at doing.
Thank you! I'm very proud of her as well. It's great that you both made the leap! Is she considering a career change?
oh thats good
Life is always hard when you think of it in those terms.
That's awful, I hope no one got hurt.
I am so sorry that happened to you but that was so awesome of your neighbor!
ohh, I know someone who does that too. It's quite interesting.
She isnt really famous is she
I know that feeling.  I had that one time in my 20s, I spent a day getting ready for an important project and making sure I was ready for it.
I know right. I remember spending my summers with my parents in Florida doing all sorts of fun activities. I miss that so much
that is scary! is it a crackhead break in or a place of business break in?
Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry! That's awful!
Oh no! I hope it wasn't expensive!
Oh my goodness!  That's horrible!  I hope the cops took care of it
Oh that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.
oh that sucks.. I am sorry to hear that. I am sure there is something out there for you
Oh no. Thats horrible
Oh no. Thats a funny story tho! ha ha.
Ugh. I have that happen with mine as well. I think it's the kitties fault
I can understand that, my cats are crazy like that too
Where will you be going?
That sounds amazing! I've never been on a vacation, only to go to college! I'm very excited as well though!
Oh no! I'm so sorry. Did she make you feel bad?
Oh no! I'm so sorry you had that happen. Are you getting the treated?
What was the prize?
Congratulations! How much did you win and how much did your prize cost?
That is annoying, I can imagine it makes your life miserable.
I know what you mean. Some people just have no patience..
Who was it from?
Oh boy, I'm sorry that it disappointed! I hope it wasn't something urgent that you wanted?
I hate when that happens.  Did you hurt your foot?
I'm glad you were okay. Did they hurt you?
20 years is a long time. Was it your birthday?
That sounds wonderful. It is nice to reconnect.
Awwww, that's so sweet!!  What did you do??
That's so cool! I've never seen a baby riding a horse before!
I'm sorry, what happened to make it so unlivable for you?
That's unfortunate. I'm sure you have other things you can work on, though.
That's kind of scary. What do you think is going to happen if your aunt doesn't get the keys?
Maybe you should call on her next time so that it doesnt happen?
I am with you.  I work two jobs and have 4 student loans.  I am also a single mother and would like to eventually get a college and make more money.
I've been there too, it will get better
I'm so glad that people have compassion and understand your problems. Most parents wouldn't bother
Oh man! That's horrible! Why couldn't you move?
That is horrible. I have had that situation before. It sucks that no one wants to help you
Can you afford to stay there?
What sort of things do they do?
Same here. I have a wonderful family and my relationship is wonderful
That is wonderful.  It is nice to have a friend like that.
That is great. I'm happy you have such a great best friend.
That is pretty cool.  Did he celebrate after?
Yeah that's pretty cool. I skate a little, so I know how you feel.
What did they do to shame you?
I'm not sure what you are judging here, I think it's quite cool! My husband and I used to play a ton of Madden and we would rack up yards after yards with our Drives!
Oh no! I'm sorry! Babies suck but teh little ones make the world so much more happier
Awwwww... Tylenol is the best! Have you given him some meds?
Did you call the police?
That's really scary! Did you end up calming the dog down after the fight?
I bet that was no fun.
It sure can be, I have a 8 week old pit bull myself. I could not imagine having to clean those puddle filled with vomit and fur!
Oh no that sounds awful!  Did they cover it for you?
Oh no. I am glad he is better. I hate seeing my dog suffer.
Yeah, when i'm having a good time at a bar i'm pretty confident that i'm doing something wholesome while keeping my cool
Yeah, I once peered down at a window and peered outside thinking about the past. I miss the good ol' days...and I try not to dwell on it too much...all you can do is smile about it sometimes :)
Nice! It's always good when you have concrete answers ready to share.
What was the job for?
yes when i was in elementary school. was it a big deal or did it not matter
I have actually. I can't even imagine going through that. I am so sorry you are having to go through it!
yes all the time. I call them names, try to get them to clean.
HAHAaha.  I remember that. My daughter used to tell us what our dad was doing in the car with the headphones on so she could listen to him play the game.  I think that made the child annoying!
What do you mean as in how you have taken care of others?
I'm sorry to hear that. It must be nice to be able to help others in need. It's a good job.
Did you take it again?
I can relate. Once when I was in college and again now that I'm a mom. It definitely is a very difficult thing to keep practicing and keep a good attitude about.
Yikes! That's really scary. Did you freak out?
I would have report them too, I am not a animal person!
Yes one does volleyball but that is it
I don't have any kids. But if I had kids that would be the coolest thing. skateboarding sounds fun!
Oh no! I would've been SO frustrated.
Oh no! Did you manage to make it back before the others got there?
That's pretty annoying, how did that happen?
That is so bad and so annoying. Why couldn't the manager help?
I love puppies what kind did you get?
That is awesome. I have a pitbull myself.
I hear ya there, i get nostalgic all the time too. What do you miss most?
Yes I agree, I think childhood is the golden age for many.
That's pretty amazing! What was the prize?
Wow! That's awesome! I bet you were so proud of your project!
Awwwww, why didn't you get him to use the bathroom in the crib?
Clinging sucks! I'm always the nervous parent but I'm sure you are handling it better than I am. I just had a baby last month, 6 weeks before being sleep trained and still no sleep.
That sounds really amazing! Did they have beach like weather often?
That sounds amazing! Was it your first vacation?
Thats awesome that you can look back and remember that moment.
Hahaha that's wonderful you have kids, that's definitely a juggling act. Yes a very happy moment to be having a change in scenery from when he was small and vulnerable. I do wish I could be there to help take care of him, it would make my life much easier.
where at
Aww that sucks. Maybe you can take an alternative route to get there.
Congratulations! That's exciting! Does he go to any clubs?
Wow!  Congratulations to him!  He must be really smart!
That is good news!
I do not, sorry. I hope everything works out with your kids
How did it go?
Oh man that's always so much fun! I love getting stuff I used to have too
Wow that's awesome! You guys must be happy to have a house together!
That is pretty cool, she can be pretty crazy when it comes to money
Oh god. That's horrible! Did it get away?
That's really bad! Did you have to kill it?
That's good that she's better now!  I'm glad it relieved your worry!
That's good. I'm glad that she got better! I hope that her clotting hasn't been too big a deal in the future.
That was probably nice of you..but it probably got the fiest of fests..Funny how that happens, huh?
That is really sad. Did you end up letting the cat out again?
Oh no! I hate when that happens!
Oh my gosh that sounds so scary!  I'm so sorry that sounds like it could have been really scary. How did you managed to get out?
I understand.
Did something bad happen?
What exactly happened?
Did she apologize?
Did they apologize?
A who? I'm not familiar with the gender neutral term, sorry.
3 months?!  That's fast!  Are yall married already or are you having a little baby?
How is it working for you so far
That sounds great! I just signed up myself, but haven't really tried it or looked into it. What kind of books did you get?
What's the surprise?
What is the gender of your child?!
Oh how exciting! I hope everyone had a great time!
Oh no, did he say why he didn?
That's awesome! It's always nice to have a college that puts you first, and makes you a part of the family!
That's outstanding! You must be quite proud of yourself!
Wow! That's amazing! How did you go about losing so much weight?
Wow! I've been on a weight loss journey as well, but it was for a completely different reason. It's been a really rough one! How have you been dieting?
Why is that
Yeah, I used to be able to drink whole milk too. Not as delicious, but I can't imagine the feelings that went through my body at the time.
I am so proud of you for admitting you had a problem with it! I have tried it before and it is no joke.
That's great! How come you can no longer join a church?
That sounds so annoying! Hopefully it didn't get to be a bad drive for you.
I bet that was very tiring. I am sure you had a good time though.
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry! Was it a big deal?
Those hard situations can be so hard to deal with. I hope things turn around for you guys in the future (I hope).
I've heard of people taking longer to get to places because of traffic, did anyone actually get hurt at least?
That must've been so aggravating! I'm glad you got to use it on time though!
That is so nice of him! What did you do to deserve such flowers?
Who forgave you flowers?
Really? why?
Wow! I'm sorry, that sounds rough. Are you alright?
Cool! Did you go inside it and find anything interesting inside?
Wow. What color was the mammoths?
Oh my goodness, that is amazing! Congratulations?
I am so happy you made that choice!  What is the baby's name?
What ended up being the issue?
congratulations! thats awesome news!
I'm so sorry. That's so sweet of you to do.  Did she have any health problems before she got sick?
It's amazing how one tiny little tear can tear a whole life away. Dogs are like family.
What did she do during the sit-in??
How long did it last? She's probably a keeper.
That's great! I bet it's hard to put backs on things you have saved so much!
I completely understand. My son went into debt at 18 and was out of scholarships at 19. I was in that boat too.
That sounds so relaxing and happy
Awe, I know how that goes, it's hard to get back into the herd after you leave them to long to get food. I hope you guys had some fun adventures together!
What is bugging you?
i'm so impatient for you! I'm excited for you and i'm sure you'll enjoy your new baby! adventure!
Congratulations! You have truly overcome a lot to get where you are now!
It's almost as if people don't realize just how good your looks and health are!
Wow - how did that wind up turning out?
Wow, that's disappointing. Did she offer to buy you one as well?
I used to LOVE Super Nintendo as a kid!
I love playing retro games too! I also like the CD-ROM version of Megaman.
That sounds scary! What happened after?
That's crazy, what did you do then?
That is so awesome, i remember when my girls were voted too! talented as mother, you are!
That's great, what kind of an gallery does she want to make in the future?
Nothing.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.
I don't understand?
Oh no!  Did you take it to an vet to get fixed?
That's so great! I bet she was SO NICE!
Must be a lot of fun!
Wow! That's incredible! I'd like to do that someday
Did your home get damaged?
That is true. I live near the coast, so I have to listen for stuff like that!
Congratulation
That's so sweet. You're both very lucky!
What's your favorite type of car?
I love Toyota stuff, they have a bit of a following.
Awwwwwww.... what is his name?
Oh wow, you need to be a lot more careful!
Oh no, that's not ok at all
They probably don't have time to build the order, it's crazy busy.
Wow! Did she promise you anything?
What was it a trap for
Oh no! Did you get sick?
That really stinks. Maybe it will be cheaper for you to rent a car this time around.
What were they led to believe?
That is terrible! Why was she so stupid?
What happened?
I know that feeling, but it's a very emotional reaction and you shouldn't let it get to you. I think it happens to all of us, and if you accept it it'll make things easier
Wow. Where did she travel to?
Where did she travel?
Oh no is she okay? I hope it's nothing too serious
I'm so sorry. That must be awful.
i know how that goes buddy.. stay grateful
Why does she have to be alone in a club? Is she a relationship type of girl
Ok then, go away! I'm not your mom!
I understand.
That's awesome. How many kids have you had so far?
That is sound like a plan! savings is always good and when things work out it looks good on your business too!
What? What don't you like about the movie?
A secret... of sorts?
what was
Oh my, I'm sure they had no idea where you were coming from!
Homeless people smell great! Did you not go outside for a moment? Or maybe you just had a bad ex-husband.
Why don't you just break things off?
Well, as a friend you should feel bad as well. But as long as you know your girlfriend does not like it, then it is alright. If you cannot face it then it is your personal business.
I am really sorry. I lost both my grandparents within 3 years.  I know how you feel.
Oh wow!  I'm so sorry to hear about that
Thats awesome! I need to get into painting.  I am bad at it.
Congrats to your kid! That is a proud moment for you guys. What an accomplishment! What sort of painting does she want to produce?
Have you ever considered telling them?  I'm sure they'd love it if you did..
Sometimes you have to live with it. Sometimes you have to accept it and move on.
Me too, it really stress relieving to know that your abilities are functioning properly
I can understand that. I am a bit of the other gender, myself.
wow that's really nice, you and your partner are a match made on earth!!
Where did you escape from?
I'm so sorry to hear that! Are you OK?
I'm sorry. I have lost many this year.
Did you honk your horn at him?
Did you call the police?
sorry?
Oh, what happened? Did something wrong happen?
You got this!!! I am so proud of you!!
That's a pretty cool career. What do you think will be your career path when you first meet him in court, though?
Why did you hurt yourself that time?
That's too bad, what hurt her?
Oh no! How awful!! I hope it didn't tear while you were walking.
I'm so glad that you didn't end up in the hospital with a torn pants. I've been there, and it's not fun.
How exciting, when is he due?
That sounds like so much fun! What is your role in bingo?
I'm sorry. How big was the burrito?
I am so sorry. That sounds horrifying
It was pretty alright. I got through some tough stuff, got to spend some good time reading. What about you?
Oh yea what's up?
What do you like to do in the summer?
I hope nobody saw that
Oh my gosh! Did you wind up feeling badly after?
Why do you have so much trust on her?
That's good. Trust can be hard to overcome sometimes.
I hope it goes better for you than me!
Good luck! If you need someone to help you out, just message me! You'll be fine!
Wow! I would love to go there
Nice I need to go see that
Oh my gosh that's horrible!  I would be so upset if that was me.  What did you do?
You should definitely do it. Usually if they deny having an issue, then they're doing so wrong and in very dangerous way...
That's great! What's been going on?
That's awesome! I love new houses! Are you in the middle of no longer class, do you have kids, etc?
I understand, I went back to school at 34 and now work full time at 35.
Yes, it's always stressful because we have to learn all new things. I'm glad to hear that you were able to help out.
Cool, do you like watching them? Do you like racing?
Are you sure? I thought only dirt bikes were allowed on TV?
About what/why?
That's awesome! I love houses! Did you buy it when it was cheapest?
What kind of car did you get?
Audis are pretty nice! What kind of a driver are you?
What kind of watch is it?
What kind of watch is it
Congratulations! What are you studying?
Congratulations! That's awesome to have a college degree. What did you study?
I hope you did well. What is your field?
That's disappointing, hopefully you won't have too much trouble with the final.
Wow. That's awful! Are you going to divorce him?
Wow I'm glad you're clear. Do you want to talk about the situation or are you just done?
That's terrible, my friend, I'm sorry to hear about that.
I am so sorry to hear this.
That's disgusting.  The restaurant was probably swarmed by customers trying to restroom themself,  trying not to think too deeply about what they're doing.
That's awful. I'm sorry you went through that. Did you complain to the manager?
I can imagine! I recently went back too. It's a pretty great feeling
Yes, I grew up with them. They live on through my extended family and I'm close with a great uncle/pa who raised me.
Were they? Were they? If so that must have really been exciting to see and remember.
Mustve been so nostalgic opening old presents
That's good to have had extra stuff in case of a flood. I bet it wasn't too bad!
Oh yes, I am fine now thanks to my house being repaired. I had to board our first child in Matthew, and our house got much more damaged in the next days.
Uhoh. What happened?
That's always scary. What did they ask for? Were you worried about something serious?
That's pretty awesome! I wish my neighbors did that!
No, I haven't made a tree house in a while. I actually don't have the patience for it at all.
I'm sure that was difficult and sad for both you and the deceased
oh that's bad :( was it a family funeral?
I am sure you felt like he really did do something by taking your time. Did everything turn out ok?
Wow I bet that was very frustrating and you don't get much more out of an hour of your time than you do to just wait on a doc to talk to you
Thats terrible. I hate how bosses can be like that
What is it? I'm sure you're ready. What is the big test?
Good luck! I'm sure you're gonna nail it!
That sounds awesome!  What beach are you going to?
I haven't actually! Why do you love it so much? I've heard so many good things about the place!
Bed and breakfast sounds like a great time!
That's really sweet! I bet he was really excited and you guys will have a great time together!
Oh yeah I bet that is a great reason to love someone.
That sounds very mysterious
what ended up happening? did you have a bad taste?
Oh no! Well at least you weren't left with just a lemon!
Who are you going to go see?
What are you suspecting exactly?
Why wouldn't they? They're paying attention
You could try giving it a shot.
Wow. That's awesome! What changed for the better?
That is awesome. I am glad to hear that. It is always nice to get what you want
That's terrible.  Baby's cry for no long at all, and usually for longer than 30 seconds. Pretty sure babies are cry for forever.  Why would someone on the other end feel he had to shoe horn in on the first hour of a long trip?
Oh no that is so awful!  Baby crying is the worse.
That sounds like a great decision. Did you think it was the right choice?
Are you making more than your current amount?
what is the card from? i love grandmas
What a nice gesture!  You must be so excited to receive such a card!
That is scary! Are you ok? Any damage to where you live?
Where did you move to after that storm?
wow that's cool. I love plants!
That's so nice. You are truly blessed to have plants in your garden. You are living the dream my friend.
That's great!  Sounds like you both have a great time planning the party!
She must be so happy, where are you having the party?
She's probably just excited!
Lol. Sounds like you guys are soulmates.  How long has it been?
Sometimes, it's just the fact you didn't like the person that asked you out... And sometimes, telling the truth to someone about that can be kind of a boundary, if they don't like you that much later on you don't have much of a choice. But I think that's what you said. Yeah
Wow, that's really lucky that you didn't get sick.
Wow.  I'm sorry you had to deal with that.  It's funny you picked that name because that's what everyone has been calling you recently.  Do you know what caused the issues with the lunch?
That's disgusting. The restrooms on the side of the road are often nasty as well, with manure and stuff. What state do you live in?
I am sorry to that horrible feeling. The worse I know is that my sister in law is on her way to visit her mom in Texas right now and that made my night!
You should feel guilty! What really happened?
Try not to feel guilty. It was an honest thing to do.
Why does she expect you to do that?
She sounds pretty entitled.
I bet that made the whole weekend amazing
That sounds really great! Did everything work out?
Oh, congrats! It is always nice to have that feeling, even though it feels kind of accomplishment right?
I am so proud of you! I have one more semester left and I am going to do the same!
I'm happy for you!
That's awesome!  I'm happy to hear that and I'm planning the same!  It's hard to feel overwhelming financial freedom, but it's totally possible to accomplish.
God is always there for you when you need it He is always there for all
That is very sweet. God is always there for you.
Wow!  I hate storms like that!  Are you ok now?
Oh wow, that must've been pretty terrifying
Wow, I'm really sorry to hear that. Have you thought about seeing a doctor?
I am sorry, that sounds terrible. Have you seen dr. jacky's youtube channel? He might be able to help
I'm so sorry to hear that. How long were you separated?
I am so sorry to hear that, I hope you can see the light at the end of the tunnel soon.
I'm so sorry! I've had that happen too! I hate it sooo bad! Did you go into the kitchen this time?
That is terrible. I hate when that happens! You go under, smell the, then when you come back smell the, oh yeah, so that's gross! And then you go back to work, and that smell is always there!
Sorry to hear about that, what happened on the trip?
Im sorry about that, But atleast, Atleast you have the girl.
Hahaha, that would be a great prank
I have no idea.  Some people are sleep deprived!
I used to be very confrontational until I realized that yelling at people was the wrong choice. I am now a much more thoughtful and approach to situations. It's nice to have that realization, because yelling back at people who annoy you now really makes a world of difference.
Yeah, it is hard to be the loud one in the room
I am sure he will be able to fix your problem.  It is really painful to have to wait sometimes.
I hope it all goes well. It might be too soon to tell though if it will be success or not.
My leg grew back again after anasthetics failure, so I am hopeful. I am a bit older and it is not fully healed, but I have had knee problems before and could have walked for a little bit. This is a brand new surgeon who did anasthetics successfully
That is terrible. I hope you are able to get through such trials ok.
80's Fiancee here. It's been the same as it has all week. What's the temperature where you are, in your experience?
Sounds like a great plan.  The problem with the 80's weather is that it tends to stay cooler and cooler over the course of a few months.  The only way to get it warm in August is if you plan on visiting the beach later.
Have you ever done one before or is there a different reason?
Maybe but you can't really learn how to speak without having some experience.
What movies do you like to watch then?
Oh yeah I watched all those too when I was a kid
I have never seen it, but I love Harry Potter.
Sometimes there is.  I saw Kindergarteners 2, and the families actually got along and laughed at the movies.  But that's Kindergarteners.  It was a real bummer getting yelled at by your parents for not respecting it.
I know that feeling, I went from working at a Nike sweatshop in sweatshop to working at a McDonald's sweatshop in Nigeria on a sweatshop in America on a student loans payment
Did it make you want to go there more?
I haven't been to Dairy Queen in ages, will have to stop by next week
What kind of job do you want to get?
That is good to hear. What good deed have they done for you lately?
That's great. I wish I could do that. I hate it when people do that to each other
Was it raining? I love rainy days.
Did the police catch you?
haha... happens to the best of us
That's interesting. It can be pretty uncomfortable to go up to someone who is so obviously insecure about their towel usage and assume that everyone has a towel.
Congratulations! That is awesome.
That is so awesome. You must have been so happy and proud!
I am at 50 miles an hour. I have two kids so it has been a long week. How has your walk been?
6 months. It's been a rough 6 months
Wow! What bank is that?
Wow, what a wonderful thing for them to do! Congratulations! I'm sure they will use that 100 to fix your computer as well!
That's amazing! Did you get a promotion or just a raise?
Top ten?! That's fantastic. What restaurant?
That's awesome! What restaurant did you get?
That's never fun.
hahaha. that's funny because I think of that all the time too.
Haha that sounds like it's a win for everyone. Do they enjoy older kids
Oh no! I know, it's stressful. It's nice that you can put a list together though!
Aw, that's too bad. Hopefully your son is thinking ahead and remembers next time.
That's good. I'm glad you got through without too much trouble.
I'm so jealous of your grocery store lol.  That is a great memory.  What did he think when you told him your forgetting some things?
Did you get the apartment back okay?
Its nice that you were nice and patient with her. You are a great tenant
That's awesome! What was it about?
That's amazing! I bet he was very proud! I am sure he appreciated it!
how did that happen did you do it accidentally or were u trying something else
It will feel better when you get back together.
Oh really! That's awesome! Good for you
That's pretty cool! Good for you!
That is amazing. I have two daughters myself. I can't imagine what some of the crazy and stressful days must have gone through during childbirth!
Hahaha, well, I'm not quite ready for kids yet! But, I am very happy for all the hard work I put in raising them.
Thats not good. Do they give you a break for it?
Haha I've done that before! But seriously though, how much does it cost?
Lesson 1, that's how it starts for most kids.  Do you start school early?
Awww yeah! That sounds so fun.
Oh no, what was wrong with your day?
Oh my gosh! That is the worst! I am glad that you are ok! Did they say anything about it?
Why not? What stopped you from doing anything?
I'm sorry.  You'll find what you want
That's cool I'm from South Texas and have family nearby, how did it go for you?
That is cool. Do you attend?
That's always a worry I had... How can you save money if there is no money?
I am sure everything will work out fine.
What is the exam on? Sorry to hear that.
What is the class?
You did great! What was the subject??
Congratulations! Sounds like you studied really hard, you should go celebrate.
That sounds fun, did you get a lot of feedback on it from people you'd visited?
That's great! I love restaurants! What kind of food were they serving?
How did you get over it?
22? Wow that's young! So you were pretty confident before and after?
That's good! I wish I had that as an option.
Same. Its the same food group as me. I love change
That's great you're so determined.
That's good. Do you exercise often?
That's too bad to here. When was this last?
Oh my, I hope you have insurance.
I used to have that problem as well when I was little.  It's funny how you can just remember the things that didn't happen that way, like throwing a tantrum or crying over nothing!
Rain can be rough on kids. How old is he/she now?
Where did she go?
That sounds so fun! What kind of book was it?
How about parasailing?
I hear ya! Where are you working at home now?
Congratulations!!!!  I know that is so exciting!!  What is he being born with?
That is awesome,  Is there a special occasion?
What are you worried about?
I'm very glad you're praying for help with car repairs.  I'm working on getting my car to be run smoothly so I can enjoy it again.  I'm praying I will be in paradise before the end of summer.
That's too bad, did she at least apologize?
What school year did you attend?
What did she refused?
I can see why she was upset. How long did it sit for?
Oh wow! Is she looking forward to it? Is it her first one?
Thats awesome! Is she very little or does she still have some growing to do?
How do you feel afterwards?
You must be quite strong to do that.
Any particular game that springs to mind?
I remember playing old school games on the xbox. The pad was always the coolest part
Why is that
yea i hate on train too
That sounds like so much fun! What kind of car?
That's a good choice. Better fuel economy and looks nicer!
That movie was so depressing.
Oh my god Fight Club! So many people die in that movie, it's a sad movie!
why are you feeling unhappy
I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?
That is so gross!  Did you complain?
That's so gross! How much did it cost?
Nice! What kind of bike did you get?
That sounds great! what kind of bike did you get?
Wow, congratulations! That's an enormous accomplishment!
Good luck! I'm sure it'll be a breeze.
I feel your pain. My husband is the same way.
I hear you. I'm in that boat right now. I have been so broke that I have had zero direction to go in life other than spending money. I'm so sorry. It's very hard!
Wow, what's her name?
That is so cruel to cruel animals, so sorry to hear that.  I hope it's just a phase and she will be fine.
That really stinks! I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry you didn't get paid
How cool. Did it make you think about them?
That must've been nice
what was the surprise?
wow that is great of you
Oh no. What happened?!
You're very welcome. I'm sure your walk will be much safer next time.
What? why did you do that?
Wow that's some dark stuff... 17 years is a long time to hold back from stealing things. Did he ever come clean about the situation?
Math is never my strongest suit.
yea but what really matter is you passed
Oh my gosh that's terrifying! I'm glad you managed to get away from that person.
What happened?
Oh I bet!  Was it a nice throwback to the past?  Did you play on them a lot?
Oh that is so exciting. I have a bunch of cards as well from when I was a kid.
Is it a good one you're going for?
That's cool. What kind of job did you apply for?
I love movies from the Hamiltonian movies!
Oh, what is that? I've never heard of it! What was it that you enjoyed the most about?
I've never been to the beach, I'm afraid to.
The beach is the perfect place for relaxation and reflection! I am sure you had a great time!
did you confess to her?
Don't feel bad, most of us have done something worse.
that's nice of you, are you nervous?
That's understandable. Have you always been able to do that?
I am so sorry to hear that, how old was your dog at the time?
Aww, I'm so sorry for your loss. How old was she when she got run over?
What happened to your dad
That's terrible. Is he okay?
Was it nice? The weather sucked
That's wonderful! I love the beach! Did you go on a walk?
oh how was it? did it excite you>
Wow, that's an amazing movie! I've heard such good things about it!
How was that experience? Did you have good memories of visiting?
They sound like such lovely people!  Do they live close by to you?
Oh no!  Did he get you?
Oh my, did you get away from the dog?
That's sweet! How old is she?
Sounds like a sweet sister you have! How old is she?
Why were you so nervous
Oh, thats good! How long did it go without her?
Oh no! Did you chase the dog too?
Oh no! I would have been running for my life if I was in your situation!
I am also a music fan, I can sing really well
I'm sorry, I don't know if I could even do that...
How did it go
That's great, chores can be so important!
How gross! I hope they didn't bring you more
I bet it was disgusting, what did you do?
Why, what did I do?
Thanks.  I am online blessing you :)  I love having people around
Wow, she hardly ever does? I bet you're proud of her!
Wow, how did you all do on your visit?
Oh! That is so awful. Are they in a long term relationship or just very angry right now?
I would be too! Did they even care?  If they don't, that is unacceptable for them!
Oh no. I bet you were scared
Oh, that's awful, but I guess it's happened to other people before too.
Are you making more than you were before or is the house a little different?
I'm sure it will be, stick to it.
Good for you! abroad is different from home! Where did you go?
What happened?
What happened to make you dissappoint?
Why did you lie?  What did you say to her?
It's good that you don't hurt anyone's feelings. Are you guys still together?
How popular is she? I'd say most people would find that embarrassing, especially if they're not very close to you
Oh my goodness, what did you do?
That sounds sweet! How did you respond to her request?
That sounds lovely! How sweet!
Oh no. Did you end up having a serious relationship then?
That's good! pounds don't mean anything in the end
That's pretty neat. You have your priorities straight! I'm a political science major, though. So, I've been studying for my political science major for quite a while, and I just got my first semester of college this week! I hope to be a great counselor/ counselor/ counselor!
Oh no. Can you imagine being a student in a college with no money?
I'm sorry. I've been there myself. I lost my father a few years ago.
Sorry, no I am talking about the family. We just lost our two boys in a car accident.
Why do you feel that way
Oh nice! How'd it go?
Oh no! That's no good! Were you able to get him to clean up?
The students registering for classes at the college I grew up in were very excited to attend as well!
It was really cool.  Do you own any dancers
Wow! Are you ok? Is it a poisonous one?
Did he catch you?
How much was it? and what did you get for it?
I hate when that happened.
Ugh, that's so disgusting! Did you tell the chef?
ewww that is so gross
I am so sorry for your loss. Did she give you lot's of closure?
Thats so sad to hear.
OH wow! Sorry to hear that! Are you doing alright though/
I'm very sorry to hear about your brother's passing. It's like losing a parent who was just too good to you. But you are right, time does help. It's been five years for me yet still feels like a blink. Time to cherish though!
fake as in non news? or like they got the story from a unreliable source???
Because gullible people believe anything they hear...I get what you meam
Aw, does she get mad when you do? I always thought kids were more respectful.
That is a smart girl! You must have taught her well!
That's unfortunate. Were you able to recover?
I'm so sorry to hear about all the bad stuff happening. It sounds like a really stressful situation.
I love shopping at Walmart. Everything is always so cheap there.
Aldi's has some of the cheapest groceries. That's great if you don't know where else to buy!
Me too! Do you like sports?
I've never seen a basketball game lol. Is it like an exciting show?
Oh I'm so sorry to hear about your father. Do you cope with your loss?
Oh wow, I'm so sorry for your loss. I can image how you feel.
Why would they say that? Is she cheating?
People say that all the time. Are you sure?
What kind of goals are they? Are they goals for you in particular or just general in life?
Good luck. I am sure you will be able to get it all accomplished.
I hear that, I'm guessing you're from Canada?
Oh that sounds like so much fun. I've seen him perform live once. What instrument did you play?
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that!
That is scary! Did you get it fixed?
Why did you leave the crew?  That's sad.  Crew?  dances?
What kind of crew you joined?
How many plates are you doing? and how many people are watching?
That's awesome, I'm glad you're putting yourself out there!
That's great! grades are everything
Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear about that.  Will you be okay?
Oh that is really tragic to hear! I'm sorry for your loss
Did everything go well?  Did everything work out?
Wow! How old is she? I bet you were pretty proud of yourself.
Well, she has to get a yard now.
I completely get you, I wish my kids had room to run and play from as well.  I have three kids myself.
Did she say yes?  That's so mean.  Did she even offer a counter proposal?  That's even worse!
Oh my gosh!  Why did he ask you?!  What for??  Was he mad at you, or what?!
yes, I too enjoy nature. What do you like to plant?
I love to garden too. We should start a garden club
What is he famous from?
What is the full show covered up with?
that sounds like a fun and serene experience
That sounds like a lot of fun! I'm glad you had a good time!
I have never been to a place that has that! Where is that at night?
I feel the same, but as long as they stay on their phones and in their car I guess that's okay
Sort of. Do you have kids.
Yes I am and I totally agree.
Do you go see a doctor? Maybe you should get that checked out!
Did they last for more than 3 days? I hope not!
Why were you so nervous about the trip?
It's funny, the same things used to go around back in the day about having a fake moon eclipse instead of having a real one. People were just afraid that they wouldn't be loved by someone as sweet as you!
It's nice to have a side gig like that to help provide a little bit of income for the family.
That must make you so happy and relieved. It is such good news that she has accomplished such a great thing.
Aw, that's cute!  It's funny how much the age old "age old" means the person still acts like a kid, too!
Yes it does!!! It's crazy how much the older you get, and how quickly it changes how you treat others. I had that with my wife and her friends growing up. She went from unconditional to unconditionally adoration pretty quick.
how sweet! I bet they had a lot of fun.
Oh wow. How sweet!
Sorry to hear about that, Did you talk to his dad?
That's so sad, but I'm glad it's you and not him
How did it go
That is great!  It is challenging to follow a diet?  How long did it take you to lose 7 pounds?
That is awesome! I'm glad that you have that kind of feeling! Acceptances are very rare and they take a lot of work!
That is so amazing! I am glad it worked out for her.  Does she have any other choices?
That's always disappointing. Who was it?
Yeah, that's true. I do sometimes the same thing, but I try not to compare myself to other people. It can make you feel bad, I know! But it's hard not to compare yourself to someone you thought you knew better.
Whoa! I hope you guys are having a ton of fun together! Are you excited for another reunion?
I'm sure they'll be back and forth, and that'll be just fine!
Good for you! studied hard is one of the best strategies
I hear you.  Sometimes I wish I didn't either... but being competitive in what you do is all you can do.  What is the exam for if you don't mindMe asking?
What are you guys going to do?  Do you have everything already set out?
awww that is so sweet!!  I'm so lucky to have a friend like that
Have you spoken with a psy doctor?  My sister was treated by one who used to work in a trauma center and they really made a difference!!
I am sorry to hear that, I wish you the best of luck!
Oh I understand that completely. It's the same for me when my husband leaves for his deployment to deployed somewhere else (I live in Florida)
That's terrible. I'm so sorry for your dogs' loss. I can imagine it's tough to be all of a sudden.
Why did he get in the skin? That doesn't make sense
Oh no! I'm so sorry! Is he at least self-employed? That can be really help-worker friendly, if he's not self-employed yet.
That's good!  Losing a few lbs doesn't usually feel that great.
That's too bad. I'm sure if they kept at it, it wouldn't be that much of a difference, if any.
Sounds like so much fun! What did you guys decide to do once you got there?
I love road trips, I wish I could go on one! Did you guys camp?
Wow that's terrible. Did they have somewhere else to put your cruise?
Wow that's awful! What a rip off! What caused them to do this?
That is wonderful! I have a wonderful experience with a friend a couple years ago. I wonder if I will see him any time soon. english haiku bot
That's great that you had such an amazing experience with your friend.
I can understand that. It can be lonely. But it's also good to have company.oneliness can leave you feeling depressed.
It is great to have alone time.  I went camping once and it was amazing.  Bring some friends too
did you kill it?
That's awesome! Did it get you?
Where in Florida?
Oh man, I've lived inflorida my whole life. I cannot say that it is not beautiful!
What food do they eat? That sounds so rude!
You should set an alarm on your fridge.
I'm so sorry to here that! It's a very common type of cancer and can be easily fixed. But it's so special to the family and especially the young people in this situation!
That is very sad. I wish your family all of the best.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did they give an explanation why?
That's a shame. I'm sorry.
Oh I bet! Do you already have a place lined up?
It's always a pain waiting to move, but I am sure it will be worth it in the end
That sounds exciting! I have never skied in the city.
That's great to hear! What indicators do you see?
I'm very much agree. I'm optimistic that we'll see great things again in our lifetime.
That's sad - I'm sorry to hear about your family's situation - but you should support them through this difficult time!
Have they talked to her about it at least?
Oh wow! Congratulations! How big was the pregnancy?
Wow that's awesome! Did you guys do all sorts of tricks to celebrate?
Wow that's right up your alley! I love animals! And yeah that sounds like a fun day!
Oh yeah? What was it, I'm always looking out for scary movies.
I have never even heard of that movie, but it sounds like it would be fun!
Wow that's awesome. You must feel great!
Wow!  I'm so proud!  You must feel really happy about this!
That's cool. Did they have a good deal on the car?
Oh nice, are you going on a roadtrip?
Congratulations! You will enjoy your next phase
Congrats! That's a tough career choice, but I'm sure with enough dedication and effort you can land a job in the right industry!
On no! Did she notice?
You can't do it. It's a difficult thing to do, but you have to do it.
That's cool with them.
That sounds awesome. It's good to reconnecting with family and getting to know people better.
I do think that way too. It's hard to put that past us though as some people haven't changed and it's good we tried to hang in there as long as we did, for whatever reason.
You're right. I think I'm in a pretty similar boat myself.
Oh my gosh that sounds like a nightmare!  I can never get scared like that.  What was the movie?  Were you scared at all?
Oh my gosh!  That's so scary!  Did you see the movie too?
That's really sweet!   How long have you and he been together?
Why did you guys choose the place?
Oh no! That's awful!  Is your chihuahua getting up and doing good?
Aww I'm so sorry to hear that, I have two feists.  How old is she?
He is truly an American hero
He has certainly damaged relations with the international community as well.
Oh no! How many sisters do we have?
Oh no!  I hope you are feeling better soon, and your family can make plans for you to go see them again soon!
Were you sad?
Well, it was not too bad then. You can drive for quite a ways.
What did they do?
Ugh I hate teammate expectations so much! If you feel you did your best it's time to tell them so.
did you try to scare the babies away?
That is a real pain for sure.
Oh wow. That sounds like you have quite a ways to go! How many people do you think are casualties?
I'm so happy you were prepared!  How many people do you think have died due to the recent devastation?
I have never been to one, but I've always wanted one. Sounds like a great place! Have you been riding horses for a long time?
Oh wow. I have always wanted to get a reindeer and do a lot of riding around my neighborhood!
Wow, that is impressive!
That's pretty cool. Glad you were able to get that worked out.
That is pretty tall... did you do it
You are very brave. Did you have to go to the doctor?
That's awesome! I want to move to the south and start a hunting tradition there! People are so friendly over there!
Maybe you should try to go out and do something that you are passionate about. Maybe join some sort of meet up group.
What is the change that you are going to do?
Wow that sounds like fun. I love Hong Kong! And I bet the change is going to be great!
That is good, do you meditate often?
That is great, I have always meditated. Have you always done that?
what happened? did they bust in?
What was it that happened?
That's terrible. Did they compensate you at least?
That sounds very personal.
I'm in the same boat! I feel like I'm always nervous!
I'm sorry you had to put all that stress on you. But you did the right thing by taking the Xanax!
That's very inspiring! I hope you got everything to grow your own food!
That's really awesome that you had such a great experience and are being appreciated!
I live in Florida..so hot summer nights are perfect for me!
Oh no, did you go in?
I hate those things too. I'm so glad you're okay though. Did you do any tests?
I bet they were upset
UPS is notorious for this. I would feel so bad for the customer!
I know what you mean. I wish I could go back in time to make some sense of all of that stuff.
I know exactly what you mean.  I'm a parent now and I feel like adult because I've grown so much.
Sounds like you are a passionate person with a great passion for the causes you serve as a politicians.
That's really cool! What do you do for a living?
That's a bummer, but at least you waited patiently!
I'm sure you have a great friend!
People are only human! Be nice!
Oh wow! How much was it?
That is a horrible feeling.  Ive been in that situation before.  Its hard.  Give it some time, it might happen to you.
Congrats! circuit boards seem so boring and boring to me, but I'm happy that you did that well!
circuit boards are pretty cool im glad you passed!
When do you think it will be done?
Is your area near faults?
That sounds pretty terrifying!  What happened after?
I would have been terrified!  Did everything turn out alright?
Aww that is so sweet! How long has it been since the wedding?
No, I've never farmed far away.  But my mom moved across the country to teach and it worked out so well.
Oh no! What happened?? Did you bomb it or did your nerves not get to you?
Oh no, what a mess!
I honk because i'm worried someone is going to hit me. But in my experience nobody knows what you are doing so it's useless.
I agree. It is irresponsible driving to cause accidents. But there are those who do not drive at all, so it's important to be cautious
Wow! That sounds really exciting! Are you very excited and hopeful for this career?
Yes I have, I was accepted to many, but I was not accepted to anything crazy, just accepted to get an education out of school.
Oh my! I hate storms! Were you alright though?
thank you! storming is scary!
Oh wow. I am very sorry for your loss. That is so awful.
Absolutely, mental illness is the root cause and the root of suffering. I think we have to go a long way to overcome it. I'm glad he's not dead yet, but I'm still upset.
Did he take a goodie bag or anything?
Wow! Did he recognized you for a good job, too?
amusement parks are fun
I like Six Flags. But I am not the biggest fan of rollercoasters.
That's awesome. How did you choose that up?
That's awesome! I don't have the funds myself, so I appreciate it!
Oh that's awesome. Was it a special gift for her?
That is so true! My kids are too little to understand the concept of dressing up as santas. But it's always great to see a happy family at christmas time!
oh damn.. did you put him back to his place?
Oh no that is a scary thing for sure.
Me too, I watch too many. What shows do you watch
I know what you mean. It can be really emotional.
Busch Gardens is an amazing place and I am so sure you will enjoy it!
The one in Williamsburg is my childhood favorite and I loved the food! We did go to Tampa once, it was a blast.
Really? Did something happen to you? I used to have a 1 yr old and would get sick if he bit someone.
Eeeewwww. That's so gross. Did anyone report him?
Eww, yeah, that's pretty bad parenting if I do say so
Dogs are loyal like that. It takes a lot to get them to stick to you like that.
Dogs are so amazing, I love being able to train them and help out where I can.  I'm glad they're loyal!  I'm sure they appreciate you being there for them.
Oh my gosh! That's so awful. I hope the roof is ok.
Wow. That's awful! I can't even imagine how you feel!
That must of been a nice reunion
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you go on many rides? That's always been my favorite part of the entire trip for the most part. The secret is getting the youngest the latest technology!
That's awesome that you have that kind of focus on your family. You sound like an important part of your family!
Wow, that sounds really special! I'm sure you'd be over the moon if your family came over!
That is cool. Does she do anything special for it?
That's awesome! Did she dance as well? Sometimes kids can get pretty amazing at what they can do with a bowtie and a singlet!
What show is that? I've never watched a show with a main actor younger than 18
Wow! That's very generous of him!
That is very nice of you. You sound like an amazing parent!
What job are you applying for. Im guessing its one that requires an interview. Im sure you have one coming up.
You're very welcome. I'm sure the job hunt is going to be quite a task. Just keep hanging in there.
Oh gross, I hope you were able to save the meal and eat it.
That's a bummer. Did you manage to find the salad again or no?
What store is it?
That is awesome. I wish they carried my kind of stuff, but I am not sure if they are open 24/7 like other retail stores.
That sounds cool.  Do they have anything like toys and stuff for adults?
How far did you have to move? I can relate because I moved from Florida all the way to California... then to Louisiana all the way back...
That's cool that Hong Kong was such an economic juggle, it's a shame that the economy there is so fragile
I am so excited for you! I have never been
I'm so sorry you went through that. I hope you are better now and that you are feeling better.
That's so great. I'm so happy for you!
Absolutely. It's a sick sick world we live in.
I agree, it is truly sad. It seems like a sickly combination of race, greed and illness.  I truly believe that if we move beyond greed and illness, the human race would be in such a better place.
That is so messed up man. Did you tell him that he is cheating?
I'm sorry. Do you think he's cheating?
That is the worst, I know what you mean! I hate when that happens!
I know exactly what you mean. I get it now.
That's sad to hear. Are they trying their best?
That's terrible, I'm really sorry. How long ago was it?
What job did you pick up?
What is your field?
What is she going for?
What is a little "fickle" in the way of being unable to stick to a plan?
Why do you have to do so much work in July? Are you going away?
i love the summer
I've always wanted to, man. It seems like something that would only be done in the movies, where there are a ton of stunt people involved, and you'd need really good reflexes. How did it feel, watching it from the beginning/back?
Oh man! I'd love to go sky diving! I bet it was crazy! Were you afraid?
I will definitely do that. Thank you for your response
That's cool! I've tried vegan food before. Some I really liked were eggs benedron and cheese thistle.
That's great to hear.  I've been veging my vegan food for a few months now and I'm loving the changes!
Oh no, I hope it goes okay.
I'm so sorry to hear that. That's so sweet.
That's so great! How long did it last for?
That is good, how did you treat her after?
No I don't I'm quite young and my dad works far away
Cool. What year>?  Did you wreck it?
Cool! Have you ever actually seen one in person?
I am sorry, did you have them for long?
Oh that is a tough one. Were you able to find a replacement?
What was it?  Was that from a restaurant or a homemade by you or your spouse>
that sounds amazing!
Oh that sounds soooo good! My favorite meal right now is pizza. What kind of cheesecake were you thinking?
Oh I'm so sorry.  I hope things turn around for you two soon.  Are you going to therapy?
That's sad. I'm sorry to hear that but you got out
That sounds so nice! What did you have to eat?
Cool. I love ravioli.
Congratulations! You deserve it!
Hey! You're welcome! Sounds like you put in the hard work. What's the new position?
That's wonderful! What kinds of words does she say?
I do.  3 daughters.  How old are your daughters?
where are you going? are you scared to go?
wow that is so awesome are you going by yourself? or with friends?
That was nice of them, did you have fun?
No problem! Yeah sushi is pretty good!
Awesome, I love sushi! I'm always so busy studying that I don't get to enjoy some of the good stuff haha.
That's nice! What weather did you get?
I've never really gone to the Gardens before, but if you have a nearby park, that would be great. I live near the ocean, so I'm always going to the beach!
That must be very lonely for you. Maybe they should come over?
wow that sounds lonely
That's good, I think that is a good thing to have as a foreign policy, to be brave and to not abandon your country.
That's great. Everyone needs some adventure in life.
oh thats cool, why not buy him one as well?
Did you try and negotiate down the price?
That's awesome! 16 can be a lot to take care off!
I have a younger brother but not much older. I like older siblings but I do miss being little. I am happy about it too
That's good to hear, it's always nice to catch up with old friends
Who was it?
I totally understand that. I have a friend who lives an hour away from me in Indiana. I miss the Indiana in him and I bet he misses the people.
I try to visit as often as possible but it can be difficult.  We live an hour drive away from the beach.  I do miss some things so I understand
Ohh.. thats nice.. How did things turn out
Did the woman know that it was you who was hitting on you?
What play was it? Did you enjoy yourself?
What role did he have?
I get the same way. I'm sorry to hear you're alone during christmas break though. Maybe you should plan to meet someone to go the same with?
Maybe you can invite some of your close friends over and enjoy yourself.
Cool, I like that you followed the recipe. What's it made from?
That's awesome! wing sauce is one of my favorites, so glad you were able to try it out!
I hope so!  Are you getting a big raise too?
i bet you feel very optimistic about the whole thing!
I'm sure!  That is an exciting stage of life that everyone should experience at some point.  I'm a stay-at-home mom, but my son's birth was a month ago.  So, you experience that as well!
That's wonderful! I have a 2 year old nephew, and I can't imagine the stress of a 2 year old. I'm happy for you!
Oh yeah I always do that. What kind of videos? Were they scary?
I think so. I always feel like I'm on the edge of my bed when I'm home alone. What kind of strange feeling did you have?
I remember watching football in the late 70s and super bowls! I loved it
I used to play football in college. The playing field was so much fun!
That is really cool! I have never seen that before!
I would love to see that. I have never seen that before
That was so nice of you. I hope he knows that you are a great friend.
I have no doubt he will remember that fondly. It's nice to have that type of friend in your life
That must of felt good to accomplish. Good for you!
Nice! Math is never my favorite.
oh my goodness that is horrible news, are you okay
Im so sorry to hear about that!  My husband and I both work 24 hours a day so I spend as much time as we can with them about once a week.  It really stinks to only see each other once every couple months, I hope they get through it ok.
Wow congratulations! How is your baby?
Wow congratulations! How far along is your pregnancy?
Oh no! I hope that you had plenty of emergency supplies.
I live near a lake and we always have to make sure we have everything when it's bad.  It's scary to lose your house if you have to flood though!
did you get drunk and leave the station
That's a really weird thing to encounter.  Did you get caught?
That's a good friend. Has he been ill for a while?
That's good news. I hope he continues to be healthy!
Wow, good for you, that's an accomplishment you and your family will always be remembered for!
That is great, I would be happy too. It is nice when something like that is rewarded.
What was the name of the movie? I hate when someone spoils the fun!
Sounds like a fun time! What movie?
I remember those day's and the days that follow. What job are you talking about?
Congratulations!  I am sure you were ready for that interview!
That's too bad.  Did she have plans after work?
That is a strange neighbor.  I hope they don't have a lot of dogs.  smoking is bad for you but, also dangerous for your dog.  What kind of dogs do you have?  Smoking?  Labrador?   Greek mix?
That was so funny. I hope you recover well from it!
That is funny, and understandable
That's wonderful! It's a difficult skill to learn when your not so smart about it.
16 months? You should definitely get him into a little program like Starting Strength.
Why so many longs?
Oh no! That sounds so awful! Why did it end up taking so long?
Oh no, I'm so sorry for you. How did he die if you don't mind me asking.
I'm so sorry for your loss, those are the most heartwarming stories. How did he live his entire life without complications?
Wow I am happy for you. What kind of job was it?
Oh man, the check would've come any minute, huh.
That's cool. Are you going to save up and take one day off and go on a different bus line to ride that new line or is it a one time thing?
Oh wow. Are you going to contest that bus with another one?
Oh, sorry to hear. Is she with someone else now?
Oh, that is terrible, I'm sorry to hear. Do things feel better now for you, or are you still sad about it?
Oh no!  Did you apologize?
Haha that's an embarrassing situation but it happens!
Yes it does! I remember when my youngest was smallest and he would play all day in his room!
Aww, that's so sweet! I bet you're stoked to have a son back then!
Oh man! I am glad to hear that! I hope that didn't cause any damage!
That must have been a pretty good experience for you! I am glad you're ok. I've fallen a few times, but never while sitting.
Oh, that was nice of you.  I bet they were happy to get some cash!
What happened?  I hope that they didn't take anything.
That's too bad. Did she get a good therapist?
That is very sweet of your sister, I am very sorry.  I can relate as well, it's just a really tragic thing that happened at that age.  It's hard for anyone to grasp the whole "what a tragic" of it all.
I agree. Having a good job is essential to having a good life!
I agree. Being grateful is something that makes life more enjoyable.
What do you believe in
That is a nice position
I'm assuming it was an expensive one?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have another smartphone you could try using to listen to the music?
I bet you were happy! What was the occasion?
That's awesome! Did you have fun?
That's so sad!  Where did you live before you left?  And where are you from?
That is so cool!  You are going to do a lot of catching up!  Tell him about his friends and family!
What show is that?
That sucks. What show was it?
Thats always fun! How long do you usually have to work with someone for a while.
It's so good when you can be so hands off and it works
Where are you headed for your vacation??
I take those vacas too actually! Why are you flying so much? Are you going on a roadtrip? Vacation formality makes me want a break!
Why is that
Oh no! Did you end up having to replace the invite?
That's great!  What did you get done with?
Oh yea, I forgot summer was such a relaxing time! I feel the same way. Are you in the south?
That is terrible.  It's like the rain you get on a rainy day only to come back a sappy sunday.  You need a lot more rain to keep things nice!
That is so great.  23 years of marriage, I bet you are very proud of his fidelity.  Where has he gone?
That sounds like he's well mannered.  You must be proud of him!
Aw, that's too bad. I bet he appreciated your company, though.
Oh my goodness that sounds terrible!  That is awful for both your husband and you!  I'm sorry!  That is so awful!  You should have talked to him and made it up to her!
That is awesome! What kind of talent?
That's awesome! What kind of program?
A ten year old crying over something trivial? That is very mean
Awwww that's so sad, poor little girl! Hopefully, he learned that not to push his luck!
What is it that he does wrong currently?  I am sure you want some advice!
That's a bummer. Maybe you could work night shift instead?
That's awesome. Did he tell you what he's doing for your bonus check?
It's a good thing you guys have saved so much.  My parents are in a similar situation and I get to be a part of their Christmas presents.  Where do you live?
I don't blame you! Some of those creatures are just horrifying in their own right! Film at its very lowest setting can get very graphic!
Oh my gosh, that's so gross!!! How long did it take you to notice?
I am sorry to hear that, maybe there is something that you can discuss with him!
Is there any chance of him not getting a large bonus, because he hasn?t had too many lately?
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you two should go to couples counseling?
That's a good point. My husband has a job, but he's so gone as well. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since I've been married for the same amount of time.
I am sure it is going to feel very different for you then
Yeah, it's like that. Growing up, I didn't miss my ex-boyfies very much. They were always so busy and did little else, lol. But, they grow up, and you miss the fun times, lol!
Oh my, was it a police or semi-truck?  Did you get hurt or die on the way?
Oh my gosh! What happened after and how did you get out?
I'm so sorry to hear about that.  I lost both my parents years ago, so I know what it's like.
That's terrible, my condolences to you and your family. I lost my dad to this and I can't imagine what it must be like to experience this.
What job is it?
Why are you angry about this kiss?
People kiss who are loyal. kiss for a new relationship, not an old one.
Did it feel nice
I haven't been in a beach for many years, but I hear so many good things! Did you go to Panama City?
Oh no! Did you confront them about it? Did your boss agree?
That's terrible. I wonder what was the reason? Maybe he was just tired?
How did it perform?  I have always wanted to see a musical of his.
ohh, I've never seen it but I am familiar with him.
Oh that's never a good thing.
vomits are bad. But i'm sure most people have done something to make them feel ashamed about themselves
How do you feel? Are you happy for them
Why are you feeling nervous?  Are you going?
That sounds so sad. Was there a lot of tension there?
Maybe she will let it go eventually
I'm so sorry. Losing a child is very hard.
That is great. I am glad that everyone is happy!
That's pretty awesome. What a shocking and amazing time!
That's amazing! How long did it take to get to that stage?
Sounds like a nice guy! What do you like about your job?
Those are qualities that are hard to have, so great that he does not afraid to do so. I am very much the opposite, love my boss as he is a very good man.
I used to do the same thing when I was young. I don't know why we do it now, it was so cute then!
Wow! I bet that was so cool! Did you get burned badly though
I know that feeling! Did you try to go to bed earlier this morning?
I hate being energized when I get 7 or more hours of sleep.
That's exciting! I wish you all of the luck! Do you have an agent helping you out?
How much is the house?
Did she get back to you?
I'm sorry. Is there anyone else who can make it?
Maybe he can work from a computer?
I am sorry, is there anyone else that can help her?
Oh that's sweet! How'd she do?
Oh my gosh! That's awesome. You must feel pretty accomplished!
What kind of math do they do
That's so sweet! How old are they then?
What kind of job may I ask you to apply for?
it's always good when someone is happy for you. I bet your anticipation is killing you.
That's always fun! Did you find any good memories in them?
I have had so much time to do my moms proud.  I bet it was nice to experience some nostalgia
Why?
That's sad, did he give you any warning so you wouldnt be left alone again
You will be ok, its only practice
What kind of job is it?
Oh, what did you think it was?
Oh no, I know what an ice cream cake looks like! Did you try any of the other cake options?
why what happend?
Aww, that's so hard. I hope it wasn't for a bad reason - maybe you just needed a break
Did you not like the birthday? I missed my friends a lot as well
Well, maybe you're important enough that your family can attend without you being home.
How exciting, Did you get it for your dream job?
Great job! What university?
Oh my.  What happened??
I would be so grossed out! How horrifying!
oh my goodness. that is awful, i am so sorry. please tell me that he is ok now and that he was no longer in your life?
Good for you. I still am unable to ride a bike.
Oh no! I can only imagine the terror that went through your body! I am sure that was a horrible thing to do
I am sure you were fine if you followed all the instructions
Did she get credit or did anyone caught her?
What were her ideas?
It is always great when a marriage is thriving.
That is great! How long were you married?
what did she steal from you, that must have upset you
Oh wow, that is truly horrifying. I am really sorry that happened to you.
Oh nice. What do you have planned for it?
that sounds like a good plan
Oh? What kind of car?
Mustang's are pretty nice! What year did you get it?
That cat is very naughty! I am sorry to hear about that!
I would have fallen out of bed! How did you react?
Oh I'm sorry! The weather should get better soon! Are you going to the beach later?
I hear ya.  Things are always perfect when the wife and I are away.  Take care and let's reconnect.
Wow, good luck for tomorrow!
wow, you're really impressive! I hope you do good
That's a good thing. It can help them become responsible and independent!
Awww, that is so sweet! I have two kids myself, so if I can make a baby, so can you! But I'm sure that trying doesn't guarantee success!
Oh, that's too bad! I know what that's like unfortunately. I hope you guys atleast got to spend a day or two together!
Aww that's too bad. Hopefully she gets back on soon and can visit you guys!
I'm very sorry to hear that! Losing a pet is always so hard, it breaks up your whole day.
That's so sad to here. It's hard when a pet you have for a pet life doesn't last as much as you'd like. I'm sorry.
Whoa! Where did she land?
That's awesome. Where have you been traveling?
Horrible movies give me so much fear! Was it because you didn't like the actor in the movie or was it because you didn't want to look away?
I do not like scary movies
Where are you going?
Wow, you're taking so many vacations already! I need one for Alaska, please let me come too.
Where are y'all from?
That sounds fun!  Are you going to see her?
What did you have on the dinner?  Did it taste great!
What are you cooking up?
Which one was it?
Was that the one with the guy with long long red hairs?
Wow I bet that meant a lot to you!  What sort of things did you share?
That's awesome! I hope it was a long long relationship and not just a one time thing!
Oh no! Were you scared?
Oh no! Did you figure out what was happening by your reaction time?
Oh I bet! How long have you been married?
That is great, it must be an amazing feeling!
What did he do to it?
Wow. What did he do to it?
What job is it? Do you like it so far?
I'm sure you will do fine!
Oh no, I hope you weren't too stressing.
Ahh, I can see how the dislike can come out! I can't imagine leaving my dogs with someone for long term... Are they fine though?
Oh wow! Has she been to many different places?
What is your favorite game?
Where did she go?
Where did she go?
What city are you moving too? I am in South Carolina and would love the change!
If you have to move, might I recommend Seattle? It's been getting a lot of buzz recently, and is a fun city
Oh, no that's terrible. Did you at least have the department moved over?
That sucks!  Did you tell them how unfair it was?
What movie was it? I'm always looking for something new to watch.
What movie was it? I've never heard of this one (too scared of public speaking to strangers) what was it?
It sure is, that's the wonderful thing about independent study! You can do what you want and not have a bunch of assignments to do or people to deal with!
I am happy that you have such a great support system to help you through tough times!
Eww!  I guess some people aren't satisfied until they puke!
Ew that's pretty gross! I wonder if anyone noticed it.
I bet you're so proud of him!
That is so great. Dogs listen to everything you say.
What type of dog do you have? Is it a small husky?
I'm sorry! I am sure it's very beautiful! Why does it make you sad, if I may ask?
You should totally get a chance to go and see it while you're there! Go to red Rocks and see all the craters.
Did you confront him to fix the problem?
That is a real bummer. I'm sorry that happened to you. Hopefully you learned some lessons from that experience!
yes it can be very irritating
I am with you. It seems to be happening more often now
Where to? I know I have wanted that for a long time.
Where did you go?
Oh, my! What was it that happened?
Oh my god! Did it turn out to be a ghost or was it someone else?
That is not cool.  What did he do?
Thant's not right. He should have paid you.
That's awesome! You must be really excited!
I'm glad to hear that. It is always good to be organized and prepared for a trip.
That is very nice from your wife.
That is awesome!  Sounds like she really wanted to spend time with you!
thats great! i love doing that too. we need more time with the kids
Sometimes that happens. Does she let you use her cooking stuff often?
Oh yeah, I understand. Did you ask your wife if she wanted some help?
Which one was it?
I've never seen it, is it good>
I hear you! I've always been a fan of babies! Why don't you get it done asap?
So what are you guys planning to do?
What kind of book is it?
That is awesome! What kind of book are you getting?
That's true- some of the people I've known have terrible in-laws. It's nice to know there are still good people in this world
That's great to hear. It's hard to find that nowadays, where love is king! So many bad people out there!
That's too bad. Can't everyone get a little involved?
That's a big problem. You have to make the kid think that all choices will make the best for him.
That is good! surprise parties are the best!
Thats great. Im happy for you guys!
That is good, do you have a lot going on?
Sounds like you have a great wife!
Oh yeah. Did the same thing when I was a roach infestation in the house. Went insane for a moment. Did that when I stepped on anroach, almost puke.
I hate those things too. Did you ever find a roach?
Why not? did you run out of gas?
Oh well that doesn't make it okay! I'm sure they understand! Did you make it to their party?
Did you ever text your momma?
I can imagine. My mother passed about 6 months ago after years of her being in the hospital and not being alert at all.
I love movies! What are you going to see?
What is the movie? The Purge sounds like a horror movie.
That's a nice gesture.  I wish more people would go out and help the needy!
That's a blessing. It's toting around in the cold, you know?
What was the puzzle?? was it an important or expensive gift?
That sounds like a fun puzzle!
I live in Florida...what did you do once you got there
What kind of problems did you run into?
Stretching is what I miss the most about America.
I'm so glad you're getting out of it. I was having a hard time after having a baby and it took me 6 years to get to the point where I would drive more than 30 miles a day. I'm glad you have a place to rest.
What are you remodeling?
Wow, that's great! That's a long term goal, so that is very impressive!
That's a bummer.  Is he getting a good grade?
Congratulations! That's awesome. I bet you're really proud of his hard work.
That's awesome!  Keep it up! Weight loss can really make you feel unhappy!
That is really awesome! I am happy for you.
I'm sorry you are feeling lonely.  I know exactly what you mean!
I'm sorry, it's really tough when that happens. Do you have supportive women around?
Really, who is that? A famous singer/ guitarist/ guitarist?
Wow, that is an amazing feeling
That's parenting. You're either good or you're not. It sounds like you gave him too much though.
Creativity is always needed. How old is he?
hahahaha yeah, I know that feeling. I went to a haunted house and I'm still scared to go in
That must have been scary
What ones do you like?  I tried Twitch for a bit but the chat is so terrible!
Yeah, it is frustrating sometimes. Especially when the results are the same, just bumped up.
Thats great, I am happy that she has achieved what she set out to do.  Its rare nowadays for parents to be proud of the children that are learning and doing well.
You must feel proud of your niece
Why's that
Just be confident and it will go great. You don't wanna mess up a relationship that good.
that's crazy! I'm in Texas and last time I've had bison was years and years ago!
Try any local butcher or restaurant! Sometimes they have it in bulk, so that's a good way to get a decent deal.
Is it a baby or an older rottweiller?
Oh, that would make me so mad. I don't know what I'd do if I lost my rottweiller :( Do you know why he keeps doing it? I would just keep putting him out!
I'm sure he's tired. How about you?
That must be stressful, I hope you get some rest.
Did anyone see it?
Haha.. that's pretty funny! Did you feel a sense of accomplishment, or did it make you a little sad? I mean, being a fly-swatter and not knowing what happened/
I would too, but being home with kids always makes it so much nicer!
That's really nice of you to be supportive of your husband during his deployment! You sound like a good and caring husband!
I'm glad she's ok! disabled people can be so scary
I'm glad to hear that she is okay now - that must be so scary!  Is there anyone who is able to help you now/
I have one of those. She's very drama-free, if you don't get her on a table she goes ham
she is a cat lover, i like mine too, she loves knocking things over and ripping them apart
Are you working on it on your off time?
Why don't you try another spot?
that's awesome, how long did it take to come out?
What was the name?
Wow! Why did they call in sick? That had to make you feel sick, especially since it was twice as long.
i know what you mean.
I bet you are going to be real annoyed when she gets back!
Oh man! That is so annoying! Did she say anything at all about it?
Thats wonderful!  I am so glad to hear that!  It feels good to be secure and enjoying your own home
That's awesome, it's been too long for me! I'm glad you're getting out
I'm so sorry to hear that, I know you are going through hard times right now but I'm pulling for ya. How's cat doing nowadays?
That's sad, I am so sorry for your lots
I know right? Do you know any way to help them find a home and be able to stay here during busy season?
That's really great of you. You are very charitable.
By doing what?!?!?!
What a nice man! What was the occasion?
I guess they didn't think it would happen to someone else but I can't fathom cheating on my wife.
Same here.  It doesn't make it okay to do but it doesn't make it any less terrible
Jupiter always looks like it's going to be engulfing us all at some point!   I'm so glad it's cloudy and clear for you.
Jupiter is a great place to watch though!
Congratluation.  How is it going?
That's fair, time with the baby is really important.
That's so great! My mom is the same, but I can totally see why you love her so much!
My mom is the same way. I love she is so giving and kind hearted. You are not alone my friend!
where you going shopping? why is that so bad
Where do you go the two hours to the store?
That's cool! Have you been on vacation before or is this your first?
That's exciting! I've never stayed at a Disney property! Have fun!
I bet that was a satisfying moment for you. You must have felt proud and relieved.
That is great, congratulations! What is your profession?
Really, do you have a lot of kids?
That's wonderful!  How old are your children and what do they like to draw?
That's nice of him!
That's great! It's about time he starts taking some of the load.
I'm so sorry to hear that! I hope things will get better soon.
That is a terrible situation. I really hope you get that position, too.
That's great! What kind of job is it for?
No, I am not a career field that I am interested in. But I wish you the very best!
Why is that?
Do they go on the regular or do they have a go-to place?
Oh that must've been so shocking. Did you two become friends?
How cool! Did you guys have a lot of fun chatting?
I'm so sorry to hear that! Have you thought about getting another one?
I feel you man. Just bought a huge Keurig machine. Hopefully it will still work after this?
oh thats hard, im sorry.
That's awesome. Where did you move? And how far did you move?
Wow, that's very mean.
I'm glad she didn't get hurt too bad!
I have a friend who deal with MS, what do you think about him going to the MS?
That's really sad. I hope he gets well soon - and maybe even better care can be given.
That must of been fun, Where did they live?
I would be so excited to see them! I bet it meant so much to you.
That's sound like a good idea. You sound ready for this.
You must've put in a lot of efforts to make sure you were ready for it!
Wow that must have brought up some good memories! Did you find anything cool in it?
How many kids do you have? That must bring up good memories.
Ouch! Why did he remind you of that?
hahaha I bet that was a nice proposal!
how did you feel when it happened??
Thank you for your service!
That sounds adorable! I love puppies, and happy birthday!
that sounds really cute! i'm glad you got a new puppy! is she a rescue?
that's awesome! I love a nice sounding dog name.
Did you call the police?
That is so bad! Did you file a report with the department?
Wow I couldnt imagine that!  I hope you are ok!
I am sorry that it is quite dangerous!
How long have you been waiting for this?
That's great! I hope you do well and congratulations!
That's wonderful. I just love to relax in my garden.
That sounds like a wonderful feeling!
Oh that must've been pretty terrifying!
That's great, they should at least get something in return right?
Congratulations. That is such an accomplishment.  Is this his 3rd year working this hard.
Awesome! Computer science is very impressive!
That's awesome! I love going to Disney World!
I think I will take the highway 30, it is only a couple minutes from my home! Maybe highway 6, it is the first time I have ever been in that area.
Oh no. Was it at work or on your own?
Oh no! I hope you are ok!
What did you want to speak about?
I feel you! That's the reason why I don't buy comcast.
I agree, it is so uncomfortable to be served with total obedience and authority that you feel entitled to.
I would be so annoyed if that was me!
I don't understand. What happened in Harvey?
What caused the warning?
What a nice husband! What did he get you in the ring?
What an amazing gift! What a kind person!
That's nice, how many people are in the room
Have you tried contacting the owner
That is awesome!!! Grand kids are an amazing joy
Thats wonderful!  How many kidss would you have then
Oh no, that's terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that. Will you need to go to his church?
I am very sorry to hear about your loss.
Oh wow! Did they do it in front of you? That's so sweet of them
That's nice! Did they sing happy birthday at work too?
Was it for college?
That's awesome! Studying really pays off. I know it would make me want to take it again, but I'm sure I can pull that off.
What did he do to inspire such great emotions?
That's awesome!  What class?
Big Bonuses are always a good thing!
Big bonus? What is it that he is usually receiving?
Why did he not come? Did he choose not to come to?
What did your brother do?
Why are you so confident?  Is there something good going to happen tomorrow, or are you just ready for the worst?
I am happy you seem excited. What did you have to do?
Oh my goodness. Why did she leave you?
I can't blame you there.  I'm so sorry that happened to you and I know how that is.  Are you doing alright now?
That's cool. Where were you going? Was it an important airport?
That's good to hear! I love traveling also, so flying is definitely not my favorite place.
I'm so sorry you're going through this
I'm sorry you don't have anyone to talk too! Maybe try joining some chats on fb?
I am so happy for you my friend!  I am also very happy for you because your parents were able to do that for you!
That is so sweet! What kind of computer did you get?
That's awesome man I love playing cards! What kind of table do you play?
wow that's awesome. I always lose so I don't know what you mean about the time you did
I can understand why! Spiders are so big and slithery! Do you know what makes them so slippery and double agent agent for your co-workers!?!
I can imagine! Have you watched the movies? I find the spiders creepy as well.
I agree, they are a great source of income!
yes, I agree. Last year, they really exploded.
Uh oh!  Did they apologize to you?
I'm sure it didn't bother you in the end.  What did they fix it to?
That's nice. Did you enjoy yourself at least?
That sucks. Did she say why she was home alone? Did you enjoy the time?
How old is he?!?!
That's awesome, how old is he?!
Oh my god, that's so bad! I'm really sorry! Is there anything that can be done?
That is so sad to hear. Cancer is something that can destroy a family.
I know that must have felt wonderful!
im happy you made it that far
Oh no, I hope you're able to get it fixed!
Oh, man! That's the worst! Guard rails give me chills. It sounds like yours doesn't sound good though. Do you have to pay anyone to fix yours?
Tornadoes are one the weirdest things.
Tornadoes are the worst.  Are you in your basement?
Wow, that was really out of character for you!
That's awesome! How much did she pay?
That's awesome! How long have you two been married?
That's so sweet! I am so glad you have someone to be there for you!
Oh no! Were you at least at a safe distance away from your mailbox?
Oh no that's awful! I hope it was just an honest mistake and not something he was after for some reason!
I am afraid too! Have you watched the Discovery Channel? They showed an interview with one that was frightening.
Oh my lord!  I am so sorry!  I hate snakes so much.  You must have been so afraid!
Why is that?
That is rough. Why did she leave?
How did it go? Was it scary at all or was you happy with it?
That does sound stressful. How did it go by the time you went in?
That is so wonderful! I am so glad to hear that!
That's amazing that you have that kind of relationship, it sounds like it would be difficult if it wasn't.
Where are you all going?
I hope so too! Is it because you like his cooking?
how is it going?
how much longer do you have to keep up this lifestyle?
That is great. How long have you been with her?
That's a really long time! How did you guys meet?
Holy cow! How often do you play the game?
Woohooo! That's awesome! I never win either... But I'm happy for you!
How old is she?
I know the feeling. I'm a little younger than my sister, and my dad promised me a quarter million back when I was in Junior High, but my mom kept it a secret from me.
That's too bad. Maybe you could bring a rain tarp or some sort of emergency supplies.
That would have made me so happy! I am so jealous.
What kind of opportunity did you get?
Congratulations, what position was it?
Oh no!  Was there anybody there to help you get back up?
Oh no, I hope you were okay!
Is it enough for your family?
Being alone at nights can really suck. At least you are saving up for your car payment.
That is exciting. Where did you move?
Wow, I'm so happy for you! That sounds like a great adventure. You'll be reunited with your people and your love!
Oh me too. I always get a little jealous and try to make moves.
I totally get that. My husband is married too, but I wouldn't let it affect me. If he was single I totally wouldn't mind going out with him..
when does it come out?
What movie is it
Oh no, public fart is pretty bad! Do you live in an area with high rates of chlamydia?
I'm with you. It's like my children are the ones in public now. I don't want to see it and I won't be able to sleep tonight thinking about it!
Wow. He must have been rubbing off on you a little bit.
Wow that's a pretty significant amount of time passed. Congratulations! What did he get you, a 14k?
That sounds so frustrating! It's not enough that people take care of their own, the enviroment can sometimes be so careless.
i hate that too
Why? Are there things that are unsafe?
That's so funny! I've always thought that being afraid of heights was a good sign! I am happy you got to go on one!
You must be anxious for your next interview.  Did they say when you would hear back?
That's awesome. It's good you worked hard, even if it was a month. I hope you like it.
I love Disneyland!
Oh wow that sounds exciting!!  Are you going with anyone?
Nice! What kind of car is it? I am guessing minivan?
What color is the new one?
That is nice of them, how long have you been married?
thats great of you
Its good that they want to help. But, don't get too attached.  Sometimes Goodwill has things that you don't even need or want, like cars.
Wow, she was so lazy and rude! How'd you react?
that is the most horrible thing ive ever heard.
What did they do?
I am sorry to hear that. Do you mind me asking why?
Aww, that's sad.  Maybe you can go out and just hang out?
I'm sorry, that must suck. Do you guys still keep in touch?
I am happy for you! I have goals of losing 40lbs and moving in 5 months. I need you to keep working at it!
I know what you mean. I have a friend who just lost 40 pounds in 6 months and looks like he's lost half his skin, totally tubby!
I feel the same way! What kind of animal are you talking about?
I really do not understand how people can treat animals so poorly.
what did you go for?
I am sure that was a happy moment for you.  What did you graduate with?
What channel is it on?
What provider offered the upgrade?
That's too bad. It's heart breaking when a loved one dies, but good friends are there to help when they need them most.
That is so nice of you to be there for her, it must be really hard for you.
Yes we do. We are def union with Mexico and i agree. We also need to build our trade deficit
I agree with you there. But it is never too late!
Must've been lonely. Did you get used to it?
You must have hated that
Why does your dog Kat live in a box, and your cat in a chair?  Is your dog just really old or what happened to make them move around?
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that she passed away. Losing a pet is never an easy thing, especially one's pet who you had for so long.  I love my cat, although he used to be a cat too, when he was little.  Are you planning on getting another dog in the
What is he doing well doing?
Wow, congrats. I bet he is happy!
What abuse?  You mean you have had pets abused?  That must be so hard!
That's terrible, did you speak to someone about it?
Oh wow I've never hiked in the mountains before! How scary was it to see the nighttime photos from your phone on the trail?
Oh I bet that was fun! I have never hiked in the mountains but I want to
Aw, that's sad. I know how that feels. I've been there with my girlfriend who has 2 dogs, they are like my children.
Aww, how long was she?
did he do better?
I'm sorry to hear that, can you try to get him to eat a little? I'm sure he will recover if you do.
I think he will make it. Take lots of breaks, that will help him along the way!
I can imagine it is very difficult and he must be stressed. I am sure he will get over it though.
Cool. What did they look like?
Have you been to many places? That would be so nice.  Where abouts did you see them?
I am missing it too. Where are you going?
Well that is very thoughtful friend. I wish more people would do that for their friends.
That was nice of them.
i hate when that happens too
brake slam! i do it all the time in the city. people dont know how to respect others.
I'm with you there! I'm always looking in my window at the worst times!
Adulting can be scary at times, but i think its part of being young
You are so sweet.
You sound like a great dog person. I wish I had a dog!
Oh no, that sucks! I know how it feels, losing power for days!
Wow, that must've been scary, what did you do?
I hope she didn't ruin the priceless memorabilia!
I bet that was a big deal to the mom. I am glad you didn't have to spend that much on a repair bill!
I can understand that.  I am gagging too now that you mention it.  I don't like to drink milk because it has so much sugar.  Are you gagging because of the milk?
Oh yes!  That's so gross!!!    Have you gone back to and gotten a taste for it again?  Sometimes that happens accidentally when you mix things up too often!
sounds relaxing.
It is so relaxing relaxing to listen to the rain falling on the roof as well.
Oh, I'm so sorry! That can really put you in a bad financial spot! Were you okay, though? Were you hurt?
I'm so sorry to hear about your car accident, but stay positive! Medical expenses can easily exceed $1000 even with insurance.
I've never been into gambling.
I bet that was a really cool thing to do.  Did you win anything?
I agree. I've been several times and really love it there.
That sounds like a blast! I'm glad you had a blast!
Yes. It's like...too soon. Too soon. Too fast.
Hahahahahaha. I once did something like that with a bicycle. A guy who really liked the bike was kind enough to lend me his spare.
Sorry?
Thanks for the apology. I have a feeling we are good now
I'm sure it must be very nostalgic
Wow.  That place sure isota bad.
What kind of presentation
Sounds like a good presentation. How did it go?
Yeah I've definitely felt that. It can get real uncomfortable at times. Sometimes you just want to smash the door and move on.
That's awful, I'm sorry.
That's awesome. I hate interest so much
That is awesome, you are very fortunate!
Did it happen while doing something important?
That's awful! I hope you are ok and can fix your finger?
Oh yay! That's exciting. I love shopping with my kids! What did you get?
Thats the worst. I hate having to go so late.  School starts tomorrow for me also.
That sounds very frustrating
That sounds terrible, I hope it's not too serious.
Oh no! That's never any good. Did someone bring you one or no one at least? Hopefully there was no hard candy there!
Awesome! School shopping can be a pain sometimes.
That's awesome! I'm happy you won.  I hate school so much.  Where I live, we have one day off a month.  It's just about sitting around waiting for grades to come.  I can't imagine what some of those stores will look like.
Online shopping will be SO helpful for you and it will save you so much money too!
I love shopping online. I wish there wasn't a time where physical shopping would be more expensive.
Oh my god! Did you kill it!!? lol
Oh my god! How big was it, maybe it could not harm you?
Oh no, what was happening in the play?
Avoided that theater for this reason alone, it is a no no for me too
What do you do for work
What does he usually get?
I'm glad it paid off for you!
That's pretty awesome. I don't know about you, but I hate to be stupid.
Oh no! Those were the good high school years though weren't they? I'm sorry to hear about your drinking problem.
oh my goodness, you didnt have a car?
i understand
I do like to study a lot. I need to study more though.
did she try to get in your window?
Aw, did it succeed?
What happened?
That's amazing! What was your major?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. But, I'm sure there must be something you are still looking into.
What did you do instead?
Did he have a good reason or did she get him in trouble?
That would make me so jealous.
I used to like watching movies on TV but Ive moved on to playing videogames.
I used to love playing video games but Ive been busy in life. Do you play them?
I'm the same way! I love riding the rides during the weekdays but weekends are so fun and peaceful. Are you at the Six Flags Company picnic?
I would hate being all alone during the winter time!  Is it because the weather is cooler?
What are you studying?
I'm a mechanical engineering major.
What had happened?
What was it
Little brothers can really have the talents to be really good and make others jealous! Does he practice a lot?
I used to when I was younger, but have since moved to a different state.
That is so scary! Have you checked the local police?
Oh no! Well I hope you can find someone to help you.
I bet that was a satisfying moment for you
I'm sure it wasn't as bad as it could have been. People are bowled hard at bowling, that doesn't mean you can't ball.
Oh, wow! I'm glad you're speaking to someone who your friend is able to talk things out about. For whatever reason, I can't stand when people do things like that and don't even say sorry or excuse me!
Yea it was probably financial.  But if you love her and you know you can trust her then just let it go.  There's nothing to be ashamed about.
Aw, that's sad, do you miss the area you were born in?
You sound really down on yourself about your age, being alone.
That's understandable. What year for you.
It will be fine
It's a good feeling when your ready for a new semester.  What year are you in?
That's a good attitude. I know it's hard to think concretely what your goals are during college, but whatever you do should make a difference.
That's awesome! That's a good feeling I know! It's good when you can just sit back and enjoy the moments while relaxing!
You can have an amazing meal without toppings.
how old is he
Oh my god. Have you had him since you were little?
What game is that
Ah, that's a tough one. Do you play wow?
That's unfortunate. Have they done something to upset the both of you?
That's really rough! I'm glad to hear that you're more mature about it than them.
I love the power outages.
I live in Florida, so I totally understand
That's great. I hope it goes well.
That's good. It's hard to study when you're tired.
Oh, what was the name of the band, may I ask?
What type of music was the artist known as?
What kind of bowler
I am sure he had something to do with it. Bowling is pretty fun, though.
Why?  Don't be nervous!  It's not a bad thing to get into, trust me!
It's a good attitude, new challenges will only make you stronger!
that happens to us all
If it's not there expect someone to take it to the shop! Mistakes happen but it's better than being unable to call a repair shop.
Oh no! That is always disappointing!  Utah is beautiful!  Be careful!  Stray!  Fly!
I love driving through National parks! I've never been to Canyonlands though.
Oh wow! What kind of car? What year?
What kind of vehicle?
You don't have a lot of choice when buying a used one- you either pay a monthly payment, or you don't.
I know how you feel... i had a car similar to this one used about 5 years ago... terrible transmission, bad radiator, bad tires all over the place.. just terrible driving. It's a scary, but exciting feeling to drive it!
I don't understand. Why would they do such a thing?
Oh wow! What are they going to do?  They are so rude.
Did you take it to the garage?
What happened to it??
Same here.. I get very anxious doing those things! Do you have an easy time presenting in front of a crowd?
I totally know what you mean! I get super nervous doing those things too.
That's pretty gross, what did you have them clean it up for? Did he have to give you some sort of oral tradition?
lol dogsitting is not fun, but i bet that was very painful for you
Hahah, that is a good story. Did they say something to you?
Haha...that sounds like it would be really embarrassing... but would you really roll windows up if they noticed?
What textbooks do you need? All of them? How many classes do you have this semester?
That is so nice of him! textbooks are so expensive
What did you do to finish it?
You did this for your country, you loyal  person.  Now go back to your rountine.
Did you have to pay extra for the supercharge?
What kind of car was it
Oh no why not? Do they smoke in moderation or something?
Oh no, why not? Do you live alone?
lol that is hilarious, ive never had an accident like that, ash is the worst
Yeah that's the worst.
That's so scary.
That's terrible. Are you ok now?
Oh my gosh! Really! Do you not have a bid for toilet paper?
I am always flush the toilet at work.
oh yeah what will that be?
What team is that?
What happened at Six Flags? Did they not trust you?
I love riding roller coasters! They can be very exciting but so scary too! Glad you enjoyed it.
That was nice. Did you get a lot of presents?
I am glad it was such a nice surprise!
Oh no! Did she get hurt or anything like that?
Oh that's terrible! I'm glad she was okay, but I'm glad they were ok also. That's kind of funny that you can see the effect of having a choking child. I'm glad they were okay.
That would make me nervous, but most don't care about that and will let you in for a few hours.
That's frustrating. Have you tried calling to complain?
Being a morning person myself, I can relate!  I love getting up early and having a few hours before work so I can do what I'm passionate about!
Being tired is not good for your health. You need to be more rest.
what did you hear?
I would go in your kitchen to investigate!  I am positive you will find it was nothing scary.  Did he say anything about it?
That is so nerve racking. What class was it for?
I can understand presentation. It is one of my biggest pet peeves.
I'm sorry to hear about that. I know it's a long process, but it's good that she is doing better now.
That is so sad. I am so sorry for your loss. Take it one day at at a time and know that there is someone out there who loves you.
That is awesome, I am happy that you are happy, that is one of the best things in life!
Coffee is always good
That's awesome! It's always nice to be able to have somewhere to get your fix on something!
That's a smart choice. Always be ready.
Congratulations, is it a high position?
That's great, how do you feel about working with the law?
What makes you think it might be on its last leg?
My friend got an xTerra last year! It was a blast to drive.
That's awesome! What are you going back to do?
That's pretty good! What college have you went to so far?
That sounds wonderful! I love to have a bit of time to enjoy our own company after a long day. It makes life so much better!
That's the best part! Nothing better than breakfast in bed after a long day at work!
Emergency? Well what's that? Hope it's not too urgent?
You're very fortunate my friend
What changed your view?
That's really great!  You must feel pretty good now.  You've taken the right steps.  You've also got some pretty cool friends in this world.  How has your life been going?
Oh that sounds fun! Where are you guys headed?
That's awesome. Where is it going to be?
That's nice to hear! What for her specifically or just in general?
Ohh, that's awesome! What kind of car?
Well that's really sweet of her!  I'm sure she knew exactly what you needed and where to get the right one!
That is sad. Why did they not invite you?
I am sad that my parents didn't attend my birthday No, they just are not wanting to come to it
Aww that sounds relaxing!
sounds like a nice relaxing sunday
Oh no that's terrible! Did everything work out okay?
That's great! I have a dog who's mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer when she was little. It was really their decision, not yours.
That sounds relaxing, but I wouldn't call it a win! hahahaha
That is adorable! I love wire dogs
I bet you're a little anxious about waiting.  How far away is she?
I am glad to here that. It must be tough.  But it must be more difficult when someone is away and no one confides in her.
Aww that's sweet!  Did he feel nostalgic and take a look inside?
Awe that's so sweet. What book were they?
Aww I'm so sorry to hear that. How long will she be gone?
Aww, that's sad. When will she be returning?
what ended up happening
What an extremely heated and argumentating exchange, I wonder if he was trying to prove a point or just really dislike each other?
I am sorry to hear about your illness, I hope he is doing fine!
That's so good! Did he improve a lot?
Why is that? Do they make you anxious?
That's how it works with me! I always look forward to when the person is waiting for me.
I agree dogs are great. I rescue them from all kinds of situations. What do you have.
Yes, I love dogs as well! They really are the greatest pets ever!
aww, poor little thing... I'm sorry to hear that... hope the cats a happy healthy long life together /
I'm sorry to here that. I had two cats that way. One was pretty old, one who had complications, and one that got run over. I hope she's doing better now.
That's terrible! Is it police or news organizations that are covering this up? I know police doesn't usually care, but I would be devastated too, like, what's going to happen if I get shot?
gas station shootings are so scary! im so glad there was only one victim!
I'm sorry to hear that.
That is so sad. Losing a pet is never an easy thing.
I know how you feel! I'm a stay at home dad and my son goes to high school out in the county next door to the school across town and isn't around very often.
That's rough, I'm in the same situation right now, but I have a great husband to help me out.
That's pretty cool.   Are you in the US?
Wow that's cool!
Why is that?
Oh that is sad. Maybe they will come by next year?
Disgust for what?
I would be equally as disgusted! Did you ask for a refund?
Did it leave a dent? I'm assuming you didn't leave it.
Did you atleast go to get the papers?
That's awesome. I hope I find that kind of caring sister when my time comes.
You should thank your her. She is a lucky girl!
Oh god, was it a wolf or something?
Oh my goodness that would freak me out!
Oh wow. That's mom. Of course you're getting the good end of the deal. What kind of car?
Really? That mustang is one of those cars where it makes no sense to buy it if you don't plan on it lasting more than 10,000 miles
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that! Why are you ashamed in your family?
I am sorry to heard that
Oh no. What happened if you dont mind me asking?
Friends shouldn't pull pranks. If you are truly disgusted you need to talk to a counselor about it.
Did it make you feel okay afterwards?
That is pretty terrifying
Where are they staying?  Are they staying in your house or going out on vacation?
Oh, that's a bummer. Have you tried to keep in touch with them?
Why is that
What are you doing to protect yourself?
Awh, that's sad, but why is that?
I'm sorry. I'm guessing you're looking for tickets sold online or at the theater?
i love vacations the most! i went to florida a couple of weeks ago and had the time of my life.
That sounds so nice.  Was it nice where you live?  I'm in FL and it snuck raining here for a few days when we were on vacation too.  Were you able to cancel any plans?
Wow, I have always wanted to cruise! Where are you going!
That sounds wonderful!  Is it for vacation?
Did the candy last you long?
I do agree, sometimes you just have to indulge and then it all felt worth it. Did you have any left?
That's great! Congrats. How long did it take him?
That's wonderful news! Cancer doesn't always give you a choice!
That's so frustrating!  You should tell him to hurry!  You might need to propose to him.
What?! Do you think he's trying to get revenge? I'd tell him to get back atcha
Congratulations. I am sure you will do great.
Fingers Crossed you get the job. MOCKED!!
That's not good.  Do they get irritated by it too?
Get a new pair of parents?
oh really, why is that
That sounds terrible but I guess life is more complicated than we give ourselves credit for.
Yes I do. Do you?
Yes I do have children and I do attend school but they are 18 now and going to university so it's just a relief to not have to worry norwork worrying about them being sent off to the gulag. Yes I do attend school, though.
Sorry for your loss. Life is very short and it is never easy to lose someone we love
Life is truly about the small things in the smallest of things. I am very sorry about your loss and wish you all the best
Oh cool!  I bet you had a good time and made lots of new friends!
That is pretty crazy.
That's awful! Hopefully she forgave you, and she opened herself up more to discuss.
It's natural to feel a little frustrated at times especially if you know you put in a good word for your loved ones.  Did everything get worked out, or did you have to call out/renew the visit?
Oh, I hate that feeling! What did they say exactly?
That sounds like a swell story.  It's good that your information led to a happy ending.
That's awesome! I've never been to the beach, but I love the food and beach.
That sounds awesome! I'm glad it sounds like you had a wonderful time.
oh no!! thats the worst!! did anyone see it?
That must have been so embarrassing! Hopefully no one got hurt
That's so sad! I've had a dog go missing before, it's not fun. Do you have anyone to help you search?
That is so awful to read :( I hope the puppy makes it
Right? Like hurting children! What a dunce!
That's really not good, did he get in trouble for something he did that isn't even technically correct?
Do you sneak it in so you dont get suspicious?
Hahahah, I do the same! But as a sweet mother I like my kids feeling like they have a sugar on their ice cream
At least the baby wasn't far!
At least you have a roof over your head and some friends to hang out with!  Maybe its time to find a new hobby!
Congratulations! That's amazing!
That's great! Nerve surgeonates seem like very under-appreciated people.
That is nice. Did you make your wish?
That is a nice surprise! What did he get you? A rose?
That sounds so exciting!!
That must have taken a lot of time!
AC broke on mine too. It's horrible!
I hate when that happens!
That's awesome. What do you plan on doing with your new house?
Great! Where did you guys move?
Congrats.You are so lucky.
I like running outside a lot but I don't think I have ever run a race before!
Oh no! What was it?
That sounds great!  It's nice to have a husband that is helpful and a good cook!
Really, since you just started running?
That's awesome!  What do you both do
Yeah? How old is she?
That is so cool! I remember when my girls were still in pre-school and playing, I used to get so distracted I would get lost in there!
That is crazy! Is there no one around you to call emergency services for?
Man that's so scary! I'm in Missouri, so when the lightening came, I thought it was going to rain and flood here. I'm praying that they don't get hurt too badly! Good luck!
Awe! I bet you're a happy mom then!
Sweet dreams
That happens sometimes, you can always reset
That can happen sometimes, you just need to break the bad habit of eating too much!
Why do you say that? Are you just not making enough money now?
That's terrible! You need to show he is wrong about what he is doing.
That sounds like so much fun!! How many kids do you have?
That sounds amazing!  How old are your kids?  I bet they loved it!
Awesome! What type of breed is she?
That sounds amazing!  What breed?
That must be very nostalgic for you
That is a good thing you are doing now
You are probably very proud of yourself. What position does the team play?
That's great! I love soccer.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm glad that you have an understanding and adviser. That can sometimes help.
I hope you feel better as soon as possible!  I'm sorry that you're going through this stress.
wow thats so sad.
I am sorry for the loss. Take your time getting over him
I feel sorry for you.  I once lost 40 pounds by eating healthy.. it is not an easy feat!
That's not healthy.
That's really unfortunate! I hate when something like that happens!
that is horrible, i hope you reported it to the police!
Oh, that's mean. Cats can't be trusted anyway, after all.
Oh no! I'm sorry you had to experience that!
That's amazing! You must be so proud of him!
That's awesome! I bet that made you feel really good! I'm sure he will love it.
what exactly went wrong?
Oh wow! That sucks! I would be so pissed off!
Oh no, that sounds awful. How long were they gone for?
Yikes that sounds awful.
I'm so sorry to hear that. That can be a very difficult situation to be in, so I'm glad you're ok!
That's awesome! I'm glad you are alright now! That sounds like a scary thing to experience.
Wow, that is a lot! I hope you did well.
Wow, what other courses did you take?
Oh no! I am so jealous of you! What are you going to do with your computer if it is not in repair?
Oh no. You need a whole computer? Man I need a whole computer!
Yes, many times.  It is very painful and very vomit y.  I once had to go on a trip and had to poop all over the bathroom.
Oh wow! That must have been humiliating! I am glad you are okay!
I get emotional roller coaster when I go to anything
That's too bad. But, I'm sure that you had an awesome time! It's always nice to be social, and that can make or break a relationship.
Yes I understand. I hope that it was a good decision on your part.
That could happen to anyone. It feels like the perfect storm.
What is the tumor?
Oh my goodness. I'm really sorry for your father, but it seems that the surgery went successfully.
I saw the first one and hated it, to this day it still scares me
That is pretty awesome! I remember when those movies came out too!
That sounds like a fun and romantic place to spend your evening!
That sounds like an amazing date!  Did she accept the offer of the free drinks?  That's so nice of you to be so generous.
Well at least you had something to do! That is always a plus. I am still searching for that "cool" place to drink but it is making me a bit envious.
That is so sweet of him! What kind of a watch was it?
I'm really sorry for your loss. Was it a very old grandfather or one of these new age collectors that's putting their hands on it?
What happened
That sounds really stressful. I'm glad that you took the call, though!
I'm the opposite! I love going downhills!
I'm not a fan of heights either.  Are you able to ride a little coaster at your own?  I used to hate heights as a kid.
That must have terrifying people in it!
That does sound like a scary experience! I would have to admit that I had trouble during the same time period with a similar name calling
That's sad.  How are you holding up?
Oh no im sorry to hear that! Im sure you are heartbroken up about that
Me too! I always had a bad experience with them
October is a long time to be haunted! I think you would enjoy it.
I would feel the same way, how annoying can it get!
How annoying! Can't people just be honest, instead of picking on people because they have something in their past?
That's pretty cool!  Did you go to any meets to get some lessons?
That is cool. Did you get to play any more?
Oh thats nice! Do you have any children in mind?
That is great. Do you have any hometheories?
Oh yea what are you doing for your vacation?
Universal Studios is a blast! Are you going to see your family?
I bet that must of felt terrible.
I hope you didn't get too depressed or anxious. Could you call her and find out why?
Did you do well on it?
Thats great!  I love Calculus.  I have been studying for weeks and am so ready for the test.
where did she leave?
That's terrible. Hope you didn't miss too much.
That's great! Any specifics or just in general?
Congratulations. You are lucky to have a nice complex. You don't always get to have that.
thats really good news! what was the job?
That is awesome! I am so happy to hear about your successful interview.
Some naturals just don't get it.  Did they get it eventually?
Some people are just born lucky! I'm not really sure how that happened, but I bet it felt great.
that is not good, i am sorry that happened to you
That's unfortunate, what college did you attend?
That's good to know. I try my best to be prepared when things get important.
What makes you think things will?
Thats so inspiring! What did she study?
That is great, how long did it take her to graduate?
I can understand that for sure
I like your thinking!
That's gross.
Oh no thats awful! Poor little thing!
A boy or a girl?  Are either your boys grow up?
That's great. Babies are so fun!
Was it a nice surprise?
What kind of car did your parents buy you?
Wow! Where did you go? I've always wanted to go!
That must've felt quite lonely.  Were you ever afraid at all about traveling?
Where did you see her fly?  Was it a professional flight?
Where were her parents?
Why is that
Why did he say never trust anyone
Wow!  That's a lot!  What happened if it didn't work?
Wow. I don't think I would ever want to fix a jeep.
Congratulations!  I know that is one of the happiest days of your life!
Congratulations! That's awesome news!
Wow! How exciting! Where did you land your flight?
Wow! That's awesome! Where did you go?
That's unfortunate, what did she do to upset you?
I'm sorry to hear that. shirts can be expensive
Congratulations! I'm sure it will look like a fine bill when born!
wow congrats!! what are you having?
That sounds like so much fun!
That does sound like a lot of fun!
Oh, that's so cute! Did she miss it and end up passing out?
That is terrible, how did the friends farm get hold of him? did he go to a rescue?
What happened?
I bet you were, that is no fun at all
Oh no, that's terrible. Did the people in your house get robbed?
That is a sight to wake up to!
Wow, that's wonderful. I've heard it's quite hard to have a child and to raise them both at the same time!
Congratulation! I am very excited for you!
Oh man! What?! :( That's so sad! I am really sorry. Was she okay, or did she have some health complications?
That is terrible, I have never been so heartbroken
What band was playing?
What a cool person! I wish I liked music.
Really, so why do you think that would be the case?
I would have been scared too!  I cant wait until I get out of there! ha ha
New home?
Oh nice. Are you in a higher income city than the one you live in now?
Did you end up having enough time to have him?
That's crazy!  I would have thought that having people in your life that care for you and would help out would severely limit the amount of free time you had with them, lol.
How'd that go?
That is great! How did it go?
What do you repeat yourself in the past?
I know exactly what you mean! It's the worst feeling!
That sounds like so much fun! I love pizza! What kind of pizza did you have?
That sounds great! Pizza is one of my favorites too!  What kind of pizza do you like?
I graduated in 2004, when was your senior year?
Criminology is not easy by any stretch of the imagination
Oh no! Did they give you a reason why?
I'm sorry, but I think you'll get a better offer elsewhere!  What was the job?
What kind of sketchy place? Like the ghetto?
Yeah, I don't like sketchy areas either. Did you go to Times Square, or any other high profile locations?
Oh no! Hopefully no one was hurt at least
Oh no!  Did you apologize to her?
That's a good thing. Do you have somewhere you want to move to already?
Congratulation! I recently moved into a place that is affordable and nice to live in. You should give it a try.
That's really awesome that you were able to get there ready. What was the emergency?
That's awesome, it's good to be prepared!
Oh no!  Did they find out or was it an accident?
Oh no haha that is a terrible situation but we all make that mistake at those kind of bachelors parties
That's awesome! Congratulations! You must be very happy and excited to raise him.
Wow! I bet that felt surreal! Congratulations! That is awesome! I am happy you have such an intense attachment to him!  Do you have children, or will you be sole parent?
Customer hate that customer! What did you do?
Oh that is so aggravating! Did you end up telling them to go to their manager?
Why is that? Do you always look away?
I'm sorry that it doesn't work out with you.   How do you feel about being unnoticed/ignored/flipped?
Is it a competition type of sport?
I love swimming.  I was too dumb to realize we had a pool at the pool.  Now I love going
That was nice of you. soup is one of my favorites.
She sounds like a sweetheart!  What did you have for lunch?
That's good to hear! What do they do for you?
That's really sweet! I'm glad that you have that to be grateful for. Families are the most amazing thing on this earth
Was it your birthday?
That's nice! Was it a birthday party for someone special or a graduation?
Are you hurt?
Oh no! You should have grabbed that as soon as you could have! I hope you are OK!!
Congrats! You must be so happy for her!
Congratulations!  That was really cool of you.  Most people wouldn't do that for a living.  She must've put a lot of work into training you.  What an amazing dog
Why?
That's really rough! Why didn't they take you along when they went to traveled?
How does he do that?
I feel you, I am the same way. I work part time too and have no one to spend my time with.
Ugh, that's so gross. What restaurant did you go to, and what did you do?
That's good. Did it smell bad?
Did you enjoy the rides there? Did you ride any rides?
They are really well made!
That's rude. Did he apologize?
Friends don't do that sort of thing. If they did, I doubt their apology would be anything but playful.
Why not make some then
I am sorry to hear you are shy.    Where are your frineds?
How come? Is everything okay?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that, you seem to have a good girlfriend though
Horrible name for that movie! What was it, if you don't mind me asking?
Horrible movies always seem to get on my nerves! What was the movie?
I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass?
I'm very sorry to hear about that.
Why she left?
She didn't like you or your lifestyle?  I get it, sometimes it takes a while to find someone right.
Sounds like a great time. Did you guys have fun?
That sounds wonderful! How was the weather?
I'm sorry they don't have a good social conscience.
I feel the exact same way.  If they act patronizing it makes me so uncomfortable and I get closed.
Do yall not go together as a group?  I have a very large family and it's hard to find people to enjoy dinner with!
I love eating with family! Do y'all do it all together or separately?
I bet you were happy!  Did they get you a lot of presents?
Was it a surprise to you as in a way that you did not expect?
I know the feeling.  I wish people didn't treat each other like this.
i agree. people treat everyone the way we do to them
Why is that?! What do they do to not notice?
I feel the exact same way! I feel like they never paid me attention in school because they were busy or weren't talking to me as much! Don't feel bad though. I'm starting to feel the same thing... it's discouraging
That's terrible! Did he get into any electronics?
That is annoying. Do you have another dog?
I think you should confront them about that.
I would tell management as well. That's pretty rude
Why does that usually happen
I understand. I have had my heart broken before.
How exciting!  I am also waiting for my AAs in healthcare administration.  I hope you do really well with it.
Congratulations. I am sure it will be exciting.
I do too! I don't want to be nervous, but I always worry about hurting myself!
I understand that! The dentist is the place to go if you have any health anxiety!
Wow!  Tell me about the job, I would love to hear about it!  Does it pay a lot?
Yeah you are right, sometimes luck has an advantage too
hahahaha I've never been married, just exotic exotic exotic. But that sounds like a great idea!
That's baseball.  I don't watch a lot of sports
I love watching Sox games.
Congratulation! What kind of car did you decide to buy?
What year of car is it?
I would have died, I hate bugs
That is scary, bugs are the creepiest things.
Wow, I bet that was really good and you really appreciated what she bought.
Scotland is such a beautiful country! I am Scottish and I love it too!
Interest are you thinking of comparing prices across different companies?
People are so much more open and helpful up there than in my neck of the woods. I'm in Wigan, where the people are always friendly.
Oh no.  Are you okay?
Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Was he in a really bad car accident?
time for Plan b
Lightening always strikes twice as hard as it actually is here, so that might be bad for you. At least you can hide in the bathroom with a towel!
did you do everything you needed to do?
That's really nice of you. I wish my family was that organized and engaged.
Sounds like a grand old time. What did you do?
Sounds like a grand night! I'm jealous! Hopefully tomorrow is as nice for you as it was today!
How is it so divided?%,3|4|4_5|5|5,<
I do too, its quite sad actually.
Thats awful, my father had the same issues. I hope he is in a better place now!
Oh my, that is so sad!  I'm really sorry for your loss.  I've lost both of my grandparents before and know the pain very well and I can't imagine what it's like to go through that.  Take care to be with family during this time.
Why do you think that?
I'm sorry, I hope you guys are having fun together!
Who are you going to see?
No, I'm sorry. Who are they?
wow, that's a good sign at least
That was so kind of her! I'm sure she really wanted to do a good job
Oh how neat. Did you change anything for them. Mine started back up this Friday.
Oh yeah I forgot about that. Kids come so quickly!
Was it really hard to get tickets?
I love Virginia beaches, wasn't too bad. What beach did you end up visiting?
That would be so fun!  Did you go with anyone special?
Wow! Did you get a nice chunk back?
Well that's disappointing. I'm sorry to hear that. But happy blessings to you!
That is really cool!  Did he tell you why he was surprised?
That's awesome! You guys must really be getting to know each other well.
How'd he get it built? Is it somewhere you're going for work or something?
He sounds very happy
Thats the worst part. you just want one to make a night of it... but you cant get it unless you ask them
Everyone likes what they like, there's no sense in being mad at someone else.
You could always start with a sandwich.
Me too! Do you have any plans?
I have one day off this week. Not sure about the off day though. What do you do for work?
A friend should never support their friend. That's unprofessional
That sucks. Maybe he should train with a different guy.
That's horrible! I'm sorry to hear that. Is your doctor reluctant to treat you?
I'm sorry you're having trouble with it. What are you trying to avoid in the diet?
I can't even imagine! Are you ok now? Any damage control done at your home or elsewhere?
Tornadoes arent fun, but they can also be very devastating
How'd it go, are you happy now.
Thats awesome! Did he get you the right one?
I love driving in my holidays car, its just lovely. no matter what you do, just revs baby revs.
I'm sorry to hear that her decorating died, did she artistic license it from her when you were little?
Sounds like you are a very lucky person!
That's awesome. Family should always be a priority over money.
That's too bad. Maybe you should wait for it to return?
That's quite a ways. I'm sure she'll adapt. It's not like she stopped taking vacations before.
What kind of job is it?
Nice! What does the new position entail?
That's good that you were able to leave him, it sounds like a stressful time.
That is very trusting.
Oh no!  Did she actually say that she would tell you eventually?  That was so nice of her, but still!
What was the secret was?  I'm so sorry to hear that.  How long ago was this was?
Wow I would be to! What did you do?
Wow. Did the shadow jump scares you a little?
That sounds great!  What movie did you watch/eat on the night?
That's great! I'm happy to hear that you had a nice meal and didn't go into drama, that sounds like a great family time.
oh no :( is he doing good now?
I'm glad you had someone you could lean on to.  You're a great owner.  I know you were really there for Riley.
She probably understood, you did you try to be there to support her?
It's hard to not be a little harsh when someone is hurting someone they love.
That's never fun. What's the problem?
I'm sorry you're going through that, is it treatable with food?
That's frustrating. Have you tried talking with her about it?
That's so aggravating! I would try telling her directly if she isn't listening to you. Sometimes you have to direct your workforce to do things properly.
I hate cats... they are just the most annoying pets.
Aww, I would cry for a long time.  Did she have a good cat then?
That's awesome! How much did you pay for the tickets?
That's pretty awesome!  How much did you pay for the ticket?
Wow, what a lucky day!
Oh really? What made you do it?
Oh no! How did that make you feel?
Your husband is a hard-working man! If he was being rude to her, he should apologize!
It's good that both men took action! That makes a big difference in the grand scheme of things!
What happened?
Someone must have knocked down your mailbox! That's awful!
Did you have someone break in?
That's good that you have something to backup yourself in a case like this.
Sounds great! What did you have in Mexican food?
Aww that sucks. Hopefully she'll be back soon to visit you.
Oh wow. What subject? That can really get on your nerves!
Are you prepared? I'm sure if you work hard it'll come out good.
That's pretty neat, I haven't gone to a single sports game in my life!  Are you a big hockey fan?
Aw, I'm sorry to hear you missed out. Maybe next time! A lot of younger people are getting into hockey.
Did you give it a try and see if it would chase after you?
Central Texas here too. We don't get many dogs here. Only coyotes and raccoons :) I'm glad the little guy was close by.
Oh man I'm so sorry to hear this!
Oh my god, so sorry to hear! I can't wait to tell you what went through your mind when reading the news.
Aww, you must be lonely. Have you tried going to your neighbors to cheer you up?
Hahaha I think you are on point!
Awesome! Congratulations. Are you happy for him?
Oh wow! Congratulations! That's awesome news!
Wow nice!  What is she going to school for?
Oh no! Do you think you have diabetes?
I have been on a diet too.. but only a few snacks and I am good!
what kind of car was it?  did you call the police?
What kind of car were you in?
That's so sad. Was it a random illness or was it some sort of brain issue/
Wow that's so tragic! I've never heard of that show, but it sounds like an interesting show!
Sounds like your night has been very entertaining, have you watched game of thrones?
That's really frustrating, isn't it?
That is a big change!  Are you going to be ok in the new place?
That sounds quite interesting. I am sure you are going to be fine.
How exciting for you!!  How is it far away?  Do you miss anything?
I bet that must be exciting
Uh oh. What do you have going on? Hopefully nothing too bad.
They still have a few hours left? I would be mad too!
I would be afraid. What did you do?
That is such a sweetheart!
That would suck!  Did you call back to make sure it wasn't you?
I hate when they do that
Congratulations! Are y'all having a boy or girl?
Oh wow, that is such a great surprise!. Do you have any idea what you might be having?
I live in the UK. Halloween is our national holiday. Did you do anything fun at the party?
That's a cool theme. Did people get really into it too?
Sorry to hear that. How did that happen?
That must've been devastating. Did insurance cover your loss?
Oh no. That is terrifying!
That is awesome. How sweet. Was it scary?
I hope it went well for ya!
What was the plan?  Did she have a presentation at school?
I saw it too! It was pretty good! What was your favorite part
I hate it to. I can barely stand to look at pictures of lawnmower accidents!
That's always a good feeling! How did it make you feel when you looked at some of your old memories?
I bet. That must of been a trip down memory lane.
Aw, that stinks. Everyone deserves a break from time to time!
Maybe you should move too!
Oh no! That would make my blood boil! What did you do after?
LOL!  I would have been like a mad woman getting mad at him.  Was you purse returned to you?
Wow, that's awesome! What kind, and what color? What was it?
Mustang are awesom. Did she have to work long?
That will be nice. Where are you headed to?
I love taking vacations! I am sure it will be lots of fun!
Thats sounds exciting! I hope you have a good time!
That sounds like sooo much fun!!! What are you guys gonna spend the money on??
That sounds like so much fun. I've never even been to the blackjack place.
Wow. That's odd. Why doesn't he pick up?
That's really interesting! Does he do things like that to make him feel good or make you think you don't need him? I could see how you'd feel some sort of way to respond.
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.
I'm sorry to hear about your loss. Where did you guys all go?
Wow! That's awesome! I never win and have never won more than $5. What did you do with your extra money?
Congratulations! I know that $1,000 won't buy you much, but it's still a great surprise!
That's awesome! It's great when men are truly appreciative of what they do for other people's lives!
Wow!  What for??
That is a nice story! What was the reward for that>?>
That would really annoy me!  I would scream at her!  What did you do?
She should have known you'd let her do it. You don't deserve that.
That's so sweet.  Did he get a lot of presents?
That's really sweet of you and I'm sure that he really appreciated the presents!
Oh no! I am so afraid to fall on the cords, I have had that happen before!
That sounds embarrassing.
That's wonderful to hear. I'm not sure how it's to feel when other people don't have it so lucky.
i agree. retirement is a great goal to have.
Oh no! I hope that doesn't keep you up!
oh my goodness!! that is so scary! i am so happy that you didnt have any injuries. i am so heartbroken
I'm sorry to hear it! Is it for work, vacation, or both?
I understand that completely, I am in the same boat right now with my son.
Yeah that's a hard age for that. My son is just 2 and a half. But when he moved out of his mom's place, he got into his last great college years and went off to medical school!
Yea I understand, kids grow so fast and it can be hard when you have to worry about them moving out!
Good job! Did you study hard for it or were you just smart in general?
Hey, if you study hard enough at the end of the year you'll do just fine!
That is so sweet! Where was it to?
That sounds really great!  I'm so happy for you!  I'm doing a secret vacation to the beach in September!  I'm really looking forward to it!
Where did you take that lie?  I've never heard of a "lose yourself" before!
What was you excuse? Why did you lie?
That's awesome, I've never won a contest.
I would be very jealous of you if I were you!
That's awesome! How much was it, and how much did you win?
Small amount of money is still money
That is really hard.  When friends move away, that usually signifies a change in friendship.  I'm sure you miss them a lot?
You can always call them! Or use the phone app!
Oh no, so sorry to hear that. That is a terrible thing to happen to someone
I'm sorry to hear about that. That sounds awful. I hope that you weren't injured, though.
Did he do anythng interesting?
oh my goodness,  is he very calm?
That's great to hear! Relationships take a toll on our life. It's good to hear that your life is going well.
I am in the same boat! I recently had an awesome relationship. It's been rough, but we are getting there.
what was it
Who sent it to you?
That sucks! Did you ask her to replace it or replace it with one of similar qualities?
How long has it been broken?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Is it something they've already decided on?
I am so sorry that happened to you. Is the baby better?
Yes, I loved it!
I have seen it
Really?? Thats terrible. Do they still have Toyotas there?
Oh that's really sad. Did toys r Us ever reopen?
Oh no! Were you honest with her?
Oh no! Well it's ok to let things cool off eventually.
That is wonderful. How long have you been together?
That is good, cheating is not good for a relationship.
I understand that, I have dealt with that with mine.  How did yours turn out?
I can understand that
How happy will he get you then?
Thats great!  Make a wish!
IT was so much simpler wasn't it. What was your favourite part about it?
I know, right? It'd be like a time machine!  What would we do then, hu?
sounds super scary! i hope you stay safe
Oh I bet! Is your town really close to the hurricane line?
What is the name of your favorite game?
Expansion packs are always awesome! What is the name of your character?
Congratulations! I'm happy to hear that!
Congradulations
Yeah it is really nice isn?t?   So you have the nice set of minimalist living essentials.  What do you like to decorate?
You don't like it when people rearrange the same things for no reason?
Oh my! That must be so terrible. Are you okay?
I'm so sorry! I think that's the worst possible thing for you to go through.
Awesome! I bet that's so rewarding!
Congrats!! That is so awesome!!
hahaha I'm not sure yet how I feel about him but okay. What kind of puppy do you get?
hahaha I'm sure your still processing the puppy. What breed is she?
Good for you! I hope you find great bargin
I imagine that's going to change as college goes on and you get experience and certification.
What were you wanting in the game?
I know how that feels. What game was it for?
I bet! That was a good movie!
That is awesome! I remember my mom saying the first time we saw it, "I'm so old too, I can't remember anything about this!" I bet that made you feel good.
What does 5 mean?
Ah I see. What made him or her moving so bad?
Oh no. It's hard to see people you know going through a hard time, but it's good to know she's close by to try to cheer her up.
Oh I am sorry to hear that.  Hang in there!
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! I have lost my job before and I know how stressful that can be! I hope it turns around for you soon!
Why do you hate the current president?
I agree. I wish our political discourse were more civilised
Oh, sorry to hear that you had to miss family. Do you enjoy single life?
I'm so jealous! I'm in the Midwest, we hardly ever get to anything. You get weekends where you can just stay home and relax, but you know it's always so quiet and boring out there. I'm sure your days were wonderful though!
I hope he's ok. Do you think he's lying to you?
I hate when that happens. I hope he feels better
I'm so sorry to hear about this but I am happy you have someone you can count.
Im so sorry to hear about that, I know how hard that can be!
Oh wow! Me too! I feel you! I'm in South Florida. We always get slammed!
Storms are the worst!  We live in an area that gets hit really often so it's the only time I get to see them.  Are you in the south?
Did you keep any of it?
Oh man! Have you looked in your attic or maybe it's headed straight for your neighbor!
Oh no!  Did you kill it?  I would have
Oh no that's horrible! I'm so sorry! I hope you can find a suitable hiding spot for it, even if just behind you in a closet. That really stinks to have to sleep with those creepy crawlies every where you go!
I'm sorry! I hope you do great!
I think you'll do well!
Oh, that's tough! Have you prepared?
I'm sorry, but I'm sure you're prepared! Do your best to think ahead, and maybe have a few drinks beforehand!
Why did you sell stuff?
That is awesome, what did you sell?
That is great. I think it is nice when families have a trusting bond.
I agree with you there, it's the very foundation of a healthy relationship!
Wow, that must've really messed up. Was your house okay?
Wow, that is a crazy story. What made you evacuate?!
That is very annoying to deal with especially if the flight was important to your trip. Where was the airline flying?
That is very bad customer service by the airline. Did you speak with an agent about this?
That's great! Congrats! How long has it been since you have taken the course?
that sounds amazing!!
I'm glad you are able to reconnect to such an important part of your life. It is fun to be able to experience those things again and remember when they were exciting and different.
I used to enjoy going with my dad too when I was little. We had a lot of fun
That's the worst. Did they find it or did you not eat it?
Oh no. I am so sorry. Did they find it?
That sounds like it could have happened to someone else!
That is a good way of looking at it. It happened to me when I was in college and I learned the hard way too.
I can't wait either! Who are you pulling for?
Roll Tide!
oh really? what did you do?
Oh no! I hate when that happens!
Wow, how was that? Did you guys have a nice celebration?
I can imagine how proud you were! What was his senior thesis?
That's great. I'm grateful to have people like that to help. So many people just want to be a "damsel" and let us down.
I can imagine, but that's so nice of him!
That's crazy, did you ask your neighbors about it?
That is terrible and really needs to be added on asap.  Thank you!
That sounds like an easy fix!
Are they going to give you money back?
Did they steal a bunch? I hope it wasn't a lot.
That's such an awful thing to do. Did you confront them?
Wow that sounds like fun! How many years of experience did you go through?
Wow, really? Where do you live?
Hahaha that's awesome! What kind of rock band was it?
They're playing live with no instruments or a backing track, that sounds crazy
Really! That is so cool!
That is cool, what kind of bowling do you play?
Oh no, did you do anything about it?
That's sounds like it would make me pretty peeved...
That's awesome! Congratulations! What are you doing to celebrate?
That is awesome. It is always nice to break the debt. Debt collectors suck!
What mistake was it?
It's a good attitude.  You sound confident in what you're trying to learn from your mistake.
What are you studying
That is awesome! I am glad you have started to look forward more and be more engaged in school!
That's awesome. I hope the company helps him out as much as it can.
That's very lucky for him but also makes me jealous a little.
That's a bummer. Did you lose any fingers?
I have never been bowling.
Oh that's cool!  What kind?
He should have bought it for him. That is not a toyota 4runner. That is a toyota 2 stroke.
I agree, upgrades are always needed and appreciated! What kind of car is it?
That's awesome! I just got a new car also. What kind of car did you get?
What a nostalgic place those nostalgic emotions. Was there anything in particular that made you remember?
I love those nostalgic feelings
Oh my, I'm glad they are able to bring him home!
I'm sorry to hear that. My son is also in the hospital and in the NICU right now.
That is great, I am happy for you
That sounds great! I am so thankful for having some land to do stuff on! I have a small patio with an out door back yard. So I can just mow my own lawn and chill out! I can't wait to get my balcony built either!
did he get mad at you
She doesn't have to feel sorry for you. It happens sometimes
Family reunions are always so fun. Do you guys usually go out with them a lot?
Family reunions are so much fun!  I'm sure they will be a great time.  Are you having it locally or online?
That is awesome! I am happy for you!
You must feel really proud! What was the old record?
what are you planning to be working out?
That's good. You should do a lot of self-exploration and take yourself out to lunch every day.
How long does he bowl for?
That's great! Has he practiced a lot to get better at it?
Uhnn!  There must have been something really upstairs.  There was a tv playing music!
That's pretty funny though. You should put a call out to complain.
That's got to be hard to deal with.  Were they doing anything wrong though?
If you really want to impress them, try rocking out on some country or rock.
probably someone playing a prank on you?
Haha that's pretty crazy. Did the police come?
That sounds great! Where did they move?
That sounds amazing, I love grand kids stories. I bet they are going to love it!
Good times? Yeah? Why is that? Better times?
Yeah I get that. It's hard not to take those holidays with you and reminisce.
You must have prepared very well then!
I agree, I try not to get too nervous.
did he scare you or what happend?
Hahahaha...that's great...I guess they have some things you don't see everyday...I had the same feeling when my mom was walking her cat lol...I was walking her cat walking her dog and some figure jumped out from behind some trees in the distance
Thats great.control your eating habits.You are so smart!
You can do this too! Switching from sugar to sweetened drinks has helped me a lot with my weight.
Nice!  Are you envious?  What kind of car?
Hey a fellow chevy driver/ owner. What kinda car do you have?
I think you should wait. A bad incident happened to me and I sold it because it did not meet repair and replaced.
You should take this phone with you! Sell it today and take a nice trip.
That sounds like quite a pleasant place!
That sounds like fun, though you must be pretty nervous!
Oh my, how terrible!  Did you have any contact information stolen?  I'm sorry!  You should contact the police and have it taken again!  That is so sad.
That sucks.  Did they do it at a grocery store or at work?  Did you call the grocery store?
That's pretty good.  Being grateful is the way to be happy!
Some people just don't appreciate anything. I'm glad things are going well for you and I'm glad you're comfortable too. I'm just thankful I don't have to work all that much to be comfortable.
What was the problem?
I love blankets, are they expensive?
That sounds wonderful.  It's hard to find someone in Scotland!  Was he good friends with you, too?
I love flies.
That is so true. I bet your very grateful.
That's good you have that realization and perspective.
Aww that's so sweet! You should give her a tail if she's giving you a bunch of kisses!
I do have a cat, but that is about it
Awwwwwww, you'll still be on time!  I know that was the biggest one of the year for me, but I was dreading mine as well.  What year do you start school?
I'm sure you'll be fine. Just try to stay calm and do your best you can. It's normal to feel nervous, especially with an expensive subject.
I can get that way too. It's really not a good thing.
I know how that is. Sometimes we have to be a "big guy" in order to be accepted. Just remember everyone has bad days sometimes and we're all going to be different on that day.
That's awesome! What are you going to school for?
You can do it! You got this homie!
Oh that's cool. What kind of car?
That's awesome!  I bet he'll drive that sucker into the lake when he gets it.  lol
Oh nice! What kind of car?
I would love an xTerra or even a 4runner! I have an honda accord I love so I know what it like to be poor.
Oh no, were you hurt?
Oh, that must have been so frightening! Did you guys drive safe?
ok
It's funny how you feel that way about something that hasn't happened in your life yet.
Are you happy?
What have you been trying to do to improve your life?
what did you get
That sounds delicious!
That's really cool. I'm Indian and have always wanted some of that stuff!
That is great, do they sell dried beans?
What happened?!
That sounds like an unexpectedly scary thing for sure!  Did you act scared?
That sounds so painful. How old is your dad?
Haha I am sorry to hear that. I guess he must have been fit to work a boat, though!
What life did he have?
it is really sad. i feel bad for people who have been through such
It's sad we don't have more mental health care in the US. It would really make a difference if we did.
Aww, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been seeing her recently?
That's amazing that you got to see her again, that must have been so special.
That's so crazy! I remember when that story first broke, it made my heart sing!
I remember that too! It was crazy.
What is the difference if I may ask?
Yeah, kids really do. I'm a teacher myself and it's easy to forget.  I think I'm going to have to start bringing the kids to school by themselves more often.
Wow, that's a bold move to have all that stuff. Did it work out well?
That sounds like an amazing event that you would go through!
Aww, that's so sweet!!!  How old is he?
That's awesome.  How old is your son?
That sounds scary! Are they gone now?
Oh wow, that's quite the change! How is everyone handling it now? Do you still see them?
That's cool...did it make a friend?
thats so awesome.. im glad you found it.. and yea i have an allergic cat myself
wow thats awesome
That sounds amazing, I'm so glad she took the leap!  And congratulations to your friend!  You both must be very proud!
I've been looking for a reliable way to watch it. Do you have a smartphone?
HALO! I've been a loyal hulu Plus member for a couple years now
That's horrible!  Were you able to find out what breed it was??
Oh no! I hate when animals are mistreated.
I can't either! I hope no one got hurt!
That's horrible! I can't even imagine!  How old are your kids if I may ask?
How fun. How old were they
That is nice. Did you had fun at the party
Oh, wow! What are the orders for? Are they for anything exciting?
Where are you stationed?
I get where you're coming from.  People are so rude!
Right? Why do people think animals are people? So stupid.
Those were good christmas memories for sure.
Yeah the holidays are the best.  I love that I get to take my kids on their favorite days too.
yea i used to spend a lot, now im pretty broke
That's a lot for a diet.  I wonder how they can afford it
wow congrats! where are you moving to?
What part of Texas have you moved to? Are you going to be in College or something else?
Is he right though?
That's good, at least it was prepared.
How do you feel when you get called aunts?
You are so right. That situation made me very special. My family is very special also.
Oh no, I am sorry, is she just really old?
I am sorry, that must be so scary
I'm so sorry for your loss. That's a really hard-knock situation to deal with.
Oh my god, my parents are getting old. I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing someone is never an easy thing, and I think an overwhelming sense of loss for the family comes with the passing of time.
That is a blessing, not a curse! Hopefully you won't be out of range again for a while.
That is great that you had people to help you.  I am so happy for you and the family.  I am sure that you felt relieved and at peace.
Are you ready for vacation?
I feel you! It's like being a parent and having to be patient! It's exhausting!
That's awesome. It's always nice to be in a relationship where you stay on the same path
Thats awesome.  I am happy to hear that.
Oh, what station was it on, if you don't mind me asking?
Who are those songs?
How do you think you did on it?  Did you get a good grade?
I'm sure you did fine! Did it feel familiar at all?
Four days? I don't know of anyone who likes that game! Did you do it on stream or video?
He must have felt so accomplished! I would love to see that!
What is the country he is playing for?
it's also a lot of fun taking those jumps!
I teach in the south but I live in Florida. I'm afraid of planes but it is my passion
That's cool. Do they get it when you're little?
I bet that's great fun for everyone!
That's the worst, when they don't want to sell it and instead try to maintain the house. I hope you're happy with their decision.
I'm sorry you had to go through that
I'm sorry to hear that. What was wrong with your horse?
Oh my gosh!  My husband had a similar problem and the doctor said he had a possible tummy cancer.  Are you feeling any better since your horse died?
Do you enjoy your privacy?
That sounds like you guys are best friends!  Do you often go out together?  Do you guys go out to eat at restaurants together?
I am glad to hear that! It is always good to finish something that makes you happy and accomplished!
What did you get your doctorate in
Where has she been?
Oh, wow!  Why did you think that would happen?  And also, no course to help her study.  That's awesome you are getting back in!
Oh man! I hate cleaning! Do you have a job? Cleaning is so fun!
Oh that's great. Where did ya'll go?
oh that's really bad, did anyone see?
I'm sorry to hear that. I use a hair dryer at home all the time and it barely does any good, unless you put a lot of pressure into the hair
What was the bad experience?  I'm so curious.
What kind of mistakes did you see/ notice/ occur/
Haha.  I've had that happen.  Something fell off the shelf, got bumped into another shelf, then came crashing down on the ground.  Was everyone around you okay?
I am sure no one really cared who you were, as long as you had an expensive display.
Oh, I hope she is doing okay?
I'm glad to here you understand, it can be quite lonely. I hope you feel atleast a little better now that she is here.
Have you heard of Asheville or Raleigh? both have a large transplant following. You can also try calling any local radio stations to see what is going on
I've been there, it's definitely not a fun way to end up. Do you have friends in your new place?
Yea, my rent went up ten times too. In four years it went up tenfold. You just have to keep putting your head up because that's what they do to people who aren't ready for them. I'm glad you escaped that hellp!
I was actually in Cleveland, but my family moved there when I was a child. I am so sad that you had to leave your home in that terrible condition!
Oh that sounds fun did it rain?
5days is a really long time to drive.
Oh my gosh! That's so awful. Is she better?
I'm glad that she's better!
I was just saying the other day that I wasn't too bummed out about summer ending.
Well that is a very positive take on things.  Summer is usually the boring period of our life for us.
That's unfortunate. Weight loss surgery is not easy.
I feel sorry for her, but I hope that it turns out ok for you!
I hate losing in general
I'm right there with you! I feel like if I don't do well in something for a while it's no use going back to where I was.
Why, what's happening on monday?
Pay raise!! That's amazing!!!  I'm so jealous!  Where are you going?!
Oh my goodness! I would have been terrified to read that! What an animal starved to death.
That's awful!  I'm sorry for your loss.  It makes me feel even more sick thinking about it.  Were they pretty young?
Aw, I'm sorry to hear it. Do you have someone you can take the house to visit?
Aw, I'm sorry to hear. I hope he feels better soon!  My dog takes a month or so to recover from surgery, so I know how it feels.
I am sure she had problems with luggage. How did she recover?
That's great that you have a good relationship with her!  Where did she go?
Oh wow! That's very generous of them!
That was really nice of them! You guys sound like very good parents.
That's too bad. Maybe you should go see them soon!
I bet that feels good! Do you live far from your family?
Yeah spiders are no fun. I'm allergic to them so I don't like them in my house, even if it is late at night/lifting weights. I don't like being near them period..I'm terrified.
Yeah I'm the same way! They can even kill a lot of people if they get too close!
That was so thoughtful! Did it turn out well at the end of the day?
Wow! You must have been so surprised! That's nice of her!
That's not cool! Why do you think he does it?
That is really frustrating. Maybe you can hide the food from your brother so that he doesn't have to see it?
Were you scared?
That is scary. I am always nervous at those times also
That's really cute! I bet it was tasty!
That is horrible!  I would never go back.  That's so gross!
Wow, I can't believe he would do that! Were you able to salvage some bread?
Oh no...Sorry to hear that. Did you tell him how you feel about it
why is that? what do you find surprising?
What did he gift you?
I'm so sorry. That's so sad. Beagle dogs are such good companions.
Sorry for the loss. Beagle love is amazing.
I do! Her name is Terror!
I do have a dog but she is an older gal who was abandoned by her family. I took in a 25 year old female with extreme anxiety who had a history of behavioral issues and was being abused. I felt bad when I saw her so I took her in.
Uh oh! What happens if he flames his takei??
hahaha, sounds like you should just let him cool it off. If you're good with cold foods, you should try putting lemon ice box in it!
Did you give him any hints as to where he might be missing from school or how he was doing?
Thats great!
What is the race distance? How long does the race usually last?
What is the distance? How long has it been?
sounds like fun i'm doing one with my mom as well! i hope both of our groups have fun
You are most welcome my good friend! Good luck and I hope it goes well.
I've never been down there. How was the experience down there?
Wow, that sounds so amazing! What kind of butterflies? Emeralds? Emerald butterflies are usually more painful than other kinds of butterflies.
How long were you lifting?
What kind of music do you like to play?
Yes, my cousin got in one and his car got broken into
Yeah, I was in my car crash and was slammed on the brakes. It was terrifying!
That's sad, how is she feeling today?
Sorry to hear. I hope that time with her will be helpful in giving her closure.
That sounds bad. Did you try talking to your bank about it?
That is actually really interesting. How did they know?
yes I have. many times over the years
That's very heartbreaking. I can see why you would feel sad for coming to terms with that. I'm really happy you're talking with him about it.
I did. Have you?
i have 2 dogs and they always try to go outside but once they are outside they are fine
That's smart of you, what kind of fondue does your fondue come in?
That is terrible. Did you ask someone to replace it?
Did you leave it there?
Did he get angry at you?
I am so sorry to hear that. Are yo gonna be OK
I can only imagine! I'm so sorry you have to deal with that stress.
What did you use it on
That's so sweet of her. It's great to see a memory crop up when you least expect.
What happened?!
Oh that's great, travel is so exciting!
Thats good,its always nice to go on a vacation
Did you get to go?
Ah, well that's a bummer! I am sure there will be other opportunities though
What kind of drugs was he on?
That is crazy, did the people there laugh at him or what
flooring work can be strange. What was the weird thing that always came out of the strange situations?
Oh no, that's so awful!
thats the best he can do is get them off if he wants to play.
That is pretty bad parenting. You cant expect every kid to know everything like that
How long was the cut?  I have a very short haircut, so I don't know the length :(
How long did it take you to do the haircut? I can't imagine if it took you long enough.
That must of been embarrassing
LOL thats hilarious!  I would have been like a "what are these shoes you're wearing" moment.
Oh wow! I would love to get a mystery box, what was in the box?
That is terrible. 99 bananas are not cheap
How do you think you did?  Did you study hard for it?
That is awesome! I am happy for you!
Oh yeah, I know that all too well! What's going on?
I can relate. It's tough! But sometimes you just need a friend to listen and vent!
How is she doing?
What kind of work do you do
Well, that's good. Do you have a plan for what you're doing?
Me too! I love winter the most.
That's a bummer. Did you win any of the money?
Oh man, that would make my wallet spin! What did you do?
Yeah me too. I hate it when the lights are off and I'm sneaking.
Lighting was such a bad thing in the old days, was it like that now?
I hope it goes well! Are you thinking of a first date place?
Just try to keep yourself busy, and take care of yourself, it'll be fine
I am sure that it will be worth a wait! Is this your first project?
Confidence is the golden key to a successful proposal.  You got this!
That is really interesting! Have you noticed any changes in his cat behavior?
That is really weird.
Congradulations!  So how do you think you are doing now that you graduated?
Congratulations! What are you studying?
Like what
Oh no. I hate when that happens. Did you get to your grandmother?
I do too, sometimes it's good for a change of scenery
That's too bad but, at least you had someone to kick around for a while
Oh, what are you guys talking about?
I'm sorry to heard. Can you kick someone out of your place?
What movie is it? I haven't seen that in forever.
That sounds scary, did you see it in the theater or on TV?  I've always wanted to lol.
Oh no!  That's terrible!!  How awful to end up like me!!  I am trying to stay away from teas and avoid them at all cost!
Haha that's so bad lol
That was nice of your cashier!  Did she give you anything in return?
That's a good way of thinking.  Did you have to return some candy?
And did he come with a real weapon? Or a fantasy one? I'm sorry if I missed something.
Oh man. What a scary situation. What kind of items did he take?
That is good, tips are always nice to have. Have you found anything recently that has helped?
That's awesome! I'm trying to find solutions to my chronic pain.
hahaha that's hilarious! I guess everyone has that habit at one point, right?!
is this habit likerenght  or is something wrong with it?
Life is a garden.You plant vegetables and herbs and you have to eat them all!
That sounds amazing!  Life just seems to always get more and more awesome as I get older!
That sounds really frustrating. What were they saying during the meeting?
Ah, I know that feeling too well. I study at home!
That is very unfortunate... Have you considered switching banks because that can really suck
That is a really bad situation to be in. Did you get in touch with a rep to let you know about it?
That is nice. Did it bring back memories?
That sounds awesome! Did it bring back any good memories as to why you and your friend used to play together so much?
Glad to here from someone with a bad toothache.  Did everything go okay, if I may ask?
Ouch, I hate when teeth start hurting, do they fix that pain?
That's cool. You are a true Star Wars fan.
That would have been a pain! I really hope you get to see it on the big screen someday!
That's not fun, is she okay?
That sounds so sweet.  How nice of you to be so responsible with your life!  How nice of you to make her feel totally handicapped?
How old was it? It happens sometimes to cats
That's so funny. Did the cat get hurt at least?
How much can you lift?
I am jealous of people who can get so crazy!
I know right.  Do you think there are enough brain cells in the world to keep processing everything?
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that, I hope you figure it all out!
oh really? that's awesome. I never win so I'm jealous.
Holy cow, that's amazing!  How much longer until you can cash in?  I hope you have enough for a house.
Was it by yourself or with friends?
That sounds so cool! What was it about it that was so hard to adapt? Were they hard to write?
Oh I bet that's fun, and I'm sure she is grateful for that!
That's awesome! I have a friend's puppy, he's so small but he's got a big heart I bet
How'd it go, hu?
Oh that sounds like fun! I love a good old fashioned road trip.
What kind of puppy did you get?
I bet that took quite some time
That is terrible, I would feel bad if that were me
that is awful, sorry about the bad poo
I hate roaches.
I would die
What happened?   I hope everything was ok!
Sounds creepy
What happened instead
That's a shame!  What kind of job did you interview for?
Oh geez! That must've been scary! Did you get it out of your car?
I would have freaked out!
Oh no, that is so awful! Were you hurt?
oh my goodness! that is absolutely horrible. i'm so glad you're ok though. it must have been a scary experience
When and Where is it at?
Wow, that must be quite nerve racking! I bet you're quite nervous!
Did you get in line too long?
That is bad, but it is the honest way to do business.
Oh wow that's great!
103 isn't that bad. I did better on a quiz than that on an exam.
That must have brought many memories!  Did it make you happy to see your old self in the book
That's wonderful. I imagine it was an amazing experience,
How was it? Did you go in person or watch on TV?
I love baseball.  Who did you go to see?
That must have been shocking
Haha that's great! I can imagine that was very shocking for you! I hope you weren't too disgusted with the sight of it!
Oh no, is he ok?
Minor accidents are much more expensive than you'd think! What kind of car is it?
That is nice. What kind of car did you get?
Nice. I love chevy. Did you buy it used or used?
I am sure you did great, did you pass?
I'm so proud of you!
How do you think you did?
wow! that is impressive indeed
That sucks. Did they have it onsite at least?
I would be so scared. How much did it cost you to replace the seat?
I agree with you there! I had a really nice lunch today at the gym. The most generous people I know gave me some money for the clothes I was wearing.
That is so cool. Some people just want to do good.
What did you get accomplished that weekend?
That's great! I bet you felt really proud! leg braces are hard to do!
What do you do for work?
I'm in the exact same situation as you, but it's really do depend on the hours you have to work.  Are you in a management position?
What clubs?
Well, you have to keep up that good work!
that sounds so frustrating
You can always take it to the dump even though you're driving
What was the conventional dish?  Was it meat-loaf or a different kind of sandwich?
I've been there! That's the worst part, they were just so over prepared and didn't really try to make it interesting. It was so gross!
I hope she did well!
Oh, wow. Is it possible that she may have a genetic disease that makes it so difficult to get a positive?
I'm sure the bride was happy about that too.
It's nice he has such great people around to help him out like that.
I understand.  Do you earn a lot though?
I know how you feel.  It's hard not to be concern about your financial future.
I do too, especially when i'm playing with my son. We had some fun with the Gradius system.
I used to play some games on a Nintendo as a kid. They were so fun!
I am afraid to say, but I have heard that about America before.
What a great place to get a micro brew. How does the local scene look?
Oh really?! Why? Is that a girl?
I feel you man. I used to do the same but nowadays guys don't give meures anymore
That's too bad. Bourdain was a cool guy though. I am still a big fan of Tom Hardy.
that is very sad
Wow! Where did they find that out of the blue, hu/
Wow, a big shock for sure. You must really be surprised!
Fresh peaches bring all the goodness
That is so great!  What kind of fawns do you have?  Were they males or females?
That's awesome! Where will you be doing all the fun activities?
how exciting! i bet she is having fun!
oh thats a good reason
Well that is a nice surprise. I bet your going to miss him a lot!
That would make me so angry! I would have stayed in bed all day if he made me!
That's the worst. Atleast you get overtime pay.
OMG that's so mean! Did you confront them?
Well at least he didn't take anything, that's some positive reinforcement at least!
Nice did he take any of them?
Oh wow! That sounds like he's going places! Do you think he will go this year, or maybe not at all, with the money he's going to be making? I hope he has enough of an emergency to not want to leave the country!
That sounds nice. What are you drinking coffee on?
Aww that's nice. I hope it continues!
That's no fun, hopefully they will get you next time
They really do have to make sure they follow through when things are that busy. They don't make money like people expect
That's cool, hopefully he can treat her right and take care of her.  She might need it
Wow, that's amazing!  You must be really looking forward to it!  That's quite an adventure!  Do they have any babies yet?
Oh no! I'm so sorry that happened. That must be awful! But you can always come to visit.
Where has she gone?
I love traveling.  Do you have a lot of catching up to do?
That sounds like an uncomfortable time, I wonder if they had something in place.
That must have been very annoying.  Did you get any sort of feedback as to what they were going to do?
Oh, that must be tough. Why don't you go with her?
That's too bad. I bet that would be challenging
I bet it felt good! Waiting is the worst feeling!
I bet that was a long wait
That sucks.  I've been there, my husband had an iphone 6 for years
I would be mad!   Why did they bring it?
Oh, no!  I hope you feel better.  What did she do to make you feel so lonely?
Aww, that's a bit sad. I'm sorry to hear that but I hope you at least get some good time with her!
Aww that's too bad! I know they're so cute in their own little bodies. What did you do about it?
Oh my god! I would have been so scared! I am glad it did not hurt you
i live in south texas and they are really bad there too
i live in south texas and they are really not a problem we get them here too but boy oh boy i hate them damn mosquitoes
Wow! Why were you scared of spiders, did she teach you?
Oh my, I can imagine how scared you must be. I'd make my husband get rid of the spider asap!
Wow! That sounds like such an experience! Will it be your first time skydiving?
Oh that sounds so exciting!
Oh no!  That's never fun.  Did they give you a refund or no?
Oh yuck! I hope you didn't drink too much of it! I wouldn't want any bugs in my tea!
Oh, no! I hope it's not going to be too painful...
Oh no, are you going to have to go through an MRI or surgery in the meantime?
Wow! So you are a hostess, hu?
That's awesome. She sounds wonderful.
I agree, what situations do you mean
Oh no! I would have been so embarrassed! I am glad your phone is okay though.
That's so sad. I'm sorry. How did it die?
Oh no that's awful, how old was she when she had cancer?
That is not fun.
I'm sorry to hear that! Where did they go?
Congratulations!!! I moved to a one bedroom once and hated having neighbors so i know how you feel
Ugh, I hate upstairs neighbors. They literally yell at the top of their lungs! And video games? No thank you. I'd be busy stomping around trying to figure it all out!
Where did she go?
Aw that's too bad! Maybe get her some popcorn and watch a lot of movies? Haha
I agree, I am applying.
Oh wow. I hope you don't end up with more spiders then you can handle! I have four kids so lots of little guys and lady bugs fly around the house. I try calling animal control though...
What position do you play?
That's awesome!  Are you training for a tournament or for a job?
I'm so sorry. unemployment can be tough.
It sounds like moving can be hard. How did you find a new job?
India? Don't fancy India much?
You must be really excited! Where is the trip to? India is an awesome place!
Weekens are sometimes too busy having fun to be here.
That sounds wonderful!  I hope you had a wonderful weekend as well!
I am glad that it did not get to bad you
are you scared of the new people?
That is lucky!
I would have left immediately
Why empty?
What airport do you live at?
Aw, I bet that's so exciting! Do you have any pets?
I'm sorry about that, but I'm happy to here that! Where has he been?
What happened, did he have a good day at school?
Faster is always good. What did he do?
Oh wow! What was bothering you about the wedding that you couldn't make it?
What color was your wedding?
That is terrible, I don't understand why people can't have nice things
I don't blame you. I would be livid if my dog did that!
Thats awesome! Congregation and blessings on your marriage!
That is so awesome! I am so glad to hear that!
Oh no!  Was it okay, or did it cause a lot of problems down the line?
That sucks, maybe get a can of corn to make the floorboards squeak clean
That sounds awesome! I haven't had a resturaunt in ages! Did you go a lot?
I hate it when restaurants close when there's still a loyal following loyal customers around
That's different than most people. Most people are just fans
Lol,  I have had that happen too.  It is annoying when co-workers can get so much more negative attitude than others.
Wow that's awesome! I bet he was happy!
Wow! lumber is expensive! You guys must be happy!
Oh, I'm sorry! I've been there myself. It can really leave you feeling destroyed and depressed for a long time afterwards. How was he died?
I'm so sorry to hear about that. How long did you have your dog for?
That is unfortunate. Did he give you a reason why he couldnt come?
Did he have a good reason to change their mind?
I'm so sorry about your wife's grandmother!
That's so sad. I'm really sorry to hear that.
Oh, I am so happy for you!
Wow,  that is horrible,  I hope you found her owner :(
Oh no! Does it still hurt a lot? I can barely make a hole in my tee ball tee.
I'm so glad that you're getting better! I can't wait until my son is older and we can go to the course together.
I think it's exciting but definitely not excite
I cannot for the life of me picture that!  How old were you when you started?
Nice. What is the brand?
That sounds awesome. It's nice to have a new tv.
Awwww, bugs. Did you kill it?
A giant fly would've been a relief. I'm glad you're not afraid of bugs
You will remember everything! You have time
What kind of job is it? And good luck!
What kind of dreams do you have?
Dang! Sounds like you two have a real chemistry going on! That could not have gone unnoticed.
That's nice. Were you guys very close?
That's so sweet! I love puppies! What kind of puppy was it?
Awww... what breed?
Ebay? I hate when they raise the prices! Did you try checking the sales before you saved up, if that's easier?
That sucks. I hope that you can save up for a different dress!
oh my gosh. you should go see the doctor and have your stomach pumped. that or you might need some sleep
Oh wow, what was your excuse to yourself when you noticed that many of your snacks had chocolate in them?!
Oh no I hope he feels better asap. I hate when my kids get sick.
Oh I hope so too. Is he at a hospital?
I wish I was still in shape. That sounds like a great time!
I wish i could too LOL, it's good to have friends though
I have never been to an event
Sounds interesting, maybe I should get into it as a kid also :)
OH NO! I'm so sorry! I hope your daughter had someone to talk to about this!
That is very mean and cruel of him.
Oh no! Did you scour the garden for them?
What does the cat do to the bird?
I totally understand what you are talking about.
Life in prison seems harsh but I guess that would be cruel and just punish the person
Did you investigate?
Oh wow! That would scare me and I would probably fight back.
What a good friend! lend me your bank account details and I'm sure he will! :)
That's good. I'm sure he appreciates it a lot.
That must've been really scary! Did you get scared when it all unfolded?
Wow. That is very brave of him.
Yes I saw one fly in my backyard once
Hmmm that does sound pretty terrifying! I think you might be on to something. Maybe a ghost?
I'm the same way! I can't stand it when people just want to be rude or annoying
That sounds really annoying!
I'm sorry to hear that, how long has it been since you had him?
That would be difficult. How did he respond to you bringing him to the testing?
That's awful! I'm sorry to that for you. Is he doing better?
I hope your daughter is doing alright! My little girl was born in January so I know how stressful that can be! I'm worried I'll miss this phone call too.
Oh my, that must have been horrible! I really hope that place is clean after this
That's insane!  What an accident!  I'm sorry for the bad odour.  Where was it at?
That's a good thing. Is your car pretty much perfect for the climate?
That's a real life example of why being prepared is better than leaving it to fate.
What are you studying?
That is very impressive! I bet you are exhausted.
Frozen solid or frozen hot?
Hahaha I bet that was pretty exciting though! Did it get on the roller coaster easily?
I'm sorry you had to be without friends. That really sucks. Are you going to have a party with them?
Well at least there's always Youtube.
Yes, I agree completely. It hurts so much. I feel for them so much more than I would on my own. How did they end up getting to that stage?
Oh my goodness, that's terrible. I am really sorry to hear about your dog. Were you able to close things out?
Did you get to go?
That sounds amazing! I have a month long cruise in October! How far in advance do you plan to count?
Wow, she is still a child?
I am glad she got the handicapped girl though!
Rain is so relaxing! What did you do to pass the time?
I hear sun screen helps a lot!
Oh really, I've never heard of it! I hope it was a good one!!
what was the experience like? did people laugh at the movie or scared you?
How do you feel about those?
Yeah it is pretty expensive, especially if your rates have gone up unexpectedly
Aww, yeah we've all done that at some point in our life! But it doesn't feel as bad because it was a birthday party, and everyone ate together.
I'm sorry you don't feel well. I know, it is tough especially when your sweet tooth is full. I have been feeling the same way recently and am trying to diet less sweets. What kind of cake was it?
Oh no! What caused it?
That's too bad. So many people do not survive those events.
Oh no that sounds awful!
That's so sad to here...I hope you find him!
That is very sad. I am sorry.
That's really rough. You may have been deluding your self.
That's really nice. I pay cashiers for my water and they usually take advantage of me.
That is a very nice gesture.  Nothing like a good friend to help out when money is tight.
How do you feel about it?
Wow that's great!  Servicing our country is one of the most rewarding things one can do.  Where are you going?
That's unfortunate, did they have it saved on file or did they completely gut it?
That is so gross and wrong on their part to do that.   Did you complain to the manager?
Ouch, are you ok?
Ouch!  I am so glad you didn't hurt yourself bad!  Did anyone see?
Why is that?
That's the best you can do is run and pretend like nothing happened. You have to protect your family if you go down that rabbit path.
I would feel some sort of way to. Have you called the cops on them?
Did she take a fence post with her to put up? She could put a lot of bark up higher.
No! How did that happen??
Wow that sounds pretty ambitious. Do you feel like a hero or just wish you had pizza all the time?
I'm happy for you!
That is great! I am happy to hear that. I need to start saving money too.
That's really cool! What kind of job is it?
wow that sounds like fun, what year for you to be teaching
I am so sorry to hear about that. Dogs become a part of life no mater how much you try to control them.
im sorry to hear this. i hope you find peace with this situation.
I understand. How much did you spend with it?
I am having the same issue. They have to spend so much money processing it. They want to get it out of my bank and give it to me for processing.
Oh really? That's awesome!
She must be a hard worker!
What was the piece? That's awesome.
That was really nice of you to do.
You got this homie!  You got this!  Don't be nervous!  Use this time to relax and get to know your kids!
I am sure he will have fun and be fine.  He may have a little anxious about it, too, though.
Yeah you do. But it will take time, and I know it will for him to realize how great it feels to have you by his side, even if just as a son.
Yes, you have to let the crazy ones go. You never really control them if they are always out there.
64? Wow! How come you overwhelmed? Was there a lot of content?
I remember getting the N64, too! I had so much fun playing it with my brother and our other cousins. We used to play hours each day just playing games.
What is the class?
That's awful! You're going to get a better B average, just stay determined.
Oh how exciting! What did he make?
That would get old after awhile lol. I love to make meatballs
I agree, coffee filters are a must. They help us with our cloudy cloudy morning morning morning cloudy cloudy cloudy afternoon cloudy night.
i can totally imagine. That is what mornings are for right? refreshing your coffee and getting ready for work
I am sorry?
Really - do bearded dragons eat other bearded dragons?
Oh no!!  Why'd they cut you
You should be careful with peanuts. They can give you the runabout.
That's nice. Was someone just kissing or what?
OH thats cool! Congrats!
I hope you didn't drink too much! Did you go to the doctor?
Oh that sucks! I hate that when I get that kind of cold/ cough.
What flavor was it?
Lactose intolerant people suck, what kind of ice cream do you have?
Oh man, that's rough. I'm afraid to even say that about myself at times.
I am sure once she is here you will be a great dad! You will feel at home.
I'm so sorry you have to worry about that.  I hope everything works out for you!
Haha, I bet it was, cats can getzaway!
I love cats, they are so sassy.
Don't be nervous!  It's not like you know if you did great or not, it's only one of thousands of dollars.
Well I think you will do just fine!
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have more things than her that you can get?
Oh I know how that goes. Sometimes you have to break things up. I hope it works out though for you two.
Yes they do, it's a big no- no in my state
that must have been embarrassing
Especially when you're being robbed!
That sounds terrifying! I would be very concerned as well.
Where did it go?
Wow, you should probably put a hole in the side of your house and wait for it.
It's probably because she is so talented.  I am terrible at drawing either, but I'm very talented at lettering.
That's really cool. I wish I had the patience to do something similar to your sister's work.
That is good to hear! How long have you been friends?
That is great. It is nice to have a friend like Kayla.
That's sad news. I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any cure?
Oh that is so sad. It is difficult but never last. You will be ok I am sure. Just take care of you head
That's scary! What was it?
That would have scared me too, what did you do?
What happened? I hope it wasn't serious.
I am glad to hear that. I hope the pain will go away!
Sorry to hear that! Is there anyone you can contact to help you get back on your feet?
HIV can be a scary thing to have to deal with but I am sure there will also be other things that are more difficult. I wish you all the best
I hear you! I love video games. Did you play Mario on the NES?
I played that with my friends when I was younger. I miss those days.
How did it go then
you'll do better
That is frustrating, especially when it was discovered that he had it before the disease was even known to exist!
That sucks. I'm type 1 and I can't imagine ever being in a situation where I would need a type 2 diabetes.
I'm sorry to hear that! What movie did you see?
That sounds lonely! Did you get to go with them again?
Did he really just do that?
Did he offer to share it?
Really! Why is that?
Jones has done a lot to get his channel private  It has nothing to do with politics
I always used the toilet paper roll on those games.
I used to think I was the only one that did that... or am I just socially awkward
Whoa that's out of control. Are you okay?
That is horrible!  I am so sorry!  Have you talked to her about how you feel?
That's really sweet of your Uncle Bill! He sounds like an awesome guy!
That was so nice of you!!
Impressive, how old he is that he managed to do that?
Wow, I'm sure that was a very large B. You must've been proud.
That is incredible! How long have you had him?
That's so cool! Maybe one day when my son gets older, he can finally understand things in a non annoying way!
I'm sorry but that made me laugh a little. Do you eat that many hot dogs?
Ha ha, that is true. Do you eat that much? That's funny. I can barely eat a couple of hot dogs.
That's really sweet of him!
That's good!  He must be a good boyfriend.
aw that's really cool, I'm glad you have something like that to remember like that!  Did it bring a lot of new memories?
Awe, that's so sweet!  I miss my mom so much too!  We're you close?
I hate when that happens!
That's pretty mean considering how dirty the floor is. Did she still come when she was cleaned up?
How cool that is!
That is cool. Do you have siblings?
Oh no! Keep your options open, maybe you'll get a promotion!
I'm sure he's just trying to keep his job. Don't be so down on yourself.
I am so sorry to hear about your cat. Have you been up all night worrying about it?
I'm so sorry, I know how it is to lose a pet.
That is so sad.... how did he affect you
Oh, I'm sorry to hear. Is everything okay? How long were you suppose to live there before you left?
Yea? How did it taste?
That is so good!
That sounds like you're going for a healthy lifestyle!
You must be real proud, how much did it cost?
Oh that sounds like so much fun -- it sounds complicated though, you might have trouble starting it up!
did you sleep well?
I am sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that, I bet that was scary
Oh yeah? Why are you going there? Just curious
why are you worried about travelling there? are you scared of how you will find a new hostel?
That's a bad thing? It can ruin your life!
That's good you had it with you! I would have just walked out! lol
I know the feeling. Have you thought about saving some of it
I hate car repairs!  What did you do?
Oh, that must have felt terrible. How did you manage to keep yourself busy?
I bet you felt lonely. Did you ever do anything with her?
Do you try hard to get healthy?
Good for you. You should be feeling great!
Are you being ironic or did you really just buy one?
I'm not worried about them either.  I'm scared that we will all live in igloosts like in the movie Jurassic Park.
Job interviews always make me so nervous! Have you prepared for it at all?
What kind of job are you interviewing for?
Oh, that's nothing! The things people do these days...
Hey, I've been through a similar situation! I just got my carpet cleaned last week after years of neglect. It was so satisfying to get that satisfaction!
That's awesome! How many childrens do you have?
Congratulations. That sounds like a lot of hard work.
That sounds nice. How long have you been moving?
That's kind of you to be looking for a change, hopefully they are decent.
Wow that sounds like an awesome experience! Were you happy to move into the RV and relax and enjoy your life?
That's awesome!  Did the selling experience turn out to be worth it?
I do sometimes. I wonder if time erases the bad things that happened or just adds to it
Yes, sometimes I like going back to the good ol' days.  It makes you happy I guess.
A time that I didn't know I possible to even visit those times in.
Aww, I know what you mean, it's like finding photos of grandparents.
wow that's so nice of them, you have some really great people in your complex
Wow! That was so nice of him. disabled people are awesome. I hope your life improves very soon.
That's sad to hear, I am sorry to hear that. Nintendo is still very much alive though so there is hope.
I know exactly what you mean about ninja turtles.  My friend and I used to play a ton of mario kart when I was younger.
I love to be in aide
yes i love to read as well
what did she film
Wow that does sound pretty gross!
I would hate moving to a new place, especially after just being there for a few years.
Where did you grow up?
Aww that's sweet! What breed is it?
That's really sweet of you! Frenchies are the best breed!
What were they doing to you?
oh my god. what happened?
I feel the same, seeing the most issues when i see one makes me so sad.
thats very nice of you to help out your local charities
Oh wow! Congratulations! Those things are rarely ever won. How much did you win?
Wow! That is awesome! I never win..but I'm happy for you!
What is the point of that much if it will only be saved for later?
Oh my! What made you so sad? I hope that the date was at least interesting!
Aw, that is good that you were doing something to feel better!  Did you enjoy the potato?
Oh god. I would have been so mad!
Oh no! I would have been mad too. What did you do?
What was it
Oh, that's not too bad. Still, congratulations for trying, though! Maybe next year you'll get a little closer to winning.
I love buying sausage! I should get on that asap!
I can imagine. I would be nervous too. I LOVE buying sausage!
It is very hard for everyone. What are you worried about?
I can imagine!  Are you going to be alright?
Where did you go? I have never left the country, I am too Old for that.
That's awesome!  What part of the country are you visiting?  I visited England, and it was a totally different experience!
That is a great accomplishment! What did they go for in college?
That is great.  They must have been very happy and successful.  It takes a lot of courage to go through that.
That sounds like so much fun!!! Where are you going?
That's hilarious! I bet that was embarrassing
hahaha.. genius!
Oh, what did she do?
That's cool, it's always good to be prepared when you go out to a big party or something! How many people are you expecting?
What type of game do you play?
Chicago is a pretty big city! Do you play frequently?
Yeah, do they try to do the tricks themselves or are they taught?
Wow that is a long time, you must be really proud! Do they enjoy it?
That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that you were able to get a good amount of exercise and comfort while getting treatments. I'm sure that will help you stay more productive and productive as well.
I bet you were a nervous walk. Did they make you a schedule?
That is so sad. Are you going to get it reopen?
That's a shame - did you try to find the source of the closure?
oh yeah? how much is your bid?
What is the name of the book?
Did you run for it!
That's terrifying! What did you do?
I agree! Have you got any cool gadgets that have advanced beyond just the simple things?
I agree! Have you worked on any of your own apps or in-house software?
What kind of cake was it?
What kind of cake was it
Financial help is always very important. I am glad you feel that way. Are you religious?
That is very nice of you.
Horrible! Did you try to watch it during a sleepover??
I've never liked horror movies but now I'm afraid to see them
Where are your favorites?
Wow, that sounds pretty awesome.  I didn't know there were any other places you could get food in the country other than the big stores?  What do you like about your country?
I know what you mean! I do that all the time! I'm so busy washing dishes that I forget to touch anything not on the bottom!
I know right? Doesn't it bother you so much that you can feel sick just from the smell?
I hear ya. That always makes the floor smell fantastic!
thats annoying
Me too, they can cause accidents!
Yeah I felt the same way when I saw people cut people off in fron oferved
Oh no, I'm sorry.  I think that poor little thing died a horrible death.
That's really sad, I wonder why they'd do such a thing?!
How is it doing?
I am sure you will be fine. I am sure if you give it a go it will be better.
I love it when places like that do that, makes it a bit less of a "buy in bulk."
That is a nice gesture.  Is her store very popular?
That's pretty cool, did it take you a long time to perfect it?
That is really cool.  Is there any particular shot you are most interested in doing well at in order to win the big bucks?
That must bother some people.
That would annoy me too, since I don't have any neighbors.
I am sorry about that! I have had that happen too and am really not sure how to fix it!
That is so scary.  I am sorry that happened to you.  I have been there too.
This is so true
Wow. How much did you pay to get that ticket?
That will be so awesome.  What a great performer she is!
Awesome! I hope you enjoy your new place.
Congratulations on that! I hope you enjoy your new apartment
I do not live at home anymore, at least not in the house. I was just visiting last month and really felt like relaxing at home.
Yikes! Did you kill it?
Oh gross! Did you kill it?
That's quite the drive. I bet it's going to be awesome!
That is awesome! I love being able to just sit back and listen to the music.
What store was it for?
That sounds amazing! I love using the computer stores as inspiration
That sounds great. I wish I could do that. It's so convenient.
disabled people are so much trouble! I'm happy you're getting good delivery service. I'm surprised they still make grocery shopping a thing.
What is it about?  Is it a bittersweet ending?
That sucks. Did the main character actually die?
wow thats so cool!
Wow, that is really cool!
That sounds like fun.  Did you have a picnic?
Ouch! Are you ok?
Oh no! Was it cold?
Did you retaliate by knocking the glass back or keeping the water?
Whoa! What happened?
Oh, that's really weird. I don't believe those things, so you must have been really frightened! Did you try to find it and bring it home?
How did it go by itself or as a part of your life?
What places did you love most?
Wow that must of been a happy place to relax.
Nice! Did you make sure they had clean clothes for the next trip?
You are very lucky!
How was it going?
I love going ziplining!  Was this difficult?
How did that happen?
That sucks. Did insurance cover the cost to replace it?
I'm sorry to hear that, that's got to be tough on you
im sorry to hear that. what breed?
I'm so happy to hear that! Cancer is the worst.
I'm really happy to hear that you worked hard for your cancer.  I'm sure your family was very happy as well.
Where to??
That's great! I'm in Florida, just moved to OK this summer, and love OK! It's so beautiful outside!
Why is that? Do you not have nice things?
i feel the same way honestly, i want my car to get damaged and my trash to be able to go in and be recycled
That really sucks. Are you lonely in general? I've always been by myself too, except when my best friends were in town for business.
Most animals only have one personality type. Humans are more complex as a species and can really have more than one personality type depending on how we're social. What kind of animals do you like to hang out with?
That's horrible. Maybe you should stop playing.
You must be feeling pretty jealous. Did he offer to buy you one once he gets his hands on them?
Why? Is it acting weird?
That's a tough decision, but I am sure the vet's will be able to help you.
That's awesome. I'm glad to here some people out there looking. Good luck.
It's good that you're looking. I hope you get what you seek!
How much will those tickets cost?
That is a great idea! Did you win the contest and get to take it on the road?
That's nuts! Why don't you think the police would show up?
That is scary! You shouldn't have to worry about those people. You should try to keep an eye on your neighbors!
That sounds so relaxing and exotic. I've only gone to the country on vacation.  What did you see?
wow that sounds so awesome!!! where were you going to go?
That's awesome! Did you have a good time?
That is a great surprise by them! You must really love them
Oh cool! What kind of shoes? And what color?
What were you wearing?
Did you end up doing it right?
Did you do all the steps?
You must be nervous! When is it?
I'm sure it shouldn't be so bad! Are you nervous?
That would have put a damper on any plans for today. Did you manage to get it back?
You are so brave. I hope this doesn't become a thing with you.
Really? That's cool, I can never do that.
wow! that is amazing, you must be very smart
Oh geez! Have you seen any? Any that you've seen recently that caused you to be anxious?
Yeah I used to do that too, but then I got good at anticipating them and avoided them!
Oh man that's really scary. Did they have a weapon?
People are so random sometimes. I hope it wasn't a bad person.
Oh no, what happened to the guy?
I bet that was embarrassing! How are you now? Did he get out?
Wow! That's pretty amazing!
That is really awesome! I have always wondered if people really eat that much to be that big.
That sounds like an awesome time! What kind of cats are they? Did they have a cat cafe inside?
That sounds so amazing and like a dream for a cat cafe owner. I would be so excited if I was you!
Oh no! What happend?
Oh my gosh! Did you run to a bathroom and desperately call for the spider?
Oh no!  I bet it's a pain to clean the hair out.
That is no good.  I hope that you are able to find something else to grive about.
That's heartbreaking, did you comfort him? He was a sweet old man.
I am so sorry for your loss
What was the song?
Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and be a kid again...
That sounds scary
did she try to scare you off?
Oh my god! Did you nurse it back to health and give it a splint?
That's terrible, I hope it wasn't an introduced bird.
have they arrived?
Roast sounds good! What are you making?
Yay! That's awesome.
That is great. It is always nice when your boss acts surprised.
Oh no!  Did you guys meet yesterday and had a productive conversation about needing to get things moved forward?
Top secret? Why is that?
thats a good spot then, enjoy it!
Do you feel better knowing you have someone to come home and share your thoughts?
that's sad, is she getting a better vet?
oh wow i hope she pulls through
oh my god, I'm so sorry!  Are you going to get her back?
That's great! Where are you going to cruising?
I am so happy for you! Where are you going cruising to?
It is always nice to have a great roommate
That's pretty thoughtful! I'm sure he appreciated it!
Oh no, that's terrible! Are you closed down?
Oh no, it's bad enough as it is, but I hope you're ready for another bad one!
What was the call for? Did he get a raise?
That is so awesome! I bet you were very happy!
i would love some right now, go you! what are you cooking it with?
I do not like mac and cheese
Are you enjoying your brand new necklace and shirt?
What kind of brand and shirt?
I hope those aren't too bad! Have you taken your dog to be tested for illness?
That is terrible. I have four dogs myself, but I would be very frustrated if I had to homeschool them.
That's wonderful. It's good when you feel you worked hard for something.
That's great. You should be proud that you put in the hard work and worked hard.
Which water park?
That sounds like so much fun! I have never been to a water park, it seems pretty gross and gross!
That sounds nice! What kind of cat do you have?
Aw, that sounds like a nice night
That was very nice of her! What kind of toys were they?
What toy was it?
Congrats! That's great news!
Congratulations! It's a great time to be a human, and make new friends and enjoy your marriage!
Oh no that's not good at all! Do you think he will get another job at the company?
That is a real bummer!  Maybe cutting those other department head positions would help?
That's sad news, is there any funeral arrangements made to mourn the cat?
Oh I'm so sorry for your loss!
She must be very artistic! I'm very much the opposite! I don't really like anthems, really, but anthems are beautiful.
You are a lucky man.  You must look on her as one of yours
I bet.  Was it your first time driving?
I can relate! I always bring a spare blanket to the car with me so I don't get cold hands!
I hate flies so much!  Did you try anything to kill them?
I am so afraid of flies. Did it make a big noise when you closed your eyes?
Oh wow! That's really disgusting! I hope your dog is okay
Oh my goodness! You are so cruel! I am glad that your doggie is okay and that the cat is fine!
For what sport?
When will you be able to give the presentation?
Ugh! What was it? That's the worst!
I have experience with dogs that puke up hairballs too. They can be really gross. Did she vomits up a ball of jelly too?
oh man that's the worst,  Did you eventually clean it up
Yeah I know teenage boys are no good but some of them have some good ones.  Did it get better after?
how was it
Did you complain to the manager and get a new one?
Did you ever find it?
Did you finally get it figured out after all that?
Really! did you get shot?!?
I can imagine it was frightening! How did you end up doing after the experience?
That's cute! Did she give you a good sleep?
How old is the girl?
what did you guys eat
That's great that you had that type of relationship with him.
and what did you do with it?
That's terrifying. I'm so sorry you have to deal with that.
That's really cute. Did you make him a new meal?
That is no fun!
How'd it go? Studying with a brother is always a fun way to do things!
How'd it go?
That is not fun, did she succeed?
Is it a chocolate dog or something else?
Oh no!  What happened to it??
Oh no! What happened to it??
Cool! Did he buy you anything special?
That sounds so sweet and thoughtful. What kind of things do he buy?
That sucks
Yeah, sales tax is so insane. You'd be better off moving to one of the lower income states where you don't have to worry about it.
Same here. I love being a good dad because if I do my best, I can leave them their best friend in peace
I do but she's away at therapy for 2 months a year.
That is wonderful! I'm glad it went smoothly!
That's great. I'm glad it didn't take long for you to get it done!
Did she say how much you gave her?
Give her a couple of days and try to contact them again
What did you do? I'm so sorry you feel terrible!
Wow! How terrible. Why did you do that?
I think that is a lot of fun! Do you think they will like that?
Get the kids one they will love it
I'm so sorry to hear that. How did he die?
i'm sorry to hear that
You shouldn't. What matters is what you care about.
I think money is important but sometimes we can care about more than money. What do you like to spend your time doing?
did you have a nice childhood?
That is so great to hear! I am sure that is the happiest memories.  Do you have any of your own?
I try and watch stuff from my childhood sometimes.
Yeah occasionally I do but mainly I like to read books on my commute to work sometimes
Oh man! I've been there! Did everything turn out okay?
I love it when you wake up and a cake to be eaten. Especially if it's hot.
Wow. Was that difficult to do?
Oh no! I am the same! It's too hard to be afraid to cook a good steak!
did it bring a lot of memories
I agree. I look back to my teen years all the time.
I hear you there... I'm in the same boat. How do you get through not having a job?
prayer works for me too, i try it every night before bed
What?! Are you mad at the people who are destroying the houses?!
Wow... that sucks. I can't help it... I feel sad whenever I see abandoned houses because people are just like that
What happened? Are you hurt physically?
I bet that was painful.  Do you have any insurance to cover anything?
Sure. What kind would you like?
Not really. What kind of games would you be into?
I know exactly what you are saying!
I know exactly what you mean.  I feel like that with my wife.
I am not doing too bad. Did you have a lot of exams?
That's great! Yes, I always try to remind myself that and I have had lots of exams.
It's been pretty good actually. I think i'm going to take friday off and go to vegas!
That's awesome! Congratulations! That's always nice when your day goes great and your boss gives you the promotion!
Oh no. I get attacked by bees all the time. What did you do?
Oh no! How many bees did you have to kill?
Yes, I loved playing them with my friends
Yes, I loved playing mortal kombat and call of duty. I was also playing madden when I was younger
Not too bad. I'm working pretty hard to pay off some debts.
That's awesome. I am glad you are having such an amazing day.
Oh no!  I hope that didn't happen while you were in the shower!
That is good that she asked, maybe you taught her a valuable lesson!
Oh no! I hope she gets fired
how nice of her! how many slices of pizza did you have?
Oh no! Is it a young dog or an older one?
That's the worst!  I bet you was so scared!  Did it come out easy for you when you got it clean?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that, how old was your cat?
I'm so sorry, how is the cat?
Oh wow! Did it go okay?
Oh man, I would be scared too! Did you go with anyone?
How'd it go?
What kind of job did you apply for?
Did you do something nice?
Haha, maybe you can make a deal with it and buy your flat some more!
Did you hurt your knee?
Oh, did it go over very well with you? It's embarrasing to go through the effort of jumping off a building, especially one that high.
That is a very nice thing to say.
Yes it is very difficult.  Bullies are the worst.
I do actually. Do you?
I used to love buying video games when I was little. I played so many street games as a kid. What kind of games did you like?
Why did you decline, that's kinda a rude move.
Oh wow,  That was a rude move of you
Oh that sounds fun! What did you guys all think?  Did your parents invite you?!
Nice did they bring up any old friends from your childhood?
How did that happen??  Did you get caught in a scam or did you buy it?  Hopefully it was the former!!
That is a very responsible thing you have done.
Kiddos can be tough at first! How did it go after she was over the first day?
that's wonderful! it's nice to experience that as a parent
Oh, wow!  I lent my cousin $50 and she ended up using it on drugs.  What a jerk thing to do!
That is very kind of you. I hope he will pay you back. What do you think will work out the best for you?
Wow! Where did you decide on going?
I would be so scared! And happy!
Wow! How did that happen?
Did anyone else notice?
Did you call the police?
Oh, man, that's terrible. I'm sorry to hear about your car. I can't stand people who drive badly!
How old is he now? Use that with him as a motivator
You're good man, it's not so bad.
oh thats nice
That is really cool.  I am so happy for you!
That's really cool. I'm afraid of the sky diving, so never did it. But it sounds like a lot of fun.
Oh no.  Was there any delays because of that or was it completely different?
Thats good
what was in the buffet?
I love eating buffet food, did you have fun?
Nice, where old was it? Did it feel nostalgic to you?
Old places and memories can really bring back a lot of great memories! Sounds like a good trip!
I'm so sorry, that's so awful, I'm sorry for your loss, I can imagine you being devastated!
I would be terrified!
what did she tell you?
Hahah that's funny! Well, it's good for you at least, because now you have a great present for her! :)
Marriage is an incredible thing.
That's wonderful! You must be very happy and relieved at the same time.
Oh no!  Did you find it?
I hate that feeling! I've lost all of my money before and I know it's never going to happen again...but it's nice to know there's still some good out there in this world!
I am a second harvest guy. My mom used to collect the sweet potatoes and she would make them for us when we were little. How did it work out for you doing that?
I love second Harvest! That was so nice of you to help them.
That is awesome! I am happy for you.
That's awesome that you are happy with your life. I'm happy for you.
Good for you buddy
That is terrible, I hope it was an accident.
I'm so sorry to hear about your car trouble! I hope it gets better soon!
I understand, but sometimes you just need a little more performance.
Oh my gosh! That's so scary! I'm so glad you are okay!
Oh no I'm sorry to that!  I would've been feeling the same way I'm pretty sure.
I can imagine how it would hurt.  I bet they wished they could all leave and go home instead.
I think it is because we have a natural increase in our metabolism. I am the same way and now I order so many things online and always end up disappointed.
I feel you! I am the same, it's like I check every 5-10 days. I am constantly checking my phone too haha!
How long did you have her?
Aww, I'm sorry for how old she was. She sounds like a great dog. How long had you've had her?
That sounds like so much fun! I wish I had a boat!
That sounds like a blast!
Wow. loaded parents. That must be very rich parents.
That sounds like struggle.
I am sure you can do some things if you put your mind to it
what kind of project was it? were you happy to finish?
That sounds like it took a while, did it end up turning out well?
That's good. What did you learn?
I am sorry you have to see so many different people.
I'm so glad that you have a healthy and happy life!   I'm sure it's a great job to have doctors helping you in so many different areas of your life!
Well, you cheated on your diet by eating pizza and cake!
That sucks! But, atleast pizza and cake is good
That's exciting, I hope you pass.
It shouldn't be too bad. As a former student, you'll get the hang of it pretty quick.
Oh, that's not so bad!  Did everyone end up being able to make it?
That's good, I'm happy to hear that! Did everything go well?
It's good to have family in an age where we don't always have to depend on others for our well being.
It's good to find good family members who will stick around after something bad happens. That can really help things.
That is so sad. What happened?
Sorry for your loss, that sounds traumatic. I know how you feel though, my friend lost his last dog when he was 5 and its the worst thing.
Did you get a new car?
Most people are satisfied until their mile mark. then it all starts to make a lot of sense
That's really sweet. Good for you! It must be nice to be able to have someone so supportive and giving!
That is wonderful!  It is amazing how caring and supportive he is of you all!
Oh no, I am sure you were mortified!  Did you laugh about it, atleast thats what happened to me!
It happens to the best of us, dont be so down on yourself.
Oh that's cool! When are you going
That's awesome! I've always wanted to go to Washington!
That's so sweet of you!  I'm glad you're able to keep and enjoy it like that!  Do you have any plans to sell it?
I'm so sorry to hear about your dad. That's an awesomeKnife.
Oh no, that's unfortunate :(
i'm happy for you, i don't have kids either but i want to one day, and i'm very sad about that too
Did you pass?
Who are you talking about?
I am sorry you feel that way now. Do you still drive a car?
What types of situations would you prefer over other times in your life?
Nice, how long did it take you to complete the training?
wow thats so deep.
Really?? What was it like??
Oh, man!  Those were the best movies!  I love the books too!  What was it that you were most fond of, though?
Oh, so that is like a bad publicity? Or did someone notice and say they were sox?
Oh no! People are staring at you now
How do you like it?
Wow, that's pretty cool, are you a professional dancer?
Oh no, did anyone notice?
Oh no, did people know what happened?
What happened if I asked you?
Oh well good for you.  I would say if you think you did well you got it!  What made you decide not to take the job?
ok, so what do you like most, your cuz? or the gym cuz you get to cuz you swole bruh
That is good. It always nice to be reminded why things used to be so bad.
What do you do to improve them?
I am terrible at running. I can't do 5 miles.
Slowpoke you are! Keep at it!
You should drink a bit of milk before you go on a run.
Why do you drink milk everyday?
Nice! Sounds like you were on top of the world! What kind of workout did you do?
How did that feel
Ouch. Did you hurt the dog?
Oh no that's awful! How'd he take it?
What did they say about him>
I would pick the one who didn't say nasty things like "Hi"
I love the buffet!
What was the food?
That is terrible. Did you eat it yet?
20 dollars? I would've been more upset at 10,000 dollars.
Wow, you must be very strong for your age.
What do you eat to be so strong?
I've never heard of it, what's it about
I have never seen it, what is it?
Smoking has so much negative side effects though, try keto. Its a good thing to try.
Wow that is an awesome accomplishment! I have never been able to do that.
That is so cool! What did you guys do?
Oh wow! That sounds challenges! I never got a chance to do that!
what do you do for a job?
I've always wanted to but never had the patience! How long do you usually work each day?
I would be too. Did you get a good workout?
That is great! Sounds like a great accomplishment.  Was it hard to do?  Do tell!
That's not a good way to wake up! Did you clean it off or did someone else do it?
That was thoughtful.
Did he/she do a good job?
That sounds horrible, I hope you are feeling better.
I know the feeling. When I look at old pictures, I miss so much.
I'm sure that's hard. But it can make the search less lonely. Maybe it's best to get out and start something new!
Crying is the best thing we can do.
Yeah i understand that feeling.  Did something happen recently?
Oh, I'm so sorry! Did you guys get killed?
Oh no!  I hate roadkill too
lol,  but if you do it slowly
You can always do the fridge, but yes it will get there
Wow that is an interesting one
Wow thats crazy, have you traveled there before or is this something new?
That's great!  litter box?  I love litterbugs!
I love puppies, what kind of puppies did you get?
I remember that!  Easter eggs are the best!  What did you do with all the extra eggs?
I did not get that at all!
cloves give me the shivers, I can imagine.
I can understand that. cloves give off a horrible after taste, even if it's supposed to be neutral. Was it just the cloves that gave it off, or was there other ingredients?
I hope your friend recovers it. It could have sentimental value.
Oh man! You better replace it before someone else gets it!
Oh no! Did they give you an extra one back for it?
Its happened to us before... dont feel too bad. Its happened twice
That's pretty neat! What inspired her to do that!
That is so beautiful...what a beautiful thing to witness!
Oh no! What was the appointment about? Did it hurt?
Dentist here, can confirm.inspecting your dentist can save your life
The thick is good sometimes but the thin... difficult sometimes.
Thats right, I use the netflix and hulu plus services alot.
Yeah I agree.  I used to play with these videos ofelefish doing snuggle parties and I would always watch them.
Do you sleep mostly on the couch or on the phone?
Oh man, that's a terrible thing. How did it end up afterwards?
That's sad, I'm sorry for your loss
That is no fun. I wish I had not had any responsibilities also.
I know exactly what you are talking about.
Wow. What kind of memories?
I know what you mean... losing family is never an easy thing
That is great, did you get a good grade?
Congradulations. What are you studying in school?
Uh oh. I would have been anxious too! Did you end up trusting her?
That's good! I guess teenagers tend to underreact like that
That's awesome! It's good to stay motivated and keep at it! What's your PR?
That's great! I wish I had that type of drive.
Uh oh! Did anyone hear it?
Uh oh.  Was it something deadly?
That is awesome! I am happy for you!
Wow! That is amazing! I bet that made you feel great!
Did you? Any specific exercises you wanted to learn?
That's great! How are you now?
Why do people cheat
Why do you think he would do that?
That's cool. Do you practice a lot?
That is good, tennis is really fun
How'd they do it?
That is terrible!  Did you guys move past that point?
I agree, what are you waiting on to get back into the swing of things.
yea but now kids are always glued to their phones and playing videogames
Oh no. I hope you are doing better now!
Being immobile is really bad. I'm glad you got back to being yourself!
That is awesome. I need to go to the gym!
I don't go to the gym.
Parents can be so tough. Do you talk to them often?
I feel the same way sometimes.  It's easy if you don't have to prove something
That's really sad, how did she die?
I have two dogs and I can say for sure your heart isn't ready. You have to let it grow and know you have someone who will love and protect you no matter what. Be there for them when you need them most.
I'm sorry that happened. Did they ever make up?
I'm sorry you had to experience that, and I'm glad you learned from it. I've dealt with something like that before as well. Just remember that as much as they might think you're bad, it's really their loss in the long run.
I would have cried for multiple days.
I'm so sorry to hear that, I know it can be such an awful loss for a pet
How old is it?
That's good it turned out okay. Cats can be boppant whenever they want.
Oh, I'm so sorry you went through that, but I'm happy that you went through! I have two children, and I'm anxious the same way. Is it easier for you after childbirth?
What do you think about all the complications that could come with having a baby?
Awwww yea!!!  I'm happy for ya!  I'm taking summer courses myself.  What are you planning on majoring in?
School can be so boring.  I used to love summer vacations but now it just seems like it's never enough time in the year for anything.  Where are yo goin?
How was the visit?
I bet that was frustrating! How did you deal?
What kind of dress is it? A wedding one? Or a regular day out?
That sounds fun! What kind of party are you having!?
it's good to hear  that you're making a change, do you feel better?
Congratulations! It's always a good feeling to be in the zone and being able to enjoy walking!
Oh that is nice! Do you think you will get it?
Thats awesome! Im glad it worked out for you!
That's good! How did you do on your exam?
That's a great way of thinking. Did you pass?
Oh god, was he suspended from school, or was he just grounded?
Oh no! I'm sorry, that had to hurt!
oh, did you? did they have a good reason?
That is wonderful! I have not heard from my friend in years either, it's nice to get to know someone that is so caring
Oh that's nice, nothing like a day at the beach and a cold cold Dr. Pepper!  I love it
Sounds wonderful! I'm jealous :)
that is so dreamy!!
I'm sorry you are having these dreams.   I had one once that I just walked around in public in a bathing suit.  Then someone caught me on the website and tried to get a preview of the piece of clothing I wanted.  Then I woke up with money on my face and body.
I'm with you on the house thing, it would make my life so much easier
I feel ya. My friend got a new house and when he bought it, it was like a rented apartment.
I bet you had a nice relaxing time with your family!
that sounds so nice and cozy!
Did they get along well? I hope not for a bad thing
That is good. So many times we forget how little things really mean to people
Oh my gosh! I hate doctors...they always give me the worst headaches :( What did you end up doing?
Oh no that's horrible. What ended up happening?
That's great to hear. What happened to make you feel that way?
I am so glad to hear that. It is always a rough period in life, as you said. But it gives you a great opportunity. Do you have any advice for me?
I do too. That makes two of us I guess!
I agree, I have had a few people get in my life and do terrible things.  It's really difficult and emotionally charged to watch!
What did they say exactly?
Thats such bad customer service. You should definitely give them a call.
That's pretty awesome! How do you feel about doing it? Are you afraid?
I am afraid to even do that. Sounds exciting though!
Oh really? Any specifics?
Do they have any connection to your reality? I know I do, I'm very scared in mine.
You sound very motivated and healthy! You should follow through and be a better version of yourself!
You sound so motivated!
That's great! I'm happy to hear that. I had a miscarriage in February, but I'm happy about my son turning out just fine.
I'm happy to hear that. You must have felt very sentimental up there!
Wow that's pretty cool! I'm not very good at skating, so that sounds like it would be really fun to me.
Wow that sounds like a lot of fun! You must be very proud.
i bet you are super excited to be starting back
You can always make new friends while in college!
You will be okay. Take as many as you want. Don't stress about it too much as it will only make it worst what will happen in the future
You'll do great I am sure of it! What makes you worry about too much?
What makes you decide to do that
I do not, but I do have a partner
Yes, bugs are a real danger to our society!
Oh yes I hate those things too. I'm glad you're not going through a bad experience though and can enjoy your time in nature.
I am proud of my self-employed status too.  Not as wild of a stinker as some of my peers, but proud nonetheless!
You are very ambitious and you must have worked hard to get where you are in life!
Wow! That must have taken some time to plan!
That must've taken some driving skills!
That's awful. I hope you had good insurance
I'm so sorry to hear that... how are you holding up?
Sometimes it's difficult to let someone out when there's a lot of pressure on you. I know it can be hard because it's so personal and that's where you put so much stock in someone's judgment. How has she treated you in the past?
Patience is very helpful, I'm glad you seem to be patient. How did it start?
Did you just raise her, or is she an introduced pet?
That's wonderful! I'm glad she is learning to co-parent. Rats are the most curious pets!
That is cool I have never been to one.
I love going to amusement parks! I was actually looking forward to my visit but it turns out it was a dud for me haha
I hope it isn't! Have you talked with the vet about it?
Aww, that's so sad! I'm sorry for your loss. I hope she makes it!
I'm sorry, that must be terrible, I hope she will be back before you know it.
I think you are right on, but you never really know with all of the things that happen in life
Wow! How did that happen!?
Oh no! I hope they didn't judge you!
I'm sorry to hear that. That must have really upset her/he/she.
Don't you hate that feeling?  Its not good to let go of a friend you don't know is right
What kind of an album is it
You must be so happy, you must have a lot to get done!
oh wow! that sounds like such an exciting adventure!
Wow, I have never heard of them. When do you go?
I agree. What makes you think that might be the case?
You know what they call people with bigots? People who love bigots.
Did you get bit a few times?  I've never been in that situation.
That sounds pretty wild!  What were you most scared of?
Hahahah, that is so funny! Poor little thing! Did you beat the crap out of him?
hahahaha that is so funny! Did your brother let you try and wash the diaper?
That's so sad! I remember my aunt as well, they had a love that was unbreakable
That's incredibly kind of her. How did she live her life to be able to do that?
That's great! She must have a very good heart!
That's nice.  How many daughters do you have?
What do you want to eat most?
Oh, that's awful! My condolences to you and her family.
That's so sad to hear! I'm sorry to hear that.
That's very sad! I am glad you are keeping an attitude. Lots of people have died before and it's never fun going back into those old lives.
Did you drink water?
I hate driving in bad traffic.
That's a good thing. How long have you two been married?
I am so sorry to hear about that! I hope he gets the help he needs
It's not hard to replace an old friend. Just buy a farm and live on it!
That's too bad. Maybe it's because you're not rich like her. Maybe you just don't realize how valuable you are because of that?
What did you do? Did you confront him>
I would be careful about saying something to her that you don't want to publicize.
Oh my, what did the whole class think?
Oh no! I remember that too! I'm super bad about that too, but my teacher is super nice!
ohhh wow! I would be so excited! I would totally do that!
That is a funny prank to pull on him.
I wouldnt. Im sure they are happy there
Disneyland?  I feel like a kid during the first 15 or so days, and after that, not so much!
How cool! How long did you have to stay?
I bet it was really fun!!!
You sound like a very excited person! When is the party!?
You must be so excited! That is such an amazing moment in human beings. I am happy for you!
Oh cool! Do yall not like each other very much back in high school?
That is good, how long have you known her?
Oh no! Are you ok?
Oh no, that's awful! I'm glad you and your family did okay though.
Man that's awful. What hurricane was it? Did you have any damage to where you were?
That's a great reason! I don't know how many people follow that principle, it's interesting.
That's a great reason!
Wow that's pretty bad! How did you manage to break it
I would have grounded her too! How could a kid be that selfish?
What is the certification exam for?
Oh nice. What is the certification exam for?
Oh no... how old is she?
Aww, you must be sad. Do you have any plans for her birthday?
That's fantastic news! You must be so excited and proud.
That's great! I bet your boss loves you
That's too bad. How long have you been married for?
I'm so sorry.  How are you holding up?
Do you feel confised? Have you met any new friends?
Have you tried to go out and make friends?  Or try to find hobbies that will help you meet people?  I know it's hard to meet new people, I'm sorry!  Do you like the new city?
How did you feel about it?
That's terrible. I would be so sad if I were you! Can't people just try and study and do their best next time?
That's annoying! What song was it that stuck?
what does the song sound like?
Oh yeah, do they still work?
Yeah, I have a Bic pens myself. They're pretty cool looking.
Are you excited about it
That would be great. I am sure it will go for a great deal.
Oh that is so lame! Why were you not able to go?
Oh that's too bad. Maybe you could meet in person? It's not hard to get into a town and then go meet someone there on the weekend.
That is nasty, throw it up while she is still alive!
I hate when that happens.  My sister and her husband had a big mess the other night too.  They were just gross little bugs!
That's awful. Did anyone come to your rescue?
I would be livid as well. How did you fix it?
What types of things did your kids do when they were younger
I agree, I have to cherish the good old memories every year because that's when the real value of school is revealed.
Thin mints are delicious, and you should feel bad for doing that.  I think I'd start keeping a few around just in case.
Haha oh man! I bet you wanted to throw up after.
I'm very sorry to hear about your loss. Losing a family member really changes the way you feel. How's life now?
Its hard when we lose someone, no one left a will so us to feel like they are still here
OMG!  How did that go?  How did you react?
Thats nice of you.
That is so sad, I'm sorry. I hope things will get better for you soon!
I hope it does!
What kind of book was it?
Awh, that's too bad. Do you know what book it was?
That must've been pretty sad. Why did he/she not contact you at all?
Its hard when family isn;t always there for you. Did they send you a card?
It's a great attitude to have! Being care free is probably the best feeling I've had in my life.
Do you ever find it difficult to relax during the day because you get up too much?
Hahaha.. I think that's quite hilarious! Were other people laughing at you?
Oh no! That is so awkward! I am glad you weren't noticed! I have had that happen to me before!
Does your cat have a thing for you now?
That sucks. Maybe he is allergic. I hope that's it.
I'm sorry to hear about that. items like what
Oh wow! I bet you were really excited to open all those items
What kind of truck
That is good that your father is responsible enough. It is always nice to have a dad that is there for you no matter what.
what happend?
I can believe it.  I ca't believe either.  I had that happen to me once and the worst part was that the toilet was right there.
That is very kind of you! Most people around me would not go out of their way to do something like that. You sound like an amazing person.
That's cool.  How big was your ot?
That is a very noble gesture by your guys!
That's awesome, I love those! They are such a smart breed, very quiet
WOW that's terrible!  Did he at least treat you right?
Thats a good thing you did, thats the honest way to go about it.  People dont like to hear honest things about people, it makes it hard to be faithful.
That is great, I used to love drinking soda as a kid. It was so sweet and so healthy too!
That sucks but I'm happy it worked out for you. I'm addicted to caffeine too and I still feel bad for it.
I'm glad it didn't escalate to that point!
Sometimes kids are too smart to get into all of that stuff.
I love cds. What type of stuff did you find?
That really is great! I loved those old CODs. Did you find anything else?
That is not cool, I am sure you deserved the job
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it didn't make you depressed?
That sounds terrible, but it's good that you've made the changes you've made. Life's not about perfect and you can't change that.
that's a good attitude. you sound like a person with a great heart
That sounds like it could be a gamechanger.
That is a lot of boats! Are you going to be using it for something bigger, bigger, or shorter?
That is a lot of money!
That's awesome! I love to be able to have a "husband" moment.  Do you enjoy fishing?
I do too actually. I recently loaned some money to a friend and loaning it back ended up making things worse.
That was very generous of you, it is nice to know that you were able to lend her some money
Oh my goodness. Where did he go when he went missing?
That's so sad. How did they end up losing their dog?
You must be having such a great time!
I love riding rollercoasters.
Aww that's so hard on them, I hope she didn't cry!
I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes when family is away for a large amount of time something like this doesn't happen. It's like when I get to the gym with the family, and my cousin comes to the curl up with the girls after practice just to distract me while I'm still getting back on my feet
I hate when that happened.
That's good that you took the above mentioned approach. I'm sure you would find someone better for your needs.
Did you get in any trouble?
That must've really disgusting. Did he help you up?
That's terrible. I hope that you get that figured out!
I am glad that you have a science solution. You should look into Wheatgrass treatments.
How old is your son? What kind of car did he get?
How fun!!!  I love remote control cars, would you have used it to take him for a walk??
Were you in the car? Did you call the police?
thats a real bummer ive had that happen before
That is so sweet!
That's so sweet of you to do! I'm sure she appreciated your service!
That's great! How old is he?
That's awesome, kids grow up SO quickly.
That is great!  Congrats!  What do you do for work?
That is great. I am happy to hear that.
Were you looking at the wrong school or just nostalgia? If it's the wrong school you know the feeling of nostalgia and being younger again!
I know exactly what you are talking about.  It seems that every year passes faster.  It seems that time never flies by. ha ha
Aretha Franklin died a long time ago? I'm not that old.
She was my absolute favorite singer.
I love red beans and rice!
That's amazing! What did you have?
Oh no, that's a horrible thing. How did you learn that?
I am so sorry.  It is hard to be in that position and hear news like that.  Is there anything that you can do to help?
That's awesome. Did you study really hard to get the result?
You did? I hope so as well because that is no fun waiting around for something like that. I am sure it was a lot of studying.
That's great! Are they excited?
That is a smart move!
I'm sorry to hear it. Does the bullying continue at school?
I am so sorry to hear about that!  My daughter was bullied during her first year too.  I think it's important to teach our kids the harsh reality of bullying and how much it's hurting them and us.
And took advantage? How?
Did everything turn out alright?
Oh no, I hope he recover!
I bet you were glad you did that.  What breed is your dog?
Oh, how sweet! I hope the kitten is safe!
What kind of cat do you have?
That must of been fun, music or dance or what?
Wow, cello is a great instrument!
oh wow! that must have been so scary!
Oh no, that's terrible!  Did any of your coworkers tell you about it?
Wow. Why is he not willing to leave?
Wow I'm sorry that's terrible. Maybe you can try to get back together?
It's probably for the best if he's not happy now and just wants to try new things out.
Sounds like he's going to take it to a whole other level, that's terrible.
That's the worst, it's frustrating to lose things when there are so many more convenient options
That is a terrible way to lose your kitchenware.  It's so frustrating!
How did it go?
Wow, that's nice! I had someone babysit my kid last year and it was hard. I bet this time will be easier
That is awesome. How old is he?
Oh wow, that must've been really gross!
Wow, that must of been really gross!
Oh, I love playing soccer!  I used to be a pretty bad player aswell, but with some practice you can really tune them out!
Just try and have a good time. Don't be a downer. Just be confident!
I'm so sorry to hear that. Did the vet find the dog guilty?
Oh, wow!  That must have been a very scary experience!  I'm glad that stitches seem to be doing just fine these days!
Nintendo is a very cool company, I have a switch myself!
That is a really interesting bet. What was the bet about? Did he have a good reason why he didn't have a Switch?
Are you guys really good friends?
What came up?
I think that's hilarious and kind of funny that your cousin talked you into doing something that you probably didn't want to do.
I feel bad that you felt that way but that is how the world works I guess.
oh yea i can see that!
Maybe she should get it for you.
That's pretty cool.  Is your friend a young millionaire?
That is some feat.
oh wow that sucks, did you guys move out?
That's terrible!  Did they damage anything in your room as well?
hahaha I'm with you on that one! I would have been all over that
Aw, I'm sorry. Maybe they will come back around.
Awww! I love it maggotty. How did you celebrate this special moment with your family?
thats awesome i am glad you had such a nice day
Yeah, I understand that too sometimes. I think they have too much cruelty to humans involved. But that's a cool zoo you went to.
That sounds so sad and sad!
I bet that's exciting! How long will it be free?
That's pretty cool. How long have you been contesting it?
Where are moving?
That sounds exciting! Where did you move?
Oh, no. Why didn't you kiss him!
Hahahahaha.  That must have been really cute though.  So he was just trying to get your heart rate up?  Yeah, I can't imagine.  Yeah, we're talking decades apart, weren't we? ha ha.
Cool! What field do you think that this would be beneficial in?
That sounds like a neat project!
Thats great, I never win anything but I still love when people win
It's nice that she had a winning chance. You must feel really happy for her.
Was he a dragon slaying  man?
What kind of sword? Did it look like a dragonfly, something?
Are you worried something will happen?
I like to be organized before the big day!
Oh no! Did you file a police report?
Oh my gosh! That's horrible and I'm so sorry! How big is the dent?
Awww! I bet that was so sweet! Did she end up with you?
Yeah I bet. Dogs are the most interesting pets. Did she go on to her full adventure?
What did he buy?
That is very trusting of you. I hope he pays you back!
Really?
That is so sad. It makes you want to be extra careful next time you are traveling.
News to what?
I feel you. Waiting is no fun
Oh no!  I'm so sorry.  I hate to hear it like that, but sometimes fate has anointed someone it seems.
I'm sorry, I'm really not a fan on surprises either, so if I were you I would try to anticipate the best.  Did the person behind you at least offer a hint as to why you didn't get it?
That sounds like the beginning to a bad day. Were you able to clean it up?
That sounds revolting! Were you able to get your car changed?
Where to?  Are you telling someone you are going?  I have lived in this apartment 5 years and know the area well
where are yall moving?
Oh no! What library is it?
Oh that sucks!  I would be so sad if that happened to me.  What book was it?
What kind of toys did she have? toys that were with you? memories? memories of when she was little?
Did you cry when you found it? I know I almost did when I first found my dog. almost.. almost.. I want to say she was a lab.
That is great! I am so proud of you!
Good, good. Statistics is the study of numbers.
How do you think you did?
That's good! What is your final grade?
That's a really stupid thing to do. What for? Must've been a honest friend, who just happened to have a car lend them out to, and they've got no bills. Can they really put a hold on it for more than a day, or do I need to tell them?
Oh no! What a stupid friend! How did you pay back the money you lent it?
It's a good place to work, but maybe it's time to look for another job.
You sound like a really good person. You have a fulfilling job, that's for sure.
That's pretty cool! Have you gotten any money for it?
I hope it went well for you! Did you get a call?
what is the job for
You sound very excited!  Where did you move?
I am sure it will be worth it
That's a good choice, I've always hated buying my own brand.
Sometimes you got to try something new and it might not work. Sometimes there is just no such things as too much!
Rain is good sometimes
Stay positive and get some rest!
I'm so sorry! I know how hard that can hit. I have a friend with a dog that I used to have. She just lost him in the past week.
That is so sad. I had two dogs that were hit by car accidents. They're both fine but it's hit hard because they're so young. I'm sorry for your loss.
Is there a time that you are not ready for?
Sounds like you're well prepared! Are you going to be preparing for a similar season in the future?
That's really nice of her! You guys must be close
She sounds so wonderful and caring. You're a lucky man/ woman!
That is a tough one, it is one of those if it bleaches you can get a refund type of situation.
I understand. I ordered a lot of chicken nuggets today and they are gluten free. But they still had the wrong order. It was a lie, plain and simple.
Those arent good for you
That would make me so mad!  Why would they change the order?!
Wow, you're leaving our little ones behind? How old are they now - and I'm guessing they're not that little anymore.
It is always nice to look back at the old items as well as the new!  I am glad you found the jeans.  Does that mean the jeans will not fit her?
Dang! That is nice...what kind of pancakes did she make?
pancakes are my favorite too! I love bacon on eggs and toast- I wish she was my wife.
I'm glad you're a good cook. I'm terrible at cooking for other people.
She's probably getting overtime too right?
Did your brother know?
I'm sure he'll keep it a secret no matter what. That's a good sign
That is admirable, people need friends like you.
Being able to offer supportive help is one of the best things you can do. It's one thing if you can't directly help her, but at least offering supportive help is something she can use in the future.
I am happy for you
That's an awesome car! What color did it come in?
That is pretty smart, I would be crazy attached to my car
That's a really good idea! You can always get a new one once you are more financially prepared. Good luck with saving!
Oh no! I hope she doesn't have a hard time respecting that! I know there is something really simple and comfortable about wearing a diaper, it's not like you have to wear two different clothes or anything.
That's a funny predicament to be in. I bet that was embarrassing for you.
What toy did you order and how old is he?!
What toy did he get you?
That's great! Where are you guys headed?
That sounds amazing!  Where are you going!
Oh man, did you end up finding anything
That's unfortunate, I'm glad you were able to do it
Maybe they didn't want you to be humble? I mean, if they didn't want to give you gifts and were just being disrespectful, I can totally see how you'd be feeling a little down.
That sounds really good!  Congrats!  I am very happy that both of you are getting back in the habit of showing your love even if it's only on Sunday!
Why junk food?
I do the same, I love doing it but it can get me real down.  Especially junk food, like fast food.
That's so neat! Did you guys have a good time and catch up with old times?
So, how did it go then? Did he like them?
That's cool.  It's nice to get a little bit involved in something that kids like.
She must have been very excited to see you as a parent. That says a lot about the coach! How old are your daughters?
That's terrible! How are you healing?
That is terrible! What did you do to help your mom get better?
That's no good. How is she doing?
I am so sorry to hear about that! Has she had tests or done anything to check on the other patients?
That is so nice.  cats are so sassy.
That sounds so wonderful! My cats love to just lay on me and get pets, too! I feel so lucky
How did it go then?
I am confident you got it! Did you have any interviews recently?  I have one right after this one
did it feel nice?
That's pretty relaxing! What lake house did you end up at?
LOL! That's pretty dangerous...did he get himself one back though?
That is nasty! What a waste of a good night.
Did you enjoy yourself?
Thats awesome! I wish i could afford to go to a park like that.  I dont have money to go that far.
Well that's very nice of him.
disability doesn't always mean you're bad off. I'm glad you have a good dad for doing what he can for you. You deserve someone like that.
What did you have problems with before you met your new one?
Psychiatrist here, can confirm, they can be quite complicated and expensive.
Oh really? That must mean that your life is going pretty good?
Must feel pretty lonely.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear you were so far away! How did it turn out?
Maybe you could call an air hostess or some other hostess to help?
That's no fun.  I always wait like 5 minutes max at most stores lol.  What was the line about?
That is long, why only one cashier?
Oh, man, that's got to hurt! Were you there?
How old was your brother in law when he passed?
That's cool. Where did they go?
That's great! Where did you guys all meet?
College? I've never heard of such a thing. Sounds fun! What are the guys like?
College is a big time commitment and lots of people leave when they get married.
I'm sorry to hear that, it's really tough to find time for all that!
Oh no! I hate when wife and boyfriend spend too much. Did you tell her?
I am sure she is getting a little jealous and will let you know in a good way.  It is her right as an American to bare arms is defended by the first amendment.  I am sure you would prefer that over hearing it from her.
Oh really? What did the woman do to deserve being mean to that other woman?
That's terrible! Did they get in fights or anything?
Wow, that's terrible. Did the police come after her?
Aw, that's too bad. Maybe she will have a surprise party for you at her house!
I'm sorry, it will work out in the end though.
That's good. It's good that your kids are excited to get back to school and learn new things.
That is so thoughtful! You must be proud.
How do you think you did on it?
I bet it was! I am glad everything turned out ok
I lost my grand father a few years ago. It's hard. I felt bad for them
That's very distressing and unforgiveable.  I hope they listen eventually.  It's hard to see loved ones being so selfish in the age of social media and online communication
what sports do they play?
What is she playing now
That's awesome, I love to fish!
That's really neat! I'm actually kind of jealous since I just recently went fishing myself! But I'm glad you seem excited about it!
Is that a video game?
Sounds like a great time! What are you going to get?
why are you so nervous?
I hate it when people make it hard for themselves! I am sure it wasajuust fine when they came over :)
What gift are you asking for?
What kind of gift are you expecting?
That's terrible. Have you tried to get it to stop?
That is really mean. I hope you get it cleaned up real quick so that no one will see you did it.
Awesome! I love camping! I am sure it is so much fun. Are you going alone?
That is good. Where are you camping?
That sounds terrifying, did you get up to go look?
I would be so terrified!  I don't understand why people freak out over little noises like that!
Oh no. That's too bad. Do you have a leak in your house? seal
oh no. Make sure the water goes back outside.
I'm sorry, what exactly was wrong with it?
I'm sorry to hear it. Did you report it to the store?
That sounds good. Did it work?
It's probably the former, but either way still not good!
That's pretty sweet...what is your sweet spot?
Oh yeah.  Those are the good old fashioned ones with the chocolate inside?  I prefer the ones with chocolate in the centers.
What did you think of it?
Aww, you're right, she is very precious!
That's wonderful. My son recently started taking me out to play videogames because I've been having such a great success with my son! What games do you play?
I love minecraft. Do you play too
Oh man, that's a trip for sure! Dean's is one of my favorite sandwich shops, too!
I LOVE Dean's dip! I'm so glad you were able to find it! I'm not much on the Dean's diet, but I'm glad you were.
Congratulation! I am also looking for an offer and would like it if you could also get it!
Congratulations! I bet you're super excited for that. Will you have a nice bonus for your loyalty?
Is it a sales promotion or something different.  I hope everything goes well for you!
Well I hope you get it! If not, that means you can always look at the bright side at some point.
What was the thing that made you so stressed about the situation
What a disgusting thing for the police to do.
Why would they do such a thing???  Its not right
That was an awesome game! I was rooting for England
That must have been such a fun time! Were you there?
Oh that does not sound fun
At least you guys still have time for your summer to heat up, right?
I can definitely imagine you would miss them but at least you are having fun at least!  You can still see them around sometimes when you shop for groceries.
I can imagine.  I hate cleaning!  Was it difficult?
Oh god. Was it rotting?
I am so appalled! What an abhorrent thing to do!
That sounds so sad.
I know right. What kind of people want to take the lives of animals so don't you think it's a bit crazy to some degree that humans are outlasting them?
People like to blame others when it their time is inconvenient. But when it's their time to take a stand, I totally agree. People who take the high road should be arrested and put in jail.
That's great! I'm a soccer player and coach myself. I wish my kids were on a team like that! Good for him!
You must be a very proud parent!
Me too. They must have been excited to play outside all day.
YES! That's why we have the tv show America's Got Talent. Some of the best tv talent out there.
That's funny, because my mom used to be a nobody until she got a job and an office.
I'm jealous! Where are they headed to?
That's true...there's always the weekends lol!
Were you able to get him out of the yard?
I'm glad it didn't escalate to a dangerous degree! I'm not as wild about aggressive dogs as some others, so I don't bite people who are easily offended!
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you handling this loss well?
That's awful. I'm really sorry about all of that. I rescue animals as well, and I can say that is very hard on the animal and person. I hope your friend is okay.
Sounds like she is learning
You must have been a great parent.
OH NO! Did she say why she didn't pay, and how can you get in touch with the director to get that money back?
I'm sorry, I think that is normal, it's just stressful as most of us do it that way. I'm sure she understands, she's probably happy she has another way to pay her fees.
That's terrible. I'm so sorry to hear this happened to you. Will you be OK in the future?
It's nice to have family that can back you up.  Did she help you out with any debt?
Did she leave the power on?
I can understand the same! I've been married for nearly 15 years, and while I don't miss her I do miss having her around!
Oh no!  How did you repay her?
Wow she must have been disappointed in you. Did you ask for forgiveness?
What movie?
Hahahaha, what was the movie? Save me.
Holy heck that's nuts!  I'd say switch it all over!
He probably forgot about it too! That sucks!
I understand! I'm in that camp right now!
Hahaha that's awful, kids are never held accountable for what they wear or what their parents did! That must be frustrating!
Are you going to have a fun time? I love butterflies!
Where are you going to meet her?
ewww that sounds so gross
I've had that happen before, where there was a hair inside the apple?
What happened next!? Did you try to scare her away or just run away?
Oh wow! Did you try to scare it away or just run?
What breed is it?
What breed of dog is he?
Ehh, don't beat yourself up about it.  Everyone makes those kinds of dumb mistakes sometimes.  It's okay, you're a sweet person.
Hey, pie is good when you need it, especially when it's hot.
I would have totally jumped out of my skin!! I hate snakes so much! I would have peed my pants
I would have peed my pants. I don't even want to think about it! I hate snakes so much!
I would of been so scared to do that
How much did you get?
Nice! What type of bonus?
That sucks, did you already buy tickets?
That's such a shame! Will you get some good movies then?
What kind of photo did you use to get that look?
That sounds so cool!  How long did it take to do?
Eww!  I bet that was gross!
Lol. Did the poop get on you?
Did your cat ruin the nap?
I understand, cats can be strange. Did you give him the finger?
Nice! I hope you did well. Did you get a call about it?
Interviews can be nervewracking.
I bet that was frightening and nerve wracking.
That sounds scary! Were you okay?
Oh wow, that must suck to have your cousin get so much information about you.
That's a really good thing that we did that way. I would feel a bit guilty too if someone I knew lost a bunch of money.
And left?
What a scary man! Did you call the cops on him?
oh no sorry to hear about your cat, how is he now?
That is sad, I am so sorry. I have one of those cats and it's sad too. They are so smart so if you give them the chance they can figure everything out.
That's cool! Have you been dating long?
That is actually quite interesting! I bet he appreciated the attention.
Awesome! Congratulations! What was the project?
Congratulations! That's amazing!
What song is it?
what is the song? i'd love some help
What did you say?
I'm going to study accounting.
Oh my! I hope it wasn't an important person.
Oh no! I hope it didn't lead to anything really bad...
What? Can you trust him?
Oh I understand. That is a very trusting friend
Are you worried? Have you gone the route before or will you be the first in a line?
Nurse! I love nursing! I'm sure you will nail it
What did you buy for your husband?
That's wonderful. I'm glad you have started to feel better about it!
Oh no. That's so sad. What happened?
Thats too bad. Life happens I guess. I hate being an adult
Is he usually OK with that? If so that's awesome! What do you usually do to improve the relationship?
Sometimes it can be hard to communicate that type of information. How has the relationship been going lately?
I'm sorry about your financial troubles. Has your situation improved recently?
I'm in the same boat.  I'm in college and have no student loan debt and make about the same as if I had kept my parents' money.  Sometimes the tightlends make me forget how fragile I really am.  What do you recommend to do with your extra money?
I'm sorry, that must make you angry. Did he pass away unexpectedly or was he diagnosed earlier?
What did he do?
Did he pick you to do it? Why wouldn't you just do it before your mom-in-law get home?
That can be a pain sometimes.
That is very unfortunate.  I have lost both of mine, so I know how you feel.
I bet that would make you feel good. It is nice that your mother is still around.
That must be very difficult, I'm happy it's not your wife causing you problems
That's very admirable. I have to let my daughter grow up, she's in her 20s now. She is more independent than I am at 31. But I guess she is still an infant and I am stuck by her side no matter what.
How old are your children? That's pretty generous of you to let them spread the wings.
Wow.  That is terrifying, what happened to happen then?
that sounds scary! I'm happy everything ended up going fine.
wow nice, what game is that?
Congratulations! That's an accomplishment that I can't even begin to match!
That's sweet! How old is your daughter?
oh no, that's awful.  Is it possible to get it fixed?
oh no thats terrible what happend
oh my lord, I can only imagine how horrible that must've felt
Oh, no! Was it embarrassing for you, or embarrassing for them? I'm an awkward drunk and I've done both lol.
Oh no! I hate embarrassing things! Do you think everyone caught it on film?
That's awesome! What is her degree in?
She graduated already??
I'm sorry to hear that, did it get better?
I'm so sorry! I can imagine how scary it must have been to find out you had it. I hope you are feeling better!
Oh no I'm sorry to hear that!
Sorry about that, is she going to stay at your house?
That's nice, are you nervous?
thats very nice of her!
That's great! What is the class?
What is the class?
That's cool.  What was the song?
What was the song?
Oh wow. Im so sorry to hear that. How did he die if you don't mind me asking?
Oh wow. I'm really sorry to hear that but it's a part of life I suppose.
That sucks. I'm sorry. How old is she?
That is so terrible. How is she feeling now? Has she been in a hospital?
Nice! What did you have?  Did you share?
Sounds delicious! Whatender was it?
How do you like it now?
That's a bummer. Maybe you can work it off?
Have you tried anything religious or spiritual about it, or do you just pray and do whatever it takes?
I'm with you on the headaches part, especially since I can't seem to quit the coffee addiction!
Good luck! I'm sure if you just keep putting yourself out there they'll put you in your place eventually!
I hope you get it! Waiting is the worse part about job hunting.
Did the parents scold you?
I think those things should stay in schools. They are not toys if they are used for a lot of different things.
hahaha..sounds like a good time!
hahaha sounds like a great way to get the body and the mind ready for the unknown.  Hope you feel better as well!  Drink up!
what did they say
How did that make you feel?
Oh no! What happened?
ohh, that's bad. I feel bad for him. What do you did?
It must've been, how old are they?
It must be such an overwhelming experience!
Oh no. Was she not happy to hear it?
That was nice of you.  Did she appreciate it?
Did you play in those gear when you were younger?
That sounds like a lot of fun! I haven't been able to find any paint or any takers for years.
Oh wow! I have wanted to do it for a long time! Was this your first time?
Skydiving sounds so exciting! I would be so scared too! How'd it go
Aw, that's so sad, I'm sure it was pretty sentimental.
did he find it
Ouch! Hopefully you were not too embarrassed!
oh no :( did you hurt your pride?
Is it a special occasion?
That's so sweet, I bet it brought back a lot of great memories as well!
Congratulations! Are you going to buy anything for it yet?
Congratulations! That's incredible! It seems that you really worked hard. I would never have been able to do that!
That sounds like sooo much fun!
I like to play baseball sometimes also.
Old friends are the best
snuck? how old is she?
Dang! Well, I'm in the same boat. I've been cutting since I was 16 and now I'm 30 and haven't even started trying to lose weight. I think we need more help motivating people to get motivated.
Have you been looking to replace it?
I'm sorry it went through such a thing
Did she nail it?
That's pretty cool!  You must have a pretty big family.  You sound like a great parent! ha ha.
That sucks.  How badly did they damage your car?
I'm sorry to hear about that.  How long ago was this?
She is awesome for doing that.
That was nice of her! You guys are close
Oh my gosh!  I have heard that it can cause accidents!  I have never flown before so that made me nervous!
That happens to everyone, it is normal!
That's awful! I bet you felt terrible. You're a good husband though.
That is a good decision by you. She will forgive you.
I'm glad you had a nice time! What did you all do?
That's awesome! I love being with my parents! It's like being back to school again!
Neat! Have you ever tried on some?
I think the ones I have feel pretty grippy too. What kind are they?
Did he enjoy the visit?
Wow, that's awful! Did you clean it up or no?
That is terrible. How old is your daughter?? I hope everything went okay.
wow that's a great lunch!
Are you one of the bridesmaids?
Are yall going to go gether together?
Oh, how cute!  I rescued a new cat about 4 years ago.  What is your friend's favorite food?
I'm so sorry. I have two cats, but they're getting too old. My friend got a cat about 8 months after my dog. I think you can make it work (by being patient and kind and being supportive) but it's so hard!
Nice, storms can be very unpredictable. I hope it all works out for you!
That is good, I am glad you were able to get a new car!
That is really awesome!  I am glad you had someone to help you out.  What kind of terms did he come up with?
Must have taken a while for him to whip that out.
That's awesome!  Did you get a big bonus?
That's good! Hopefully they hear back for you
What is the charity of choice?
That is amazing, I have never been able to do anything like that before in my life
That is great! How big was the birthday?
What things in particular?
Florida Man...I'm a New England man myself. How long have you been living in Florida?
I live in Florida too. I go back every year on the anniversary of my fathers death. Makes it that much more special.
How'd he go?
Oh that sounds stressful! How old is he?
I hope you ace it! What is the subject??
That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that you feel confident!
Nice! What kind of job is it for?
I hope you got it! It can be nerve wrecking.
What movie? Was the name familiar?
What was the movie? Save me.
I am so sorry. That is so bad.  I hope it gets better soon.
That's very nice of you. I'm sorry that you're going through that but I hope that you're doing the best you can with the situation at hand!
Oh no! That's not fair of her! You guys must have a really great relationship, or it wouldn't of happened!
That is terrible. I'm glad you had someone to take care of it while she was away. Dogs are so loyal and can help take care of anyone.
Have they fixed it yet?
That sounds really frustrating. You guys at work have the same issues, so I understand. It's frustrating to not be able to keep up with things you're doing right!
That must be so sweet and fun for them! It's nice to spend a lot of your free time with them and spending a lot of money at grandma's house.
Aw that's so sweet! You should totally go!
Sorry to hear that.  I am sure that is no fun but I'm happy you were informed!
I am happy that he is healthy and happy for you!
That is very unfortunate, I am sorry to hear that.
Sometimes it happens that things go wrong. I'm sorry.
That must be annoying.
Oh wow, I am sure he has had a rough life, but at least he seems okay now!
That's awesome, good for you. What language was it?
Congrats! What did you learn?
How old were you? It's always nice to be fresh in the air after a hard workout.
Good job! You must skate a lot!
oh cool! the beach is really nice! i've never been to a beach, what part of the state are you in?
That sounds like so much fun!
That sounds lovely!
Oh wow!  I bet it was embarrassing!  How long before you got it back again?
Thats a bummer. Did they compensate you at least
Thats awesome! an expensive one at that! Congrats
That is so sweet!  I would love for someone to get me an apple watch!
Life comes with those kind of moments, is it resolved?
That sounds like it. What did you eat?
Thats awesome! Did he know you came back?
That's great. Did he notice or even acknowledge your raise?
Oh no!  That's terrible.  I hope things get better for you both in the future.  Do you have any ideas on what to do to help?
That is really scary. I hope things work out! budget cuts have been happening for awhile.
You got this girl. If all else fails you may consider adoption. Its a big life event and you are probably overreacting a little
That sounds so fun and nostalgic! Did it make you think of your friends and other holidays?
I bet that brought back some awesome memories. Did you play a lot with them?
What happened?
That's a shame. I hope you can save it, or at least fix it!
Awe, that really stinks! Did you have plans after work, atleast for today?
Was it a special trip at least?
That's great! You deserved to treat yourself!
Are you moving there soon?
That sounds awesome! I'm sure you will have great success with their new job!
That sounds like fun! How old is he?!
I think those games can be pretty exciting. Especially the backyard ones!
What kind of qualifications do you have to meet to get the job?
Congratulations.  Is it something that you have wanted to be doing longer?
That's great!   Is it a big company?
That is good, it is always good to have a positive attitude about something
Aww, poor fellow, did he need surgery?
That was nice of him. Did he get a treat from you too?
How did it go after you came in and it was positive?
I imagine, but video chatting and writing down what you have to say in front of a interviewer is a good way to go.
It can be hard to talk to people you don't know, so if you can't trust people at first, try and be open and honest about it. It's always easier when people know you well.
i am so sorry to hear that.  I am hoping for the best for you
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope the doctor has some answers to your pain.  I can't imagine what the alternative is.
Wow! That's great! I love soccer.
That's great!  Is he very talented?
Oh no! That is awful, is it something she figures on later?
Thats good. Kids are so observant of everything these days.
What an awesome accomplishment! Sounds like you raised a very special young lady!
Wow! Sounds like a sweet gig!  I bet your family really enjoyed that.  Did they bring you anything cool?
Wow, I have one myself. It was quite an amazing game, actually. I can still play it sometimes.
I'm sorry you're going through that. I wish I could be there to support you. What's the issue?
Oh no that's not good at all. I hope that you feel better soon.
Maybe. Could you try different pillowcases or maybe get different comforter?
You're so uncle Jebodiah!
You're such an uncle to him. I'm sure he'll keep that in mind for next time.
Uh oh, was it okay?
Oh that's nice, I hope everything is ok.
Oh no, that sounds like a nightmare!
Oh my!  I hate road rage!  I'm glad your brother was able to do something about it!  Did you have any cameras?
I can understand your point
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Me too! I prepare every day for a reason! What is it?
I think being prepared for a situation is a lot more important than simply being ready.
Oh no! Was it bad?
That is awesome that she is doing good now!
Uh oh, what happened?
That happened sometimes, I hope it works out for you.
I'm not surprised that he does things like that - he seems like a strange person to do those sorts of things.  But social media has sure caught up with him in the past few months!
That must of made a lot of sense to him then
What a nice thing to discover!  Did you play with those a lot?  Did they make you happy?
That sounds like so much fun to me!
That must've taken a long time!
Chicago is awesome, I've been there 3 or 4 times.
That's pretty cool! What are you studying right now?
What do you like the best?
That is awesome!  I am sure that was an awesome day for both of you!
That is so sweet. I'm glad you got to share it with someone.
I don't get the Halloween thing but, everyone else seems to like it!
that sounds like so much fun i would die
That's loyal. What company?
That's awful, I'm glad to hear it went your way.
A what lie?
What was the lie?
I am so glad you got that good job.  It is always a good feeling to be secure and helping others.
Thats great.  Did you find a good job doing it?
That's awful, I hope you were all right!
Oh my, how terrible! I hope that the people involved were okay!
Wow that's nice. Were you delighted to attend?
You are very lucky to have such family.
Cool, are you a little nervous about it?
Cool, I hope you got it then!  Were you nervous?
That must've been scary!
Oh no!  Did you end up getting any kind of compensation?
How exciting!  How do you get to pick your own prize?
That is a very specific and specific use of the $100.  I think I would pass out and cry if I were in your position.
That's so awesome! Moving can be so stressful!
Wow, did you ask for a handout as well?
Sorry to hear that. What were you going to buy?
I hate powerball tickets too! Well, you can buy another one and try to win!
That must've been really awesome! I can never get enough of LOTR!
I think that's very suspend and story-based game play, not a documentary on Bilbo the Bilbo of Bilbo the LotR.  But LOTR is a very complex story!
They? The politicians? I agree with you 100% that is a gross over reaction by them. The FBI is handling the case as we know it.
The Republicans don?t seem to understand how or even understand the concept of cybersecurity.  They just keep funding those same people.  The real question is, is the money laundered by Trump or his cronies?
Oh no. How old was the goldfish?
That's a shame. You could have given her some love during those tough times.
Oh yeah? How do you feel about that?
oooh, was it a long interview?
Oh man! That's the worst! Did you get it fixed?
I'm so sorry to hear about that! autosave can be really handy though! I hope it didn't take you long doing it!
What a terrible thing for them to do in that situation... Sorry to hear about that.
That sounds horrible.
Did you try anything to get it checked out?
I hope you get that figured out.
How was the magic show.
What show was it?
How do you feel? Do you think you are ready?
I hope you get it! What kind of job is it for?
How did that make you feel
That's great! Did the person know what they were getting into/
That was nice of her!
She must have really appreciated that you appreciated that.
how are you adjusting
Aw, that's too bad. How far away did you move?
I'm so sorry... That's so awful. I hope that was an easy process for you...
That is very kind of your aunt.
Oh, did you feel content with what you had done?
That sounds wonderful!
What did he do for work?
I'm sorry to hear you were so miserable. I know that you must be heartbroken.
That was nice of them!
That was very nice of them!
She is in a better place now
I'm sorry you were feeling sad about your grandma. I bet that is hard.
That's terrible. I hope you got it back okay
Paper airplanes are the worst.
Wow that's awesome! What was it on?
What is the paper?
What was it, may I ask?
Oh wow! How exciting! Will you stay there for a whole week?
That's awesome! I have a cat, too, and it goes to the trash every night.
Congratulations! That's awesome. I have a cat who was just a stray, and found an adopted mom. They are great pets.
That really sucks to leave them with you but at least it's only for a few days. How old are the babies?
That sounds hard, but I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. How far did you leave?
That sounds like a fun time! I bet he will love that!
Oh wow. I wonder how he'll take being home with that?
What happened? did he forget?
haha yeah i know how that feels
Good for you! Going back can make you a household name!
Good for you! Hard decisions is key sometimes.
That is awesome, what was in it
That's really neat. What kind of jewelry?
Nice! How did it fix your car?
That's good, it's nice to get a shop fix even if it's just for a little bit.  Did they fix your car for free or for a set amount of time?
Oh no, I'm so sorry! How is he coping?
That's a tough situation to be in but I'm glad you're looking into ways to help make things better for him!
Really - did they do something cool?
That's nice! It's nice to have great friends, even just for driving sometimes!  Did you have any fun?
What!! That's so bad!! Do you know who they are?
That's really messed up. What do you want to do to stop it?
I can understand.  When did you graduate?
I can totally understand the feeling!  I was never a great person at college and I sure wasn't during high school either
I am sorry to hear about that. How long were friends?
Aw, that's really sweet! Hopefully everything works out in the end for you!
Oh no! I hope you find them!
You're a carkeyder, hu?
did you get mad at him?  or are you glad he came with you
That is good. Rented from a friend or family.
Sounds like a solid response! Why don't you tell her yourself?
That's good that you didn't do anything rash like hitting someone in the nose or something.
What about a bank?
Wow, that is a lot! I would definitely need that kind of money to keep going through the legal process to get them in the US if they ever made it. I am so happy for him!
That's awesome! Was it a marathon?
thats awesome, how long did it take you to do that?
Wow! That sounds like such fun! Were they expecting it, too?
Wow! Big surprise or a nice present?
I bet that brings back memories
I agree.  The 90's seemed like an easier time!  What did you miss most?
that must've felt so good
That sounds horrible! I'm sorry that happened to you!
It's not for everyone! I used to be afraid to because of my fear of heights, too. But now that I'm a lot younger I think it's easy enough.
Haha!  That's funny!  Oh no!  I have never been but would love to be and would feel horrible afterwards!  Sorry you felt that way!
Where did he fly too? Is he staying somewhere safe?
I'm glad he's doing well though! How far does he live from you?
What kind of job is it?
You will do just fine, I believe in you.
Why are you moving?
It's great that you're moving, but I can imagine that you'll have some new people in your life! Are you meeting anyone?
poor dog, was it hurt?
That is terrifying! I hope that you were not harmed at all.
What was it
That's great! I am glad it turned out well. What was it that you were worried about?
That is really good to here! What has he been doing?
Taco Bell? Oh, how fun! What a nice husband. That really makes me want Taco Bell!
Yes it has!! What has happened in your week?
Congradulations
I know exactly what you are saying.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I love rewatching movies I watched as a kid
Aw, that's cute. You should hold onto the stuffed animal too lol
Oh no! Is he ok?
That is so sad! What breed of dog?
What did you do then?
That's pretty funny.  He must have really been handy.  Did you find the cable guy?
I am so sorry to hear about that.  Do they have full recognition of your fathers mistakes or have they made excuses to not recognize him
Uh-oh!  What happened to him/her?
That sounds like a great relaxing time! I'm jealous! lol
Ohhh that's so nice. I love sunny
Did you have another college to drop out too?
Sometimes grad school can be tough, and with a four year degree you'll have more experience and be more familiar with the areas in which you will be working.
On no! Were you hurt?
That's really embarrassing - did you hurt anything?
how is he doing on the med?
soup is a good soup.
That's annoying!  I hate when they don't stand there and look at you the whole time!
That's great!  Did you feel nervous or what?
That's really impressive! What kind of questions do you have? Are you nervous?
Wow, really - good luck with that!
Why did he do that
Oh no! Did it happen recently? Is he okay with the idea of having sex with another woman?
Those mood whirls are no good. Do they happen randomly or does he always keep them in check?
It happens. If you're good to him and he's loyal to you then he's a good guy in your eyes. If you don't feel that way then he may be trying to do whatever is best for himself (i.e. make the relationship work).
Woo good luck!
That's awesome! I bet you'll be very proud when you see those!
Oh I am so sorry to hear that! How did it happen??
Oh no, that's so sad. It's like losing a child to an illness that makes you very sad.
That's so sweet of you. I hope you have a wonderful visit!
That's a cool place to visit.  It's always good to take kids to a place that they haven't been before.
that is so nice of you, what kinds of things does she make
Wow.  That's pretty amazing.  You must be proud!
Wow, that's awesome. Sounds like she's a great mother!
That's great! You are a very trusting person!
It must be such an exciting time for him. How did you find out if he was accepted?
That's awesome, I'm glad to hear he is doing well in college! Does he have a major picked out for him?
I'm so sorry for your sister's passing.  Do things ever get easier?  I'm sure you have some great memories of it.
So sorry to hear about your sister.  I have two younger sister.  How is your mother now?
It is good that you felt that way, it will make it that much easier for you when he gets his degree!
Amazing!  I am an engineering major!  I can't imagine going through college
I love vacations! I went on my first one this summer. We stayed at a hotel in Bali, which is outside of town. I felt so relaxed, like I was right back in my childhood!
You have a wonderful wife. I am sure you earned that vacation time. Did you have a nice beach trip?
Oh sweet! How long will he be away?
That sounds fun! What are your cooking ideas?
What are you guys cooking and eating?
That sounds wonderful. A wedding without a partner sounds miserable.
Aww, that's so sweet! What did he study?
I miss those times.
That is wonderful! You deserve it, your hard work has paid off!
That's awesome! You sound like a great candidate for that position!
That's so mean!  I'm so sorry that happened!  Did you confront them?
I can believe it! That's so mean! Is there no way you can speak with her and get through to her about it?
How did it go for you? I'm sure you are proud.
Thats so great! Im happy for you
Did everything turn out alright? I'm always worried I'm going to forget something and trip somewhere and forget it too.
It's ok to fail once! You made a good plan
Oh my goodness! That is so disgusting!
That's really disturbing! How did you respond to it?
What happened?
Who did they sound like?
Wow that sounds like a lot of fun. Did you have a good time?
That sounds like a lot of fun! What was the occasion?
I am sorry you felt bad. Did you apologize to him?
Don't beat yourself up over it. It's easy to let others opinions bother you, especially when they bring up a subject you don't really know anything about.
I would be scared too! Did you check it out?
Wow, that's a pretty awesome story! Did it feel like you got ripped out of the scene?
We all need food on the weekends.
Sometimes we don't have a lot of choices. Sometimes we have to make hard choices. I'm glad you gave the man food, though. Sometimes hard choices make us stronger.
Congratulations. You must have a very happy and joyful life now.
That's amazing! Congratulation. I'm not sure how fortunate we are in our life, but I am happy to hear of your blessings. I'm a little jealous, since my daughter is only 13 and still in pre-k.
I understand, coworker. Did you have a say? to one another about your position?
I'm glad you decided to stay true to what you believed in. Sometimes that can be a difficult thing to do.
Oh that sounds like a challenge! Did you do alright?
People are just so rude! Be safe my friend!
Thats good. Losing weight is so easy.
Thats great, i wish i had some of that type of group to join
Ohh, I am sorry. What is the class about?
Congratulations!  What was the test over?
That sounds like such lovely memories!   What was the subject matter?
No, I absolutely agree with that.  It is better for you to cherish the people you've lost, than fade from memory.
It's a good idea to have things to preserve if you have to put them out.
That's the best thing you can do honestly, you want to clear everything out and show them what's what.
slide? like a skateboard or like a slide pit?
That is so scary! Are you ok now?
Why would you keep a secret for a friend?  Is it a important secret?
Why is it a secret if its a happy ending?
Are you sad, or just missing someone?
What was the play about?
Awesome! That's a lot of hard work!
Thats great. I have two kids and have used both ways to teach them.one is a fast one and the other is not so much
That's great! I'm happy that you have someone to help you out.
That is awesome.  I am so proud of you guys!
Don't worry, you can make it through it
At least you're organized! I hate trying to clean up!
That's hard.  I'm so glad you had someone to help you out.
It's nice to have someone like that to rely on.  Sounds like you have a wonderful family!
Aw, that's great! Sounds like you two are getting along so well now?
I understand what youre saying
That's so awesome. Sounds like he truly loves what he's doing.
That's awesome. I'm sure she appreciates it a lot, and puts a lot of effort into her craft.
oh yea? that sounds like fun, are you going to go alone? or with a bunch of people?
That is a good start. Where are you going?
That must've been hard. Were you able to visit her during the grieving period, at least?
That is a real bummer.  I'm sorry to hear about your Grandma.  I'm sure everyone was close to them.
That's really a bittersweet moment for sure.
Oh my goodness that's so awful, I can just imagine the horror!  She sounds wonderful though, I'm sure she was a lovely lady.
Wow nice! Which one are you getting?
Sweet. Halo is a classic!
That's so sad. I'm so sorry to hear that. My family is very close too, so I can tell you know that it's much easier when you're near them
I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my mom a year ago and I still get sad thinking about it.
That's awesome! I love being away from my mom. She's the best. How are they?
That sounds awesome
That is awesome.  Where from?
Thats awesome. How long has it been?
oh no! that is so sad! did you comfort the poor little animal? i hope that you gave it lots of kitten love!
That sounds like such a heart warming story.
Awe, how sweet. Did you find the bird after you helped?
Oh no! How baby bird was it?
Did you pass?
what class were you taking?
Oh no! Were you able to remember at least something she did?
Oh no! Did he forget too?
Did anyone else dress you up as a different color?
How long were you out there?
Yeah, I've been through that. It's terrifying the first night. But the second is okay, I guess.
That is pretty terrifying! I hope you can deal with your nightmares.
How?
I could see how it might make you feel bad. Did you end up feeling good about it?
That's really great. Did you get a good report on it or any techniques you used?
That's a really interesting app! How did you find it?
Me too! where are you going??
That sounds like so much fun!
When will you find out?
That's awesome! I hope you hear something soon! What are you applying for?
Nice!  What kind of cookery do you like to cook?  I like to make shredded hamburgers and filet mignon steaks!
I'm terrible at Chinese.
What was it?? I missed it
Wow that's cool! I wish I could flip but I'm not very coordinated
That's amazing! I'm happy for your loss!
I bet you had some pretty good news to go along with that news!
That's wonderful!  How long have you two been tegether?  It seems like she cheated more recently
That's amazing! How old are you?
Oh no! Did she apologize?
Oh god. That had got to be painful.
That must've really upset you. What kind of landlord is it that you don't have a landlord?
That's too bad. I hope it was a mistake that you made.
Goodness, how did it happen!?
That's really good that you were able to do that without any problems. You saved your tire.
That is so sweet!
Yay! What a nice friend you got! What kind of gift is it?
Why did you steal from them?
I think everyone has cheated on their friend before.
sorry for your loss.
I'm so sorry to hear about your father. That's so hard. I'm happy to hear that, though -- that's a good sign, at least. Any plans for his health this time? Any big plans?
What made you love it?
yea life gets more difficult as you get older
What kind of cats were they
That's great!  How long were they missing
What is wrong?
Congratulations! Paper butterflies are so satisfying.
oh no, did anyone see?
Oh no! How many people were around? I've never been swimming before!
Really?? I thought drinking milk everyday for health benefits. But okay now that it has been awhile since I last used it I will no longer use the service
How did you manage that?
What did you do? Did she know that you did?
What did you even say to that?? Are you going to ask him about it??
I feel the same way! It can make you sweat! What works for you?
I feel that.  micro manage a business or a group and it gets very stressful.
I totally get you on that.  I keep a toothbrush handy just in case.  Do you have any kids that have any wisdom in them?
I hate having to do that
That's terrible. Have you tried turning on some fan settings?
that's terrible, I hope you figure it out! dreams are a pretty big part of our life, it's no wonder
It's always a blessing to get out in front of people and look beyond where you're slacking off. It will make you stronger!
What gym were you trying to reach your goals at?
skydiving sounds like an experience! where did you do it? and how'd it go
I would love to try and do that one day!
What makes you think that?
Congratulation! what song did you write?
What are some of the good ideas you have?
That is so true! I learned how to program my car so I could program to meet my mom for the first time in person.
i agree i find it to be a great exercise
How do you mediate things? Do you have a mantra?
Being lonely can be fun! Have you thought about getting a dog?
I understand, i wish i had more time like you, I have felt lonely before as well.
I'm sure it does. I have the same feeling. If I let my emotions get to me, I end up doing something I wouldn't have before.
Yeah I feel you. I let my life take a break from my control a lot in college.  It's hard to let go.
That's good. You should look into exercising.
That's awesome. I'm pretty skinny myself, but I've been getting in a lot of miles on my bike since I started working out.
Where are you going to go?
That's awesome. I live in Florida too, but I'm a little scared to move there. Are you going by yourself?
Wow, it happened in a place so old and quiet? It's a miracle anyone got back in.
Wow. What happened?
Was the rock hard?
That is a real lucky break! I'm glad you made it there in time!
That's awful!  Thank God you were able to help!  That's the first cat that had ever done that.  Now it's its turn to try to get free!
That's good, I'm glad the cat made it.
Connecting to God is the foundation of our civilization.
Connections are important but I think you need to do some introspection into God to get a good idea what to expect and what is His nature
I know exactly what you mean! I'm always like This place is so quiet, I can't get much done, and I have to force my kids somewhere else so they don't go to sleep!
I know what you mean. When I can't take any time off I feel so trapped in the present that I forget how to function.
Oh really? Why is that now and not in the past?
I hear you there, I still have trouble socializing even to this day
I love doing challenges! They can be rewarding!
Nice! That's so inspiring!
Oh nice, is it a goal you are chasing or just a way to make sure you look less bad?
Good job! I need to get in better shape asap!
did you use a gift card?
Scamming people can be very profitable though
I am sure they were very appreciative of you.
I'm so glad she wasn't mad at you!
Oh I love that album so much. I wish I could make it work
What albums have you discovered lately
Did you have to take a test?
I'm glad you got it and it worked out well for you!
Oh no! I'm so sorry that happened, have they stolen a lot?
I hate when that happens... so sorry... what are you going to do?
Did you do it on your own or was it with help?
Oh yeah? How did you learn about that?
I would be too! What are they doing to deserve doing that?
I'm sorry, I hope she tightens things up soon!
It's sad. Sometimes you have to put people in their place.
Yes I agree on all terms. Fake charities are disgusting because they pretend to be charities in order to stay in the shadows but when you get out and about the real world there's far more horrors. So I think you have a very good point there
I'm sure if you just stay calm you'll do fine!
Thats great. Good preparation will help you knock this thing out of the park!
Why did you leave it with the car mechanic?
Oh man, that's a terrible stress situation. Are you okay?
Did they give you notice so you knew you were not going to be able to take more courses?
I'm so sorry to hear that, I hope it goes better for you then.
What does he usually talk like?
Did this ever work?
Why almost stealing?
Why did you steal it?
Oh wow! Congratulations! Is this your first child?
Congratulations! I'm sure you'll be great parents!! Do you feel nervous at all during the first trimester?
I agree. What was the best part about it?
I can only agree to an extent, I'm happy that it's almost December now. But that does make it seem much more exciting
I would have been so scared! What happened after that?
Hah that's weird! I'd say call the cops but I'm a law abiding civilian!
Oh no! Did they catch the person?
Oh god...that is terrible! I would be livid...did they have a note or anything attached to your car?
Oh that's always good when you can find good stuff at a good store. Was itavan.
HARiburgerHood? I haven't heard that name in ages. Was itHariburger Helmutburg, because that's the company?
That's good. How long did it take her to recover from her illness?
That's good to hear! How long has she been sick?
That's pretty awesome!
That sounds so fun! I would love to see one like that
Why did you have to cancel
That's terrible. Did you guys already have plans?
What is that?
What is the good word you speak of?
Yikes!  Did you spray the windows?
Yikes! cockroachs are huge, they can seriously cause cancer in some areas!  I'm glad you saw it!
Did you prepare well? And how do you feel about the results?
You'll do fine if you prepared!
