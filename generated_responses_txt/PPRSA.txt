What happened?
That's really a scary experience! Did they have any cameras? How much money did you end up with for your accident repairs/
Sure, I went to a public toilet on vacation, but the thing that bugs me the most is the toilet paper not fitting inside the dumpster.
I was shaken up but otherwise fine. Yes, the guy I was riding was very drunk.
I'm so sorry to hear this, are you okay?
That's unfortunate, but maybe there is a light at the end of tunnel somewhere for you.
What concert?
That's awesome! Were tickets for the whole band or just the two singers?
that sucks, how was she dying? was she sleep
that's terrible, i hate to hear that. i'm really sorry that this happened to your baby
Oh no! Is he alright though?
I hope it wasn't serious!
That really stinks. I am sorry to hear that. Is it a really big job?
What kind of work do you both do
Oh no, that sounds terrifying.
Oh no! Did they get into trouble?
That's cool. Are you flying or driving?
That's awesome, I bet your are going to miss them!
What a jerk. Why July 4th? Did he do something wrong on that day, or did the 4th just spring to mind?
that sounds horrible! I would have cried!
What a rip off. What are going to do with all the money?
Yeah i would have been bummed out too. Did you walk into any electronics stores?
That is good of you to show him you are loyal to him.  Does he know you did it for the good reasons?
She may have done it to protect herself.
Aww I'm sorry to hear that!
Awww! Babies need company and a break from all of this crazy baby noise. It's like they don't know how to sleep.
Why do you say that? Are you not happy there also?
Have you thought about doing it locally?
That's a jerk move on his part. I'm glad someone can put a damper on his behavior.
That is really not cool.  Did he get in trouble with anyone?
Yeah I hate bugs too!
That's good. It's good to have people you know from your past relationships.  Do you see them again?
I'm sorry that happened. But everyone makes mistakes.
Cherish that moment forever!
Love and complications overcome time I guess, for those born with a good mom and dad.
Of course! Life's not fair! You get screwed if someone steps in too debt and it seems like they always come out of no where and the bill comes in just a few days!
I've certainly felt that. I'm glad you felt that way and I know it's definitely an overwhelming situation!
What happened that happened?
That's so sad. How did they lose them in fire?
That's so wise! It's so easy to miss intuition when you're trying so hard.
That's great advice!
That's awesome! You have to appreciate your friends even if they don't like you at the time!
That's so sweet! I love that feeling when your loved ones are being kind and thoughtful!
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends in your area to turn to?
I am sorry you feel lonely!  Maybe if you just keep putting yourself out there it'll start to make more girls interested maybe?  You could also meet new friends?
That is a good point! They could very well be showing signs of early development!
Hahaha, that's so cute! It is so easy to miss little moments like that when you're just learning. It's like you see it all and now it makes you want to learn and become better
Oh my gosh! I've never had that! Was it any good?
That is crazy. I think they should do something about it.
Oh, that sounds so sweet, I love seeing animals suffer and have their lives cut tragically short! How long did you go with them for?
That is so amazing and I wish I could see an orphanage teach kids.
That's good to hear. I'm not married and still get upset about my partner not being happy with me haha.
I have no idea. I don't get it. Does she live with yall, or does she live on her own? I'm not sure what would drive her to want to distance themselves from each other so soon-
What did you do
What did she do? Did she say anything to you?
Oh my, sorry for the heart squeeze! I can't believe she is gone. I am truly sorry.
Wow. What makes you so empathetic to them?
You are so right. I am a great coworker but I really dont do a lot to show it.
I try not to let it bother me, but I certainly have had some experiences of mine that I would not want to repeat. It is a very difficult habit to break!
oh wow!! tell her that i said congrats
Wow that's crazy!  How far away do you live?  Does she live on a farm or something?
Oh wow! I can only run 1 marathon, but I bet you were exhausted after that lol
Wow! That is incredible. How far did it get?
Congratulations! That sounds like an amazing experience! I've never been to a marathon.
That would surprise anyone! What made you unsure about this person?
I hate to hear that! I hope you feel better.
That's absolutely understandable.
Have you talked to a psy, satanist or other person about it?
Oh wow!  I bet you're really sorry and sad about this!  What did she say?
I'm glad she was able to comfort you. It must be so hard seeing your pet hurt like that.
I would be too! I've only been once but it was on a short trip!
That is awesome!  So lucky to have grandparents who lived close.  Disneyland is truly an amazing place!
That's good that you got to talk to him again! Did it make you happy or sad?
Wow, so he's looking for a job now. Good for him. What was the occasion? Do you know why he's looking for a job?
Organize is nice! What sort of stuff do you like to pack?
That's so fun! It sounds like you are excited to get the hang of it, and it sounds like you have a good idea how it will work out!
I know right
Exactly what I was thinking. If only people would just text or call instead of talking on the phone...
That is not healthy
I'm glad it worked out for you guys
awww! that's so sweet!!! It's always amazing when we feel like we don't have anyone to come home too. I'm glad you were able to make friends and be together.
That sounds like a great adventure! How did you find your people?
Do you have an example to give me?  I'm always open to hearing that!
Thank you. Yeah, I'm glad people realize it takes practice to really improve.
That was very thoughtful of you, I'm sure he was just trying his best
That is true and he must have gotten upset with you. But mom's love knows no bounds! He can always find something on his plate!
That's mean!  Were you able to confront them and ask them why they did it?
That is nice.
I understand what you mean
I completely agree with that.
awh i know what you mean i wish they were the size of my palm
No, they're in their twenties, but I still miss them. They used to always go trick or treating at their neighborhood club on weekends, too.
That's wonderful! It feels so good when you feel like you have what you got!
i bet that was a nice day for you
I can understand that.  It is challenging to make a living and having it decidedly provide for the needs of the family at times, but it is so do worth it.
Part time jobs can also be stressful
Really! How did that make you feel!
That's awesome that she's into you! Did you like him at first?
That sounds really fun! I have never been on a vacation before, and I am really excited for you!
Sounds amazing! I hope you guys have fun!
Oh nice!  How did it go?
Wow, that is really frustrating and frustrating. I would be pretty irritated. Did you call her and complain?
I would be scared too, what did he look like, like a creepy clown?
What grocery store were you at this at?
Uh oh, tell me what happened!
I'm not sure how that happened. It's not like I'm a smart person.
What happened? Did everyone get together and throw a trash can in the trash?
Hahahaha. That must have been funny. Did everyone end up understanding?
No. But I really really really hope that you had fun...
Did you hear that? The rain didn't get to me. I was so jealous of the Jay and Beyonce performance that I decided to drive up to the parking deck just to get a photo with them!
Whoa! Did you tell them, and how long were you gone for?
Whoa that's crazy, was he a nice guy or a freak, or what?
That sounds like a pleasant surprise!
He must really love you very much!
Hatched eggs are expensive to get rid of.
Oh wow! I bet that was an excellent feeling!
No
Big shoes to fill, that sounds tragic.
That is some crazy stuff.  How'd it go?
That sounds so crazy! I'm glad your friend didn't do anything like that!
Oh that's terrible. Did it take you long getting it fixed?
That's a shame. Do you have any repair plans available for it?
Oh, no. That sounds like trouble. How do you feel about that?
I am glad it worked out for you guys
i can imagine it to. Did everything go okay? she must be proud of you
I'm glad she was understanding! Sometimes we forget how much a "mommy" is.
That sounds wonderful! Where is the condo at?
Wow! That sounds awesome! I love the gulf. Do you guys have jet-ski lessons first?
That's great! What kind of job did she get?
She must have felt so accomplished. I wish I had the drive to do that. You sound like an awesome parent.
Oh my gosh! I have never done that, but I hate that. It's inconsiderate and just causes more mess and drama.
Some people are just jerks! That's annoying.
You must be so excited!
That is awesome!  I am happy that she is your wife!  You must be very excited.
That's so beautiful! How do you get to that "Flow" usually- speaking?
Oh I've done that before actually! And no I'm not familiar with that either.
I agree! Leaders should put all their money into running a successful business or business rather than just sitting around doing nothing!
leader like that is exactly why we needless to be humble
That's awesome! I'm glad you had such an awesome day.
Ha ha! That's funny, because that's the name of one of our pets in the movie! I was also at the Shedd aquarium as well. I'm glad you made a special trip there and enjoyed the experience!
That sounds great!  I am so happy for you.
That's awesome! What a wonderful day to be alive!
I don't know. I wish someone will help me. I am very depressed and suicidal.
I think so but I don?t understand why it won?t let you off the hook for the second offense?
I did but they said I didn't listen so well.
That is so exciting! I am sure it will go very well!
Congratulations!  That's so exciting!  I'm so happy for you and your family!
Ha ha, no I had to cancel my cable subscription.  I tried rewiring the router but it would take forever!
I watched netflix last week actually. I was quite happy
What is the twist?
That's great! You worked so hard for that chance!
Wow that's amazing! Good for you!
I know! It takes me an extra 20 minutes or so in traffic to go a decent city park! So aggravating!
Oh man! I bet that was aggravating! Were you on your phone when it happened?
Did it ever get better? Or worse?
I think the Grudge was a pretty scary movie! I don't get scared easily lol. What did you do in the end though
That's awesome! I am happy for her!
That's wonderful. I am glad that you're happy for her!
How did that make you feel
That's a bummer! Maybe there's something wrong with it? That's usually the culprit!
Oh boy did it already!  What did you get?
That sounds like an exciting day! I have 3 dogs myself.
That was really nice of them.  Did you have to move very far away?
That's so wonderful. I'm lucky to have great family.
That's really good that you have that kind of relationship with them
Congrats!  How long have you been married for?
People get crazy when it comes to salary.
Those malpractice rates make it hard for many people. I hope he gets a raise soon, though!
Did you get any concrete answers for the questions that he was asking you?
That's great! What kind of doctor are you going to be?
Nothing really, it just sorta happened naturally, you know?
You could also try reporting the post to the authorities!
Wow, did you do it
That was so nice of them!  I'm glad you had a good friend like that!
That's amazing!  It's nice to have a roof over my head when you can finally afford it.  Good for you staying with her!
I can feel the nostalgia now! What did you like best from the time period
I do feel like toys r us is still somewhat alive and kicking. They have a lot of classic toys
I love that feeling! 90s were a good time. Do you have a favorite band or favorite album?
I do love a good 90's Facebook posting
I was just a baby in the 80s. I can see the trends and what everyone is wearing today. I'm glad things were easier back then!
I agree bullies make me so mad!
Yes, but unfortunately I always get called names.
I have never seen the new one, is it good?
That's cool to hear! What movie is it?
Do they report it to you as well?  I know they try to hide it from you if it's not enough for your bills lol.  What do they do?
I feel your pain. I once got evicted and then got a second home with parents that paid for everything.
Exactly! And they think they can just do it all on their own without being asked! How aggravating
They don't think about the children. They don't care about them either though. Some people just aren't considerate.
that is so sad, i am really sorry for your loss
That's terrible. I hope she didn'tREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREMREM....lol....sorry for laughing
That was a tough one to watch! I'm glad you have someone to talk to about it!
That's so sweet! Roxie sounds like a lovely name!
Did you find a new car to ride?
That was really nice of someone.
I know right, some people are just unbelievable. I am glad you got to enjoy yourself!
No - I'm too introverted.  Did you enjoy it at the end?
Yes, me too. I was begging him to throw me a surprise birthday too! It was so fun. I really had a lot of fun planning it. What was it about?
That happens often?
Rain can be such a damper. What do you do to get rid of the smell?
How did that turn out?
wow you must have been very confident that day
Yeah I have a dog. What kind do you have
My cat drives me nuts too and he just wants to lay on me!
Congrats! What did you teach him?
Congrats! It's such an awesome experience! What did he do that you were proud of him?
I am so sorry. How did you do it?
I'm so very sorry, that must have been difficult. I know it's because we've grown up in the same family and know the feeling well - but it's important to remember your loved ones and let those you love know where you are, thank you very much.
How young are we talking?
Wow he is really starting to make some good coin-selling beans! I wish I had some myself!
Why would you think that is a bad necklace.
You're not jerk. I think you should totally put that necklace back on.
That is so sweet! I am happy that both of you have someone like your aunt who will help you in times of need! You deserve it
Yes, it is great when that happens. I once went to an episode of castle rock. I was so taken back.
Yeah i know how you feel i used to listen to pandora and it was crazy listening to that songs and reliving those times.
I am so sorry to hear about that.
Oh no, I hope you found all your cats ok.
Oh no. I am sorry to hear that too. What kind of dog were you having at the time?
Oh no. I hope your at least somewhat okay. The doctors can't exactly do a thing about dying pets these days unfortunately
eww that's so gross.
Oh wow! I can totally imagine how gross that would have been! I'm sorry to that for you!
What! You are the worst kind of friend.
What was the prank?
That's too bad. Are there any positive aspects to this break up?
That is sad. Do you think there is a way to bring yourself to accept it?
That is scary, but you need to think positive. Long distance can be good though.
Well as long as you have something to look forward too it shouldn't be that bad!
That's sad but also makes you remember why you loved her in the first place
I'm sorry, I hope it turns out well for you.
What makes you feel that?
That's great. She'll probably say no since she's not your girlfriend anymore.
I dont have friends, so what is the best gift you have ever received?
Oh that is awesome, I have never even thought of that ha! Well its always nice to get some new people to hang out with.
4
Oh no. What happened?
Oh my gosh. I hope you are okay!!!
That would be scary. I hope your neighborhood is okay!
Yeah, I love mugging strangers on the side of the road. Especially in freezing temperatures.
Oh yes! That sounds very relaxing. Do you do that frequently?
She sounds like a good mom! How old is she?
That's sweet. It sounds like she really loves you.
I don't know, we're still dating.
Yeah I did but it's not the same thing you failed if it was a completely different class. It was calculus and I didn't understand it so I had to take it again. I felt so bad but I guess it wasn't that bad. Yes I failed the exam
That's great, your mom is awesome
I love her. What kind of a car is it
Oh no, is there anyone in her life that you could fall back too?
Oh no. Maybe she will come back. Just try to have faith that everything will turn out ok.
I teach English as a first language. I am having a tough year. I am scared to even leave my house. School has started back up and it's intimidating. Luckily, my boss is super cool and understanding.
I work in sales, but I'm not very well off. I'm worried I won't make enough money to pay for my mortgage and bills. I'm worried about losing my job.
That's good! I hope you do well in college!
That's cool.  Are you in college?
I used to do the same but now I have a surround sound system and block out most scary movies. It is really nice to not be afraid of something for a change!
I think I've only watched like 2 or 3  movies like that in the last year, but last time I was alone at home I tried watching Kindergarten by itself...it was okay, nothing special really.  Now I keep thinking about it and it's kind of funny.  So weird.
I like romantic movies and comedies. Anything really, I dont know.
None of the above. Which movie do you like?
Well, he is not that bad yet. He still has time to change.
Real Conservatives don't want Trump in office. That makes him look like a Communist.  I don't get it.  Are you confusing Trump with Ronald MacDonald?
Wow, congratulations! That's great. What are you studying?
That is great! I was just accepted to my university as well! That is pretty awesome!
That's amazing! I love love my girlfriend so much, she's the best!
That's wonderful! I am glad that you feel that way! You deserve it!
Yes, I do. What are your favorite ones?
I do like old family pictures.  Do they bring you back some good memories?
I am sure he will be the one that makes you fall in love with.
You definitely should. Women are loyal no mater how much or how long you've been banging them!
An hour
How long do you have to live with your partner after an argument or when you lose them in a court, for instance?
That is a nice surprise! Are you going to spend a lot of time together?
My mother is going to be moving soon, so it makes me feel a lot better to hear that people are still nice around here!
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that! Are you doing all that you can to help?
Oh no! How long has it been? I am so sorry to hear that!
Why is that made you jealous
It sucks that jealousy runs strong in this world, but I know you can get there, too. Just gotta stay positive!
That's really nice!  How has your relationship been?
I do! I love my partner, our dog, my best friend!
That's so great! I love that about mine.
I am very close with my family too! It is awesome that you have such a great connection with your family!
Why did you do that
Why did you do that
Oh no! I hope they didn't laugh as much at you.
Oh man, I am glad I wasn't there when you went through that!
Congratulations! You sound like a hard working person now
that is a great idea, im sure it is much cheaper there, and also have a lot more work available there
Where did the doctor go for visit for?
Oh lol. Well that was a nice surprise then. Good luck with everything else.
I know!  Sometimes you need some space for the whole family!
I feel you! Sometimes I feel lonely because I don't know what to do or where to go. I hope you feel better though and don't feel bored!
That's awesome! What are you going to do to win?
You sound very hopeful!
You mean increase his intake!?
You're husband sounds a little entitled.  My kid just refuses to go to the bathroom!
I can imagine. How long has she been gone?
That is too bad. Maybe she should visit on her own time?
Oh god! Was it a nest or something more gross?
That sounds terrible!
I'm sure that sucks
I have. I've even worse in management situations.  Why did they pick him/her?
Thats sad. Were you close to them?
I'm so sorry for the loss. How long did it have?
What job did you apply for?
Congrats. I hope it goes well.
That's terrible, I hope everything worked out for the best!
Well that's good. You are lucky.
LOL....You said it like that without irony. You said nothing about cheating. You said plenty. You are very lucky that your wife is so trustworthy.
I hope you got it back! That is mean
What a rascal!!! What did you do to make him behave!
What if it turns out that he's really into you...
No, I haven't. What is she like?
Not really? You seem curious. What's been going on?
I was 13 at the time. What about you?
They do! Have you tried emailing them?
Haven't tried Starbucks in a while, I usually get caramel
That's awesome. What did he graduate in?
That's great. My parents went to college and my son's dad worked a few jobs to make enough to attend. I hope you have an awesome gradation!
Dang! Did you get a second one?
Oh wow, I hope you didn't have to spend too much on the pizza
They know your lettuce needs you
That would make me mad
Oh no! You shouldn't do that to her! Maybe you should buy her a good present.
Oh no! Well maybe she wanted them because you two are friends!
Eeewwww! Are you sick?
Oh no! Did the dog wash his feet after?
Which recipe is that?  My favorite?
I have never tried that, but it is a great idea.
Wow, that's so exciting. Were you worried at all about the results?
I bet that was a surprise and you were happy about that!
Oh no, that's terrible :( What kind of exams? He could've taken an English class I'm sure.
I hope he learns his lesson. Football can be hectic at nights!
i am praying for you, pray tell me what happened if i could help you!
You will know for sure on your test if and when you passed!
I would love to see that
What was the name of the guitar?
oh no, sorry to hear that, was your flight delayed?
Oh, wow! I'm sorry you had to deal with that inconvenience. I hope everything turned out alright for the most part.
Wow! That's amazing! Congratulations! You have some pretty amazing daughters to choose from. You must be so happy and proud!
I remember those days! I used to have one as well, but due to a health issue they had to move us down the list and unfortunately that meant we would have to homeschool our oldest.
Is it someone in your neighborhood?
That would freak me out
Why is he in prison
That is horrible! I hope Bahamas does better for him!
Wow! How old is your son now, are you proud?
Great, that kid will be world class one day!
3 months?! That's pretty darn fast! I hope you have a nice surprise.
That's great! It's hard to wait to get kids!
Did it hurt you? I've always been scared of bats
Maybe you should think about returning the favor and let your imagination run with what you had stolen. Maybe that batman had a crush on you.
Thats right. some people say if you believe everything you see, you dont need a blessing
Amen to that
Oh no! Did you get hurt at any stage?
That is hilarious!  I am glad it wasn't embarrassing!
Tupacs were such a cool thing when I was a kid. You must have some really good memories.
LOL at least you were active when you made that connection!
That sucks. I hope your did everything right to bring him up to date.
That's too bad. It's always sad when pet dies, but at least it wasn't something too tragically tragic like losing a child.
Less fortunate then I suppose... I was born with low self- esteem, but I've since managed to wipe it out.
It's always nice to help those who have nothing to gain by others giving.
What did you do?
That is very specific. I hope you can be fully forgiven.
Lousy mofoe!  I bet you felt terrible about it!
I love that moment when I see the kids going through the process of the gym, I'm like, what are we talking about six years old, I don't need to be in pain but I want to be in pain. I'm just like, I'll take the bad thing and be like, okay with it
What a crazy and wild time. People do weird things when they first meet someone, and it makes you feel bad even though it's probably in the back of their mind.
Wow that's pretty extreme! But maybe she found someone who's into her.
He sounds like an awesome dad
Wow, he sounds like an awesome guy. He sounds like he could handle anything!
Wow, he must've got a real job then.
That's awful! Did you tell her the truth?
That's really mean and cruel of her.  I'm glad it all worked out though!
What happened?
Where did she originally live. She was never nice to you in person?
PE?ressive environment?!? I didn't think it was that bad, PE was definitely a letdown for me!
It's always better to do good and do well then to make a girl wet.
That is impressive.  Were you ever afraid to call upon the teacher when the time was right?
What school do you go to now? That's awesome that she had that kind of education and was able to get you started, it's rare.
Oh my goodness. That's so sad. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Were you close with him in some way?
Oh wow I completely agree, I feel like they are trying too hard to shoe horn in more death and tragedy in movies!
adapt or die
Cool, that always makes for good bracelet. What kind of things do you do with the bracelets?  bracelet sold separately?
That's terrible.  She's not someone I would want to date anyway.  Why did she do it?  I'm not sure I get it
That's such an unacceptable thing to do. I hope she steps back up or lets him know how she feels.
That's pretty terrifying, did you report it?
That's a real suckerpunch, my man. What bike did you use? That's a real life saver when you don't have time to do stuff!
that is great, what was your previous degrees?
That's great! Congratulations! I am currently in the process of getting my bachelor's degree.
Yes! My husband had a surgery a few weeks ago. I stayed home with my baby and did everything we needed, including diaper changing.
That is great. Some people can be so hard on money
It's great that you worked hard for it.
Was she okay
That's good, how old was she when she hurt her?
Why don't you try listening to new songs/art thou
I know what you mean. I listen to the same kinds over and over.
What game is it?
That sounds really exciting! Which one are you getting?
Congratulations on your promotion!
Wow, that's quite a long time ago, do you still have your current job?
Wow, I bet that's a lot of work! But, it sounds like you've found your calling, which I'm happy for.
Have you always been this DMV apocolypse? I'm sorry that you're going through that wracking!
Have you tried to do the test over again?
You should try a dmv.
What happened?
That's great.  It's such a bittersweet moment.  It can be a good lesson for you, even if it's not right then.  But you must be grateful to have that degree in order not to go through worse.
That's awesome! Congratulations! What are you studying right now?
What? That's not something you hear very often, have you heard anyone else say it recently?
What was your reaction
That's really good for him. I hope he does great interviews.
Oh I hope so too! I bet you're nervous! Is he a hard worker?
Oh no! You had to be alone?
I am scared of stairs, it's one the worst fears I have as well.  Did you do any major renovations?
That's fantastic. You must be very excited.
Congratulations! It's always satisfying to see a good job done well by someone with a good degree
I have, it's no fun. What happened?
Omg, Ive been in ones like that too! It is so terrifying! How did it happen?!
Yes, I certainly was in high school.
Oh no! Did you guys reconcile and work things out?
I sure have.  Those games were amazing back then!
I did, I played it a ton as a kid too
Oh yes many years ago. They are a classic
No, I haven't. I always get the big sliders. They're the grossest things. You're right though, they're really cheap.
no, I don't know what that is.
I have had those. They are terrifying
Yes, many times.
I have not rode one. I always wanted one.
That is disappointing news. You should ask your friend if he would do anAMA about the situation.
I can see why your friends boyfriend thought it would be wrong.  He may have been a little jealous?
Where are you going? I hope its not too far.
Where did you go?
She deserves better pay for her hard work!
Thats good. I bet she is happy too
that sucks, teachers deserve some respect but cantylittle til they get fired
A puppy for a month, that's cute
Awe how sweet! I bet it brought a tear to your eye!
It happens to the best of us! Did things work out?
Wow, it sounds like you have a very open and cooperative personality. That's very commendable!
That is annoying, but if it's for a special occasion, I'm sure she understand
She must've been really hungry!
Me too!!! Do you have any plans for Friday?
I feel you. My son just went back to school and I'm just glad it's over.
Wow. I hope the snow didn't cancel your trip too much!
Oh man. That's the same reason as me - I don't want to be stuck in traffic!
Did you ride home in it on the snow?  or were you stuck on the driveway side?
im sorry thats rough i was never married and in the same boat
That's good to hear. It's probably for the best if you stopped worrying so much about it.
Rain can be such a damper, how did you manage to get out of it?
That's nice, it would have suckedling if it was raining hard and all of a sudden it rained. Hopefully the weather cleared up soon.
What were you planning?
That is such a cool surprise!
Hmmm, maybe you can return the favor some other time?
How long ago did you steal it? Did he find out?
I'm sorry. Are you going to be able to stay by yourself?
I am glad she came with you.
That's too bad. Did you already have her/her?
Aw that really is too bad. I'm sorry. Is it far from your original apartment?
That's very nice of her!  It's nice that you were so thoughtful and helpful.  It's nice that she loves you so much.
Moms are like that. It's one of the oldest profession.
Sounds like a fun roller coaster. Where did you go on it?
Wow that sounds pretty scary! I'd be scared too! How much did you ride it?
Wowza...what happened...did you have a thing for her or what
That's happened to me before! Work friends can be so annoying
Did he just want to go on his bender?
I'm sorry! That is pretty gross
Congratulations! You must feel relieved that it is finally happening!
That is great! I bet you worked really hard to get a good job and find something good to do with your time!
Did she notice when you noticed?
That sounds like it was a wise move on your part.
I hate when that happens!  Ive seen a guy do a wheelie in a grocery store once.
Hah that sounds like fun!
That sucks.  I hope it wasn't something you did accidentally.
awww what a sad day.. how old was he?
Oh no! I would have been so mad at him! Were you able to get him to take it easy after?
I hate when that happens! I have a dog that chewed a piece of carpet too recently, luckily.
That sounds rough. What did she do? Is there anyway you can make it right?
Its okay, you were just being mean. I know how it is to be angry at your parents.
Sounds great! Where did all of this happen?
wow what an outdoorsy experience. I bet they had a lot to get their jollies too
I do agree, I would even say most of the earth is!
I agree.  People don't realize it because we don't see them doing anything to actually change the surroundings or improve things.
Yea, that's always tough when you look back on someone and see how they acted that specific time period. It makes it hard to value them as people who have done a great job of distancing themselves from those people and moving in with a set of values they held.
Sometimes I have the feeling that I am the worst kind of person to someone else.
Tornados give me the creeps too! We had a house burned down due to a tornado! I always had to stay with the kids and scare them until we caught the tornado lol
I grew up in michigan and there was one tornado every year. People talked me into moving somewhere warm like hawaii.
I am glad that it worked out for you
I know exactly what you mean. I used to get super mad when I was the same way as well, only it was with my older sister's kids.
That is good.  It's easy to become a little overbearing when kids are little and become like a pet.
I bet! Where did you guys end up moving too?
Yay! where to!
What is it that you fear the most
I'm glad you enjoyed it!
What kind is it? I have an old iPhone5.4
That is awesome. My parents had that problem.
That is an incredible blessing.
Have you ever been in a car accident?
I am sorry you have that fear
That's a great way of putting it! I hate when people drive so fast.
That sounds horrible! I never in my life have I ever seen someone do something like that. Everyone just stood still and their faces said hello.
hahaha I bet it didn;t last long though
Maybe you should take an epidmerge?
Do you get emotional about them
They are called nephew and niece because the youngest son is nephew and the mother daughter is niece. How about you?
That's wonderful!  I remember when my daughter was 3 and 5.  I love when they're excited and exploring the world!  What do you like to do for fun during those years?
That is awesome! I bet your excited to see them grow up too!
That's great! It's hard to do that sometimes!
I know what you mean, I struggled with money before as well.
Oh wow. Sounds like a lot of studying. Did it work out well?
That's awesome! Hardwork pays
That is so wonderful! I have two little boys and they were just over a month apart when they came out, I could not have been happier!
That's awesome, baby tickets are really cheap!
That is so mean. Why would he hurt your feelings?
Sometimes husbands can get a way to do things that are not in their best best interest. It's really quite funny.
Driving overpasses is very scary, I feel like I was one of the drivers that got into accidents. Nowadays everyone fears getting into an accident.
That is terrible to hear. I am really glad you are okay now (I think)
Wow! That is very creative and original!! I think I would start something like that!!
Wow that's quite an accomplishment! You must be quite proud of yourself!
How many do you have?
Yeah traffic seems to always be bad here. Any specific streets you've noticed this?
That sounds so annoying. Are you in a rush to somewhere you need to go?
That's cool!  What kind of video game was it?
Through an internet videogame? I didnt even know there were any videogames out right now. What game did you all play?
You sound like a nice person
I care for everyone because I love them and want to give them everything
That's interesting, are you guys together?
Wow, how interesting! How did she respond to the situation?
Wow! What a great accomplishment. That's amazing!
That is so awesome!
That's annoying! Did you give her a bath or was she just exploring her territory?
That is infuriating! I guess she didn't have enough toilet paper :(
Being with someone makes you more enjoyable.
That's awesome! How long have you been together?
I totally understand that feeling! I get home sick all the time and it's the worst.
Yeah that is annoying.  Things that happen when no one is around are even worst when it's convenient to just watch tv or do stuff at home.
thats great to hear
I love being home too! I am glad you are happy!
Yea, I wish I could be the same! I'm currently on leave and am kind of bored at home.  Maybe I'll finally get a day off where I can come home to just kick back for a while and just relax.
I can imagine! Where were they all from.
You are very lucky! I hope you had a good time at the party!
I can imagine so.  Do you have fond memories of it?
That's sad but I guess you'll get to make it up to her
That sounds like fun! What did you guys see on the trip? Did you go on many adventures?
That is cool! I live in New York now but before that I lived in New York City. It has been a while since I have visited San Antonio. What did you do there that made you like it so much?
Congratulations on that! You have worked very hard.
Congrats! That's amazing, I bet your mind was blown.
I am sorry about that. Did you do anything about it>
Oh no, that's awful! Did you end up taking him to a doctor's to have him removed from his diet?
Oh no! How'd he react?
That's really frustrating! I hate when my kids are out of place
That is awesome. I haven't been to quebelitas in a long time.
QDoba is awesome! You must have been chompy after that one.
That's so cool, I'm glad he was successful.
that's so cool! what was the kid's first language? that's so amazing, i can't even imagine
What sort of impresses you about him?
Wow! That's amazing! What market is it?
You must've been so proud! What a young athelete!
That's awesome! You must have felt so proud of him.
That's a shame, I imagine that's a painful and nerve wracking position. Do you get used to being put in that position by others?
That's okay, everyone has those moments in their lives. It was a good story in and of itself.
Oh, do you feel lonely there?  I can't imagine!
That is a great idea! I have two dogs, they love to run around and have fun!
That's so sweet! What kind of flowers?
Oh wow, flowers are always a pleasant surprise! What did you do with them?
That is so annoying, have you spoken to her about it?
That's a hard one, I have two dogs and can say for sure they bark more at loud noises (like cars moving)
What did she say to him when he answered the phone
What situation are you in right now.  I hope everything is okay.
That's really cool!  Did you guys get to do it a lot back in the day?
that's so sweet!!! are you and your wife still very close?
Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that, I have lost all of my mother's in a nursing home.
I am sorry for the difficulties. I have lost many mother's before. It's important that we remember their lives in their best light
It's good you were patient. In my industry, you wait forever for a call! It can make all of the difference between getting an offer and not getting an interview
That is awesome, what is the job?
Oh, no. Scold her? How come?
Wow!  You can't really blame her though.  Sounds like you have a very hands off approach to dealing with her
That sounds great, good luck!  I am sure that you have prepared very well
That sounds great!  Is it a new place?
That's awesome! I'm happy for you!
That's great. Yes such reliefs can be life savers especially when dealing with a lot.
That is a great blessing.
Thats good, it helps us grow
That sounds rough, I'm glad he's better now!
That's really rough. I have two daughters myself. I have never had any sort of issue when it comes to their friendships.
I'm sorry you had to experience that.
I am so sorry. That is one the biggest pains of life. I am sure you have been through worse but its nothing to complain about and deal with. Life is just unfair all around.
That's awesome! You must feel really confident about yourself!
Great! I hope you get it too! What kind of job did you apply for?
That is awesome!  Did you feel sentimental about it>
That is sad to here, but it is good you found it
Right, I remember when I was shopping for a car for myself and all I got was this lousy dress.
Right, I wish I had money to drop
That's so kind of you! Poor animals deserve all of our love
That's an interesting first name! And an awesome thing to do, too.
Yes that is definitely true for some parents
That's no good, I feel sorry that happened.
Congrats! That's great news!
That's awesome, congrats on the good news!
Oh no. That's awful, what did they find?
Ouch, that sucks. I hope he feels better soon.
Well, it wasn't your fault at least
I think so.  It may make her want to change her ways.  It wouldn't be the worst thing to do.
That's the worst. I've had that happen to me before as well. What did you do?
Oh no! That's the worst.  I hope you didn't get fired, or disciplined, or both!
Wow! That's amazing. I've always wanted to go on a cruise!
I am sure you will be fine! I am sure it it very hot and humid where you are.
That sounds lovely!  You seemrom lovely!
Who is mom?
What kind of dog is it and how is it doing?
What does a dog do that would agreat a bird, if you mind me asking.
That's so sad.  I hope things are working out for her
I'm so sorry to hear about your animals.  I hope you can find some support from family and friends
That's awesome! Congratulations! I'm happy for you and the newphew! :) How long has it been since you have seen your loved one?
That's a long time!  How did you find out he was coming?
I hope it's not too expensive to have looked
Ah that's a bummer! I know what you mean. Well I'm sure you can replace that piece as it's quite old and she won't remember anything you lost it for.
award for what?
It's nice you were patient and got it!
Thank you! I agree, I think it's a great one!
Thank you so much! Yes, I am very apprehensive. I think I am just nervous!
Did you nail the job, though?
I have. They're definitely hard but it's worth it. I get paid more at the moment than I would anywhere else. So, it worked out for me. ( I don't really mind the company making me an offer, it's up to the person doing the interview)
I think that's true in every family.  It's hard to put an ideal face on it, but it's always good to have some room to improve.  How old are your kids?
That's awful, but I can't imagine she was all that disgusted by it, though.
I am sorry you have to deal with that
I am sorry to hear that! I have the same feeling for my kids. I am always talking at my kids super loudly trying not to slip away!
That's a shame, it's nice to spend more time with your daughter though
That is awesome. As a teenager us adults spend a lot of time with little girls.
Where are you guys going?
That is exciting! I love national parks! Are you going alone or with friends?
Wow, she must of got tired. I am sorry.
Oh no! I hate that! It's so frustrating! How long did you have to clean for? I'm glad you didn't lose her.
A cat needs a place to cozmose, have an up vote
That sounds wonderful!  What are your plans afterwards?
Oh, good luck on it. Did they have enough people for your team to handle it?
How do you feel about it now that the interview is over?
That is good, do you love your partner very much?
ok
Thank you who?
Thank you for nothing.
You're quite welcome
Thank you for nothing.
That sounds very fun! I love going to the garden.
Oh, I have never tried that, I had heard of people growing potatoes though.
What was the mistake?
That is bad service.
That's a good thing you filed. You're being treated unfairly.
What happened?
oh no. what happen?
What made him your rep.
That's really cool! What other things does your dad do?
Who is she? Someone you know or just someone you're forgetting?
i can understand that
What's your favorite take out?
What is your favorite restaurant to eat at in town?
That sounds great.  Do you have any animals?
Wow. That's pretty rare. Are you a really big town?
That sounds amazing! Were you shocked that he did such a great job?
Wow! I bet that brought back a lot of memories for the both of you! What a day that was! Cake or pie?
Good for you!  Did everything work out?
Thats good news! Do you have any plans after this?
I'm sorry to heard that. Losing a loved one is always tough but it gets easier as time goes on.
I'm so sorry to hear about your mother's struggle. Losing a loved one to a health issue is always hard, but treasure those that have lost all through life. Treasure the journey that you have made in light of your memories and the journey that you are on now. treasure that journey always make it count.
wow that's so exciting! is she a girl or boy?
Awe. Thats awesome. I love kids.
Same here, I think it's important for couples not to take each other for granted
That's great! I hope your wife feels the same!
How nice is the truck that he just got?
What truck did he get?
Great! What makes you feel that way?
That sounds wonderful! It's good you feel that way, that's a good way of looking at things I think. I'm glad that it sounds like you have something exciting happening!
That's good of you. Is she better now?
That's a bummer. I hope she starts to feel better.
I'm glad you got a good look at it
Wow, that's so deep and thoughtful!
That's awesome! You must be so proud!
Thats awesome! Does she sing well too?
Oh that sucks, but you can't help who they fall in love with. It is their life.
its okay to admit it. but dont rush it. I have been there before.
That's good! What kind of job is it? Are you qualified?
That's good, I'm in education and there's a ton of demand for IT workers. I hope you land that position.
Maybe try and find something to do in your free time?  Or join clubs or get hobbies!
A little downtime is good for everyone. It will help her grow in your life.
That sounds like a conversation you had with your father. I am happy it was resolved and not you two making it worse.
Oh my, what did he tell you?
hahaha oh no, were you hungry?
hahaha I hear ya there...I have been eating a healthy diet like for 3 years and never went on a diet..went on vacation once and had a massive craving for chocolate but couldn't help myself
Oh wow! That must be so stressful! What did you guys do?
That's great! I know it's hard when your hardworking and have kids but it's so great when your hardworking and don't have to support them!
Haha!  That is funny!  What did you do?
That must have annoyed you. I am glad you have neighbors like that to make things easier on you.
Maybe you should buy a new one? You can also use the money you'd get from sales tax to buy a new one!
i know how you feel, i have lost several my size
That's awesome! I wish I had parents to see my parents. I'm a college freshman.
wow, you must really miss them. I hope it will go as planned
Oh wow. How long has she been away?  Did you enjoy your time with her?
It's good that you went, though. Are you studying abroad?
Oh wow! Sorry about that, did they realize you were upset? I hope they didn't yell at you!
That's crazy, I would wake you up if my neighbors did that too! I hope they learned something
Oh my, that must have been quite an uncomfortable moment for both of you. Was it the first time they had ever heard it?
Oh no! That's pretty embarrassing! Were either of them loud enough to notice?
Where did she fly off to? Is she coming back with friends?
Aww, that's really sweet and lucky for you! You deserve to be with someone special!
so you are saying your life is good right now. That's good
That is great that you took the difficult step and have been able to do it.  You have a good story to tell!
That's great that you finally got over that difficult gate!
I am so glad it worked out that well for you. What have you achieved so far
Oh, I'm so sorry! Losing a family member is always so hard, I can only imagine.
I'm so sorry you're going through that, it can't be easy. How old was she when she passed?
why is that? is it too expensive there?
You can't go both ways... But I'm glad you are trying. It can be tough to say goodbye to someone you love and see them every now and then. But you will be happy in the end!
wow thats a great idea, I'm glad someone said something positive!  Do you have any day plans?
wow. That is great
I am so sorry to hear that... I am here for you if you want someone.
I know what you mean, i dont have any friends either
Where has she been. Must be nice to be alone for a whole year
Oh no, when did she leave?
That's awesome. Where will you be going?
That sounds really fun. I have never been to the Ozarks before! I bet it is gorgeous!
That sounds terrible. I'm so sorry you had to go through that!
That's really strange, since a woman's job is to communicate to and get information.
Did it really happen?
Wow. What pizza did you end up getting?
It was pretty good. Did you have a nice day?
I hope yours was good too. My name is James. What about yours?
It was okay. How was yours?
I hope it was a nice day for you! Did anything special happen?
That sounds like a situation you must have been rather embarrassed about.
That's funny, I had something similar happen at my old job.
Oh nice, how do you feel about that?
How do you feel about that?
grad school is so much fun though!
It's really tough. Even though you're far away from your loved one, you're still spending time with them. Maybe it will push you to having more friends in the area you want to move to, or to having more hobbies, etc.
Where did she go?
That is sad, maybe she can take a flight to your home.
Uh oh.. I hope you weren't going for a drink
Did the other person get in a fight back?
Oh no! How did that happen??
Oh wow! That's pretty scary! How did you manage the accident?
Adult apartments seem nice, but I'm 26 and would like a change! How often do you see people there with kids, and does it get busy at all?
Looking at pictures is one thing, writing letters on wall papers is another. But I agree, it is difficult as an adult to move into a house that has everything.  Do you have any pictures from that apartment still?
I am glad it wasn't a neighbors party!
That does sound crazy! I'm glad your night was peaceful! Did your friend calm you down?
Nice, do you think you will be getting it back, or no.
That's awesome!  Is it in the field you're least excited for?
Aw, well that's okay. Doggos can be fun though!
Its okay, happens to the best of us
Are the police involved?
What kind of heavy items do you order usually?
I hope they help you and give you an edge.
How'd it go?
That is wonderful! Did you visit a lot back then?
Those sound like wonderful times.  Do you still keep in touch with your best friends?
That's so awesome! What kind of car? You can get a good deal online if you want
That's so awesome! What are you most excited for?
That is great! I have had problems in the past with my family as well.
That's really great that you have such a faithful friend.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I am so so sorry, I know it must be hard but you just got to keep your head up!  Are you applying anywhere else?
I am, I just have a lot to be jealous of.
I understand. Thank you. Yeah, I'm trying to be more grateful now that I'm in a more prestigious field :)
Pets can be good though! Take your puppy to the park and spend a lot of time together!
Aww!  That's cute!  I would totally let my puppy run wild around the house!  He's probably just grateful that you kept him around!
Stealing is wrong? what would be considered stealing
I totally get what you are saying
Oh man that's a real bummer. Did you find him?
That's a bummer.  Did she at least get a little bit mauled?
That's awesome.  How far away does she live from you?
That's awesome!  How exciting!  What an incredible amount of time!  How old is she?
You will be okay! 6 months isn't that long!
A general doctor.  I'm scared I may have a stroke!
Yes, very much so! It has been quite some effort and hard work, but it's payback for not having much to work with.
It's nice to hear that. Sounds like she's accomplished quite a lot.
oh thats good
Life always is a scary thing, that's for sure.
Oh geez, I hope it didn't do too much damage!
That's so awesome! I wish my neighbor was nice like that!
Oh really?! What did they do to get so famous?
Who is female singer?
I know exactly what you are saying
I think the world still has the opportunity to do a lot better honestly.
that is scary! is it a crackhead break in? or an aggravated one?
Oh my gosh!  Those guys should be on some sort of watch list.  I hope you had someone with you that was with you the night that it happened?
Oh no!  Were you able to find out who did it?
I'm sure they caught those culprits!
Oh that stinks. I'm sorry. What career field do you have in the mean time?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that, I'm sure something will come around for you, though.
Oh no, were they unbreakable?
Oh no. I am sorry to hear that.
Ugh. I hate when that happens. Have you taken her outside?
I can understand that
Where will you be going?
Oh, I bet that will be exciting! I've never been toSomalia. Have you been to North Korea?
Oh no!  Were you able to repair it ok?
Oh no! I hope you can get the Doctor to treat you! Is there anything you can do?
What was the prize?
Congratulations! How much did you win and for how long?
You should have a listen to this man. He is interesting person
That is so annoying! Have you tried asking for a break?
Who was it?
Oh no that sounds annoying, what was in it?
That sounds really frustrating!
That is good advice! It's important to have people who will protect and show support like that!
20 years is a long time! Did you have fun?
That is a wonderful feeling. 20 yers
Awwww, that's really cute!  How big was the baby?
That's crazy! Where did it happen?
Oh man, I'm so sorry! Can't you tell from the poor service that you did great?
Oh, that's too bad. I hate when things like that happen.
Well that's not good at all, are you going to go in and check it out?
Well you should trust your son. He is an honest man
I'm sorry to hear that.  What is the source of all this loneliness?
Keep your head up. Start making your money again and after you get a bit richer you will be in a better place.
Yeah.... Parents always have the last laugh.
Sorry to hear that. Why cant you move?
I'm so sorry you had to deal with that, what do you do to move?
I am so sorry to hear that, that sounds like terrible work! Are you able to afford to get out eventually?
They sound like a good bunch of guys!  What are some things they have done for you?
Yes I do. But in a different way.. I'm very trusting
I wish I had a best friend like you.
That's awesome! I bet you are very happy!
Wow that is pretty cool!
Nice, skateboarding can be pretty fun. I'm not much for sports, but do you ever go to tournaments?
What did your mom do?
I'm not sure what you are talking about but I do agree that it is rude to shame someone for anything!
I feel you! My girls teething and have a few hospital stays each time.  I don't think I've ever teared a baby off before! It's amazing and so painful!!
That's awful :( Have you taken any Advil yet?
Did you call the police?
That's too funny! I would have been so scared! Were they alright, though.
I bet that was a relief.  Was it hard training a whole new dog?
I can imagine it would be! I always found it easier to do this one when my girls were puppies, but I always found it easier to train them after the age of 2 or 3. How long do you have yours trained?
Oh, I'm sorry! It's very hard to lose our animals, they are very loyal.
Oh no! Glad to hear he is doing better!
Yeah when i go camping or doing anything outdoor?  I haven't really had the chance to. I'm kind of introverted and introverted so it can be hard to have those moments
Yes I once chased a seagull in the ocean. It was a sight to see.
What kind of job was it?
What kind of job is it at? Hope you get it!
yes once when i was a kid. it always took me a few days to file and was always a pain to go through
I haven't, I work too hard for it but the work doesn't always get us where we need to go
Not really. I turned 18 this weekend and my daughter has been acting extra childish. I guess that might be the case.
Haha yeah, kids love those kinds of things too. They're trying to communicate.
That's nice. It can sometimes feel overwhelming caring others for things you never have control over yourself.
That is hard, my wife is sick too, but she is a stay at home mom, so taking care of her is what they do best for them. I hope you guys are doing everything possible to make their day go a lot smoother!
Did you take it again?
I'm glad to hear you passed! I'm sure that motivated and motivated will get you the furthest you wanted in life!
Yikes. I don't like rat soup
That sounds so disgusting! I hope that the food was not spoiled or that they fixed it right away!
Yes, 3 does.
I don't have any kids. But i do have 3, 6 and 10 year old kids.
Oh no! That is definitely something to be worried about!
That's terrible! I hope you didn't make a habit of doing that!
I would have been so upset! Why were there only two of you working?
That's so annoying! Why couldn't the cashier help herself? What was she waiting on, that's so aggravating!
I love puppies what kind did you get?
That's great! Congratulations! I have 3 dogs myself. They're all awesome!
I agree. Life can be so busy these day, it's strange.
I agree! I wish I could go back to just being a kid again. Life is full of wonders.
That's amazing! What was the prize you received>
That sounds amazing! How old were you? I am only 26 and I could never do that!
Awwww I am glad he gets some use out of the crib. Kids are SOAT IT!
Aw, that is difficult, I had a baby 3 1/2 years and it would break my heart to have to put her to sleep. sleep training can take it out of the baby, it's very difficult! But I am glad you are doing it more often, it's very calming
That sounds like so much fun! I love a place with a sand beach!
Oh I feel for you. I've had family go a few years now and it's a blast! How far did you go?
Thats a great outlook to have.
Life moves fast. Julian, 27, feels the exact same way as I did when I was 5
Awwww, that sucks, why can't you take a vacation with your friend?
Aww that stinks.  What do yo want to go to the beach or something?
Wow congrats! What is he going to study?
Wow! Congratulations! That's an amazing accomplishment! You sound like a very proud parent.
That's good news and bad! I'm not sure what I should do but you are making the right decisions!
I don't have any kids. How old is he?
How much did you get?
Oh no! Did you end up getting anything in return for them?
That is such an accomplishment! How old is she?
That is pretty cool, you sound like an excellent parent.
Oh my gosh!!! I would be so mad right now! What do you think would have caused the animal to do such a thing??
oh no.. that is so bad. i hope she is ok
That's good to hear.  Was the first week alright, or were you worried about her deteriorating further?
That's good, I hope it wasn't serious then.
How was the cat afterwards?
That is how I felt when giving a dog a bath or taking a dog to the dog wash. I can tell the difference if the cat is acting weird.
Oh no!  Were you scared at all about what could have happened?
Oh no! That sounds so terrifying! Were you able to find them?
You sound like a good parent!
What did you force her into doing?
I'm sorry you went through that. Was it your first experience?
Oh I bet. That's unfortunate that you couldn't go, but I guess that's what makes it so exciting and surprising to go and experience!
Well at least they were honest about it.
A boy for what?>
Three months?! That's quick! Are yo going to meet your new best pal?
How's it going?
That sounds great, have you used the recipes to help you in your own way?
Wow, thats a huge change, congratulations! What happened?
haha what a great surprise!
That's great! Did you invite all of your friends and family? :) Congratulations! I'm sure that brought you all kinds of stress
Did he get you the car, though?
Hey, congratulations!  It's awesome to have another person that cares about what they have to say!  What did you study?
That's great! I just graduated recently myself, so I know the feeling.
Wow! That's awesome! How did you go about losing so much weight!
Wow! That's a big change!!
Why don't you like milk growing up?
I'm with you. I never liked the taste of milk growing up, it always tasted gross to me.
I love skimpy milk, like skimpy cereal.  But that's just gross to me.
What was the choice?
I bet! The weather must've been bad!
Where did you guys vacation at?
Oh my gosh! I hope you took the news well. Did he do it for any reason?
I am sorry, that sounds hard.  Do you think he will be able to get it up?
I bet! It's so frustrating waiting in line at toll booths!
Oh no! Did they repair it at least?
That is so sweet. I bet he appreciated it very much!
Who forgave him flowers, that is amazing.
Where were they kissing
Oh my god. Are you alright?
Cave found me?
wow, that is crazy, what color was the mammoths?
Oh that is wonderful news! I also had a child out of the blue. What is your favorite part of your pregnancy/
That sounds amazing! Where were you trying to live?
What ended up being the issue?
That's so great to hear! I'm happy for you and the baby
I can understand how you would feel helpless. It is hard to lose a pet,ud.
I'm sorry for how awful that sounds but at least you got a pet with a good history and life with your owner.
That is terrible, what did you have to eat?
What did he want? A ride home?
That's good that you are taking care of him!  What an investment!
That's tough, but it is good that you took advantage and did what you could to help your son.
That sounds so relaxing and you must have felt really happy and joyful. I'm sorry you're having such a hard time, but I'm happy that you are having such a great time and that you're enjoying the outdoors.
I'm so happy you got to spend time with them today! My dog died a year and a half ago, but our rescue brought our puppy back to health and ended up having a surgery to repair his torn anterior cruculus. So happy for you guys!!
Why is that, is something wrong with you or someone?
I bet that is exciting though
That's great.  You sound very healthy!
It's almost as if people don't realize that changes can always bring about better health.
That sounds fun! Did it rain or anything?
Wow that's crazy! Did she win any awards at all?
Me to my childhood as well! What are some titles you enjoyed most about it?
Those games still seem so new and fresh for me. I loved playing Gradual Stampede on the Gameboy Color
Oh my god! What was it?
I'm glad someone made a funny about it!
Thats so awesome! I really love learning and I bet that gives her such a huge boost as an artist.
that is amazing, what kind of an art she is making?
nothing, just had to check my messages
I don't know. I think I'm just lost in my world right now!
Did you take a video of the kitten? Did you report it to the animal control?
That's so wonderful!  I had a feeling you did it by yourself but I didn't know you did it by yourself.
What an amazing feat! where did she go?
Wow. She must have been quite an adventurous woman!
Did you go in the house
Thank goodness it didn't hit your home!
That is great! When is the wedding?
That's a really nice gesture. It's good for your brother that he wants to help her out by providing a little extra.
What kind of car are you getting
Those are nice choices!  The new SUV's are really impressive and fun to drive!  Are you getting an SUV soon?  You'll be able to do just fine on the highway with ease!
How old is he?
Wow! You definitely should be ready for the baby. That room is going to need some serious fixes.
Aw man. That stinks because those are really cool looking gifts!
They probably don't want to raise shipping costs
Oh my, that is a lot! Do you have any idea who she is?
What really happened?
Wow. What happened to it?
What did you get repaired?
Oh, what a big lie... Did they actually move in to your place?
What really happene!?
Oh, I understand where you're coming from. I can see where your coming from.
What made you think it was bad before?  I'm curious.
Wow. Where did she travel to?
Where did she travel?
Are you feeling better now?
That sucks, i hope she feels better.
That is sad to hear, i am sure there must be a special reason for your not have money
Why don't you work?
Ok
Well that is very sweet of you to make her feel good about herself!
That's a good plan!
I hope everything works out well for you!
What were you thinking?  What made you unsure?  I'm glad it did come out. What were you thinking?
What were you thinking it would come out kind of?   Are you ok?
what was?
Awe!  I am so sorry!  That sounds awful.
Homeless tomorrowski?
Oh no, that's awful. Did she know it was you? If she didn't know, then it wasn't so bad, right?
Why did you decide to go through with it?
I'm so very sorry to hear that. Losing family is never an easy thing.
Oh no. I'm so sorry.  I can only imagine how you feel.
That's awesome! I always wanted to be an artist.
That's great. How old is your kid?
I think we're all guilty of lying to them some how, even though we know it's bad. Why did you do it?
What was it about lying you were lying about?
Me too, it is very relaxing!
I'm sure there's something there.
Isn't that the greatest feeling? Isn't it just the best to feel so loved and cherished over something that isn? - your own?
Oh man. escape is key. Did you have some escargot over the summer?
I am so sorry to hear about that. It is always so hard losing a pet...
That's very sad to hear. How did he die, if you don't mind me asking?
Wow! That must have made you angry!
What?! Did you honk at him?
sorry?
Oh no! How did you get into that mistake?
Oh that sounds very tough! I hope you do well!
Oh wow that is a big step! What will you be studying?
Why do you say that
I am sorry you had to go through that
Oh no! How awful!!
oh damn that stinks
how exciting
That's pretty cool. What is bingo?
I'm so sorry you had to experience that!
Oh my gosh. You better find something to eat then.
It was pretty good. I just finished eating. What about you?
Oh yea? I hope it was a great day! Was it a nice night?
What was the weather like?
That's awful! How did that even happen?
Oh no! How embarrassing! Did anyone see it?
That's good. Trust is very important for any relationship.
Aw that is so sweet! Trusting is so important in life!
I hope it goes better than anticipated!
Good luck! I bet it'll go fine! Are you studying for an upcoming class, or an engineering class?
Awesome! I love animals
Nice. Are you going with anyone?
That would really make me mad!  I would make sure they took responsibility and covered their nasty actions!
I would certainly try. They may be worried sick or are in shock that their guests are acting ill
What made you happy?
That is awesome! I am really happy for you!
I agree, but maybe it's good to look back at the simpler things in life, like buying clothes.
I am glad you were able to get help. School can really be a lot of money.
What is the favorite?
Well that's cool. Are you any good?
About what/why?
That's cool!  You must be proud!
That is good. Some people would prefer to have money for other things.
Audis are really nice! What color? Are you getting a trim?
What kind of watch is it?
What kind of watch is it
Congratulations! What are you studying?
Congratulations! Thats awesome! What kind of jobs are you looking for?
I hope you did well in your class! Do you anticipate that you did?
I hope you do well on that class. Hard work always pays off.
That is awful, I hope you realize how much of an attraction there are to people!
Wow, that seems like an awful place to be. Are you okay, or do things make you unhappy? I'm glad you were able to piece it together and come out of it stronger.
That's terrible. How did she die? I hope it was preventable.
That sucks so hard. I hope she wasn't in pain for too long. My mom was in pain for over 4 weeks before she died.
That's disgusting! Did you complain to the manager?
That is really disgusting!  I would stay far away from there next time!
I bet! Did you get to play all the old games?
Yes, I had a good relationship with them growing up. They were both very approachable.
Were you looking for something in particular or just for fun? It can give you a good nostalgic feel.
Ah yes, do they make you think back to those days?
I am glad you were okay. Was it bad down south?
I was fine. We did have one or two feet of snow on the ground, but it didn't really do anything for the electricity, or for us in the house, in the car.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. What was the appointment for if you don't mind me asking?
I hope it went okay!
That must've taken a lot of planning and construction!
I have not, but I know my mom did when she was pregnant with my son!  It took a long time, but we eventually got the parts figured out and were able to build it pretty quickly!  Do you like to decorate?
That's terrible, sorry for the funeral
That sucks, I'm sorry.
Wowza. What did you want to talk about?
Wow that sounds very unpleasant, what happened once they got to you?
Yea it is annoying when people act like that when you're trying to have some time to talk to you
What is the subject??
Good luck! When you feel prepared, just remember the hints and practice problems!
Sounds like an amazing trip! Will there be much downtime there between the two of you?
I've never been to the ocean actually! I know that is beautiful. I've always wanted to go myself.
wow! that must have been a nice surprise!!
Wow, you are lucky to have a husband like him!
Oh yes I do know. I have one and one half married as well. We have 7 kids and one stepmother (our forth-wived) lol.
Oh wow! Kay Jewelers? I have never heard of them.  I use those jewelers on my car, but they're pretty pricey.
Why? What happened?
That sucks, did you get a soda refund at least?
Who are you suspecting he is going to go to a party?
What sort of things are you suspecting he is going to do?
Maybe they just envy you.  I do that.
You could always try and get a confession
Oh that's great news! What finally convinced him?
That is awesome. You must feel pretty lucky!
That's awful!  Babies are always so precious!  Was it someone's kid?
That's a good point. Baby's need someone like you to keep them company!
That sounds like a great decision.
Are you making more money than your current job is offering?
What a nice surprise! What's the address?
How is it going?
That is crazy, are you ok?
Where did you move to after that happened?
That is so relaxing! I love relaxing moments when people do nice things.
Do you have any animals?
That's great!  What do you have planned?
You sound like you really enjoy your wife.  I hope the party goes smoothly and that the marriage is going well!
She must really like to have fun with friends! Sounds fun! Where is the surprise party at?
That was probably my fault then. I hate being flattered.
Well, now you know your friend is a reliable guy.
Oh no! That must've been awful
Haha, I'm sorry you had to deal with that
That's the worst!  That always irritates me when I'm on the road and have to clean up after others!
I am sorry to hear that! But they must have been so busy to clean everything right away!
What kinda TV?
Could always buy another
That would annoy me too, is she always expecting it?
Yea that is infuriating! How do they get away with that?
Oh yeah? It is always nice doing those things with old friends! Are you guys really getting along?
Good to hear, it sounds like it was lots of catching up to do
Two classes? Wow, must be a really intensive coursework.
That's ridiculous! I'm glad that is over!
I'm happy for you!
That's great! I'm happy to hear that!
God is always good to people.
That is very sweet and true
Wow!  I bet that must've scared everyone!  Were you all okay? Were the windows broken?
That must've been terrifying, my mom's insensitivity to storms can get pretty bad!
Lupus is terrible! I think it's genetic. Have you heard of the internet to try to find a blood relative?
I have lupus. Not super rare and you really don't want that bad of an outcome to play out in your life, but if it's ever gonna happen you better make sure you have the strongest possible medicine just in case.
I'm so sorry to hear that. How long ago did you first hear about this?
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope everything turns your day.
Did you check the fridge?
That's disgusting! What was you'saction after you noticed that?
I'm sorry, that must have been disappointing. Did everything turn your ok after that?
Im sorry to hear that. I hate when things dont work out
Hahaha!  Maybe you should set up an alarm at night!
Yeah, that would have scared me too!
I think subtlety would be good for asking for permission to use a bathroom or other common bathroom. But you're absolutely right about the need for good manners, I guess.
Well, if someone were to make noise in your neighborhood maybe it'd be more discreet
I'm so sorry! I hope everything works out.
I hope it all works out for you.
I broke an ankle 4 months ago and it has been swollen ever since, tornados and tornados give me the runs!! I fell in the middle of nowhere and couldn't stop walking. I don't even have insurance!!
I'm so sorry. I hope it's not too embarrasing.
80's Felt like a breeze today. breeze and sirens!
Sounds like a great plan. It's been raining a lot here lately too. Maybe you should move?
Have you ever done one before or do you find them nervewracking?
You never know, you might just be better prepared to speak in front of people
What movies do you like to watch then
I love trolls, those were the best years of my life!
I've never seen the movie but have always wanted to lol.
Yeah, it's really frustrating. I mean I watch previews for movies I know will make a lot of money but I end up blocking them. It's so easy to be offended though...
That is good to hear. Do you feel like you are ready for it?
That sounds nice, was you tipped as well?
I haven't been to Dairy Queen in a while... I need on a treat
Most of us don't have as much of a need to work as some would hope though.
That is so true!
That is awesome.
Was it on a bike or a car?
You must have been quite scared, did you stay on the bike for a while?
hahah that is so funny!
I always take off my towel when going to the locker rooms. It makes it so I don't get trail of life.
That's amazing! Congratulations! That must feel like a great feeling!
Wow that's great! Congratulations!
It hasn't been too bad.  It was bad when she broke the news about me wanting to be fired, but she seems to be picking back up recently
I just got hired to start a practice law firm next month!
wow that's a good thing they did that fast!
That was really lucky of them!  That makes me feel a lot better about my bank!
That's fantastic! Congrats!!
I know that feeling! What restaurant?
That's so great. I hope you really enjoyed that gift.
Oh no! You must feel guilty about this. You must feel guilty for forgetting to get him something.
haha that sounds good!
Hah, yeah that happens sometimes to us when we are kids too! I hope you're not too disappointed with him.
Oh no! How old is he now?
Aw man! You can't unpack that stuff! You better pack it for him!
That's good. I always like riding with my little son. I'm sure that will make for an exciting day!
Oh that's good. I live in the city too, so when I have to eat out it's no big deal. I do it because I want fresh fruits and veggies.
Did she give notice when you told her?
It's nice she was patient. I always like my bosses being understanding when they have problems.  Did everything go over well with the rent?
That's great. What was it about?
wow that is such an accomplishment!
how did you hear about what happened?
You are a stronger soul than I am! I hope he is in a better place!
Oh how cool!  Congratulations!  I hope you like it?
That's great! Good job!
Aww thats awesome! How old are they?
Wow! Good for you! That is one tough road you're on. Congrats! How did the delivery go?
Hm.. I don't know what to tell ya.. What do you think is going to happen?
Haha that happens to me all the time. I guess "If it doesn't rain often, it's not a problem."
Lesson 1 starts tomorrow.  Summer vacations are always a good idea
Awww, teenagers!  I'm so excited for them!  Are you happy for them, too?
I am sorry to hear that, I am also sorry about today. What happened?
Oh no! Did they tell you why?
Why not? What stopped you from taking a trip?
Sometimes you got to do what you gotta do
Wow, congrats! What was he saying?
That's really awesome!
Have you thought about investing in stocks or borrowing money?
3 months seems short, but it's never to late!
What is your degree in?
wow, 5 months to find out? That seems like a lot of time!
thats amazing, good job!
Congratulations! What things did you study if I may ask?
That's awesome. You must be so proud of the restaurant!
That's awesome. I love restaurants that have a big presence in town.  I hope you enjoyed the weekend!
Sorry about your problems. You will find somebody good in your life.
What changed your path?
It is nice to have some time to rest.  What do you like to do for fun?
That is so good to hear! I wish I could do that! How long do you have on your routine?
That's awesome! I need more discipline.  How do you do that?
What type of diet do you follow
That's too bad to hear!
That's too bad to here. I hope you and your family is ok
I used to leave my little boy alone in rains too, how times have changed haha. How is he today?
Rain can make you forget a lot of stuff.
Oh that must have been exciting for both of you!
What book was it
I'm sorry, what do you do to earn money?
ukulele staking is good way
Wow.  That is soon!  What are you going to name him/
That is awesome!  I know right!  I have 4 boys myself
I have the same issue. My biggest worry is having too much work and home life. How do you handle it?
Oh no! I'm sorry you're having car troubles. I'm sure you'll be alright!
Wow, what did you do? Did you confront her?
That's a shame! I'm glad she was embarrassed, but that sounds horrible and sounds like a lie.
Why did she refuse
Why was it that big a deal that you couldn't ask?
That's so cool. Is she looking forward to it?
That's amazing! How old is she?
I would imagine thats very hard! How did you feel afterwards?
You must be quite proud of your achievement! What school do you go to?
Which one were you playing with him?
I love playing old sega games
Oh no!  What made you scared?  The weather or the trip?
Yeah, the train is no fun.  I used to be scared too because of the movies!
That sounds like so much fun! What kind of car?
That's a good choice! They are very reliable and a great car to have!
Wow that's so dark. Did she enjoy it?
Wow, you are a brave and brave person! Good for you showing your age!
why are you feeling unhappy
I understand that completely, sometimes it's just the simpleton's paradox of wanting to be happy while at the same time being sad that gets us! It's an interesting feeling to me personally, so I can relate.
That's gross! Did you complain?
That's disgusting! I wouldn't of gone for the pizza though...
Awesome! I love bikes! What kind did you get?
That sounds awesome! I hope it feels great to ride with you.
Congratulations! I am sure that you have a very stressful time in the making.
Nice! I'm sure it will be a good decision for you.
I feel your pain. My sister in law is like that too.
I know what you mean, it's very stressful and I'm glad there's someone out there that cares about it!
That's terrible, I've had one fatter sister who looked almost exactly like my cat too. Are you thinking about getting another one?
That's sad to here. I have a friend who had to get his dog breed specific since it affected him. It's really sad to hear about other animals getting hurt so violently.
That sucks. I hope you get paid eventually.
Oh no that's not good! I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe there's some online work that you can try and do that?
What was it of?
I love that picture, it is so cute!
what was the surprise?
That's cool! I hope you guys spend a lot of time together!
Oh no, that's always scary! Were you okay?
It happens. Just remember to be brave and take it one day at a time
What really happened at that point in time?  Did you feel remorse?
Wow that sounds like it could have been a really dark moment for both of you.
Math is never my friend.
yea thats true.. but like one time I cheated..
Oh my, what did you do?! I hope they were stopped!
Oh wow! Did the person in the chase stop?
Wow, finding cards can be a lot! Did you play on those cards often as a kid?
Wow that is really awesome, I have not collected baseball in a while either.
what kind of job did you get?
Cool, what industry do you work in?
I don't know that movie. What was it?
oh really? I've never heard of that
The sound of the waves was exhilarating, like a breath taking
i love going to the beach. i wish i could do it more often
Did you tell a teacher?
Don't be too hard on yourself. You did your time and did the best you could with what you had studied.
that's nice. i hope it goes well.
That is understandable! Have you always been able to do that?
I'm sorry to hear that. Were you able to get over the loss quickly and comfort yourself at least.
That is so sad. How are you holding up now?
I'm so sorry to hear about that.  What sorts of memories resurfaced from him>
That is sad, my dad had cancer too.
That's fun! Did you have a good time there?
I do love the sound of the ocean, did you go on a vacation or something?  I've never been on one
That's an awesome movie. Was it good, too?
What did he do?
Did you have a good visit?
That's cool.  I live far away from my family.  But I get what you on.  How long have you been waiting for?
Oh no!  Did it get you too scared?
Oh my goodness! Did you get away from the dog, or did the dog chase you too? Were you able to get home safely?
That's sweet! How old is she?
Is there any major problem?
Why is that
awww thats great! How long were you waiting to meet them?
Oh no! Did you chase the dog or did the dog get you?
Oh my gosh!  That must be terrifying!  Did you chase it after you ran?
I'm not good singer but I do have a singing voice.  Don't be jealous!  You're so lucky!
I am sorry.  If you really want to be a singer, just start singing.
How'd it go, do they do what you want them to do?
That was nice of you.  I'm glad you got instructions!  That usually makes chores much easier.
How gross! I hope they didn't bring you more trouble as a result!
Oh no, I bet that made you feel sick!
Why, thank you!
5 what?
That must have made you feel a little jealous, Did you talk to her about it?
That's awesome!  Did you have fun at least?
Thats not good!  Did they even have good reason to?
Oh my, I hope that nothing came out and you guys are still okay.
Oh my word! Did you kill it? You may have saved yourself a lot of time and frustration.
That is so creepy, but if he didn't fly then that means there was an even bigger fly in the chair too.  I would be more scared!
Are you at a very low monthly payment?  If not, might be time to look at getting another job.
I'm sure that it will be better! You should try to do what you can.
Oh, where were you travelling?
What happened?
I used to go to KFC when I was younger.  I miss the good ol days.
What did you say?
Sometimes you got to just do what you think is best... and hope it's not bad!
That wasn't very nice.
Wow. How popular is she? She may have just found out from someone higher up.
Aw, is she older or still a kitten? That's amazing!
That's sweet! It's always nice to see little kids showing off how much they love and are devoted to their loved ones.
Oh no.. why did it make you so nervous
Are you going to be with her parents for a reunion?
That's pretty neat! I was kind of thinking that way as well, since my goal is to get my foot in the door into the real world. What kind of education are you hoping to get?
That's too bad, hopefully you find another scholarship.
I am sorry, thats terrible. I bet it was hard
No, the cops are terrible. What about you? Any relatives around?
I understand. Dogs live with us. Do you have any pictures of him/her you can share with us?
Oh that sounds exciting! How did it go
Oh no! I'm sorry! I hope he didn't feel too guilty! That must have been a pretty gross experience.
It sure did man. What was it?
It was really cool! It was like watching someone jump higher!
Wow that must have been terrifying! Are you ok now?
Did he catch you?
Oh no. Did you manage to get it all sorted out though?
I am sorry to hear that.
Oh no! That's a shame! Did you tell the seller?
That is so gross.
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Was it a pretty devastating loss for the dog.
That's really sad to hear. How long did you have your dog for?
oh i am sorry to hear about that! my condolences   to all around
I'm so sorry to hear that. Life does get easier. Just hang in there....
Yeah me too, it can be so fake sometimes.
Because gullible people believe anything they hear.  It is quite sad actually, quite sad.
Is there any store you can buy it at that sells only organic milk?
That's sweet, it's nice to have a little girl who wants to be a kid again!
im sorry, how did that happen?
Sorry to hear about that. It sounds like you have had a hard time getting out of the place.
Yeah, the things you don't even think about can really add up!
Aldis is German owned, right? So they are sort of a German supermarket, but yeah, that sounds awesome to me! I will give them a try, thanks for the tip!
Me too! Do you live in Los Angeles?
I've never been to Lakers hell yeah! Have they been doing well?
I'm so sorry to hear about that! Did he at least live a happy life with his dementia, if i may ask?
Sorry to hear about that.  Did he have a good life though?
How long have you been friends with her?  Has it been more than a month now?
People say that all the time but they're kidding. She's obviously not.
What are some of the goals you're working towards?
Good luck and I hope it all works out!
I've never seen it, was good movie tho?
I love Broadway shows! I bet that was exciting for you
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! Did you get her back up and running?
Oh my goodness that's scary! How old is the dog??
What kind of things did you participate in?
That's so exciting!  Where were the Crew at in the Crew Crew Crew?  Crew?  That's so cool to me though, because the Crew was the first dance promotion in my entire family.  I loved dancing!  Have you heard of hip hop?  No, I really haven't.
That's awesome! Have you been working on any routines for it?
You can still win if you are on some sort of performance drugs! Don't be so down on yourself.
That's awesome! I'm happy to here that! Did he help you with anything else?
im sorry to hear about that.
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. Are you close?
Why were you so nervous?  Did you have to go through an interview?
What?! That's amazing! How far did you run?
Maybe you should move out! lol
I understand your jealousy. I'm sure she feels more than happy with the house.
I'm guessing she didn't like your brother?
That's not very nice.
i too
I'm the same way! I grew all of my own tomatoes and peppers!
Did he do an interview for the Times?
What is the full show?
That sounds like fun! How old is she?
That's great! I took my son to a park once and we ended up skipping for half the day!
I live at night too, sometimes i come across motorcycles and some people are very careless.
I agree, those bikes can cause road rage!
No, why would I be?
I am and I totally agree
Do you have anxiety too? If you did, did you tell your doctor about it so he could fix it for you?
Oh no I'm so sorry! Maybe try to have an advocate come to your home to help you.
Was it overbooking?
It happens to the best of us! I think it is better to be nervous and excited than happy and nervous!
That is really awesome! I am so proud of you!
That is such a great idea. You should be proud of yourself
Aw, that's cute!  How was the relationship before and after?
That sounds like a pretty interesting story. Did you two ever develop an outside relationship (or did you still stay seperate)
How wonderful! How long will they be staying?
That's awesome!  So happy they got here!  What did you guys do with it all?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think it's due to his mental illness?
That's frustrating for everyone. You should tell him how disappointed you are in him.
I can see why! What's helped is cutting down on carbs and moving to more plant based meals like lentil soup and chick peas!
That's great! How did it go?
That's wonderful! I'm happy for your daughter, too. I hope everything continues to work out and you guys meet in the future! I bet she'll end up loving all of you guys very soon.
That is amazing! I am happy that your daughter is excited about college too!
Im so sorry!  Ive been there more than I like to admit.
Yeah, I get that. It happens to all of us. It was just a day at the office, nothing more than that. But I still felt a sense of obligation to make sure everyone was okay
That is good. Do you often get together?
Nice, middle and school were always good times. I'm glad to here about the high school reunion
Oh nice. What subject was it?
Competition is healthy sometimes! What college you attend?
That's cool!  Where are they going?
That's awesome! I'm glad you get to catch up with her.  I'm visiting myself this weekend and I'm a bit envious of how far away I am to have a friend like that.
Have you spoken with a psy doctor?
I am sorry to hear that, I hope that you get well soon.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that! What happened to them?
I am sorry for your loss. I have lost my two dogs. They were 15 years old and 14-year old girls.
That is so annoying! Why is he always on the couch?
You should talk to him about it!
I'm sorry to hear that. Losing weight is hard, especially when you have to chase those beautiful healthy eating habits.
How long have they been in a group?
Sounds like so much fun! I've always wanted to take a road trip. How far did you have to travel?
Yes I agree. Beach trips are awesome
Wow that's terrible. Did they have a good reason to do so? Were you really looking forward to the trip?
Wow that's a rip off. Why did they cancel?
I'm sure you will. That is a very special friendship.
That is wonderful.  I'm sure you had a wonderful time!
I can understand that.  I'm in college and live by myself too!  It can be lonely
It can also help if you have someone around that you can talk to.
did you kill it?
I would do the exact same thing!  You must have done it because you are brave!  I don't want to talk about how it found me..
I live in florida but not too close to florida state.
Wow that sounds like a fun trip.  I went to Florida on vacation with my family last year.
Have you brought it up to your landlord?  Some don't care if others are getting sick
Do they keep cold?
I am so sorry. That is so horrible. How old is she?
Oh, I'm so sorry! That's awful. That's sisters of us..they're always looking to help or find a solution to the problem!
That sucks, that sounds like you had expectations for a person that wasn't you. I guess that goes for every single rejected relationship, unfortunately. I'm sorry to hear about your situation.
Wow that sucks. Did they like what they were rejected too?
It's good that you're adjusting, though! I moved a couple of years ago and it's definitely an experience!
That is scary! I have to move to Florida soon!
I lived in the country for a few years. It was fun but the cold always gets to me.
That's good to hear! Is it the economy that is doing well? or is the Trump Administration doing well?
I am hopeful as well.   What do you think is causing the economy to be so great?
Aww I'm sorry, you're not helping though! That's your brother, right?
That is sad, but I understand your fear. I hope everything turns out okay
That's so exciting. I'm happy you guys found out! I'm guessing he must have really been excited?
I am guessing the Shedd is no more?
That's so cool. I love the sound of babies! And the unique way they wriggled around in the water! Very cool.
Oh yeah? What was the film?
I saw the Ring too!  I loved it!  I'm not sure if I will be as frightened as you.
That's amazing. You must be so proud.
Wow! That's amazing! That's amazing to hear! I am so proud of her and wish her all the best!
Oh cool! What kind of car is it?
That is awesome!
Congratulations! That's an amazing accomplishment!
Environmental Engineering sounds great! What are you planning on doing when you get your diploma?
That's not good :(  Did she know?
You have a couple days to make the most of this bad experience and move on
Oh yeah? How big will your wedding be?
That sounds awesome!  Where are they from?  Do you all have kids?
I do as well
I know exactly what you mean. I was always a really good friend to my friends and had some amazing times! Time definitely does help but it's not everything.
Oh my gosh, I hate horror movies! Were you scared at all, or just disgusted by the acting and graphics?
What kind of movie was it? I love watching scary movies!
Aww that's sweet!  It's the best feeling!
Has he done that for you before?
I'm so sorry to hear that.  Is chihuahuas a breed that's easy to train, and if so that could explain her difficulties sleeping.
That is so sad :( I am so sorry to hear that
I can not disagree with you there!
He is truly damaged goods. I mean, he is a millionaire but he doesn't act like a humble man.
Oh no! How old were they? and how badly did you hurt your toe?
That is scary! I hope you feel better and can visit them soon!
Did you visit with your family often?  Did it make you want to go back again?
Oh, well that does not sound fun! Where did you guys go?
Pulling your weight is very different from providing useful feedback!
That sounds terrible. teammate issues should be worked out by a committee. It would make everyone's life so much easier
Are you keeping them inside?
That's a bummer, but at least they are trying to avoid you being able to kill them.
That sounds like you were prepared for anything! Did it happen in your own home or at work?
That's a good move.  Are you in the habit of carrying extra clothing?
Did you enjoy that?  Were there any horses you didn't see often?  Were there any horses you liked the most?
Did the people treating you horses really love them?
That is so great! I can just imagine how excited you were.
Thats good, how long did that take?
That is pretty tall, did you try it out?  I would have been nervous too.
That's insane! How long before people forget this stuff and start calling you names?  Sounds like you'll be around in 20 years!  That's quite an accomplishment!  Did you cry yourself to sleep that night?
That's pretty sweet!  Are you jealous of him?
You could look into swing dancing
Where did you move?
Wow that sounds very exciting! Are you moving to an unfamiliar city?
That is great, I wish I could mediate.
That is great, I wish I could do that too! Have you had some good guided meditating practices?
what!? did you shoot them out of the inside?!?
Oh wow! That would make my heart skip a beat!
Wow. What was the project over?
It's always disappointing when people bail on a promising thing like that. Especially when the person isn't very good or helpful in anyway shape of, for whatever reason. But, usually those people end up becoming the next Elon Musk.
I'm with you on that, it's the biggest stage of the semester. I get very nervous about it!
That sounds stressful, but it sounds like it was way easier in the morning than in the evening.
That's really nice of the storekeep to help you.
That's really nice of them! I wish I lived in a better town
I live in Florida. The summers are brutal.
I hate wasps. Did you manage to get over it?
I'm sorry that that didn't happen to you. Did it hurt you when it happened?
I've done that before... customers are so unreasonable sometimes!
That is a terrible situation. UPS is notorious for this kind of thing.
I know what you mean. I think back on those times fondly.
I know exactly what you mean, adult life can be stressful at times
Sounds like you're really passionate about what you do! What do your jobs do?
That sounds interesting.  How do you like working there?
That's such an honest friend if he forgot to call and wanted to show he still cared.
I think you have to wonder about your friendship as well.
People get drunk all the time. If you behave irresponsibly you might lose your seat to someone who isn't fit for power.
Wow! How much was it?
I hate that!  I would have offered too!  That was a tough one to stomach!
Congrats! Sounds like you are commited to school, that's awesome.
That sounds like studying worked out well.
When do you think it will be done?
That would be quite an undertaking! Would you be laying down or up?
That sounds scary! Did you make your friend get away?
Did he do anything to you?  I'm so sorry you had to go through all that.  I hope everything is okay now.
Aww I am sorry to hear that. I have a one year old and have the same feeling so cross country trips can be helpful! Have you guys been able to find any new places yet?
No I haven't! That is so nice that you felt the need to help her feel better even though you were probably not going to want to move again. It's good that she left you though! She seems like a nice kid
Oh no! What happened? Did you bomb it or not at all?
That's always a pain :( I bet you looked pretty miserable.
Why are you glad?
i agree with you there, some people just dont care about others
Wow! That's pretty awesome! I'm sure you'll be a great electric engineering student!
No, I haven't been accepted to any engineering school yet. I am applying now
Oh my! Was everything alright though, and do you have an underground shelter in case you get scared again?
Thank you! storms are scary.
What a tragedy.
Wow I completely agree. It's one of the main causes of depression I think is the overwhelming amount of factory farming we do. I'm glad he is not dead yet though!
Did he do anything to you?  Did he make fun of you for it or anything like that.
Wow that's so nice of your boss.  Did he give you any big present for coming in so early?
amusement parks are fun
I do not. I like rollercoasters because they are fun for everyone. Which amusement park are you going too?
Wow! How did that work for you?
That's really smart! Are you worried that it won't work out?
Wow. How big was the family?
I love the kids! I think they should all dress asSanta!
Oh no! I'm sorry that happened to you! Were you able to find out who did it and put them up for adoption!
Dogs are always getting out of control sometimes.
I can totally relate to you! What shows do you watch/make you feel that? I used to hate dramas and comedies but once I started watching more of a dramas-s shows, I fell in love with the serious shows.  Like, 24/7.
I know exactly what you mean. I watch sad shows all the time and when they get real sad it gets hard to take a break.
Busch Gardens is an amazing place and if it's in the city then it's worth the drive
The one in Williamsburg is my childhood and I love that park! We are going to the one in Tampa next week. We are super pumped to see it.
That's so true. I was just talking about this with my daughter. She had a reaction to one today and had to have it taken away...because she started vomiting.
Oh no! Kids can be careless when it comes to touching or eating items. Was he able to finish the bar before the kid reached the kid's room?
That's pretty bad luck
That's really sweet! I have a dog myself.
That is so wonderful!  Golden retrievers are so precious and gentle dogs.  I love labs though.  How long do you have them?
Oh my, that is horrible. I hope everything is okay now.
oh god! i'm so sorry! you will be fine though! everything will be alright eventually
How was it?  Did you have fun?
That's cool.  Do you have a fondness for all of your childhood friends as well?
That's nice. I hope they enjoy it? Do you have a large house?
Wow, that would sound amazing, having your family come to you as well. You're lucky
That's awesome! Did you have fun seeing her perform?
That's awesome! I wish i could dance like that!
Thanks, that's a good encouraging advice! Do you have any advice to give to make myself feel less bad about myself in the future?
Wow! That's so nice of him! You must really love him!
Wow that's very nice of him. He's lucky to have a son who loves helping.
I hope you do well and get the job!
You should do your best, just don't stress about it too much. You have no idea what kind of person your going to meet at the interview, but it's their call.
I bet you were super grossed out!
Well it's good that it didn't. Most of us don't know what a refrigerator is.
What store is it?
What stores in that area do you like? Sounds fun!
That sounds fun! I hope it turns out that you are a jewelry hoarder aswell!
I am sorry that that was hard for you. You should try to find a job and also look for a holiday home.
Wow that's awesome. I'm happy you have that supportive community. I'm guessing you also feel like that in other places?
I'm so excited for you! I moved last year to Amsterdam. It was truly a magical experience!
That's unfortunate. It must have been very scary.
That's really great you have a great family. It's good you had someone to lean on.
I agree. It is a disturbing thing that people can behave in such a cruel way, when they don't have control over their own lives
I really agree.  It's so easy to see the bad people as people we can help, but it's sad how that turns out sometimes
Did you tell them?
3 months? Wow that is a long time to break up so...
Did anyone step out?
I agree. People just don't understand why we can't have nice things sometimes!
That sucks
I'm so sorry to hear about that; my parents are getting old. My sister was just over 50 and lived with her parents for the first time until she passed at the age of 50. Your parents must be very sad.
Oh I'm sorry. What have you been doing.
What do you do?  Sounds hard!  Do you have a day job?
I bet you are!  What is she going to school for?
What is a little "fickle" haha. Has she decided what her major is yet?
Why do you have to do your co-workers in such busyness?
I'm July and August here.  The summer just ended, and it'll be July here for a little while longer.  Did you have any plans for the month of August?
I think it's crazy enough to be fun. I'm not really sure about it, but it would certainly be an exercise for the mind!
Oh man, I've always wanted to skydive. Would it be worth it to do it on my first try?
I agree, I try and do that even when I feel absolutely sure I can do it.
That's awesome! I'm glad you're getting back in the game.
That is good, do you use pesticides when you cook?
That is such bad luck. How do you think you will do in those pictures?
That's so sad. Did she have a nice family?
I bet you were a strong and supporting parent.
wow thats great!
No i dont, why?
Cool. What year>?
Cool! Have you gone for a ride in it?
That is no good, did you have them for long?
That's too bad but at least you can put them on a cart and take a trip away
What was it
That sounds amazing.
That sounds so good right now! What did you end up getting?
Sorry to hear about your loss, but I hope things start back up soon.
I'm so sorry. That is so sad to hear. Are you thinking of getting him a second partner?
That sounds so awesome! Was it your birthday?
Cool, what was the occasion? Did he tell you his plans for the dinner?
Congratulations! I'm happy for you!
Congratulation! I'm sure you deserved it!
That's awesome! What kind of words does she have?
I don't. I have three kids, though
where are you going? are you scared to go?
Wow, that's pretty early to go. Are you going by yourself?
Oh that sounds like a good surprise! Did you have something good?
I love sushi! I go to the sushi buffet at my college almost every day
Oh yeah, I love sushi! I'm so jealous right now! I'm thinking about visiting one myself, they seem pretty cool.
That's nice! What weather did you have?
I have a garden. I visit many parks. I do not like the path/bike lanes/parking where people walk in circles waiting to put something down. I don't like people not wanting to walk on grass or loose stones/ Anything that isn't green.
You must like to just be alone!
wow that sounds very lonely
That's so awesome! How far did you move?
I bet it does! Are you in a foreign country right now?
oh thats cool
I am sure the 16th will be a fine car
That's great! 16 isn't that old to drive.
I do have one, but shes only 15.  We get carpool tickets to work sometimes lol.
What did they do to surprise you so unexpectedly?
What did she like most about you?
What kind of elements do you miss most?
I am sure. Do you live in the midwest. I have family down there but moved away for college. I live in the southeast now
How'd she do that?
That is very nice of you. You are married too?
What play was it? Did you enjoy yourself? Did you know the play was happening?
That's cool! I like supporting my favorite actors too!  Did he have an awesome role?
Maybe try having a night alone?
Maybe you could go somewhere public like a store parking lot to meet people.
Cool, I like wings. What did you search for?
That's awesome! wing sauce is one of my favorites too! I'm glad you were able to find something new and creative to make.  Did you make it up off the bag?
I hope so!  That sounds exciting!  What did you train for?
I am sure it was all worth the wait!!
That is great. Is this your first child?
That is awesome! I am very sure you are an amazing mother! I am so glad your son is here!
Oh yeah? Did it get a good scare or what?
i have had that feeling before
I remember the first professional season I ever attended. I went to a preseason football game in College Park in Georgia. What side are you rooting for?
Oh nice.  I don't really follow the college game much.  Are you a big fan?
that sounds like fun! i haven't been to an amusement park in years.
It's like they were skating on air!  That's pretty amazing!
That was incredibly nice of you!  I hope your friend appreciates it!
That's good. I had a car mechanic say that the carburetor was something that he had to replace.
Awww that stinks but hey, better be over prepared!
Math is pretty tough, glad you got an A!
OH no. How old was he?
I'm really sorry.  What kind of crash was it?
Wow congratulations! How are you celebrating?
Wow congratulations! When did you find out?
Oh wow! How did you and everyone you knew take precautions?
That's a good attitude. You're very brave!
Why gas station? Did someone offer to buy you more?
Did it make you feel better though
That's really kind of you. Is he going to be better and better for it?
That's good that they seem to be in a good mood, though! I hope the flu stays away from him forever!
Wow, you must have worked hard.
That is great, I bet it was a lot of hard work to earn it!
That sucks! Sorry to hear it was a bad movie for you and friends
Sounds like a fun time! Did you watch it with anyone special?
I remember those nervous moments. Was your interviewer nice?
Congrats! I'm sure you were nervous, but you did great! It's a great feeling when your hard work pays off!
That's too bad.  I'm glad the dogs are okay though!
That's really nice that your neighbor cares so much about your safety! I'm sorry you had to experience that, but I'm happy to here that your neighbor cares about your safety!
I hope it wasn't a bad injury that kept him from ordering you to the bathroom.
That's funny! I would feel the same as laughing myself off.
That's wonderful. My daughter is only 5 months old. She loves to use the spoon!
That is great. My daughter is 3 1/2 months and learn to use a spatula and a bowl as well.
why so long?
Oh no! That sounds awful!
Beagles are some tough pets. I had one die from congestive heart failure when I was a kid.
That beagle was probably my favorite dog ever. I'm sorry.
I remember those days too! Did you find one after that long period of time working?
Oh yea, that feeling is always different though.
Thats cool. Do you have any cool kids pictures of the old days on there?
Wow that's really cheap especially for an old bus system!  I'm sorry it isn't in better shape anymore
I know how you feel.  How are you holding up?
I'm so sorry to hear about that. It's good to be over that though.
Oh no!  Did they react the same?
haha that's a good one.
Yes it does! I also have a son and it flies by too fast too!
Aww, you are so right about that time! Life really flies by fast doesn't it? I am happy you will have that to look back on as well.
Oh god! Are you ok?
I tripped at the fair not too long ago too. I dont tripped too much
That was nice of you.
I think you did a good thing by doing that.
I am very sorry to hear about that.  I have lost both my grandparents within the last year, so I know the feeling very well
I'm glad you understand. I don't have family to carry with me, so I understand completely, what your saying.
I agree. I have been there and know that it is not easy to accomplish.  It is something we should all be thankful for.
I agree with that. I feel grateful towards my husband for getting his degree and helping out with bills.
I am grateful as well
Wow, thank you for what your position brings you, I wish there were more people like you in this world
I am sorry to hear that. Do you have another phone that you could try to find?
I'm so sorry to hear about that. Did you manage to find it or at least remember what you had lost it too?
Where were the parties at? Was it at your house or at school?
Wow! Where was it?
That is really sad. Where did you move to after you graduate?
that's awesome that your son is going visit them! i bet that is going to be so fun
What show is that?
I've never watched it but it sounds good.  What is it about?
Sometime that's the most satisfying!
It's good you took steps to improve your answers.
Where are you headed to? Are you going on your vacation home?
I take those vacations too. Why are you nervous?
Oh no! Was something up with your sister?
That was nice. How long ago did you help her?
Thats great!  You must have felt very happy!
I am glad it was a nice surprise. Do they do it on special occasions too?
I'm with you on that one! My yard is straight garbage and it's so hot.
Oh that's too bad, are they going to have a baby?
That's so cool, I work from home and I love ironworkers.  You must work really hard.
Oh no that is too interesting! I'm glad you guys are adults about it instead of just little kids!
Oh no! I am glad he didn't make you feel that way, but please don't ever let it make you think he was being rude to the woman. That's what he gets you when you don't fully appreciate or trust someone. I hope he left her a little bit charasmatic.
awww.. what happened
What kind of program?
That's terrible!  Poor innocent kid!  Did he get in trouble?
That's very kind of you!  Sometimes the most important thing is to teach your own children how to be healthy and to defend themselves.
That's unfortunate. What is it that he does that is so hard?
That stinks. I'm sure if you tell him he'll find another job, but you still have to be really supportive.
That's so awesome! What does he get usually?
I think you need more wishes!  My parents are on their 60s and 70s, respectively.  Perhaps you and he should get bonuses every month just to keep things interesting ha!
What was the movie? Geez
Oh my god, you just described my worst nightmare! How can people cut their legs off?? I thought they were so cute the first time I ever saw them in real life!!
How much is he getting?
Why don't your husband get a large bonus?
Aw, that's a bummer. Do you at least get to visit?
Oh wow. That's really good that you guys are close and able to communicate. I hope you guys can laugh and bevieve all you want in order to accomplish that goal! :)
I can just imagine! It is so cool to see them grow up, learning from us and helping others. It makes you wish you had children myself.
I can totally understand that.  It's a shame the way our technology and ageistically accelerated society prevents us from realising the wisdom of the ages
Oh my god. Was it a police or a robber?
Oh my gosh, I bet you are scared all the time. What do you think was it?
I'm so sorry to hear about that.  I know it's hard, losing a loved one, but think of all the positive aspects!  You can find peace when thinking of him, and I'm sure you'll feel better.
I'm so sorry. I'm thinking about you right now. Do you want to talk?
That's great! What kind of job is it and what are you looking for?
I'm sorry, how long have they been friends?
Why did they do it? Is it something that can be forgiven.
Was it nice?
I've never been but i hear so many good things! was there a lot to do or just so so much to see?
Really? Why was that?
That's terrible, I feel bad when people do things to me.
How did it go.I have never seen a musical.
He was definitely not expecting to win, that is a fact
That would be embarassing! Are you ok?
ugh that's the worst,  Was it something that was easily replaced?
Have yo meet them yet/
I am sure that is a good decision. Are you going with anyone?
Oh my god. Why did she do that?
Sometimes people make mistakes like that, and regret them later. If it's any condolence, you can still give them a taste of your own medicine to help things get better.
I can't imagine not being able to see your daughter. That must have been awful
That's awesome. How far along is she?
propose to me? how come? what was the occasion?
You may have just surprised him a little bit. That is a pretty awesome gift to receive - a man that's willing and Able to take a surprising turn in life :) Congratulations on your engagement.
Sounds like a nice guy to have around. I wish I had a boss like that.
Those are good traits to have.  Most people don't take that kind of position.
I have always tried to do this, but it always get me too excited and on edge when I do it. What do you do in the summer time?
Wow! How long did it take you to stop?
I know the feeling! Have you thought about getting some sleep earlier?
I feel you there, I have that happen to me often.
That's exciting! I'm sure closing will be smooth.
I hope all goes well. I know how anxious that can make you!
Did she get in trouble for not telling you when she was going to have dinner with family?
I am sorry to hear this. Is there any way for her to make it at some point?
I am sorry, work does have its time. Life is just too short! Maybe you can work remote to have more time to spend with your child.
I feel your pain. My son is the same way, only he doesn't want me to ride the coasters lol
That is adorable. How old is she now?
oh that must be so cool, do you get to talk to your daughter often, maybe we can see eye to eye?
Did the girls do well?
That's wonderful!Math is really hard, I couldn't imagine doing it alone!
What kind of job?
I'm sure it's good you're looking for something so simple yet rewarding. I hope everything works out.
Were they from your childhood?
Those memories are sometimes the best.   Were they photos of your family or friends?
Why did he leave?
What happened?
Oh wow! Have you been doing it for a while? Do you feel prepared?
What kind of job is it for?
Creme frappacinos are amazing!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you eat the whole thing?
why is that
Aww, that's so sad. Why did she leave you?
Why did they miss your birthday?
Well, obviously, we are. But, we can still enjoy our time together. I guess.
How exciting! Do you feel like it went well?
Thats awesome. You are very lucky.
Oh my!  What happened??
I would have screamed!
Oh no! That is scary! I can imagine it must have really messed you up.
Good for you. I still don't know how to ride a bike.
Oh, wow! What was wrong with it?
Oh I have had those replace before. They take like 5 minutes at most. Not a big deal.
How old was she really
Why do people think they can steal things just to make a buck?
i am glad you married her! it's always a blessing and a curse
That is great. I am glad you married a wonderful partner.
That is horrible!  What did you do after she stole your ideas?
Oh, how did you reacted?
Are you excited about it?
That sounds cool. I like the sound of it, it's a good feeling to be in a new place and feel like you have a place to call home
I would have been too! What kind of car did you get?
Mustang is an awesome car.
Cats can be ridiculous! Was it a cat that you saw?
That is so funny! Poor cat!
I know what you mean. I'm in the exact same boat. At least we have the sun to thank for our vitamin D.
I feel ya. Atleast its raining wine. Maybe one day we will be able to go on a vacation haha!
wow, you are so confident, you must have studied hard for it
wow. you must be pretty confident. what makes you so confident?
Nice! How far in the past have you gotten her?
Aww, that's sad but it's a part of life I guess.
how long will it take her to get back?
Aww, that's hard! How long will it be for before she gets back?
I'm sorry to hear that! How old was your dog?
I am so sorry for your loss. How long did you have him?
Where was she gone?
That's awesome! I hope everything goes well for you and congratulations on 2 months!
Horrible movies give me so much anxiety! Were you scared by a particular movie or just the overall feeling?
I do not like scary movies
That's awesome! Where ya headed?
Wow, that's an amazing accomplishment! Where are you going for vacation?
That's great!  Where are y'all going?
wow. that will be fun
What did your guests eat?
What are you cooking up? I love trying out new things!
Was it that scary?
Did you enjoy it>
Wow that's really cool, how long were they you looking for them?
That is awesome!  What did you write each letter for?
Oh no! I do that way too often! What happened afterwards?
Yeah I get that way sometimes when im alone.  Were they really bad movies?
Why are you so proud?
That is a very nice thing to say!
How did he destroy it?
Wow that sucks! Did he just wreck it, and not even take credit for it?
What job are you starting?  I am very sure that you are excited but I am not positive.  I am sure you will do fine though.
I'm sure you will do fine! Do you start right away?
Oh yeah? Why were you worried about them?
Oh no that's too far. How far are they gone?
What are you doing there then?
What is a videogame?
Where did she land ya
That's sucks.  Where has she been?
What city are you going in too?
If the cost is just right maybe you can find something that you really love.  But if it's in a different city than you've already made the connection I see no reason to be nervous.  Just do it!
Wow! That was rude of them, did you give them any money for it?
Thats unfortunate. Did they help you move the department or just the department as a whole?
What movie was it?
What movie was it?
It really is,  is there anything like that where you live?
It sure is nice. Do you work for any of them?
Eww!  I guess some people aren't satisfied with just bread and butter?  Did you flip the table over?
Ew that's pretty gross! Why did you notice that?!
I bet that makes you happy! I rescue animals aswell and they are the most rewarding as dogs!
I bet he's a smart little pup!
Oh no! What happened?
I am sorry to hear that... does she have a new place already?
You should go and start a business, make enough money so you don't live in the ghetto!
That is annoying when someone does something they shouldn't be doing. Did you end up canceling the wedding?
Oh that sounds so frustrating! I am glad you weren't let down by their response though.
yes frustrating! It makes me want to leave all day long and never talk to you guys ever again.
I am with you on that. I work at a fast food joint and they always have difficult workers. I always find it frustrating as well because you have to do a lot of paperwork to work with them and it takes forever!
Where to? I have never left the US
Where did you go?
Oh no!  What happened?!  What was it that happened to?
Oh my gosh! What did it look like?
That's not very friend like.
Wow...thats not right!
That's cool. I usually procrastinate as well but I'm working right now so I can relate haha.
That's really lucky. I always tend to go through the same problem as you, but I think you've got it all planned out. I'm proud of you!
It happens to the best of us. I have not had one forget anything in the last 5 years
That's nice. Did you spend time reading or watching anything cool?
That's awesome! It's nice to have time for our relationship to shine, and to not have it be a chore to get it together!
Why is it not a big deal?
Yeah, i understand
What was it? I've avoided it at all cost!
I saw that movie too!  What was it about???  Did it scare you!!  I can't even watch it now after rewatching it.
I hear you! Have you ever tried a chirurgical pregnancy? My daughter is chirurgical and she had two pretty successful ones!
Oh wow! I didn't know you could do that! That's pretty interesting. How many kids do you want to have?
What book are you waiting for
Wow! What an awesome mom. What kind of book is it?
I agree. My husband and my mother in-laws have a strained relationship. My mother in law refuses to take my husband to the doctor's for check-up and my husband refused to get his checked up.
That is great to hear.  My in-laws are only a few miles apart, but they have both moved away.
You need to look at the big picture of life. He is not the father because he does not have the emotional attachment to the mom that you do. He is the product and the father because his work and life force is what defines the mom.
Maybe he's just a little homesick. Give it a few more weeks.
That is good! Surprise parties are the best!
You must really be anticipating something good.
That is nice to hear! What makes you grateful?
Sounds like you have a great wife!
Really? Because that seems pretty reasonable.
Yeah I understand how that goes
Why not? What was going on that night?
Why couldn't you go? That sounds like a bummer!
I can imagine.  I had a mommy issues when my daughter was young, I think it's normal for that.
I bet that is a relief to not worry about her missing!
What movie are you going to see?
I've never heard of it! What is that? A Halloween movie?
That's very sweet of you.  It's amazing how much some of the world's poorest people can help each other out by providing a warm body of water.  She is lucky to have you guys checking her out.
They are called life savers. They are great for people in desperate times.
What was the puzzle of?
That's cool.  I've been looking for a new quilt for my quilt.  Is it one you got for free?
That sounds like a very interesting drive! How did it go?
Was it beautiful? I always love driving through beautiful National Park places.
I'm glad you enjoyed your trip so much!
I'm so happy for you! I need to stop driving so much.
Well done! What are your specific plans as far as making money and doing the things that you've been doing?
Well that sounds really great! I hope everything works out for you!
Did he graduate?
Congratulations! That is awesome. You sound like a really big dad. How old is he?
That's great.  How much did you lose
I used to be afraid to go to the pool as a kid.
i agree on one hand but disagree on the other hahahaha. what made you feel that way?
I'm sorry to hear that, but I think it's important to remember the reasons behind your relationship. You can't get everything all or everything.
Really, that song is so relaxing, I love it!
That's an odd nostalgia trip for sure
Oh no. Did he do something bad?
Creativity is key. How long has he been a kid?
Haha, that must have scared you but I'm glad it worked out in the end
I think scary situations are totally possible in your basement! I'm sorry you had that happen to you!
what is frustrate
Yeah I understand what you mean. It really throws me off when they don't work for me
That's great that she has such a caring family.
That must be a relief to not have to carry any extra luggage.  It's nice that you guys can enjoy your time together.  What's the show?
Why's that
Just be confident that she will be nice if she changes her mind!  It's not too late!
that sounds disappointing! where was the nearest store?
Oh that sounds disappointing. I do not think it is healthy for you to go that far away from home.
I bet that makes you anxious, mine don't at all
Oh, that is terrible! Do you have any control over how much gas he can hold?
Well at least the baby is learning to sleep. That's one less baby trying to get into mommy diapers.
That must be frustrating.  How long will he be away?
Did anyone see you do it or did you figure it out on your own?
Haha.. that's funny. I once forgot my fly was down as well...Mom, get off my lawn!
I totally understand.  How are you coping today?
Aww, that is so sweet of him. I am sure he is having a wonderful time in his military apartment.
That's good.  I'm glad to hear that she's doing better!
I am so sorry to hear that.  She is lucky to be alive.
That's unfortunate.  Cats can be so annoying
Lol that's funny.  Poor kitty, I bet she didn't last very much
I'm sorry, that sounds really frustrating.  Do you have someone help you?
Why do you doubt yourself? Are you sure you want to continue?
What movie is it?
Oh wow! That sounds like a really good musical. What was the name?
That's crazy! Why did they call in sick?
I bet that was a difficult thing for you. Did it make you feel bad?
Oh no! I hope she is OK!
Oh that's awful! I'm so sorry you're having to deal with that.  I hope she gets to see you soon!
It's been a long move for me too! Did you buy a house?
That's fantastic! What made you decide to move?
I'm so sorry to hear that!
That's terrible, my girlfriend's cat used to be like that too. I don't know how our pet can live through something so horrific like that.
I know. I see so many people crying and needing help in the street. Makes me feel pity on them.
That is so nice of you.
What happened?
What a jerk! What did you do?
I guess they weren't thinking about how they would hurt her, I guess.
Yes I have and its hard but they dont realize it till theres a problem. I was tempted to marry my now fiance but I am no eunuch and am too shy to do it.
Jupiter is a great planet! I love the red giant though!
Jupiter is a great place to look
Congratulation
A new baby also means more responsibility and stress.  It's a good thing that your wife has decided to take the time away from raising the newborn to help the mother.
That is really sweet. Moms are the best
I'm so happy for you! It's so nice when you have great family members you can completely rely on.
where you garther than usual?
Where do you live that it takes so long to get to the store?
That is really exciting! I wish I could go on vacation too! What are you most excited for?
That's exciting! I've never stayed at a Disney property! Have fun!
I bet you worked hard for that class!
that's great. what are you planning on doing with your degree?
Really? What makes you so sure of it.
Those are nice gifts to have as kids!
What does he do at work?
Well that's nice. I hope he deserves it.
Dang! What kind of payday do you have coming up?
I hope you do too. It is a tough position to fill, but I believe in you
Congratulations! What kind of job is it for?
I have applied but I always get turned down. What is your industry?
oh really
That's cool man. Where do you guys go to meet her?
How'd it go after that?
Did he treat you well?
Oh no! That is heartbreaking! How old is your Keurig?
I feel your pain. I moved into a 1.5 million dollar mansion just so I could have one. Now I don't drive and have to buy another one every few years!
Oh wow! Why did that make you move?
That's good, where did you move?
wow thats so mean
That is so sad!
Wow, so sorry! I have the same disease and it is really, really sad!
Wow, poor kid. I hope he gets some help soon, that must be tough.
Were they upset about something?
That would have scared me.  Were they trying to sell something or perhaps visiting?
That's a good thing, how do you think it's going to go?
It sounds like you're ready to go, good luck! What is your test on?
Wow thats always fun. Did it make you happy?
That is wonderful that you have memories like that.  It's nice to be reminded of good times with them!
Oh no! How was that?
lol thats amazing... proposal flash back or what
How scary!  I'm glad your ok!
That sounds awful!  Did you get hurt or property damaged?
I bet she's going to be lots of puppy talkative!
that is so sweet!! i bet she is the cutest pup on the block
That's an interesting way to remember the name!
That's terrible! Did you call the police?
That is so awful! Did you file a complaint?
Wow I could have sworn I had heard one of those tonight....do tell
That is terrifying, I cannot even imagine!
That's awesome! I hope you do well
That's great! I hope you do well on your interviews! Are you nervous?
That's good, deep breaths breathe is the key to life!
Wow that sounds like a wonderful feeling! You must feel secure and at peace! What is your garden like?
That was nice of them. Was it a big blow?
Oh wow, that's nice of them. I wish more people would help each other.
that's awesome. what school did you guys go to? congrats btw. i went to tamiami.
Wow, good for him! He must have been so excited.
That's awesome! I've never been to Disneyland!
I have never taken a vacation to Disney World.  I am taking my 5 year nephew to Florida!
Oh no! Are you ok?
Oh no! I hope you were okay and not injured too bad.
Talk about unacceptable customer service! What did they do?
I feel your pain! At least they tried to listen
That's annoying
That's really not fair. I mean they should not be able to treat disabled people any differently just because they're different.
I bet. Was it a bad hurricane?
What caused the warning? I haven't heard anything like that since I was a little kid
That is so sweet and fortunate that he trusted you!
That sounds really sweet. What is the diamond ore for, again? I've never heard of such a thing!
That's nice of them! Do they enjoy tea parties?
That's a shame. Maybe they can make it accommodating for you.
I am excited for you!
That's so sweet! I am a mom, so I completely understand! What an exciting time of the year!
I'm sorry, I've been through it. It can be very scary.
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I recently went through some of the same stuff with mine.
Oh wow! That is very thoughtful of them. Happy Birthday to You!
Wow! I bet you were so thankful for that! It's always nice to get unexpected gifts on special occassions like that!
Did it make you nervous? or were you more prepared than you had been before? I'm sure if you practiced, it'll become a muscle memory that you'll get used to.
That's awesome! Studying really pays off!
What did he do to make you proud!
that's so cool, good for him!
What does he usually get?
What game is this?
Oh no, why was he not able?
Well, did he give you a reason? Maybe he is a shy guy.
Why do you feel confident about tomorrow?
I like days like that! They give off an amazing feeling
Oh no. How come?
I am sorry to hear about that.  Have you tried to have a talk?
Traveling is never easy.  I flew for the first time and was terrified!  How did it turn out?
That sounds like it would be a little scary. Where did you land in?
I'm so sorry. That is so sad... I hope things will work themselves out.
I know the feeling. Do you have a significant other?
wow, that sounds really awesome!  What kind of graphic did your computer get?  I'm guessing they found one that looked decent and then made it into one that you could actually play on!  What was your most memorable moment was making that computer?
Well its good that they were able to get you into the computer side of things.
That's cool!  How much money did you win?
That's cool! What level of play was it?
I'm the same! I'm never too far from a spider. Do they bother you in the real world?
I hate them too! They are so big and slithery!
yes they sure do. I used to love playing them on my Nintendo 64
I agree, what is your favorite video game to play now?
that's annoying. did they fix the orders after you complained?
That's frustrating. I bet if you corrected it they'd forgive you eventually.
How many people do you have?
That sucks
How fast is he?  Is that even a real thing??
That's cool that your son is growing so quickly. Does he run well, too?
Oh my god. I'm so sorry to hear that. Cancer is such a horrible disease!
that is so sad, I hope she pulls thru
I can only imagine, graduation is a very big event.
Oh that must've felt amazing to accomplish. Congratulations!
Was the other driver okay
That's too bad. Are your cars in good shape though?
Tornadoes can be pretty scary, have you been in one before?
Oh wow, I would have thought you'd want to stock up before that!
Wow! What an awesome surprise! How much did she give you for it?
That was so wonderful of her! She sounds like an amazing person.
That's great! How long have you been married?
That is an amazing story. How old are you?
That is so awful!  I hope it didn't actually do anything bad to you!
oh god..that had to be so awful! I am so sorry! How awful to be robbed at a time like that! I am glad you returned the things you stole
I'm with you on that one! Have you gone to the pet store to try and buy some snakes?
That's terrifying! I'm glad to hear you made friends with a friend who was brave enough to help you out.
Why did she leave?
That's too bad. Are things going better for you now that she left?
How was it? Out of group or with a group?
Yeah I can understand. It's scary to go alone for sure!
That is so wonderful!  23 years is a long lasting marriage - so wonderful!  Are you having any children?
It is very hard to find true love.  But, you are married it seems.
how come?
What party do you have planned?
That is great! What do you have been doing?
how much longer do you have to keep going?
That is great. How long have you been with her?
That's a long time. How did you guys get to that stage in life?
Holy cow, that's awesome! I never win either! I need to start playing the lottery!
Wow! That is a fantastic feat! I never win either! But I still love winning! How did you do it?
That's really nice of her!
I think its just a way for her to show that she is the one who raised you.  Maybe you just don't understand?
That's too bad. Maybe you could plan to do it the next summer, when the weather starts to change.
I would have loved the rain too! I live near the beach and it's always so beautiful there during the summer. You're very lucky!
Oh that's cool! What was the position?
Congratulations on getting this opportunity! What kind of job was it?
Oh no!  Was it a nice mud puddle or a bad one?
Oh no!  That's terrible!!  I've been there done that before!  Did you get soaked?
are you happy with that? i mean it sounds kind of boring
Do you enjoy single nights?
Wow, that sounds exciting! How far are you guys from each other?
Wow, an overseas move sounds like so much fun! But I'm sure the weather will be bad!
oh me too...that's a horrible thing to happen
I agree, I don't understand why some people get so worked up about other people getting married! How do they treat other people?
When does it come out?
Heck yeah, that's my favorite cartoon! Who is your favorite character?
My mom has told me about this. I hate it when people do it in public.
I am the same, i can barely contain the force when i fart.
Oh wow! He must have a super heart.
That is very sweet. I am very sure you deserve this ring!!
I agree. I see people throw their beer cans all the time in the city.  It's terrible!  Does your city have any dedicated enforcement team?
That is the worst, when you are trying to help someone but they just throw it all around you!
I am as well. What makes you feel afraid?
That sounds super exciting!  I bet that was exciting for both you and the person being rescued!
I'm sure the interview was long and the wait was no big deal! Did they call you back for another interview?
That's awesome. It takes a while to build that anticipation in the interview. I'm glad you did it.
i really want to go to disneyland, what is your favorite place in the area?
That sounds amazing! I haven't been to Disneyland in over 15 years! My favorite coaster is still in operation! Do you like it?
That's awesome! what kind of car is it?
Nice! what kind of car did you get?
That's nice of them, how much are they paying?
That's very kind of them!
That's a good thing. Most of us don't take anything for free, it drives me crazy.
Wow. Did you get in trouble?
That must have been aggravating! Did she get a beat down?
What do you think you are going to do when you are waiting?
Oh geez! Me too - but I think it's just because they've never had to actually wait for something to actually happen than just hop on a bus or something. Makes me feel like a slob! But then again, I'm an introvert and an out of towner so... I never thought much
Aww, that stinks! Hopefully soon though because that's where he was before and it's where you were when you last spoke?
I'm so sorry you're going through this. Have you asked him about it?
That's awesome! It's goal achieved and accomplished in one convenient step!
I do agree with you there, I try not to be envious!
I feel the same way! Why can't people be nice to animals!
I'm glad that you have a voice and can voice your opinions! I don't understand why people can't take a hint not to be cruel to others...
What college?
That's awesome that you have that special day. What college did you attend?
What tv did you get?
That's awesome! What provider do you have it on?
It's wonderful you have a good friend like that.
That sounds so sweet of you! How has she been coping?
I agree with that too
Yes I agree. There is nothing more important than making our government great again
That must have felt really isolating.  How did you end up doing once you got out of the house?
I bet that was very lonely!  Did you get used to not having anyone to talk to?
What happened to your dog Kat?
I'm so sorry to hear about your dog. I had a black lab who passed away recently too. They really are great pets. What breed was she?
What's he doing so well?
That's amazing, congrats
What abuse are you referring to
That is very sad. I have had that happen once before as a parent who really wanted their dog back!
Oh no, did the hostiles start following you?
that's cool.  I haven't been back to los Angeles in about 8 years
Aw, that's sad. I know what you mean. Pets are really precious and they become a part of the community.
Aww, I love animals! They're so sweet.
i hope he starts to get better!
Oh my gosh that's so awful! I can relate, my girls get irritated when they have to get their teeth pulled and it is horrible for them!
Oh no. Maybe he could take some melatonin.
Oh no I bet it's painful and hard! I have two children and the first time I put a diaper on I almost passed out! But you are right it's so much easier when the first time is just like waking up!
Wow. Have you asked them where they are?
Have you seen them in a while, by yourself or on vacation?
I am so glad we have the technology to travel
Was it a good lunch?
That was nice of them.
I do too! I get so anxious just staring at other drivers!
brakeslamming brakes sucks!
Yeah, I get scared of the dark a little, too. What do you think it is?
I think most people feel the same, even if it's not as bad as the movies make it out to be.
That is awesome. I wish I had more people like you.
You sound like a great person
Wow, that sounds like it was very unfortunate, did you find out why?
Oh wow, that is scary! I bet you were very worried. I would have been if my power did that too. Glad candles helped you figure it out.
Oh no, did you ask her to leave the furniture by itself, or to replace it?
I am sorry to hear that.
That must of been so disgusting!
Oh my god, that is crazy! Did anyone else hear this happen to them?
That is nice, it is very calming listening to rain.
That does sound like a nice sound
Oh my gosh! Are you ok?
Oh no that's so awful. Were you okay, or are you still messed up?
I've never played video poker before. I think I would like it, though.
I would have been way too drunk to even try that lol.
Definitely! I visited a month ago and really had a blast! I was shocked at just how much things change around the city each year! Makes it feel smaller than it really is!
That sounds amazing! I live right outside of New Orleans and it is a pretty awesome city! I'm so happy you guys made it out there!
Yes, what a terrible situation.
Oh wow that is horrible! Are you ok financially? That sounds like a real low blow.
Sorry?
Thanks for the apology!  I'm not that mean!
Why did you go on a homestead anyways?
I don't think I know where you live. Here in the U.S., we don't have a absurd amount of toilet paper, yet somehow we managed to get so much worse than the U.K.
How do you think it went? Are you nervous?
Sounds like a good presentation. How long did it take?
Of course. It's not a fun situation. But it's happened. I'm not sure I want to go into it too much detail. What do you mean?
I totally know what you are talking about. I had a roommate who was a terrible girlfriend. Her husband was cheating on me and I saw him cheating on me too. I was beyond devastated.
That's wonderful! I have never been able to do that!
that's amazing! you are lucky to have her!
Did you go to the kitchen and fix it?
I bet that was a nice feeling
Oh yeah? What are your plans?
that's a great feeling, huh? I'm sure they're excited to go school shopping together.
That is why its best if stores get really busy during holidays.
That's never a good thing to hear! What was going on? Hopefully you didn't take it too personally?
What flavor of cookie was it
Awesome! Congratulations! That's such a satisfying feeling, especially coming up with new things to buy!
That's wonderful!  The worst thing that can happen is people getting mad at you for not doing your job well, and that's never fun for either parties involved.
I can imagine.  It is so nerve wracking and annoying.  I am glad you are getting it all done though.
Oh yeah! I have to do the same thing this week! It's so nerve-wracking and it makes you feel like you're not getting what you want!
Oh my god! Did it jump on you!
Oh my god! You have such a temper! Were you scared?
I'm not a fan either, but why too much? Were there too many people, too? Were there too many jokes made at the end?
I would have totally been in their seats screaming and running.
How large is he usually getting?
What are your plans?
What a nice person he must have really got that from you
Wow...that's crazy. But you did the right thing.
Oh no, do they still make fun of you at parties
Oh no! How embarrassing! I bet everyone forgot about it.
I am not great with math either
I can understand that, I am not great at math.
Did she want to make you believe something was really up with you?
awe is it a kitten?
What made you decide to do that?  In a good or bad way
Wow, congratulations! That sounds like a lot of fun. You should be proud.
That is horrible! I'm so sorry! What will you do?
Oh man! What are you waiting for?
That's kinda mean.
That's such an awful feeling! Maybe you both can meet up online?
I used to like growing up, not so much after seeing the gross mutilation of adult life.
I used to love playing video games but Ive been busy with work
I'm the same way!  They're so much fun during the holidays but theroid is the best in the winter
That is a shame, but I suppose we can always look forward to them coming back soon.
What are you going to study
I'm an engineer as well! I'm a computer science major. What about you?
What have you got going on?
What does the medal look like? A fat ole manly bummed face, or happy, or sad?
My little brother is getting better and better, Is this a sign of things coming  together?
I love bowling. I used to when I was little but I haven't been in forever. Maybe it's time to get back in too it
that is really creepy, is there someone else in the house?
Oh my god. Have you called animal control?
You can learn to do it better, I'm sure
That's ok. You can always improve!
Oh my goodness. I would feel awful bad too. You don't have to tell anyone, but you can't just let it ruin your friendship over something like this!
Sometimes, it's just best if you keep it secret for awhile.
Aw, that's sad, maybe you can move back?
I am sure you miss your family.
I remember when mine were first offered they had to wait a couple weeks approval.  I believe its much better for them to be rushed now rather than later.
That does sound hard, but if you have the time you should be able to get through it.
It's good to have the time ahead to make sure you do everything you want to do.
College sucks! I hope everything works out for you!
That's awesome! What did you have?
I'm glad you had a great meal and a good night! Pizza's are so much fun!
Aw, I'm sorry. That sounds painful and really hard to deal with. I can only imagine the agony you're going through.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope he'll recover!
What game is that?
Oh I've never played that before! Have fun mowing lawns or building castles!
That is not good.  Have they tried to have a peaceful talk about it
That is so annoying! I'm glad you work with parents who are good
I hate powerouts! Especially when it's raining.
I live in Florida, so we deal with power outages a lot.  We lost one tonight, and it was just as bad as the ones we had last year!  Luckily I live close enough to the house that we didn't have to deal with it, but it was still very scary!
That's great when it's pay off.  homework?  what's that?
That's good. I am in the same boat. I am getting the same amount of homework as the last semester but I am having so much fun.
Oh that's cool! What kind of music?
What kind of memories did they remind you of?
What kind of bowler?
Thats cool. I would be so proud of my brother too
Why's that? Must be pretty scary.
Well I wish luck and success with your new job! What kind of desk is it?
That's a bummer, but I've done it before so you never know
They are going to have a talk with you. Mistakes happen but if you had the correct information they would not have been so big of a deal to you.
Ah, that's always hard when you don't see them for a few days. Were there any cool aspects to the trip?
That's cool. Maybe I should do the same.
Well, that's exciting for him! But a little sad for you.
I would be so excited for you.  Maybe its for the best.
Get researching what kind of payment plan you want and then try to research what payment options you want.
I understand that completely. It's scary to think what other drivers might do to you!
I saw one try to take a can of RAID on my way to work. It was horrifying!
Oh wow. Gas cans are very destructive tools for a lot of people.
That's awful. Are you able to start things up for tomorrow? Hopefully something similar will come around
That's too bad, are you planning to sell it or keep it for a collection?
Me too, especially in front of people.
I totally get you.. It is a very social situation.. I have social anxiety too
wow that does not sounds pleasant!
lol i dont think dogsitters are that hard.
Did you say anything?  Did you say anything?
Haha, that would be embarrassing.
What textbooks do you need?
That's awesome! What are the books he got you?
I bet. Those who finish before the service are often called invalids
That's great! What was it like?
That sounds awesome. What kind of car did you get?
Awesome, what kind of car did you get?
Why is that exactly? Do you think it's unhealthy for you to see them smoking or just that you don't like their smoking?
Why is it so bad now?
I know right? It is so uncomfortable.
I am sorry that you had to experience that.
That is so sad! Are they ok?
That is terrible, I cannot imagine how you feel.
Oh my gosh! Really! Why do you have to flushing the toilet so often?!
Flush the toilet at your house. Problem solved.
what do you plan to do to become such an owner?
What sport are you talking about?
What happened if I may ask.
I love riding rollercoasters! They are so much fun! Did you have a good time?
That was thoughtful of them! Did you get lots of presents?
That's pretty cool.  It's nice when the older you are, the simpler the things seem
Oh no, I bet that was scary! Did she end up choking on the carrot herself, or was it the other end?
Oh no!  Did anyone help you pull her back up after she choked?
That would make me nervous, what about calling them to see what the issue is>
did they at least give you a little cash for the inconvenience?
Being a mom I understand.  Sometimes it is good to be a littleggy and just lay in
Beach day?
Oh, no! Did anything happen or did you figure it out?
Haha that must have taken a while to piece together! Sounds like something out there in your neighborhood?
That is a great stress in your body! Was it hard?
That's too bad. What was your presentation about? I'm glad your stomach felt so full!
Sorry for the loss.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that! My aunt is getting better everyday. I hope she still has some great years left!
That is awesome, It is nice to feel confident.
Cups are always good.  That's great news.  What kind of coffee did you get?
that's awesome. It always feel like you have so much more room to tool around
Multi tools are awesome. Are they useful in the kitchen? As in how to properly apply, or how to use them?
Congratulations!  What position is it?
that sounds exciting, are you nervous?
What kinda car is it?
Oooh I really like the new SUV platform! You must love the car
Wow, 6 years is coming to an close. Did you graduate 6 years?
What college you went to
Good life is a great place to be!
You're so lucky! I need some pancakes too now. What kind of sausage did you have?
Emergency? What happens if an emergency come up? Do you have a boat?
Emergency money is always nice. What kind are you saving?
What changed your view?  I'm curious.  Is it something that you're excited to get out of the ordinary, or that you're excited to see birth?
Thats awesome.  Congratulation
That's great!  cruises are so much fun!  Where are you guys headed to??
That's really cool. Where is the cruise headed?
That's awesome. Is she working hard to get better at everything?
She must be a pretty good driver.
Well that was nice of her!
I would be sad too. Why didn't they invite you?
I am sad that your parents didn; t attend my birthday No, they just are not want to come to it
That sounds relaxing!  What do you usually do that time?
I love watching tv with the dogs too. We have an old country show that I love to watch as well!
Wow! Did you have them for a while?
Oh thank god! That's a relief! Did you have the wedding at some fancy restaurat?
That's a good strategy.
That is adorable.
Where has she been
I am sure you will get through it.
dad's are awesome like that!
Aww that is really cool of him. Did he get a good feel of your stuff?
Aw :( I know how that feels. I hope she'll be back soon to visit?  What did you do?
I bet you will get through it.
Oh no. What happened?
What an extremely heated exchange? A fight where people are fighting over silly things? I hope both people are okay!
I'm glad he got well! Did you guys get well, too?
That's a good thing.Love and health are more important than money sometimes!
Why? Is it because they think they are being patient or maybe you are anxious about them in general
I do that too, it's annoying
Dogs are the best! What kind do you love the best?
Oh I'm happy for you! It's good to find someone who can love animals!
aww.. that's sucks. How old is your cat now?
Oh no! I'm so glad it didn't end worse for her! I had to have an ancer repaired in my other cat and it ended up worse for me because it was more healing process. I hate cats that are too clingy.
gas station? that sounds awful
gas station? that's awful. shooting in a store? even more so.
I'm sorry to hear that, how long did you have it for?
Oh no I'm sorry, how was he?
How come you alone so much?
I am very lonely also.
Wow.  That's cool!   Is that even legal though?
That's awesome!  I wish I had a new car.  I have an old clunker from the 90s that still works... runs good as new.  It's nice to have the peace of mind to just not worry about payments on bills and worry about making money on the side hustle.
Why is that?
Oh wow that's quite the distance, are they busy or do they not have time to make it?
Disgust? What is wrong with your cooking?
That's a shame, what kind of food was it?
Oh no, did it leave you feeling guilty?
Oh no! Did you ever end up apologizing?
That's awesome! It sucks that you had to use your sister for sick days though, was she able to do anything about it?
That is very nice of her! You must have felt very lucky that day.
Who was it?
Haha, that would be the worst worst thing ever. I rescue, so if I were you I'd be running around in circles trying to figure out where it came from! What did it sound like?
That was so nice of her! What kind of a car?
That's awesome! My mom got me a Ford raptor! What a lovely surprise!
I'm sure they're not the only ones. Why do you feel ashamed?
I'm so sorry, that must be hard.  Do they think it is because of you?
Oh no. What happened?
Friends don't pull pranks. They pull on someone else.
Were you? How was it?
Horrible, was it a scary movie at least
Where did they go?
Wow, that's a big place to be for family! Cuba is one of my favourite places to visit!
Why do you think that is?
Why wouldn't she want to do that?
Awh, that's terrible. What movie is it?
Oh no that's sad! I hope you get to go soon enough!
i love taking the time to relax as well. it's hard for me to put off house work for long periods of time
That's great! The perfect weather is the best.  Was it nice and clear, or was it rainy and hailing?
wow that is so fun! where are y'all going??
Caribbean islands...I have never heard of them...I am so jealous, how many people do you have?
uhoh, did someone call the poison hotline?
I have had such bad chocolate problems in the past. Did you have any left?
That's great!  Cancer free? That's incredible!  How long did it take to completely remission, and how long did he battle the disease?
That's fantastic news! Cancer isn't something that's easy.
That's just crazy! Do you think he is crazy?
Wow, that's a real "gotcha." I'd be frustrated as well.
Those butterflies can be really bad! Just stay positive!
That's great! I'm sure you'll do great!
That's not nice.  Have they talked to you about it recently?
Tell them to be quiet and maybe try to have a conversation.  If it bothers them go to their room
I am sorry, how did it happen?
That sounds so sad. You must feel terrible and lonely.
No I dont. But its a huge relief for my marriage and my life
I do have children. Yes I attend college. And no I do not attend college.
I'm so sorry for your father, but it's good to hear that he has some great friends who he had no clue about. Life changing illnesses are really tough.
I know what you mean.  Its hard when you are not sure how much time will pass by.  Life really does seem to mirror itself, doesn't it?
16th? That's young! What happened?
That's so crazy! Did it make you cry, too?
That's awful. I hope it didn't lead to something more serious.
That sounds awful.  What was it?
oh wow! Thats crazy! What did he look like, if you don't mind me asking?
That's really awesome of you.  I've never had the luck to be that lucky.
Where did ya'll go?
That sounds amazing! I hope we get a good turn around for our vacation, too!
Oh no! That would be horrible. I tripped over that too last year when tripped over an old tree branch. It hurt!
That happens to everyone lol
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! I have lost many pets over the years and know the feeling very well.
Oh, I'm so sorry! I know how you feel, I lost a dog years ago and its still hurting!
What did he do?
4 yrs old?  Does he have good motor control?
Do you sneak it in so you don't get noticed? Or are you just a regular mom and just want some company?
Why do you sneak it out? sneak what?
At least the baby hasn't started to eat.
At least you have a roof over your head and some comforts. That is a positive right?
Congratulations! That's awesome. What is she nursing in school for?
That's amazing! nursing is such an amazing career!
That sounds like you really love your birthday! Was it a surprise, or was it a happy birthfay?
Thats sweet! Congrats buddy!
That sounds like a fun project! Did you find anything in there?
That's very nice memories you have there! Did you find any good things in the box?
AC is so hot where you live? I can barely go to 70!
I hate when I wake up and the AC is broke. That's the worse part.
That is awesome! Are you all going to be able to stay together?
Awesome! I can't imagine being in a situation where my situation is any better! I hope you guys do well
That is awesome! running is such a stress relief
I used to play tennis but never played it competitively. I'm doing crossfit now and love it!
Oh no! What was the occasion?
That is so sweet!! I bet he felt so good!
Really, since when you were born
Oh wow, that's fantastic news! I'm so happy to hear that and your husband's success is really inspiring. What kind of job did you apply for?
Time flies. Is she your only child?
That is so exciting!
Did you call the police?
Wow that's a crazy thing to do. Is your house damaged at all or is it just hard to see in the lightening storms?
Awww, that is so sweet!
Sweet baby. Enjoy his early life. He is not going to change unless he wants too.
That happens to the best of us
Stacking is key.
Why? What's wrong?
That's a bummer!  You should definitely do it!
That sounds like so much fun - and of course you must have so much fun planned. How old are your kids?
I love the beach! How many kids do you have?
Awesome! What typeof dog is she?
That is awesome.  My dog is getting potty trained too.  I love how their dogs look up at you and they know you are worried about them lol
Aw, I know how you feel! How is it holding up?
That's great. Maybe your family should visit too?
That's cool, I like soccer. Do you play in the league?
You are the best.  You are a player that everyone wishes they could be.
That's terrible. You need professional help.
Well I hope that it gets better.
wow thats terrible, i hope it wasn't for the worst! were you okay?
I'm so sorry to hear of your father's passing. It's very painful for a child to watch their grandparents go through this, I know. My mother was in a very similar situation.
Junk food makes you healthy right? It's healthy if you avoid sugar and meat! If you don't eat it all the time, it's just as healthy.
Hey, if she can do it all by herself, why shouldn't you?
That's horrible! I would be so upset if that were me
That is terrible, I would be so upset
Oh, that's mean. Did it wake you up?
I bet that was a surprise
That is such a huge step. It's potty training that will make him a very well mannered person!
I know that feeling of becoming an uncle!  My son is 3 1/2
what happened?
That's really annoying. I hope you got your money. What concert was it?
That's always a bit disappointing. What did they end up doing instead?
Are you going to tell them the bad things happened?
What exactly happened to make it so bad?
That's awesome! You must be quite proud of yourself :)
Wow, that's quite a feat! You must be very proud. I couldn't even imagine.
Wow, that's quite the feat! What are you the most passionate about?
Oh man! I am so jealous of you!  What is the worst that can happen?
Oh man, that's the worst! What kind of computer is it?
yes several times.
Oh wow, that must have been humiliating! I hope you had plenty of coffee to calm your bowels!
Did you get on it after a while?
That's so sad. That would make me so sad too!
Sure does. It can feel like you wasted potential sometimes.
Rainy days are the best days
That's unfortunate.  What is the treatment for it?
Oh my goodness! I can't even imagine what that is like! I hope you have someone to confide in right now!
Yeah I love those too
That sounds awesome. I used to love the old republic command and conquer movies. They have gotten so old.
That sounds like fun! Did you have a good time?
I bet she loved that.
Where are you from originally. I'm Filipino.
Oh, that's so sweet! I'm sure you cherish having a watch from him like he would always love to have a hand giving!
Thats really sweet of you. I hope to one day get the same kind of memories from my father.
I can see why that might be difficult
Oh my, did she take you out drinking with her?
I thinkights are great! Are you always alone?
i am glad that you don't afraid to heights, i mean i'm scared i wouldn't make it to them at all
Sounds wild! What do they usually do in the crowds?
That does sound scary
Aww man, that sucks man. I'm sorry.
That's really sad to hear about that but also to hear stories like this. Are you guys distant now?
Me too! Did something happen to make you think so?
October scares me to death. I think I would pass out! LOL. Maybe if I'm being honest with you..I'm still pretty young and haven't had a decent amount of sleep since Halloween, so I don't really know much about them.
Why don't you get a dog
How do yo feel about that? Maybe she should consider seeing a counselor?
How cool. Did you go and check it out yourself or were you just happy to see it?
That sounds fun! Did you have a lot of fun playing?
That's fun! Do you have any kids?
That's awesome! Have you been having a boy for a while, or is this your first?
That's cool. Where ya headed for your vacation?
Universal Studios is a blast! Have you gone there many times?
That's unfortunate, where did she go
Oh that is depressing. Why were you alone?
Did you do well in the class?
Thats great! Did you already have all the answers down?
I'm sure she missed ya'll
That is really bad timing. Are you ok? What happened to your car.
That's a good thing. A lot of people would be happier if their lives were less stress.
thats nice
That is good news are you happy now?
That is awesome. Im happy to hear that! Im sure that you got a great answer!
Some people are just born winners.
People can be really random like that. I'm glad for you and the pool guy!
That's unfortunate.  Were you able to find another internship?
That's too bad. You must feel disappointed about that, but maybe there will be another opportunity that you're interested in pursuing.
That is the best feeling.  I am grateful for it.
What things do you want for the baby to be gifted?
That's great! What is she going to school for?
That's great to hear, I'm really happy for your family as well!
I can understand being lonely
I can understand that
That is disgusting. What are you going to do about it/
That's pretty gross! I wonder what got her in the situation to have that happen
A who, may I ask? Are you having a boy or girl?
That is awesome, I have a boy on the way aswell.  How many kids do you have now?
That was very nice of them!  You must have felt very happy and relieved!
Was it a nice surprise?
That must've been exciting. Were you afraid?
Wow that sounds wonderful!  Did you take lots of pictures?
Where did she fly?
Where were her parents?
Why is that
Why do you not trust people?
Wow!  That's nuts!!!  I would be livid if it were me!!!
Wow! I'm impressed you got it running for that cheap!
Congratulations! Boy or girl?
Congratulations! I'm happy for you! When is he?
Wow! That's awesome! Where did you guys on your trip?
Wow! Where did you go?
What a jerk
That is disappointing.  I hope that she wasn't upset about the shirt being returned.  It was probably for good reason.
Congratulations! What is the name?
wow that is so awesome! congrats
That sounds like so much fun! How were you the entire time?
Wow that does sound like a lot of fun! I've always wanted to go tubing!
Did you have to run away? That is a horrible dog
That is terrible, I know the feel, my friend's dog is a 19 year old Spanish Bichon Friseoise. They say chihuahuas have high anxiety so I'm guessing he was stressed about his life. It's sad to lose such a sweet dog.
Wow, I am sorry to hear about that. Do you have other women?
That is terrible. I am sorry.
What happened?
That would make me mad, did he get a warning?
Congratulations! I am sure you will be an awesome parent! You have my genes :)
Congratulation! I am so thrilled for you!
Oh my god. That's absolutely devastating. I am so sorry. That's one the hardest drugs I've ever tried to get through, and it's one I've never tried before.
That is terrible, I feel sorry for your friend, I hope he has a long life
What kind of band was it?
What a strange turn of events. How did you feel when you saw her playing?
Really, what makes you so sure?
I would have screamed as well!  I can remember being scared out of my mind when I was trapped in an elevator.  What a crazy feeling!
Congratulations. Are you in a new home?
That's great!  I wish I had a swimming pool!  You must be so happy!
Did you still have work?
Oh wow! That's crazy!  Did it take long at all?
Did he get chosen to speak at that church?? That's awesome!
That sounds very interesting! What was his original message, and how was it received by the church?
I know exactly what you mean!  It's the worst!  Do you ever remember the first time?
What do you repeat?
That sounds like fun! I love doing movies too. What kind of movie do they want to see most?
That sounds so great! I love pizza!
I can understand the stress, what are you going for
What are you studying?
Oh. Sorry to hear. I hope you find something soon.
I'm sorry. I know how hard it is to feel like that.
Was it a scary sketchy part of town?
Yeah I don't like sketchy areas either. What kind of job did you pick up?
Uh oh! Did she get upset with you for it or were you trying to be nice?  I hope it wasn't too hard to fix, it happens.
That's good that you followed the recipe and didn't get too irritated with her
That's a good thing. Are you moving for a new home?
That's so awesome!  I'm moving in with my sister next week!  affordable apartment?  yay
That is good, were you worried you might not have enough?
They are definitely giving you back a little bit. That is wonderful.
Oh no! Sorry to hear! I've never been to an event like that so I'm not really judgey
Oh no, that's terrible. Did he take it the other way?
That's amazing! Congratulations! I know you must be very proud of him!
That is so exciting! You must be so happy for him!
Customer service is so important. Did you say something to them?
Customer service is so important. You must have a very good relationship with them if they would do that!
Why is that? Do you always look through your mirror at the moment?
I'm sorry you're so lonely.  Are you always lonely or do you have people around you a lot?
Is it a pleasurable experience?
i love doing that too. i can't swim though :(
Good of you. I love soup.
Aww I love soup. That's so nice you guys took care of her!
Yes. No family can do that for you.
I'm so grateful to my family They help me with whatever I need and they are always supportive!
Oh that must have been awesome!
That's nice that you have such a good parents! Was it your birthday or a party?
Oh no, that's awful. I hope no damage was done.
Oh wow. I guess it was really lucky for you to not die during that storm
Congrats! How big is she now? :)
You're very welcome! I can't believe no one else would show her some love!
Oh no. Why are they leaving?
That's awful. How did they leave you?
oh, flaunting is a good way of putting people in your shoes. I hope he really appreciates the good job and can quit his bad habit.
I feel you.My brother is doing the same thing. He is 17 and has a good job, but he also seems to be getting more interested in female strippers. I don't think he is very well off yet.
I hate when my food had a hair in it too!  What does that mean??  Did you put the food in a hair dryer??
That is not cool.  What did they forgive you?
Did it make you ride a lot of rides? theme parks are always stressful for me as well.
They are really well made! Did you ride any?
I hate when friends make fun of me.  What did he say to you?
That is rude!
I'm sorry to hear you feel lonely.  I have the same feeling- I hardly have social media anymore :(  Do you have any outside friends?
I understand, but don't feel scared, talk to people!
How come? Is everything okay?
Well you should have no issues with that
Horrible film! Why was it so scary!!
Horrible! I bet that was hard! What was the movie about?
I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass?
I'm so sorry.  I've lost both of mine, so I know the feeling of losing someone.  What happened?
why what happened?
She might just be an enabler.
Sounds lovely! Did you make any special gift?
Sounds amazing! I love the sound of rain, especially when it's hot.
I feel the exact opposite.  Its the exact opposite of what they would want to do
I feel the same way. It's very rude and annoying.
That's so nice! How many people do you have?
That is really nice to have. Do they enjoy eating together?
I bet you were happy! What were they doing to surprise you?
Was it your first time?
I know the feeling. I wish people didn't treat each other so so so poorly. Have you had a experience like this recently/
Where is it headed? I can not afford all of my bills.
Why is that
I am sorry you feel that way.  Try not to be jealous too much!
Was the television working?
Wow! Did it eat the wires? That would explain a lot, since those are the cheap parts, and they're the cheap wires, too! What do you plan on doing about it?
That would be annoying! Have you told her?
Oh wow. Maybe she thought you were being rude. I would tell management too.
Why do people get in trouble?  Are they doing it for the wrong reasons?
I'm sorry, that must suck to have that happen sometimes.
That's awesome. I hope you enjoy your new job and have an awesome experience!
Congratulations! I am sure you are excited to begin your career too.
I know.  I always dread going there
It's definitely painful.  What's worse is when you have to wait in lines.  The dentist gives you one extra payment for being so close!
That's great! Does he know what kind of job it is?
Yeah, I can relate. It takes quite some luck, and I'm sure if you work hard at it, you can achieve it too!
hahahaha good one!
That's baseball! That is exciting!
That is very exciting! I am glad you had fun watching it!
Nice, what year?
Those seem like good choices. You're very lucky
I would have died too!
That is terrifying. I am glad he closed it
That's awesome, what type of cheesecake was it
That's a shame. Scottish cheeses are typically expensive so that had to be a pain to get a hold of.
Interesting! I have no idea where either of those places comes from. I will definitely be on the lookout!
People are so much more open and helpful here than in other places I have lived. Mustangs are so easy to steal from, too! I'm surprised cabott isn't more popular
Oh man. Sorry to hear that. Was he in an accident or was he in the course of his life when he died. Either way it still sucks.
Oh man. Sorry to hear about that.
time for Plan B
Lightening is the worst... atleast its not going to rain
did you enjoy it?
That's cool. It can really kick your butt when you have time to spend time with them after a long week of work.
I bet that was fun! What did you do after you unwinded?
That sounds great! I love swimming! Did you have to get up really early for it? I hope it didn't get to hot to swim in!
How so
I do not like how our country is divided either. I hope things get better for you, too.
Sorry for the delay but I have a very similar situation in my life and it's really rough too. Just got back to work and it's so very tough still.
sorry to hear that, thats very sad
Why do you think that? Is there something in the water?
Oh that is sad. Do they visit you often at least?
That sounds fun, what band?
No, I don't. Who are they?
That's good, it can sometimes be a lot to handle
I would be a mess. I'd switch again
Oh wow! Did you make any changes for school yearbooks?
I imagine it is a lot to prepare for, do they enjoy the class?
Was it a good idea at least? I've always wanted to go to Outer Banks National Park!
Did it turn out to be worth the trip?
I've only been to one and it sucked! I'm sure you are happy about it.
Wow! How much did you pay for?
That's really awesome. How much is the prize?
That is really good for him!
That's awesome! How much is it and where does he go to get it?
How was that?
That's awesome. It's always good when a parent can just go buy a "good" house and not have to ask for help from anyone else!
That's the worst! Have they been wanting to eat together?
Everyone likes what they like right? If they won't agree then that's their loss and you can go ahead and do it that way, it's not a big deal!
You might be on to something there.  You might be saving a lot of money too
Me too! Do you have any plans for Friday?
I have one day off this week and then I have two days off this month! I love those offs.
That sucks. Have you asked to fight against your friend?
That sucks. Have they talked to you about it?
Oh that's terrible! I hope your doctor was able to give you some treatment options.
I am sorry to hear that! I hope the diet works for you!
Wow, I can't even imagine how awful it must have felt. I'm glad you're safe though. Do people there live in your neighborhood?
Tornadoes are one of my worst fears!  Are you ok?
How nice! Have you been looking forward to it for a while? Did he pick out some cool ones?
That's awesome! Did he get you one when it broke? That is awesome!
Me too! What is ornamentation like?
I'm guessing she isn't coming back to town this year?
That's really sweet of her!  What makes her so special?
That's great. It's nice that you have someone like that.
that stinks, i hope we can get another chance soon!
Was the drive fun at least? How old is your daughter now?
That is great! He has to make do with what he has.
That is great news. He must have really worked hard.
Thats good,kids can grow up to so many emotions
That's fair, being with a good child should make you very happy and content!
Oh my! What was the secret?
Is there a way out of it?
I do not believe you
Oh my gosh that's hilarious! I would be terrified! What did the intruder do after he left?
That sounds nice
That's really nice. You guys sound very happy.
oh no. that's horrible. what breed?
I'm so sorry to hear that. That's so heart breaking and I wish you all of our best
Sometimes we do things for a reason. I guess I'm one of those people.
Sometimes, in situations of emotional distress, it makes the situation worse. It's hard for us to see our friends getting in a bad spot when we haven't seen them in awhile and we haven't seen them for a long time, especially if they're close like parents. It's hard to see a loss like that
That's terrible! Have you tried any diet apps?
I'm sorry you have to go through all that! I hope the doctors say it works out for you!
That's frustrating. What kind of mistakes does she sometimes make? I can't think of any that I've seen.
That's frustrating. Maybe you should tell the department head?
That cat was probably sick. How old was the cat, 17? 18? 19? 20?
Aww.. I am sorry. Losing a pet is never easy. It is great that you have someone to help in that difficult situation!
How much did you pay for the tickets?
Wow. How much did you pay for the ticket?
Wow, what are you going to spend it on?
Oh really? What made you have such bad experience
Oh no! How did that make you feel?
Helpfulness doesn't always come to mind in marriage, but it should always be available if someone needs it!
It's funny you mention your husband. I'm a very trusting person, so I totally understand your feelings. My mom was in the hospital for quite a few days after her husband had an alcoholocaust (not a peephole). I had a hard time trusting people after that, too, since I've always been
Check your mail? what was in there?
Did this morning brighten your day?
Oh no! Do they not deliver in town?
That's good you have a backup plan if something happens.
Oh that sounds awesome!  What did you all eat and how much Mexican did you eat!
Aww that sucks! Hopefully she'll come home to visit you guys soon.
Well I think you are going to do a great job on it!
That's awesome! I hope you're able to. When I took the LSATs for high school, they were really hard so I'm sure you'll do just fine.
That's pretty cool.  Was it a pretty close game, if I may ask?  Was it close?
Aw, that's too bad. Perhaps you could find yourself a new sport?
That is so sad!  Where was it?
Central Texas here, can confirm that it's a desolate hell haha! What breed was the dog?
Sorry to hear that, my friend
Oh my god, I'm so sorry! I've lost both my grandparents within the past 5 years. I can't even imagine how you must be feeling right now.
Aww that's a bummer! Maybe find yourself some quiet quiet time by yourself?
Hahaha maybe you should hide the tv in your bathroom!
Oh that's awesome! What does he do?
Congrats!  That sounds awesome!  I hope he's happy!
Oh wow!  Congratulations! That is awesome!  What is her major.
Aw, too many? You okay? We're supposed to like sweets.
That's never fun. Are you feeling better now, at least?
What kind of car was it and how fast did you think you was going?
did anything happen to you?
Oh that's so sad! I can't imagine what you're feeling right now. I hate losing a loved one.
Wow! That's terrible, I can relate to- although I think it's more tragic. I don't really like tragic shows though.
whats your favorite show
That's pretty slow, sleep is my least favorite thing to spend my day doing
why are they leaving?
That is scary!  I'm sure the changes are scary for you as well, but I hope it works out for you.  What do you think you'll be doing there?
That's great! How's it been?
That's awesome! My daughter is only 6 so it's hard to have kids haha
Oh, did it make you feel good to get looked over by one?
Oh no! I hate when that happens!
That sounds like a cute cat, what is it called?
That sounds so sweet!
Was it a long con?  Did everything work out finally.
That would make my night, so many people lose it their night!
Oh cool!  How far in advance do you have to have the appointment?
Wow, that's amazing! I'm happy to hear about this, and what an amazing life that makes us!
I live in the UK. Halloween is our national holiday. I've seen so many people dressing asolph HHH and HWHoH
I've always wanted to go as a plague doctor!
Sorry to hear that, did the fire start in your area?
That's so sad. Did insurance cover it?
oh my god, why did you get lost?
Oh wow. That is a miracle haha
I hope it went well for you!
What was the plan?
That's awesome! I love that movie!!
I hate gory movies, too. What was it you didn't like?
How did that make you feel?
Those high school years can be really interesting, if you were around them a lot.
I'm sure it stinks for you but I'm sure there are plenty more fish in the sea.
That's a relief. Maybe you can still keep in touch online?
That's very polite. I would do the same. How did they get so mad?
LOL! I would have been so mad. Did he at least apologize?
Wow, she must really be getting into the car buying lifestyle!
Mustang are awesom, my parents have one as well!
Where are you going
I love vacation time. I went to Panama City Beach for like two weeks when I was kid.
Thats sounds awesome, are you going alone or with friends?
That sounds like sooo much fun! Which casino?
That sounds like so much fun. You are making me want to get out and start playing.
That is a slap to the face.
That's very shocking and I would definitely report it to the police!
I am so sorry to hear about your loss. Where did you guys last vacation together/
I'm sorry about that. Where did you all go?
That's awesome. How often do you play?
Congratulation!  I know that is one the most satisfying moments when you win a little extra money.  I once won 20$ in a candy contest.
That's wonderful! I am glad to hear that!
Wow! I bet that meant a lot to you!
That's cool! Did it make you proud
that is mean
that sounds really rude
That is so thoughtful.  I'm so sorry that happened.  Did he appreciate it?  It's such a thoughtful holiday gift.
That's so sad, it's so hard to feel that way toward your cousin. What gifts did you end up getting her?
Oh no, that sounds painful! I hope no one saw you fall!
I would have been embarrassed as heck!  Did they at least throw you off balance on purpose?
It's nice to hear that. I am glad you have that opportunity.
It's so nice to have the financial stability of our lives.  I have been lucky to be in that position.  It feels like we have been struggling for so long.
Oh my! I bet that must have been so scary!
Oh no! That's scary! I'm glad you weren't hurt though!
I know that can be really tough especially if you are not near family! But being lonely can also serve to fuel your imagination more so than to provide any useful information.
I understand that. traveling can make it hard. But it is needed to meet new people. I am glad you find peace!
I understand. I had the same feeling when my youngest left the nest.
Yeah kids really like to move out of their parents houses.. I had 2 girls move out of their parents houses.. It was a huge problem!
That's awesome! Did you get a good score?
Congradulations. You must be quite proud of your score.
Where did he go? Did he surprise you?
That's amazing! Did you guys have a lot of fun playing Blackjack?
Where did you lie about it?  Was it at least a honest mistake?
Did you guys ever grow out of that?
You must be excited and full of anticipation. How far away are you planning on driving?
What is the deal with the free vacation? Do they give you anything extra for winning?
How much was it, and how big is the jackpot?
Small potatoes, what will you do with the extra money?
That is hard. I am sorry to hear that and I hope you feel better soon!
I know what you mean. That is tough. I recently lost contact also. Just hang out in the chat room and things will happen.
I am sorry to hear that.
I understand, I'm so sorry to hear that!
Did he do anythng interesting?
Oh no, I hope nothing bad happened to him! My thoughts are with you, I hope he is okay!
that's good to hear! How are your relationships?
I am in a relationship right now, but I don't feel that way most of the time. You?
Oh really? What was it
Who sent it to you?
That's not cool! Why did she do that?
Scolding her for the vase? Scolding her for what?
Aw, that's too bad. Is she upset because the baby wasn't expected?
Oh no that's awful. I hope everything works out for the best
I have not. Is it good or not really that great?
I haven't actually but I will now. Sounds like quite the talents!  I watched the first season a loooong time ago.
What is that? I'm not too familiar with it.
Oh yeah. They're pretty sad. Did you have any toys there when you were a kid?
Was it a special occasion?
Was it out of the ordinary?
That's wonderful that you have such a great relationship! It sounds like it's very personal.
That's really sweet. How long have you been together?
I understand. I have experienced the same issues. How does the husband cope with it?
Teenagers are so irresponsible. How often do you sit?
Oh that's nice! Do you and him have a good time beforehand?
Well, that's lovely. I'm sure that'll be fun
Yes, I love the cold, the jolly ranchers, the singing karats, and the pumpkin patch. Why do you love the holidays so much, kiddos.
I agree, I love the holiday. It is so full of imagination and feeling good.
sounds super scary!
Oh I bet. Is everyone you care about okay?
What game is it
Expansion packs are always a welcome surprise! What's the expansion?
Congrats! You deserved it!
Congrats! You deserved it :)
That's a good idea! I would love for everything in my house to be like that!
That's annoying too. It really puts me off, like putting pictures of my cat in the fridge.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Will there be other arrangements available to help?
Oh my god, that's terrible! Are you okay? I'm so sorry!
Awesome! That is a big accomplishment!
Dang, that's impressive! How old is she?
Haha, what breed? That's cute! What kind of puppy is it?
Haha, well, we all get a little excited about getting a new puppy :) What kind of puppy did she?
How have you found that so far
I hope it works out for you!
I'm sorry to hear about that, but what game was the game you were wanting?
I know how that is. Sometimes things come back to bite us.
it was so nice. my family went to see it with my nieces
Oh that must have brought back some great memories! I remember watching it with my mom too!
4
That is hard. Were you friends before?
That's sad. How far are you guys moving?
Are things stressful?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! I know that can be a scary thought. I lost my job a few years back, only to upgrade to something more secure once I had recovered.
Why do you hate the current president?
I know right? Things used to get so better.  Especially during the Obama years!
That must have stung a lot, being alone for so long. Do you have friends to go with?
Oh wow!  Maybe you could take a trip and go visit them?
Oh no. Did he have to go to the tooth doctor?
Sounds rough. Hopefully he will pull through and it will go away.
I'm so sorry. How old was he?
Im so sorry for your loss! Losing a pet is always so hard
Oh that's the worst. I remember when that storm closed my town down, we got power almost immediately!
yes i hate it as well, that is why i always have the old generator on when it storms!
That is so lucky! How did you spend it?
Wow! Did you try to find out where it came from?
Wow! Did you kill it? I would be ticked!
That's terrible, i would cry if i saw that!
I know that is so nerve wracking! I hope that it goes well!
I am sure you will do well!
I hope you have prepared a lot for it! Are you nervous?
I'm sorry to hear it's so tough for you. Are you worried? Maybe try reading a book or maybe practicing in front of a mirror.
Why did you sell stuff you didn't need last week???
That is really good, did you buy low and sell high?
And what do you all think of that? faith is a key tenant when it comes to love
I agree with that. It's important that both of you know that you love the person you are taking them to, and are loyal to them no matter what.
Wow, that must've been terrifying
Wow, what a terrible thing for you to have to go through! Was your house okay, did you have any damage?
That is very annoying, did they gave you a refund at least?
That's awful! Where did you fly? And I'm so sorry that you had to endure that!
That's awesome! Congratulations! How long had it been since you had won?
You know what's up! That sounds amazing and exciting! You're very lucky to have teachers like that.
I do too! I used to love going, fishing or hiking.
i enjoy gardening too. i grew up fishing so much growing up. what about you?
I would have been disgusted! What did you do?
Oh no! I would have been so embarrassed.
I can just imagine you running the emergency lights and everything. Glad you came through it alright!
Oh no. That sounds like a big accident! I'm glad you learned from it.
I can't wait for it to be over with and for the tailgating to continue!
Roll Tide!
What did you do?
Oh no! I hate when that happens...especially when you are trying to pay
What happened??
Wow, I bet that was exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time, huh. Well, you're welcome.
I love when strangers help each other out. I'm glad you were able to make it all work out without any drama. :)
That's cool, it was a cool night.
That would make me mad too! Big dogs can be so annoying sometimes.
LOL! Well in my neighborhood we don't have time for all that!
That would be nice.  Is that something that can be done easily?
What will cost more, the house or the transmission?
Was it an intruder?  Did it get you?  What did it do to your car??
That's the worst. That's the thing about people, they don't know any boundaries...they just go whenever...and they're never very good at keeping things secure
Wow how rewarding! Were you afraid at all while using the Expereience?
how far did the canyon go?
What rock band is it?
That is crazy! I guess live drums and no mixing sounds better.
That's pretty cool! I never really played, but I heard of others!
That is cool! How long did it take you to improve your bowling skills?
That must have been so disgusting!
That's awful! I would take that dog home and take him in!
That's awesome! Congratulations! What are you getting into?
That's awesome! How did you get debt?
What mistake was it?
What was the mistake?
School can really make you do things you aren't expecting to, good for you!
That's great. I went to college for a few years, but have dropped out.
He is lucky, but you can be too too overconfident.
It is really great when something like that happens though, so you are happy about that as well
I have done that more than once.  It can be very embarrassing.  Are you bowling for a living?
That bowling is so much fun! How did you do?
That's cool!  What kind of toyota?
I would be too! Those are nice cars
Nice! I bet it feels great to have new stuff to your life!
Nice! What kind of car is it?
What a nostalgic place those nostalgic emotions can sometimes.
I love nostalgic listens
oh no!! i'm so sorry! I hope everything is okay
Oh wow! That's terrible!!! What a difficult phone call to make! I hope he pulls through!
That's great! Congrats! I'm sure that they are very happy as well! I'm looking to buy a new apartment as well.
That's great! I moved into one this summer, it was very noisy but so much better than my old place.
Oh no! Did the person say anything to you about it??
She may not have known that it was you bowling. She could have still looked over to see if you were ok
Family reunions are always fun! Are you going with anyone? :)
Family reunions are so much fun! I hope your family and I can make time for you!
What was it?
That's awesome. Any idea why you took the record? Were you training for a race or for a gym membership?
That's awesome! What are you planning on becoming a nurse for?
That's good! What have you changed?
How long has he been playing? Does he have a long stroke?
Does he practice a lot?
Uhmnnn!  Thats no good!!
That's hilarious. I love prank calling my bosses!
That must have been quite annoying for you. Were they being loud and vulgar or were they being peaceful?
Maybe, or maybe you just need new friends.  I have had that problem too. I play the guitar a lot, but I don't have anyone to play with.
probably someone playing a prank on you
Hmmm that is really weird. Did the sound come back after a short period?
That's awesome! I love when you get a surprise visit!
wow that is so cool. I bet he or she is very excited as hell.
I love those special moments
I know what you mean. I live in a small town right outside of Atlanta. Christmas came so quickly back then!
Congratulations, I know you must have felt good about the interview!
I agree, I know I did my research and that I will definitely land something soon
Did he scare you?
Haha. That's so creepy! Did you say something to him?
That's great! You must be very disciplined. How did it work out for you?
You definitely should if you want to stay healthy! Don't listen to those filthy doctors who ignore his hernia!!!
Well thats not bad at all
Those things are really dependable.
You should always be paranoid.
Oh no! I hate meeting people.  I avoid public events because it isolates you.
That sounds quite peaceful!
Wow that is a pretty weird place to be.
Oh my god! Whoa! Did you have any idea who did it?
That is not good!  Did they take anything important?
That is pretty good.  I'm glad to here you're feeling content.
Totally agree. It is nice to have things we don't take for granted sometimes!
How did that work out?
that's awesome! blankets are so handy and fun to make! You are very creative and original!
That sounds great.  I've never really been to Scotland.  Did he visit you guys while you were there?
That sounds amazing! It was the phone calls that got me too!
That is what makes life fun!
That is a really good attitude to have.  It is good to realize we can appreciate things more than we know
Awwww that's so sweet!!  What breed is your doggy?
I do have a cat. Her names may be Pepper, but she is a mix between Pepper and Dingo :)
Why are you getting nervous?  Is it an important class?
I'm sure you'll be fine. Just try to study hard
I think we all get a little judge-y in our head. Doesn't hurt to be honest with you.
I know the feeling. Sometimes i even forget how bad it really is.
That's awesome! I bet you'll do awesome! What are you getting in too?
That's the spirit! You will do it!
That's awesome, I wish I had a brother! What kind of car?
I wish I had a brother like you, I would be the perfect age to be excited for my brother!
What kind of car is it
I know the feeling! My father in laws old Grand Cherokee was a dream car! Just under 200K miles on her!
Were you scared? I bet that was scary!  Did you end up driving home safely?
Oh no! Did you end up driving home safely?
Children are a very complicated subject. It's easy to put onto a person because of their past, present and future. I can see why you'd feel emotional, however!
I know what you mean. I was just talking about that with my friend last week. It's so nice to remember all those great times with your kid
that's good! What made you feel better about yourself?
That's great! It's nice to be forgiving!
That sounds great! It can be very different when it is a "new" restaurant. Was it one you really liked?
that is awesome that you had a chance to taste some indian food! i love it when i go to amsterdam and find some indian dishes
I have never had green beans. You are enlightening me.
That sounds awesome! I love that it is local, I may have to go there tomorrow!
why did he do that? did he do sometING horrible?
Did he jump scare you? I would be scared too!
That is so cool and inspiring! How long has it been since he last saw you?
Did you ask your dad about the stitches?
That's so sad! I was a little sad too when I read about that. He was a nice guy in his younger years.
Yes! I agree completely. Anthony Bourdin is such an inspiration, but he was certainly an unfortunate person to live such a self-defeating lifestyle. It's truly inspiring to hear such tragic stories like this one. I think mental health is just going to get a little more recognized as we move closer to our Golden
I know right? Who sent you to this website? Some sock puppets, I guess...
How's it been? Have you seen her lately?
That's awesome! I love grandparenting! You're definitely one of the lucky ones.
That's so amazing. I'm glad that you got a chance to be there and witnessed it live. I'm also really jealous.
I remember that too, sports are so boring for everyone.
What is the different subject?
Yeah it really does, it makes you think about it too, how did you learn that in the past
Oh wow, that sounds like an amazing thing to do! Did it work out well?
That sounds amazing! I am so thankful for having so many things like that.
Wow that's great! How old is he?
that's great, it's amazing how some little things can change your life!
That sounds very relaxing.  Were they gone for long?
Oh wow, that is a long time. Were they gone for good or did they go away for vacation?
You must be thrilled. Was it a stray?
That's a really awesome thing you did. I would do the same. I am allergic to dogs and cats too but, since my cat is in one piece and my dog is not, I couldn;t get any of the other two to.,
Wow. That sounds like incredible chapters from a book. I am happy for both of you.
That sounds amazing, I would be crazy to do anything to hurt someone. You are wonderful for being able to support her so well.
I've been looking for a way to watch it outside of the country.
HALO is great. I watch a lot of Disney shows there.
That sucks!  Did he say anything to you?
Oh god, that's awful, how horrible! I hope it wasn't a stray or someone you knew?
I can't either! That's so tragic. What happened?
I'm so sorry to hear that. How did it happen?
Was it your birthday?
That is such a thoughtful thing to do for you!  Did they get a lot of presents?
Oh, I wish we could get some type of order, "Make Your Wishlist" or something?
Where are you stationed?
I get where you're coming from. Have you had an animal roommate?
i get what you meam
I used to do that too when I was little
I know what you mean.  I think of mine sometimes also.
yes! I know someone who lives with his parents and spends hours every day shopping!
I am sorry to hear that.  What does your friend do for work if you don?
Where to? Whats happening?
That sounds awesome. Are you moving away from home to begin your new adventure?
That's good thinking.  I hope it's not as bad as the weather has been this week!
That's a relief.  I hate those types of situations when it's not your fault!
How nice!  I bet that brought back a lot of great memories!
That's wonderful! I have never used facebook before.
Oh no I hope she is ok! Is this her first time having to do this?
I am sorry, but I am afraid that you are putting in a bunch of pressure that could put you in an unhealthy situation.  I really hope that it is ok and that you can get her teeth cleaned!
That's terrible! I am so sorry to hear about your grandma! I lost both of mine, so I can relate. It's so sad.
That's terrible, my grandmother passed away a few years ago aswell, so it's not an easy thing for us to lose someone so close to us. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I know it's hard for everyone involved, but it's good that you enjoyed your time with her.
Oh no that is awful!  I'm glad you were able to get some help!
I'm glad it turned out well for you guys.
I know the feeling! Is it getting late in the year?
It is always a rush! I bet you are going to feel better!
That is great! It is always good to have a happy marriage. Are they married too?
I am happy for you! It is nice to find someone as happy with themselves as you are!
Oh that's cool! What station did you get to hear this on?
I have never heard of those. What songs were they?
How do you feel now? Did you at least pass?
I'm sure if you prepared well and studied hard it'll turn out good eventually.
Four days? You must have been so excited! Did he get any gifts?
He must be so full of joy!
Wow, that's awesome! He must be so proud. I hope he wins.
it's amazing the amount of people who would believe that
I'm in the midwest. I was just in an instructor's class over in youtube and it was so cool! The guy was teaching his kid how to do tricks!
Oh I bet! It must make you so happy!
What do you do for a living
I know that feeling, my friend! I had the perfect place to live when we moved and the market crashed. I was so frustrated and jealous, until I saw that my friend had managed to get it for me!
I am sorry to that! I am sure you will find something even better.
Oh no! How old was it
Oh man I'm sorry, that's really awful to hear! How long did you have it for?
Do you enjoy your privacy?
Sounds like you really trust your friend!
What did you get your doctorate in?
Well, that's good. What are you studying now?
Where have she been.
Haha! Why a language class?  She'll learn so much!
Aww, you better make some quick stops! before she realizes it's time to go.
A bit of a clean house will do the trick :)  And she's coming back, that's exciting!
I'm so sorry to hear that... did it happen in the shower or at home?  Did you dry it yourself or hire someone to do it for you?
i have long hair, i can't do anything with mine
Oh, what happened?
What things were you having problems with?
What?! I am so sorry that happened. Did anyone notice?
That is too funny!  People are so nasty!  I bet your embarrassed!
Where has she been?
Aww, I am glad she is back!  Where has she been?  Do you have any plans with her to visit?
Oh wow. I've lived in both those places. I know a lot of the people, but it's always tough leaving some established people behind. How did it feel moving from the South?
Yea that is pretty silly. I moved to Colorado from Virginia three years ago, and I didn't know anyone in either place either. I hate living alone.
Yikes that sucks! I'm glad you escaped your situation. I'm sure it was hard to leave.
I'm in the Midwest. I was so sad when I moved to a new state. Everything around me was the same. It's just a dump. I moved to Texas and it's pretty nice.
Did you have any issues? I've always wanted to take a journey to the South through the US.
Wow! That sounds super fun! How far did it drive you?
Oh my goodness! How horrible! How is she feeling now/
That's good.  Were her periods any good?
School is always a fun time for me as well.  Where did you go?
That sucks.  That sucks how summer goes by so fast.
That's awful! I hope she doesn't get hurt.  What is the plan to help her lose weight?
I don't blame you for being nervous. I hope she will make it.  It can be dangerous to lose weight at young ages
I'm the same! I'm constantly checking to make sure that I lost before someone can get it!
I feel your pain! It's like losing in arisal race or losing at poker!
Why is that
Wow you must be so excited! Where are you going in too go?
That's so sad! How awful for the family!
That's awful!  I'm so sorry.  I know how devastating it must have felt.
Aw, I'm sorry to hear it. I hope she feels better!
That's too long, is he being sweet?
Oh no! Did you find her? Did she stay a while?
I am glad that she is back!
What a blessing and a curse that was.
That is so wonderful of them!
I'm jealous. I love traveling, and my wife's family just moved about an hour away. I'm so jealous!
That's awesome. Do you guys live near the city limits?
I'm with ya there! They are creepy
I think they're creepy, but they also make good pets!
That is so thoughtful! What was the plan was.
Wow! That must've been a very nice surprise party!
That would be so annoying! What does he normally do that you can't do anything about it?
That's so funny!  Hey little brothers, get out of here!
Were you nervous?
That's unfortunate, but maybe she had a valid excuse to go somewhere.
That's gross! I hope it didn't ruin the meal?
that is not cool, did you tell the restaurant?
Oh no! That's so disappointing. I would have been upset!
Oh no! I hate when my husband does that! Did you say something?
why is that? what do you feel surprised about?
What did your friend give you as a gift?
Oh no, be careful, it is one year older now. It is sad to think that could happen to anyone.  Be happy that he is in a good place now - and looking forward to the holidays with you :)
Awe. Beagles are such good companions.
I do not! I don't know if it helps, but my aunt rescued from a shelter, so when we got him he looked just like my aunt. Except he was a little taller, and lanker. He was cute. But now... Not so much lol
I have two dogs. I prefer one over the other but I still have other dogs I have to train. I'm very glad they were there to comfort you.
Uh oh! What happens when he scares you?!
Oh my goodness. That's one of my pet peeves. Why don't you let him put the chocolate into the chilli first, so it's not lump sum of course, but at least put it in the right chilli. You're better than me, I know.
Did he get all of it?
That must be a great feeling of accomplishment! I don't have mygebra down yet but I know my son knows how to do basic math so it should feel pretty good.
What is the race? Sounds like you trained very hard!
Oh that's awesome! what marathons are you doing?
sounds like fun i'm doing one with my mom! i'm very happy for you!
Local moms? Oh my goodness, you're very bold!! I'm a mom, too! But I totally understand why being social would make you anxious, too! I hope it goes well for you.
I have never heard of it! Sounds cool!
That sounds so awesome!
How much do you lift?
What is your favorite music to play at gym?
Yes, I was in a car wreck one time.  I felt so numb when it happened!
Yes, I have actually been in a car crash. It is terrifying!
That sucks.  I hope you two can talk it out!
That's so sad. It's so nice you are there for her. I'm sorry you're having to go through that. Have you tried to keep her company and cheer her up?
that is really bad
I would expect them to at least let you know so that you weren't left with a cliffhanger.
Yes. Many. Many people have. What's worse; the attempt or the attempt to kill themselves?
I am very sorry for your brothers' death, that's so sad. But I can understand your feelings too. It can be very upsetting when it's sudden like that.
Yes I have
I have 3 rescue cats. They are the worst! I had one who had to have his stomach pumped and now he's just laying around waiting for his siblings.
You're a good person!
What was it that made you want to keep that piece in there?
Did you miss your mailbox?
He's probably just out for his money.
Are you working?
Oh no that's horrible! I am so sorry! You're lucky to be in an apartment, but I know you must be real tough on the financial side.
what did you use it for?
That is really cool.  Were you surprised to see your life flash before your eyes in that moment?
Oh wow. Did it turn out alright?
That's good, travel is so exciting!
thats cool
Oh that's terrible! Well next weekend may not work out since the weather has been bad this weekend.
Ah, that is a bummer! Well at least you didn't miss out on much if you were more than a couple hours away.
Well, you are more gullible than me.  I am sure your parents picked up on that line.
Lol that sounds like a crazy story! Sounds like he was a cool dude!
flooring work can be strange. was it an emergency or a scheduled thing?
Oh my god! I could not handle that at all! Were the cats okay
You mean the floor. That's what happens when you don't clean your toys. I taught him that
That's a shame! Does he not keep them in the same bucket?
How did it go?
How did you feel when you did the cut?
Wow! Did anyone see it
Must've been quite embarrassing! Did anyone give you tips?
That is a really cool prize! What did you end up getting in the mystery box?
That's the worst, it's like they don't understand how much money you're paying or something!
Wow! Did you study very hard for it?
Nice! Chemistry is really hard, I'm proud of you!
I know the feeling. Do you have a good ventracker?
Yes there really isnt.  Its like a disease..  If only we knew how to get it under control.
oh thats cool
That is great! I bet she is proud of you!
Well then I'm excited too! Where have you been checking?
Me too! I love the weather, the shopping and the people. What's your favorite part about Christmas?
Wow! Did they give you anything in return for it?  Did they let you win any money on the machine?
I love playing blackjack!  What machine did you go on?
Why were you scared
Lightning always scares me. I'm pretty tall and I hate being out in the dark.
I hope it goes well!
Don't worry too hard about it. Just enjoy yourself. If they are good looking chances they most probably are local.
I am sure it is exciting
Confirm the proposal then.
That's pretty annoying. Why don't you get a cat?
That is strange. He could just need a cat scratching post.
Congrats! That's awesome. What are you studying?
Congratulations!!! I wish you all the luck!
Like every time! What do you lose if you do it wrong?
Hokey was a big influence on my childhood. I bet it was fun!
I do too, sometimes I enjoy being by myself for a while.
That was really cool of you to do. I'm pretty sure most people would've just gone with him, but wanted to make a different trip.
That can be upsetting. Have things worked out in their relationship?
That really stinks, I'm sorry. Can't you just break things off?
what movie? did you like it?
What was it? I can't believe I forgot this was a thing
Haha, that's terrible.  It would have sucked more if it had been coffee!  Did you end up able to breath okay?
Haha that's terrible...but funny at the same time!
That's always nice. Did you have something to buy?
That's a bummer.  Did you have to pay cashiers for not doing their job?
Oh my god! That's so scary! Did he come with a bomb too?
What did you do after he took your stuff?
Yes! Sometimes people get lost in a clutter. Do you find value in learning new things?
That's a pretty noble gesture to take the attention to. I'm happy for you! tips like this can really make a big impact.
thats awesome, its always good to wake up with some confidence
is that good or bad
Life truly is a blessing, isn't it? How long have you been together?
that sounds amazing!
oooh I feel you. I had that problem as well
Try not to let it bother you. I think if you try to focus on being quiet they won't bother you.
What do they do?
That is terrible!! I hate when they make you pay for a mistake they made at a store
Did you guys play it?
Aww that is so sweet!  I bet he really miss that friend!
Glad you got it worked on! Hopefully they know whats wrong.
Ouch! I'm sorry to that. Did the dentist fix the pain?
Oh really?? You are a dedicated member of your family! You are doing good things
That's a bummer. Do you know who won?
That's so bad! I hope she's okay!
That sounds like such a romantic and sweet way to end a evening!
How old was it? It happens to all of us
Oh my goodness, your cat jumped through a window? That would scare me too, I would've ran away. How big was your cat?
How much can you lift?  I have always wanted to be able to do pullups!
How long have you been working at this for?  I'm sure if you were really dedicated it probably took a lot longer.
I know right? What is the number one thing that you are thinking about right now?
Are we talking about yourself or talking about your significant other?
Oh wow! How much did you win?
Wow, that's impressive! What are you going to do with it?
Was the play very interesting?
That sounds so awesome! I'm glad it sounded like something I'd be into!
That sounds like a great addition to your family!
That's a great name! I have a dog similar, named herLayla :)
That's cool! Did you guys have a great time?
That is cool.  I love old disney movies!
Nice. Was it difficult to choose a name?
I love German Shephards. I have 2 of them!
That is terrible luck! Did they return it?
That is so terrible.
Oh god. Did it get you?
That roach must have been terrifying for you. Did you get any funny looks?
Woowoo... What was it?!
Oh my, that sounds terrifying!  What did you do?  What was it?
How did it go after you arrived at the interview place?
That's a shame. Do you think you'll be let down next time?
Oh, man! I bet that was scary. What did you do?
Yikes that's gross. I would have freaked out.
oh no! that's horrible! did he/she stop and help you? did you get anything else?
Oh no! That's terrible! Was anyone hurt?
Oh, that's fun! Are you worried at all about how you'll perform in front of a large amount of people?
Wow, that's a pretty epic scene! How long do you think you have to speak for?
Did you say something or were you just excited?
Oh wow, that's very unfortunate. I wonder why that person did that?
103 what? I don't understand you.
103 is awesome! You must have been so happy and proud of yourself!
Thats so sweet. How old were they then/
I do love looking at my old photo albums too
how was it?
how was it?
What did find?
Holy cow, that must've taken some preparation! Glad to hear it turned out well.
Oh no, how are you fixing your car!?
That is not minor accident if you ask me.
That is awesome.  What kind of car did you get
oh nice, you must have got it used, the salesman tried insisting i needed an auto reconnection
I hope you did well on it!
That is such an incredible feat! What school did you pick?
How do you feel now after all that study? are you satisfied with the results?
I love sneaking in free time to read good books.
That sounds super scary, what happened after?
That's good. Sometimes people leave things out on purpose.
I agree! generous are people like that.
I would do anything for my friend too, I just cant understand how people can treat people so poorly
What did you get accomplished that weekend?
That is great, she must have a partner in crime.
yea i know that feel
That's too bad but, also maybe too late now.
what clubs? are you going to be a member?
That is great! I hope that you get that internship! Good luck!
Ugh that is so stressful and it only takes you 15 minutes to jog to the dumpster from your car.
That is horrible! Pick ups are so annoying!
What was the thing?
Yuck! Sounds gross! What did you do?
Did she?
That's pretty lucky. Is it still too early to tell if she's going to be alive or not?
I'm sorry you felt that way. Was it something that he could do anything in response to?
Oh wow that's unfortunate. Yeah wedding venues can get pretty relaxed!
I am also concerned about this. Are you in a career field that requires income, or do you just work at home most often?
That's so sad, how much are you making?
I used to play a ton of video games when I was little.
I agree! I played DOOM last year and had a blast! It's an amazing game. Did you play it recently on the Switch?
I haven't heard about the explosion. How big was it?
What is a micro brewery?
Do they do things to you?
I feel you there! I look at guys and girls side by side all the time.
It's so sad. It's a shame that he passed away...
Awww, I'm sorry for your loss.  Anthony Bourdain was a great man.  I'm glad that some people still care about him.
That was nice of them!
Aww that's sweet! How many people were in the area? Did you have fun at least?
Fresh peaches bring back the nostalgia of winter wonderland visits!
That's so nice! What kind of fauna does the twin grow?
That's awesome! Where will you be going?
That's awesome!  Are you excited to be with your wife again?
oh thats good of your neighbor! i would be sad if i was in your situation
thats cool. i moved out of my old apartment into a new one and have friends in all different states. it's so nice living with people you actually know
That's the worst.  You'd think they would be more considerate to your time
I would be so mad!  Did he tell you about it?
Oh no that's terrible! I hope it was just some kids.
Well at least he didn't get into a shooting. That's something
Nice did he take any of them?
oh wow that sounds really cool, transportation seems interesting
Good for you. What are you getting up too?!
Aww, what kind of soup are you going to make?
Oh wow! That must have been very annoying! I would have been super busy!
That sounds very annoying!  Were they helpful at least when you tried to talk to them?
That's cool! I hope you guys enjoy it! I hope you two become a couple. :)
Wow. That's awesome!  You must be so proud.
Wow, you're in luck then. You can just buy a car and drive around! That's actually not that crazy difficult.
Where has she gone?
I hope she is well fed and comfortable.
That must have stung!  You've given me hope though!  You must have prepared yourself well for the interview!
That must have been very annoying. I hope you didn't get any other interviews.
Oh, that must be hard. I'm sorry.
Aww, I love animals, I would totally hate it
I bet you were ready to wait. Did you get the job offer?
I could never do that.  I would have to think very long on some of the questions they asked.
That must make you mad! Can you return it?
That's really unfair. I would complain to your parents
Oh that's a bummer!  How are you holding up?  What are you both doing to try and keep it together?
Awe, that's too bad. I hope she comes back with good news soon!
Aww that would tickle me but it's so cute! What did you do about it?
Oh god, an wasp? I would have been so terrified!
I do not like the mosquitos either
I live in the south and they are so much worse here. Mosquitos are the worst.
Wow! How'd it get there?
Oh my gosh! You must have done something horrible to deserve such fear.
Nice, I've always wanted to do an experience similar to that of the movie their movie edge of Darkness
Oh wow! that sounds like so much fun!!!
Oh no!  That happens to the best of us. Did it make you sleepy?
Oh gross!
I hope it goes well. How old is your hip now?
Oh no, I hope you can get it all done!
Where are you going?
That's awesome that your friend helped you out.
What situations do you mean?
Oh no! I have had that happen, it really is an uncomfortable situation
I'm sorry to hear that :( Are you going to get another one?
I'm so sorry. How long did you have her for?
I'm sorry to hear that. Where did they vacation at?
Aww that's too bad. Maybe you should get a dog?
Congrats! I bet your excited and full of joy right now!
Ugh, I am the same! It's so quiet and spacy up there.
Oh, well that's no good! How long will she be away?
Aww, where did she go? I hope she hasn't had too many adventures!
Thank you, I'm crossing my fingers!
Oh no I'm so sorry! I hope everything is okay now (don't freak out too much)
Hey that's awesome!  I bet you're a great player!
That's awesome!  What is the game for?
I know that pain, my brother-in-law went through it too when he came to Chicago in 2009/10.  It's definitely not an easy thing to do.
That's good that things are on your path.  I am in a similar situation right now.
I am happy for you! Where is the trip to?
That's awesome. Are you going to visit anyone or just yourself?
That sounds wonderful. What was it that happened?
That would make me mad!  I would just laugh and keep walking.  You are so lucky.
I'm glad you had a blessed week. It's so quiet now since they came back and you don't hear much anymore.
That's nice that they are trying to make things more interesting.
That's hilarious. I would have noticed.
Oh no! I hope that you didn't have to stay in that room that long!
Why empty the airport?
I would imagine, that would be very scary indeed!
That's so exciting! I have two dogs myself. They're quite the handful!
That's good! What type of breed is it?
How many children do you have
Faster, hu/
What happened that made you so excited about the wedding?
What color was your wedding?
That is terrible. I don't understand why people can't have nice things, let alone dogs.
You don't have dogs in your neighborhood? What are you even talking about? Do you have a pit bull? Haha I'm sorry I didn't make that connection...
Congrats! That's an awesome achievement!
That's so awesome! What is he doing to minister?
That sucks!  Did you have the box all clean??
That is so annoying. Did you kick she to the curb and give her a piece of that?
That's always fun! What kind of restaurant?
I hate when a restauraunt is so cheap.  I'm glad you were brave enough to try it out!
I can imagine. Co-workers can sometimes have different ideas on how to run an organization.
Sometimes when you're in a heated argument you might want to just end it and move on.
Oh wow! I can carry a ton of luggage too! It's not easy!
That sounds like it would be a challenge. I carry way more lumber than I need too.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. How did he die?
Oh no. I lost my cat recently too. It's never good news.
Oh no, I'm sorry, are you guys really close?
That sucks but I guess everyone fumbles in life. It'll work itself out.
That's terrible, i'm really sorry.
I'm so sorry. That must have been devastating.
Oh, how sweet!  What is she up to?  Did you find her?
I'm so glad you found her. You must be so relieved and relieved to find out she's still alive.
I'm sure with a good arch you can get it up again, what hurt you
I'm glad it worked out for you and I hope to play golf some time in the future!
I agree! Do you do it yourself?
That sounds like a challenging experience!
Nice. What provider did you buy?
That's cool. What kind of tv is it?
A giant flying bug? How terrifying! What did you do?
That is so funny! I would have totally been in your shoes! I hate bugs sooooo much!
donate your memorabilia
You will do fine, just stay calm and do your thing.
Nice! Was it a real life friend that you were talking about or was this a dream? Either way, great!
Sounds like a fun dream. Did you ever find out what happened to him after that or is he still around?
That's nice. Were you able to catch up with them?
Oh man! I have one and they are the cutest dogs ever. Was she happy to surprise you?
That's awesome! I love animals! What kind of puppy did you get?
That's such a shame. You would think they would have a system like that to prevent that!
That sucks, I hate when things like that happen! Have you looked up the designer before, to make sure they're legit?
oh my gosh i feel you! I have done that loads! My son used to eat loads of salted chocolate bars
That seems extreme but maybe you can explain it to yourself over the chocolate.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that!  I hope he feels better asap!
Oh no! Is he feeling better now that you're here?
Cool! What kind of competitions
I know what you mean, it's hard to find people to hang out with these days especially at college!
I have never golfed, is it like that?
Nice, maybe I can get some time on this app to play.
Oh no, how awful! Did she say something to the police?
That is so sweet! Did daddy bear side bear your mama?
oh no. what did you do with the rest of the bones?
That's too bad. Did the cops come?
I would too, if i was in his position
I would sentence them to community service
I bet it did.. did you find out what it was?
Oh my goodness, that must have been so terrifying! I'm glad you found your wife and were okay!
What a good friend! lend me your undivided attention and strength my friend!
That is good to hear, how much did you borrow?
How'd he do that? I'd like a blindfold myself!
Wow, that's pretty crazy! What a nice man!
Yes I saw one fly a few days before I moved. It freaks me out
Oh wow. You think a person could just walk up to it and kill it with a RPG or something?
I completely understand. It can really be annoying at times!
That sounds really childish of her.
That's sad to hear. Are you going to get another one?
thats really sad to here, my friend who had a dog also passes away, it is very sad
Oh that's terrible! I hope that he is going to be okay.
That's scary, my son is also at risk and could be getting checked out.
oh my goodness. you should sue the hotel
Wow, I am sorry to hear that.  I am sure the truck smelled bad too!
I would have done that as well.  What happened to yours?
That's good you had a good idea on how to protect yourself.
I know that must be quite hard, but I believe you will do well.  What do you do?
Wow, that's a lot of extra work! What are you getting a degree in?
Haha I bet you were a little shocked
Hahaha! Did the thrill finally overcome you?
That sucks. You're a hard worker, you should work as hard as you possibly can.
Well you could always watch tv or play games. Or you could meet some new people. What do you usually do?
I absolutely agree.  They're like family members you know?
Oh wow. I'm really sorry for your loss. I had a dog that was the same way.
Did it go over well at all?
That sounds amazing!  How far did it get?
Wow, that's terrible. I wonder what they thought?
I'm happy that she is doing better now though. Hopefully it continues
Rain is good sometimes!
I'm in the exact same situation! Finally a day off where I can get some sun and play outside? I'd love that.
Sounds like fun!  What did you see?
What happened? Did people actually get into the movie?
How do you feel about that? Are things good or bad for you?
Yea, compared to what I pay, insurance is really not that expensive in my opinion. compared to my neighbors, it is ridiculous
I don't blame you, that sounds like an amazing accomplishment in itself!
Oh wow. Maybe have someone take a bite!
Oh no! What happened?
That is terrible, I hope you recover.
Oh no! Did you miss him and you have any pets?
Oh man, I'm so sorry! I hope your dog is found safe!
I'm so sorry to hear about that, that must be so awful.
That really sucks man. I am so sorry.
That's a nice thing to do.  I wish I could pay for things too!
That is so nice! Did you have a Starbucks?
Oh wow that's awesome!  I bet he is excited.  I know mine are.
Oh wow, what is he in college for?
Oh no. Can you go back to the place?
Yikes!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Did they at least offer you a replacement?
Oh no!  Did you hurt your self?
Ouch!  I've been there before!  Did you trip over anything?
Why scary movies?
Was the movie good?
That must be annoying. Dogs can get rowdy when their excited about something!
Have you called the police on them yet?
Did that make you feel yucky?
Wow that's a crazy good appetite! How much pizza was it?
It is such an amazing feeling, wasn't it?
That's great. I'm glad you got that feeling. Procrastination can really relieve stress.
What kind of job is it?
Wow that sounds really exciting! Good luck and I'm sure it will go great!
That's so sad. Have you been crying yourself to sleep at night?
That's sad to hear, I'm sorry to hear. I hope things get better for you two in the future.
I agree. Do you have a new debit card issued to you?
That sucks. I don't think autopay is an issue with visa or American Express.
Oh wow! I am so happy for her! Is she getting a big raise?
She must have a fulfilling career ahead!
That's awesome! I bet she was happy!
That was very thoughtful of you. I bet she really enjoyed the writing piece and the winnings.
Oh I bet, I can relate! I'm 35 and about to enter my first year as well! Time flies! What is he studying?
I can imagine, being a parent can be an adjustment
Yes def, but I think you are right, at some point you just have to let go.
Yes that's the crazy part.  You don't know what he might do or how he might react, that's the exciting part!  It's like you're putting a mine in mine and hoping they mine it.
64? Why?
Hah, I bet you felt incredibly happy when it came out, too!
I'm sure you have it. Just stay positive. You need as many friends as possible to help.
I'm glad you passed!
That sounds nice! What did he have?
What did he make
That is a good point!  Coffee filters can be a pain to deal with.
I can just imagine.  Coffee filters are the most convenient convenience I've ever bought for any hobby.  And to think it was my first accident... ouch.  I'm sorry to hear you had such an inconvenient experience.
What about 4?
Oh wow. Do they eat alot?
OH no! I hate when that happened! Did you have another job lined up for?
That's good, I am allergic but I don't think it's that bad.
I bet that made you very jittery
OH! happiness is something that is hard to come by.
did you drink enough water to keep it inside?
That's terrible, what can you do to help manage it now that it's better
Did she get mad?
Lactose intolerant people are the most annoying.  I am one of those!  I'm glad you were happy with it!  You should have eaten it! hahah
Lactose intolerant? I'm sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about getting some milk or something to help?
What are the big questions that will be asked then?  I think you have plenty of time.
Oh no. I hope you are prepared! It's so exciting though when your kids grow up! I am sure everything goes well for you.
haha I've done that before! What did you do after?
Oh, outside cats are rarely angry!
That's a bummer. You should do better than you think!
That's impressive! I'm sure you'll do well.
Oh man I hate it when that happens...I had that happen with a few girls I was involved with. Hopefully you can get her stuff back
I can imagine. I hope it wasn't for the worst.
Yes, they are supposed to. That does make the phone call annoying though, no pun intended.
That must of been scary!
Especially when you are not even in the US
That is awful!  I would be furious!
How scary! Do you live on a farm?
I would be terrified! I would run too!
That is really nice to hear, I am the same with my sister's art.
That's pretty great!  You must be really good at it!
That is so nice! How long have you been friends?
That's great to hear! I am glad you have a great friend!
I am so sorry, that must be terrible.  How are you feeling?
Oh, I"m sorry. I just have some bad news too. I just lost my sister to cancer. She was a very lovely woman.
Did you call the police?
That is crazy! I'm glad it wasn't something serious though.
Did you have family over? How old was your dad when you got the surgery
That's awesome. I hope he recovers well!
Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry!
If they're smart, the age old question of can you have kids is going to be answered, and you definitely should if they want good life. But for now, it's probably not something you can do. You're a good person for getting the news though!
I hear you! I love playing video games. What kind of games do you play?
Yeah, I remember playing with my friends from time to time. It's always fun reminiscing about the good ol' days. It's like those games weren't just games, they were like real life friendships.
How do you feel about that
Don't be too hard on yourself. I'm sure you did fine.
I'm so sorry! That's an awful disease and I hope that your co-worker is okay!
I'm really sorry. Type 2 diabetes is horrible and is very treatable if you work hard and are on a healthy diet. It's a life changer.
Oh no that sounds lonely! Why were they not wanting to go with you?
That sounds lonely!  Did you enjoy it>
hahahaha that's funny.  Did he do something to make him feel bad?
lol sounds like a win win situation!  Did you buy anything nice with it?
Really? I didn't hear about that.
Oh yeah, he's a pretty bad guy, I can't stand his movies.
Haha. I do that too now.
Haha that's so funny! I was just talking about this with my friends.
Wow, that's some bad news. Are you okay?
How can you do that?
That's very inspiring! What made you needed him?
That was nice of you. I hope he was well fed and had a full nights rest.
That's awesome!  World history is so cool, especially the bits that don't get explained to us.
wow thats awesome
What type of news?
That's so cool! Does he atleast understand you?
That's pretty awesome! What kind of hot dogs do you like?
Ha ha, I'm a man of discipline. I would have to admit that major league eating world champions are quite inspiring. But I'm still not quite wild about the idea of paying a visit to someone else's hot dogs. What if someone ate my lunch?
That's so sweet of him! He sounds like such a good boyfriend!
That's good. Your boyfriend sounds really caring! You should be proud of him!
aw that's really cool, did you have the same kind of mom as your mom?
Awe, that's so sweet, it's nice to remember the good times! Yes, there's definitely a lot we miss her in our life! Hopefully they'll get married someday!
That is unfortunate. Is the dog potty trained?
Oh no! Did the dog take a poop on your house floor too?
How cool! How old is he/she?
That's awesome! I wish I had kids.
That really stinks. You must be feeling quite lonely.
That is a bummer but maybe it is for the best?
I am so sorry to hear that. It must be tough to have to deal with.  Have you been able to relax and not get stressed?
oh im sorry to hear that.
That's sad, are you going to be okay?
Oh no. I'm sorry. Are you okay?
I love pie! What kind of pie was it
That sounds so good!
That must be pretty nice.
I know right, I have a clean hair too, but I feel like I don't have a soul when people say things can bring someone joy...
Oh that sounds like so much fun!!!
did someone woke you up?
Being alone in the house can be nice sometimes.
I'm sorry, that must have been very annoying. I hope it's all over for good
Wao, Why's that
Why are you worried about going there?
That's terrible! Did it fall on anything bad?
That's really a blessing you didn't get stolen right?
I know the feeling. What are you planning to do about money?
Oh man, that's awful! I hope you're able to get another car soon! What a pain in the butt!
Oh no, how did you cope?
i would have felt the same way, went to the beach every week too, sometimes with my friends
Has something been wrong?
That is good. I hope everything continues to improve for you!
Are you being ironic or did you really not read the fine text on the armageddon ordinance?  If it was written in english, you would have had to research it and probably studied the relevant section.
Because they don't have nukes?
I am sure you will do great!
You'll get the job!! I guarantee it
Congrats! You are very lucky
It's a good time isn't it? Have you been looking for a carpet changer yourself? I have a good pair that are easy to find and are great for carpet cleaning.
That is awesome.  Do you have any tips for me
That's awesome!  How old is she?
That sounds nice. Have you met them before?
That's understandable. I moved out of my parents house 5 years ago and have been lucky to have great neighbors.
Wow that must be scary! Are you guys set up now?
That's awesome!  I can imagine it's a crazy exciting time!  Did you guys have a lot of stuff to sale and what did you need the money for?
Sometimes I do, especially when my kids are in the house.
Yes, it makes you appreciate life a little more.  Do you have any advice for me?
A lot can change. What do you miss most about those days?
Aww, I know what you mean. Sometimes I like going through the same old photos just to get a little "me" time to remember the past. It makes it feel a little better.
That's nice of them, I wish more people did that.
That is awesome! I would love to have someone like that handy
I used to play all day as well. We would go street racing in the neighborhood with our neighbor hood gang!
I'm sure she'll make time for you to visit!
I love to be in the house by the pool
Yeah, I love to read too! I like to read a good history too, especially about plantations. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of adventure?
What did he record on your phone?
That sounds awful. Have you told her to leave it be?
Scotland seems really lonely.
That sounds pretty sad honestly... where are you from?
That's really sweet! What breed is the dog?
Aww! that sounds sweet! I'm so glad you have such an awesome dog!
Kidnapped me? That sounds terrible.
Oh no, did they take anything?
I feel the same, it's sad. Do you know any homeless people you can go to meet?
I do not like seeing them either.  What charities do your go to?
That is awesome!  Did you buy anything cool with the money?
Wow! That is awesome! I never win anything. You must have really been excited.
What were you playing it for? A free prize maybe.
Oh no, what a gross and revolting thing!
Aw that's sweet! What did the potato look like, b/c there's no potatoes on this earth anymore?
Oh gosh!  That's so annoying.  I hope you have a lock.
Oh no I can imagine. I would've been mad too!
What was it that you wanted to win
I am sorry to hear it did not turn out well for you.
Are you going to save up for a while?
I would be too, but its always a good decision when you know you can get quality ingredients
I'm sorry, I've been there before - what's wrong with your grandpa?
I can imagine, I am sorry to hear about that.
Wow, you're really coming home! Where are you from?
home country checking in!
That is an amazing accomplishment!
You sound very happy for them!
really? That's pretty brave of you. Where ya going?
Oh no! I am glad it didn't dent your bookbag!
Haha. Did the whole thing get caught on video?
What kind of skills does she have that you would consider that impressed her?
That's great. Did she get any tips from you on how to properly prepare?
what type of game are you playing?
Chicago is a pretty big city! Do you play?
That's cool! Have you done any yourself?
Oh wow that's a long time! What are you most excited for?
That is great, did you do it on your own?
Oh, that's wonderful! My husband and I did that a couple weeks ago. We were having trouble walking for a few minutes at a time, but we had a cane. It's good that your doctor is able to see things like that for you.
That's a bummer! Do you have plans on fixing the problem?
That's horrible. I hope you had someone there to call a tow truck to come fix it!
oh yeah? how much is your bid?
What is the name of the book? I may have to buy it!
That is scary! Did you chase it and knock it out of its owner's house?
I am glad that it was not hurt.
I agree! Have you worked with technology in the past?
I agree! I had an amazing experience using my smart phone a few years back
What size was the cake? Did you feel bad afterwards?
What kind of cake was it?
That is a very Lucas arts y thing to do!  You must be proud!
That's good! It's nice that you want to help when they're in trouble.
Horrible film! What was it?  Was it scary??  I've always wanted to see one
Oh no! I have not seen that one either! What was so bad about it?
I love traveling. Where do you like to eat?
That is very nice. I am glad you're happy with it. What do you grow in your area?
I feel you! That's like when you take out the trash and the can is covered in maggots! Ugh so gross!!
I know right. It's like the food industry is milking these cow-seselfs for us.
I know that feel. I had that happen with shoes today.
thats annoying
Me too, it's like they think your a police officer or something.
Me too, I wish we had lights on our dash cam to help us see the bad drivers.
Did you then keep it in the yard, or did you eventually find it?
That's really sad. I wonder if they had a family? It's really hard to know how to respond in times like that.
Oh? What kind of restaurant to you trying to open up? And is it a small business?
That's a risk you are willing to run but if its a quality place I dont sweat it
I love it when places like that do good job
That's great! I love indian food! I'm so glad they still made it! I'm not a huge fan of Indian food generally, but I do love a good chinese!
Nice. Has it improved a lot from before?
That's pretty cool. What kind of game is it?
Talk radio? I don't even know what that is. Is it some kind of noise maker?
That would make my life so annoying!
Some people are just so rude!
I would say that he is inconsiderate as well! I would just yell at him and move on.
That is a very good way to have faith. I think we are all just gonna wait and see what happens.
That's sounds like fun! What do you look to do with your time?
Wow that sounds like it will be a great time. Who is she playing with then?
Awesome! I bet you worked very hard to secure such a nice place.
Congratulations! I wish you the best of luck moving!
I do. I'm just over 30 years of married life. But when my husband gets older and gets married- it'll be nice to not have to hear his crazy crazy crazy stories when I come home!
That's pretty terrifying!  What did you do?
That's pretty nasty...I'm glad you took some precautions...bug repellants won't help you kill them, but they sure can help!
Are you worried at all about being late for your meeting?  I hope it's not as bad as you worry!  Do you have any car trouble getting to where you are going?
You are so right. Sometimes I envy drivers because they are so prepared for their long drives.
Nice, what kind of computer is it. I have a pretty big one I got around 2000 years ago and still run like new!
What a great surprise! Is it a laptop you've been wanting? Or are you just excited for the new features?
Really? What type of groceries do you want to get delivered?
It is difficult and expensive to do online!
Oh, yeah. It kind of makes you want to throw away all your hard drives, though.
Oh I've heard of this movie before! I didn't like it at all. What don't you like about the movie?
Wow, that is such a cool thing to hear about little boys.  Does he also do other things well, too?
Wow, he is really growing up, I bet it will help him along the way!
Oh yeah did you do anything cool?
Ouch! I'm sorry! I know that must hurt, but it's happened to everyone, so you're just going to feel okay about it.
Oh wow! Why didn't he tell you!
That is terrible. Did you retaliate?
Whoa! What happened?
Oh, that's terrible!  What did you do about it?
Did it bring back any good memories?
Oh that sounds wonderful. I visited Spain once, it was beautiful continent by far the best in Europe
That's nice! It's been a while since I've seen my kids. Did you have fun with the house cleaning?
That is pretty amazing! Where did yall go?
Yeah, sometimes it's fun to imagine what other people have going on, even if you don't know exactly what they have.
How was it going?
Did you have to wait forever for your turn? I always hate waiting.
How did that happen?
Oh no! How'd it get caught?
I'm sorry, is it a young dog or older one?
im sorry to hear that.
That is good to hear, cancer is the worst, so many years lost
I'm so glad you got it worked out.
Where to?
That's great! I was actually just about to ask the same question! Have yo moved before?
yea it is so nasty
That is exactly how I feel. I feel bad when people do that but at least we can trash the streets together.
That seems really isolated.
That is sad but also has it advantages too.
I'm sorry to hear that. I've spent way too much on packs on the hobby.
Wow that's terrible. Maybe they should have a lottery like they do for movies.
Oh no! I hope your dog is okay! Is it boarding because something bad or just upset?
Maybe your vet should train her to go to the beach instead?
Well I hope something comes up for you.
That's a good attitude, I wish the same for you.
How many tickets did you buy? and how many people are going to the fair?
That would be cool, what year of Mustang is it?
I would not live in your hood either! Keep your doors locked and a chainsaw if you can!!!
What are you going to do? You have to protect your family!
That sounds like a great adventure! What did you see?
wow, where did you go?
That's awesome! Did you have fun?
That must of been such a wonderful surprise then!
Oh cool! What kind of shoes?
Right footed? Can't you just wear socks with the shoes?
Did you end up doing it right?
What is your marathon distance?
Are you prepared? Are you worried?
I'm sure if you just try to be quiet it should be okay
Oh that's really frustrating. Did you manage to get it back ok?
That is really lucky. Where did you leave it?
How did that happen?
Wow, amazing! How long did it take you to memorize that?
I've been looking at a lot of my girlfriend. She's been kind of flake out lately, though. Do you have pictures of any of yours that you've been through, by chance?
That's so sad! Are you planning to buy a dash cam for your car?
Wow, that's really scary. Did they leave anything behind?
I don't know how some people can be so inconsiderate!
That's scary! I hope no one was hurt.
Oh my goodness that's horrible! I can't imagine how terrible that must have felt. How are they doing?
Wow! That's pretty amazing! I wonder how he kept going after going through that.
Wow. Deadlifting 700lbs is pretty amazing!  And I bet you were panting afterwards!
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did they have a cat cafe where you were?
That's so nice! You can make friends outside of your comfort zone.
Oh, that's terrible!  I hope it's nothing serious
Oh my, did you get nasty and run for cover?
That is so gross!
That is so inconvenient! I would take the cat to the salon.
oh no. I bet you miss him a ton!
That's sad, how old was she?
What was the song that you had like that?  Were you a kid?
Older Me? Is it an older song or an intro to another kind of MeMeMe?
Were they the same size?
Did the armadillo follow you and make you fight it?
Did you nurse it back to health and give it a splint?
Oh no! That's awful! I hope it wasn't a black racer?
Have they arrived?
Roast is one of my favorite foods, I'm glad it'll be good.
Oh that's awesome! You must have really appreciated that too!
That is great. You must really be excited and relieved!
Oh no, do you think it's going to be cancelled?
Top secret? Why do they do that? Is there something about being alone that keeps them from getting any good stuff done?
Thats sounds lonely. Do you talk often with him/her?
Do you have any friends to invite? Or do you have to do it by yourself?
I am sorry to hear that. I have had to put a dog up for adoption who was not able to find, and it is hard when it seems like no one matches.
oh wow i hope she starts feeling better soon. that's awful
Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry to hear you're having to put her down. I hope everything is OK.
That's awesome. Where to?
That sounds so fun! Where are you going cruiseishing?
That is so nice! You are lucky.
Thats great! I love cooking for people.  Im an oven but always wanted to try grill some food.  What's your favorite dishes to make?
Oh no, bad storms? That's never fun. Hopefully it cleared by Friday.
Oh my gosh, I hope that it doesn't warm up to much!
What did he do?
What? That's crazy, I would fight for that stuff back if they came after us! What are you gonna do?
I love mac and cheese, what is on it?
I like pepper, where do you find it?
What kind of necklace and shirt?
What brand did you get?
That's terrible accidents happen to everyone. Have you talked to him about it?
My thoughts and prayers are with you...I hope this little accident doesn't continue!
That sounds wonderful! You sound like a hard working individual.
It can be. But as long as you stay committed you will do fine.
Which water park?
That will be so much fun!
Yea I am in that camp right now. I love cats but it's so hot. What's the cat doing to make you feel so nice?
Awww! Sounds like a nice night!
That was a fun toy. Was it a nice toy?
What toy was it?
Congrats! That's exciting!
Congratulations! That sounds like so much fun!
What kind of job does he lose? Does he qualify?
That is horrible! I hope everything happens for you!
I'm sorry, how old was it
I'm so sorry! Losing a pet is like losing a family member I know :(
I bet she feels a lot like you when she wins!
that is very cool! I wish i could be like her.. I am still a no artist but i have gotten pretty good at learning
Sorry to hear about your car wreck. Was it your first time? How are you doing now after your experience?
Did you survive the wreck?
I hate flies so much. Did you try anything?
That's some intense turbulence!
Oh my gosh! What did the mail bring you?
I can imagine. I would have left the cat box out in the sun for days. I am sure she will get over it.
For what sport?
When do you go in for your first speech? And what do you want to say to the judge when you do it?
That is gross. Did it clean up easily?
My cat does the same thing! I have a hairball in the bathtub! It is horrifying! I am so sorry.
Oh no! That's pretty gross! Did anyone help you?
I hate being that person...I've had so many bad experiences like that. It makes me really question my own humanity
Nice. What type did you get.
Did you try any of the others types of pizza? If you like that you might need to find one with extra toppings!
Did you ever find it out?
Did you ever make it there by yourself or with a group?
Really, did anyone else hear it? Did it go off?
It's for everyone isn't it? I was surprised when I didn't have a shirt tucked into my pants by the end of the race.
That's nice. What did she do to impress you so much?
That's unfortunate. How did that turn out for ya?
That sounds nice! what did you guys eat?
That sounds so good! It is always nice to have a nice dinner cooked with care
that is not good, is the police there?
Oh, that's terrible. I'm glad there's someone you can call if you need help.
I hope your dog wasn't too upset about that. Did it make you late to get home?
Awwww. I love dogs who are dedicated
Did he turn out okay?
Did he flip it down?
That's gross!
Oh no, was her poop delicious?
What happened to the paper?
What book was it? I hope it wasn't one of those FloridaMan ones?
Nice! What was it?
What kind of things does he buy?
Yeah that's a bummer.  It seems the city messed up quite a lot over the past 10 years.  Are you living on a fixed address?
What city are in right now?
That is a good attitude.
I do! I have a girlfriend, do you?
That sounds great! I'm happy it didn't go to your crazy though!
It can be hard to find something that will loan out at the right interest.  What was wrong with it?
How long will it be until she gets it?
Lesson learned, sounds a lot like you learned a lesson for sure!
What did you do?
Haha, that's embarrassing. What kind of card was it and what were the payments for?
Thats sounds like so much fun!
Get the kids one they will love it.
That's so sad. What breed was it?
It's actually my wife that lost him not me lol! I am so sorry. It was an awful experience and i hope that you can get over it somehow!
What things aren?
I hear you on that one! Money seems to be the one thing we all have to care for.
do you like to walk around with your old friends
That is really nice to have that feeling
I do sometimes. I also use the internet for work sometimes which is great for my mental state.
I try to watch stuff on my own but I also try to find things on youtube that interest me. I like anything really, old or recent.
uh oh. I hope you didn't eat it! lol
I'm so glad you managed to get through the day! What kind of cake was it?
That sounds so awesome! What temperature did you end up turning it to, and how did you do?
Did he enjoy teaching?
did it bring a lot of memories
I can relate. It was not an easy life.
I completely understand. I have to rely on that as well. It's the only thing I can do to help get through my prayers!
Well I hope that it does as you have a lot to be grateful for :)
Oh no, that's so sad. Do you know why they were ordered so close to the new building?
Wow, they are completely out of control! Why did they do it?
What happened? Is it something on your tire?
I bet that was painful, but I'm sure you'll be okay!
Sure. What kind would you like to play?
Sure! What kind of games do you play? I used to play COD MW2
I know right. I wish I was as jealous as you are.
It really is.  Sometimes you have to earn what you can with what you know.
I did pretty good. I think I did fairly well overall. What are you studying in university?
That is great! Yes, you can do anything you put your mind to! What is your favorite thing to do?
Good so far. Would like to say it has been a pretty good day overall.
That's great news. Congratulations.
Oh no I would have been scarred for life!
Oh no! How did it hurt you?
Yes, all of the ones I enjoyed with my parents. What kind of video games did you like to play?
I sure do, I play a lot of N64 games. What are your favorites?
I'm pretty great, not the greatest since birth, but I'm loving every minute!
that's awesome, glad youre having such an awesome day!
Wow! Two dates and you still have the same key?
Wow!  I would have given it to her too, hahah!
That's disappointing
how was the sandwich? i always loved chinese
Oh no! Are you able to get it out?
Did it clean up easily?
Oh no!  Did you do anything to it.  It may be it may have still been alive and kicking.
Oh man! I am so sorry to hear that!
Oh wow! Sounds super exciting! Did you have fun?
What are you talking about?  Did something in particular make you nervous?  Was it scary in general?  That sounds exciting!
How did it go?
How did it go?
Did they enjoy it?
LOL!  I guess you were hungry after all!  Did you ask your flatmate to buy you more?
Did you hurt your self?
You're braver than I am for this very reason! I'm scared to jump out of planes
That is a very nice thing to say.
Yes it is really difficult and expensive to do that. Bullies are horrible and should not have their presence in our society.
I do. I have several game rigs in the works right now.
I do not, I don't really game.
Did you like her too much to risk rejection?
Oh wow!  I would be very apprehensive as well, but I would be thinking the same things about any given relationship - it doesn't make it any less true.
Oh how fun! Do you remember what happened?
I bet it did.. always good to go through those
and did it go well?
That's cool. I don't use ice.
How did that go for her
That is amazing and also very nice of you! How old is she?
Oh wow, I hope he takes care of it.
What are these crypto-note cards? Do you have any idea what I should do with them?
Oh really? Well if you're not in a rush I can totally understand
Well hopefully that day will never come! Maybe go skydiving in the future!
Oh no! I noticed when I got home from work today!
That's hilarious!  Did anyone notice?
Did this person at least ask for insurance?
Holy moly! Sounds like someone needs a taste of their own medicine.
How old is he now? Use that with him as a personal lesson
I'm sure you'll be fine! Don't let it bother you too much!
Oh wow. 12 Years! That's a long time! Are you still the same job?
That's a long work term. Do you get to enjoy it every day?
Awesome! I'm glad you're happy with it. What's your favorite part of the job?
That sounds awful! Did you get on and go on the next flight?
Thats great. Its nice to have some peace in this rough week!
What was in your stomach?  Did you get sick?
OMG! I have never been so jealous! I would be too!
Sounds like fun. Did you do anything with your siblings while you were on the vacation?
Old places and memories can bring about a lot of happy emotions too. I'm glad you were able too. :) Where was the place you went?
Oh, my goodness! That's so sad!
That is so sad.   I am glad you feel your friend was really hurt.   What happened?
Did you like the sing?
You are very lucky to have such an awesome wife!
Marriage is the most important thing ever.
I'm happy for you!
I hope you didnt lose a lot of money.  Its a very expensive habit.
It is really sad. I have lost many
That's amazing! What did they offer?
What is Second harvest? I have not heard of it.
That is awesome. It is nice to be happy
That's wonderful! I am glad to hear that. You must be quite content at the moment.
That's cool. What makes you happy now?
Oh no! That's an awful feeling! What happened next.
I would hate to have to do that.  Were you able to get a good deal on a new one before the accident?
I understand. You can spend a lot for less.
That's a rough one! I'm glad you're ok.
I am sorry to that. I bet it was embarrassing for you
Ahh, I get it now! You shouldn't be ashamed though! It's a healthy celebration of the accomplishment you've made!
I know how that is, I also have that issue.  What country do you live in?  I hope they have it here!
I do that too! I ordered something a few weeks back and when it got here the other day, there was a little box with the tracking info for the next step but it wasn't in the actual package.. I checked that all day yesterday!
Awwww.. that's so sad. I'm sorry for your loss..
Aww that is so hard.  I am so sorry :( What was she that you had with you her whole life?
That sounds like so much fun!!!
Aww that's so nice! That sounds like so much fun!
thats the worst, when i see parents like that i feel so bad for them
That's hard, I'm sorry.
I am sorry you dont have more
That's awesome! What was the project?
That's a lot of boilerplate. Did it take a long time to learn?
That's good, it's always good to be prepared
I'm sorry that you have to deal with that.   Have you seen one doctor so far?
It is good that you have a healthy and happy life.
Well, I suppose that's partly why it was stressed and not because you ate too much. We all over eat when it comes to food and it's unhealthy, so don't feel bad for doing it when it should have been natural to overeat even when stressed. It can all even out eventually.
Well, you cheated and got a taste of his, that's for sure
That's exciting!  I hope you do well on your exam!
It will go fine, just relax and do your best!
Oh well that's ok.  Did they make an exception to thedule?
Happy belated birthday.  Was it a long day at work?
It's good to have a good family. Do they live close by?
Being healthy is so important!
oh my, sorry to hear that
Sorry for the loss of your sweet beast, are you doing better now?
Did you research the model and choice of features before making the purchase?
What kind of car is it. I never liked buying cars because you spend so much time getting them.
I'm so lucky! How long have you two be together?
That's great! I'm glad he was there for you!
Oh my! How clean it really was! I'm guessing you didn't see it, or maybe you didn't see who she lived with? Either way, pretty unlucky.
That is the best part of that,  I bet that was so embarrassing
That's going to be so much fun! Do you have any family there?
That's awesome! I live in MD but when we get to go to Virginia it makes plans a little easier to make! What are you planning on seeing there?
That is so sweet of him!  I'm sure he appreciated it!
I'm so sorry to hear about your father's passing. That's an incredible knife to have!
I'm sorry to hear that.  I assume that you're trying to have children in a way that's sustainable.
That's good. Children are a big investment which you should be very worried about.
Nice. Did you think the interview went well?
Congrats! What job did you get?!
I am glad you are feeling better about yourself now.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that! I've never lived out of mine but I know I know I'm not superman like most people
wow. You must be quite experienced with this subject
wow that must be so difficult to let go of all of that fix you just gave
Really? How old were they and were they good? lol
I love those movies. His movies always make me feel like I'm getting older!
Oh no! Were you able to change right away?
No they didn't, that is hilarious. Well at least no one called you out on it, thats good! lol
Are you a dancer?
Wow, that takes a lot of hard work! Good luck!
Oh no. Did anyone notice?
Were they unzipped or did you have some sort of medical emergency
What are the questions for?
Sometimes you need a gut feeling like you might get the job done. Did it work out for you?
That's really good that it's there for you to stay on top of things like that.
That's good! It's hard to stay motivated sometimes when everything feels like going against the grain sometimes.
How do you feel like it is helping?
Sounds like a challenge! How long do you train?
Slowpoke you are!  Do you try yoga or home runs?
That's quite an avid hobby, you must have a lot to be happy about.  Do you drink milk everyday?
That's the point!  Don't you get it?!  You're making the protein for your muscles so it feels good to look and look and do things!  Do it without the milk, that's bad...
Nice! Sounds like you're lifting hard!
Nice! I have worked out before but never on a machine.
Ooof. Did you hurt them?
Oh no that is so painful, is he ok though?
Oh, what did chad say to that?
Oh, that's awkward. I hope you can make up your decision, though! You seem upset about it, but you probably already decided.
Did you finish?
What were you eating at the buffet?
cheese cake? what? is that like the gouda cake?
20 dollars?  What was the cake for?!
Wow, you must be very strong.
What are you waiting for to eat?
I've heard of that, is it by Cameron?  Do you like it?  I didn't like it too much as a kid
I've never heard of it, but my friends and I always watch.  Is it good?
Smoking definitely can make you lose your temper and it definitely can be addictive to some level.. so I understand that. But it's better for everyone to do that than to be miserable and in a bad way. It will be a process for sure, but you got to start from a beginning.
Wow that's actually a pretty interesting place to visualize... where everything is possible?  Congrats! How'd you do that?
Did you get the job?
Oh wow! That sounds challenge enough to me!
What kind of things do you do?
Oh really, you have skills.
It is good to be content in life.
i love doing chest work. it feels good and gives me an awesome pump too.
Oh no, did you punish your cat?
He should clean his shoes.
That was sweet of your roommate.
Glad you are okay! I had an emergency have and had a friend help me carry me to the ER.
I'm sorry that it did that. Do you talk often?
I'm so sorry. That's so sad. I hope it wasn't too painful of a break up for you.
Crying helps us discover new areas in our lives
I've never cried that much.  Are you depressed, or just sad?  It helps to remember life isn't fair.
Eww! Sounds so gross! What did you do to it?
Oh my goodness! I could imagine the smell would be horrible!
I'm right there with you! How long have you been eating this food, man? I can relate...my husband refuses to clean up after himself even though I tell him it's the least I can do for him lol.
You can always do it slowly, and as you loose more you can do it more!
Good memory. Moon landing was in 1969 right?
Wow thats interesting!  Do we now have plans to colonize Mars?  I am pretty sure they have plans to colonise the oceans also if I recall.
Oh that's great. Do they look like puppies or do they look tiny?
Congratulations! That is so awesome!  litter box disasters are the worst.
That's always a fun surprise! Did you go often?
Easter eggs are the best.  Did you guys get to play all these games with them?
Really! Did you research the stuff before you ate? How did it turn out?
cloves are never bad. You'll be okay
That's terrible! What book was it?  Did it rain on your friend?
Oh no, what book were they talking about
oh that's annoying. Did they give you a reason?
Its okay, karma will come
That's so sweet! I love seeing dresses that evoke emotions!
That's so beautiful!
Why did you decide to go?
Oh no! I hate the dentist! It can be hard.
The good and bad parts?
Thats so good to have the internet forever
Yeah I just had the chance to look at a lot of my friends cat who got hit by a car this past week
I am with you on that one! I don't know what I would do if I had to be an animal
Oh man! Is he okay?
That is terrible, I'm sorry for your loss
Nice. Not much to stress out over. Life?
I know what you mean, I had to live with my mom and brother all the time because we were the youngest
Really?! So you experienced a reunion or reunion of sorts?
I know the feeling too well. It's the only thing I have left of my grandparents after they passed away several years ago.
That is great. You studied hard.
Congrats! How do you think it went overall?
What car? You let your teeny teeny do anything? That is very dangerous!
I am glad you were not reckless and left it hanging there!
Wow thats great!
That is awesome! I wish I had that drive!
Uh oh, did you find out what was it?
Uh oh! What was it?
That's awesome! I love to hear that!
That's awesome! What do you do for that?
That's great! What do you do to mediate?
That is great! What helped you with the meditating? Did you have to do a breathing meditation?
Why do you think that is
Why do you think he will do that? Is he not in a relationship anymore?
How long has he been working with you?
That is good, tennis is really fun
How did you find out that they were dishonest?
That's really terrible! How did you find out what she was dishonest about?
Why? What happened?  Were your happy times spent mostly in the library?
Yeah I agree, I miss most of that as well.
Oh no! How are you doing after the surgery?
Being immobile is not the endall be, I am glad you got back on your feet
thats cool that it makes you stronger! what do you run?  running jiu jitsu or weight lifting cardio?
I love going to the gym too. What do you like to do on it?
Parents can be so intimidating at times. I'm glad you worked it out.
I am right there with you on that one
That is so sad.
Oh no I'm sorry to hear that, I love my dog to death and would mourn with her every day
I am so sorry to hear about what happened. How did it end up happening?
I am sorry about that, I know it is hard
Oh my, how are cats nowadays after the surgeries?
That's terrible, I'm sorry. animals are so precious!
Oh wow. That's a big cat! What breed is it?
That's good to hear that they didn't take it to far
Did everything turn out ok after the due date?
I can imagine it was stressful and hard!  Are you ok now, at least?
Awwww yea!!!  I'm jealous!  I'm taking summer courses at the college I want to go to and I can't wait to get my hours back!  What are you studying that you don't mind studying?!
Try to relax during the week and get out of your comfort zone during the school semester!
What an awesome surprise! I bet she was so surprised to see you!
I'm sorry that it didn't work out.
What kind of dress is it?
That sounds fun! What kind of party?
Congradulations
Congratulations! It's always a great feeling when you can say that "I can do anything " in a race.
Oh nice! Do you think you will take that opportunity?
Thats awesome. I hope you get it.
I can't imagine having to take an exam for an entire year!  Were you prepared for sure?
That is very wise advice. Hard work always pays off.
Oh no! How young is he/she? I hope he/she was just clumsy.
Oh damn! That's not cool at all!
Well, that's good to hear! Did you call him up to make a phone call?
It's always nice to get a chance to reminisce about the good ole times! Are you guys still friends?
nothing better than relaxing! nothing can stop me from doing that!
Sounds like the ultimate plan!  You're a genius!  I would have totally done the same.
that is horrible i'm sorry you have that nightmare!
I'm sorry you're having these dreams and it can't get better. Have you thought about getting therapy?
I'm sorry, I know how that feels. I recently bought my first home, only about 6 miles away. I think its even worse that you can't even buy groceries or clean your house.
I'm in the exact same boat. My friend just bought a place and has yet to sell, which makes me feel even more stressed.
Sounds nice
That sounds really awesome! What are some of your favorite movies?
That sounds really cool! Did you guys catch up or get to do stuff?
I am glad it brought back some memories
Oh wow. What happened?
I am sorry to hear that! They sound very rude and it seems your boss didn't care that you were so inconvenient!
That is good to hear! I hope it doesn?t change anything!
I am glad you are learning from your past bad experience and moving forward
I do not like either of those things
I agree. Its really frustrating and annoying when a person pretends to be innocent until proven guilty
Wow, that's strange. What was it that they found?
I would confront them about it if i was you!
That's awesome! I'm not even supposed to be able to rock climb!
That sounds like so much fun, but I would freak if I were in your position. I am terrified of even the smallest things!
Oh, that's awful! What happens during the night?
I am so sorry you had dreams like that. Have you thought of going to a therapist to help you deal with these issues?
thats great
You sound so motivated! I would be if I was as ripped as you!
That is wonderful! I am so happy that your pregnancy was successful! I am having a girl soon!
I'm pleased to hear. You must be a very sentimental person.
Wow that's pretty cool!
Wow! that is quite the trick! You must be quite proud of yourself!!
I can understand where you're coming from. Start hanging out with people more often and try and make friends where you are. You'll make friends where you'll fit in, I'm sure.
You can always make new ones online! Start making friends with your friends!
You'll be okay. Just make sure to have a lot of breaks. What are you majoring in?
You will do great I am sure!
What do you think is the issue that you are having with your girlfriend?
No, I don't have any romantic interest.
Yes indeed! The bugs that gather all around us in the summers are a real danger! What are you going to do about them?
I'm so glad I'm not as scared of those as you are.
I am happy that you are doing well
It's a difficult situation to be in but I'm really there for you.
That's awesome!  How long were you guys driving
That must've been quite a journey for you all!
Oh no. That's awful! I hope you had good insurance.
That's no good, are you ok?
That's hard. It sounds like you're trying hard to give the best to her, but she's probably reading it back at you. How has it been going, though?
Patience is very helpful, I'm glad you have a way to improve your relationship.  I'm sure it has it's advantages too.  How are things with your partner?
Have you taught her to be more friendly with other rats?
That's amazing! I'm glad it's working out for you.
Thats awesome! I love Six Flags! What did you ride?
Thats awesome! I love taking my kids there.
I hope it isn't! Have you talked to your vet about it?
Oh no!  Have you thought of getting a second cat?
That is a terrible thing to happen.  You must feel terrible about it!
Oh no. You must feel terrible. How did she say that?
Oh no! That must've been horrible!
Oh man that sucks! Did you get them back?
I'm sorry. I hope she comes back to earth.
Don't be nervous. She's your bestfriend after all.
Oh nice! I'd love to have a new music sound like yours! What kind of music do you listen to?
What kind of music do you like to listen to?
Oh man! I've heard it's quite fascinating!
Wow, I've never heard of that. When do you go?
I agree. I think we are in the right place at the right amount.
You know what they call a tude?
Really scary?  Were you alright?
Oh yeah? I've been to that place a few times. You were scared at least?
haha funny how that works. Did your brother say something?
That's disgusting. Did your brother notice?
Oh that's sad to here of. Sorry for the loss. Was this recently?
Oh, that's so sweet! What a wonderful memory. It's wonderful how memories like that are repeated so vividly in our lives.
thats awesome! what a nice person!
Oh, wow!  I bet that will be so fun!!  What do you have planned?!
What are you cooking up for the family?
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  My mother-in-law was placed in hospice recently too - she's not going to make it.  What happened?
That is horrible. I feel so bad for her and her family
It is really difficult to deal with someone with an Alzheimers. She is lucky to have a great partner in life though.
Sounds like you got reallyDrizzled! Did you have to uber?
I can't stand driving in busy roads! I try to only drive when there is nobody around
How does he deal with it?
That is so sad to hear. I am really sorry to hear that. I hope he gets well soon.
It's natural that people want to meet people. I would feel the same way!
I feel you man. It feels good to be loved.
What happened then? Did he start something new?
I would tell the husband if she said no take the blame.
Oh, man, I hope you didn't get embarassed
Oh man. That's super gross, but that is the story for me, too.
ohh, thats so sweet. You are making my mouth water!
What are the numbers?
Disneyland? why would you feel bad? that's a wonderful holiday
Disneyland is so fun! I went there as a child and as an adult I loved it. Maybe you should try and do it with your kid too! Haha!
How cool! How long did you have to stay for?
That sounds really amazing! How did it make you feel when you were going to Washington?
You sound excited about that, are you?
That's awesome! She's a lucky lady!
Oh, that sounds fun! Have you been looking forward to it for a long time, or are you just excited to get out and meet some of y'all again?
Wow. I'm sure she felt bad for awhile but I bet she was proud.
Oh my, I am glad you are ok!!
Oh no! Is everyone ok, is your city lucky? Did any damage to your house?
Man that's awful, I hope you didn't get much damage. What hurricane was it?
That is a good reason to stay faithful.
That's a good reason.  vegetarianism is a life long decision.
Wow, thats pretty bad... Did you give her a make over?
I would have grounded too! Kids can be such drunks!
What is it for?
That's good. Hopefully, you will do great on it.
Why is that?? is she looking away??
Aww I'm sorry. That's sweet
How nice of him. Did he give you a raise that big?
Wow that's great! You must be feeling quite happy about the situation!
I'm so sorry to hear that.  What happened?
I'm so sorry. That's awful. Have you tried talking to anyone about how you feel?
You should have a friend over and make new connections!
I understand that completely, I have been in a similar situation, I have a friend in San Francisco and it's a pretty big city too, so I understand how you feel! Keep your head up - you are doing something right if you have people to confider you!
Oh no what happened
That's a shame. I'm sure everything went well in the end. You should celebrate by going out for drinks on the weekends.
shes a lucky lady
That is crazy! I hope she took it somewhere to be saved. Maybe on an SD or something?
oh yeah? what were they like then?
Oh I remember those. I had an extra set of Bic pens that I used when I was in middle school and found out I didn't have the real kind
How soon are you expecting to sell it?  Are you anticipating a big increase in the asking price?
That's a lot of people, did you see it recently?
That's a shame. Did she reschedule?
I'm sorry. That's always disappointing. Hopefully you can make the trip at some point in the future.
That is nasty. What did she do to cause it? Was it a diaper rash?
That sounds disgusting!  My sister would make me feel sick just because she can do things like that!  What did she do?  Is she sick?
Did anything happen or was it just the mechanic giving you a hard ride?
Sorry to hear that! That's awful, what did you have to fix it?
How many memories do you have of when your kids were in school?
i agree!
What did you eat for this breakfast?
Omg! I have done that more than once, I feel bad.
oh no. i am so sorry to hear about that.
im sorry to hear about that, im sure it has hit you hard but keep the faith that everything works out for the best
OMG! I would be SO stunned! How did you react? I bet it was really crowded!
Oh that's sweet! I love chik fil-a breakfast! It's just so convenient and quick to get to work.
I'm so sorry! I hope soon things start looking positive for you.  I know it's probably tough right now, but I'm so confident in God's goodness!  And He'll bless all of you.
It's really a pity that you're in that position right now!  I hope you'll get the good news soon!
What book was it?
ah that stinks.. what book was it?
Oh, I'm so sorry! I"m so sorry! Did your family not invite you?
I am sorry to hear that. Did they say when you called them that they had heard from your sister yet?
It is nice to not have worry in life.
i agree with everything you just said
Hahahaha I've done things like that. Did you laugh or were you embarrased?
Oh no, were you able to laugh about it at all?
How come?
That is weird.
I'm sorry for the loss, I hope he was a good grandpa.
That's very nice of the representatives, they must have felt very sentimental
That was nice of him. Did he trust you not to take it?
That's good that your dad is a good parent!
What happened?
That's pretty messed up.  I hope you didn't wake them up in the morning and have them telling the whole truth to what you said.
That's really sweet! You sound like a great friend to these guys!
That sounds like a wonderful thing for them to enjoy. It sounds like you really love helping them.
Oh how cute! What breed?
That's awesome!  I love dogs, so that's what caught me off guard.  How long did you have him for?  Is he small now?
Wow, that is a big shock!  How did you feel when you found out!?
That is terrible. I feel really bad that my wife would do something like that.
Soda is addicting to some extent. How did he quit?
That is really impressive! It is hard to quit cigarettes, I am surprised that you were able to get through.
I'm glad it didn't lead to anything too bad
Sometimes it's hard to tell if someone is being honest and understandable. It could be they're being cruel or it could be they're just being self-aware. Either way, I hope everything works out in the end somehow.
That sounds like it would be fun to go through and find some more good ones to play with, maybe some old siblings can play with you? lol
I've never heard of Red alert, but I love those kind of games! Sounds like fun.
Oh no! That's not cool. I am sure that you deserved the turn though.
That is really frustrating. I am sure there is another position open.  Did they give you a reason?
I know the feeling. Sometimes you got to make those changes to keep yourself moving forward.
I can relate... Getting busy in life can be very hard but it can also be incredibly rewarding as well.
That sounds like it would be fun! Have you been river walking before?
That is amazing.  Where did you buy that?
That's amazing! I hope you're able to afford that for your wife!
That's awesome, I'm so jealous. Hopefully when it is time for it for you that you can take some fun photos
I do too actually.
That was very generous of you. You must have a very good friend
Oh that's terrible! I'm so sorry! How long has it been?
I'm so sorry to hear that. I love dogs.
It's great to have family out there pushing you harder. That said, if I didn't have family pushing me, I'd probably not like it as much as you do :)
That is amazing! I wish I could be like that with my kids, I feel like that would be paradise.
Aw that sucks. Did they have another plan?
That is sad.
Oh no! I hate when that happens, but I hope everything turned out alright.
You'll get it next time, friend.
Did you get in an accident or did someone hit you?  Did the police catch you?
That is hilarious and terrible! hahahaha
Have you gone to a doctor to see what might be causing this
What do people usually put in those repair vacuums?
Oh cool! What kind of car?  Does he like driving it?
What a cool surprise! What kind of car?  Did it work or anything?
Oh wow. Did they catch the guy?
thats crazy! i hate that!
That is so wonderful!
That's really sweet of you to be so there for her. You sound like a great presbyterian.
That's awesome! You're setting an example, I hope he sticks with it!
Wow, Zelda must be one of the best video games of all generation!
That sounds awesome!  Congrats!  What do you do to keep yourself and your family busy?
That is awesome, I am glad to hear that.
Were you looking at the wrong photos? lol
Its a great feeling to look back on the days gone by
Aretha Franklin died a long time ago, she was a singer.
Aretha Franklin passed away?  That's a pretty interesting statement.  I haven't heard that yet actually
That sounds delicious.
Oh man, sausage rice is the bomb!
Oh no! Is everything clear for you?
That's really rough. It's hard for kids to have kids if they're in stressful circumstances.
Thats awesome! Congratulations
You did! I hope they don't cut you loose.
That's great. Are you going to surprise some one at the school or just see how well they do?
Thats a good start.  Do you have a party?
That's really sad. Bullies are terrible!
It's tough to watch as an adult. It's hard to see how one kid is so mean to another. But it's good she is learning and making changes to protect herself and her family. So much better that she wasn't raised in a bad environment.
By how much, if i may ask?  please tell me about this
Wow, that's brave of you! How'd things go?
Oh no! I hope he recover soon!
I hope that you were able to do everything that you could to care for her.
Are you going to keep it?
Are you roommates a boy or a girl?
Wow, cello must be really good! Did you win your competition?
Wow, cello is a pretty complex music instrument! You must be very talented!
Oh wow! I'm so sorry! Did you feel humiliated?
Oh wow, I hope it wasn't serious!
I am sorry, you seem to be broken up for good reasons.  How are you holding up?
I can see why it's so difficult for women to leave abusive men. You're absolutely right about his motivation. He doesn't have to make the decisions, but at least he's honest about making them. I hope you're getting out of the relationship, though. That speaks volumes to both about your personality and your
I'm sure he meant break ups usually last for a long time.  If you two are getting along well you should just keep doing it!
That seems like a crazy reason to throw away the best guy. Maybe it's a smokeshow situation.
I hate when that happens! You should have taken pictures and posted on the web!
That sucks! I would've been SO upset.
That was nice. Did he babysit your kid well?
That's awesome. How old is your friend?
Kids can be such good actors/ singers/models/eaters- I'm glad you were able to have a great time with your kid!
That's gross. Did you go straight for the shore or did you do it by yourself?
That must've been really gross, and sad to see.
its never too late. You can sign up now and start training on friday.
Just be confident in your ability! It's not like you have to do anything crazy to win the game!
What happened to your dog?
Oh that's a lot, did you have to have surgery?
Nintendo are known for having some of the best customer service in the world!
That's a really good win!  What are you going to do with your Switch?
how long has it been since you last spoke with him?
That's good that you have a friend like her.
what happened after that? did he/she get you and what did he or she do?
That's a real example of family versus an idea someone came up with. It sounds like you had a big influence and influenced your cousin for life!
Oh that's a cool gift. I'm sure it'll last you a long time!
Maybe she will give it back to you as a gift?
That's pretty cool.  Did you guys celebrate?
That's awesome. I wish I could do something cool like that.
Whoa that's terrible! Did you at least get some security cameras?
Oh no. Did they damage anything else?
hahaha I'm glad someone made a connection. You're not the only person who thought that, I've seen similar blankets pass by in passing. It could be that you are reconnecting with an old buddy.
Maybe you will get lucky next time
Awww, how nice of you! I'm still too young to understand how special that day was.
Thats awesome! Sounds like its a great day to be alive!
What zoo was it?
That sounds so sad and sad!
I'm so excited! How long will it be free?
That is very exciting!  I can see why it'd be kinda boring though :)  Are you excited?
Where are you moving?
Where did you move?
What happened next
Hahahahahah I would've been busy trying to figure out how to respond... But I'm glad it worked out for you.
Well that's nice. Are you really interested in doing this?
that's very kind of you to help them. are they hiring?
That's awesome! I hope to win someday. What is the drawing for?
What is gonville?
Was it a dragon tooth?
What kind of sword it was?
Are you going to go on a vacation?
I love being organized and prepared! I think being organized and careful is so much better than being rushed.
Oh no! Did you file a police report?
Oh my gosh! That's terrible! Was anyone else hurt? That's so dangerous! Hopefully, insurance covers your car -- if not, that's even worse! Were you able to claim any damage at all?
Awww. I bet that was so special.
That is a crazy memory. Did she remember you picked her up?
Is it a large amount? How much do you want for it?
That's good. Sometimes older money is better than new money.
wow thats horrible
That trash man must have felt really bad. It's his turn to throw it though.
News about what?
I feel ya. Waiting is no fun! What's the news?
Oh man!  I'm so sorry!  What happened??
I'm sorry.  I hope it's not too bad.
I would have lol
Oh that's disgusting! I would have been so sick! I am so sorry!
Where to? tell me where and when!
where are yall moving?
That is so sad. You should get a second opinion from someone higher up.
Oh no! What book was it? I am so sorry to hear that.
Were those the good kind of memories
A pit bull, I'm not too sure. Did you find out what breed?
That's great! Did you find a good place?
Congratulations! Statistics are pretty fun!
Good luck! Do you think you will do well on it?
That's good. Your hard work is paying off!
Why did you lend it to a friend? You must feel bad about it!
Oh no! What did he end up doing with it?!
It sounds like you've got a great job lined up for when you're retireable. I'm sure your family and friends are excited for you.
Those are great jobs to have.
I'm no public relations major, but I've done a few things for companies.
How do you feel about the call?
What is the job for? That must be pretty exciting!
Friends are so useful in new places, it can be hard sometimes leaving behind so many people. How is your new place?
That is true.. It takes time.. But good friends are always there to support you.
I feel your pain. I have so much to choose from right now as well. What brand do you like?
Exactly! I usually go for new if there is a good alternative. I hate paying extra for something I've used before! I do it all the time. I always end up getting the good stuff!
Same here. I love just sitting at home and watching tv. No need to rush anything!
Staying inside a bit won't do much anyway.
I'm so sorry. I know it's probably for the best but it's hard when they're so close.
That's awful, I'm very sorry to hear about your loyal companion... Have you thought about getting another dog?
Are you going to be ready for a tropical storm?
Sounds like fun! Are you a diver?
That's really nice of her!
She sounds so wonderful and caring! I'm so glad that you have such a great wife.
Oh wow that sounds serious. Has this happened in the past with you as well?
That's so gross! I would just be sad that it was an accident.
Those cokers always seem to mess me up!  What were you going to get instead?  I've always wanted some diet dr. Pepper lol.  What were you trying to get?  Some diet dr. Pepper?  And were they bad?  I've never tried diet dr. Pepper, so if
That is hilarious and frustrating.  I hope they got you.
Wow, 14?!  That's amazing!  It's hard to imagine life without the kids these days!
Awww, yeah kids can be a handful! Hopefully they don't grow up to be jeans or something lol
Dang! That's a good morning snack! What kind of pancakes did she make?
pancake holes are a favorite of mine. I love bacon, too! What kind of pancakes were they?
That's really nice! You are a lucky lady!
Exactly! I would never cheat my wife like that!
Oh my goodness! Why do you think he won't?
That is a really big secret to keep.  I hope he says the big surprise when the time is right!
That is so nice of you. Being a great friend should help her in any difficult situation.
Thats great that you are trying your best to help.
I am happy that you were there to help your neighbor! What type of car is it?
I would love to have that
I have an subaru brat myself! Such a great car!
I have never won a scratch off!
Oh no. I guess she didn't have a very good childhood? It is pretty bad when a kid wears diaper all day.
That is unfortunate. It happens.
What toy did he want? A football or something else?
what toy is it
That's awesome. I've never cruised on my own! Where are you going??
That sounds amazing!  Where are you going!
Oh man. Was it a long drive. Im not super far from you
That's terrible! I hope he's alright.
Maybe they have changed some since you last visited.
That's good. I am happy it has worked out that way for you! I know you wouldn't want to do anything differently
Why junk food?
I do that too! Sometimes I'll do jello or spaghetti with meat sauce, too. Don't beat yourself up about it though! You're doing God's work
Nice!  Did you guys have a good time and get a good laugh at the same time
That is so sweet.  I bet he loved every minute!
That's awesome! I bet she was proud too.
That's wonderful! I was never the athletic type but my mom was an awesome volleyball coach!
That is terrible! Did it turn out ok?
that is terrible, i'm so sorry to hear about this, is it possible to have your arm completely limb free, or is it still very painful?
That's terrible. I hope she feels better soon!
That's not good. What is her doctor saying? That it could be something serious.
That sounds so relaxing!  What's his name?
That sounds like you got some pretty great cats!
How did it go
Those job previews give you so much hope and excitement and uncertainty. You will know on Monday.
did you like it?
sounds nice
lol....that is funny. Did they get busted?
I bet you wanted to vomit!
Did you enjoy it?
Thats awesome. I wish i could afford to go skate park.
Well, that sounds like he's a good dad!
disability is the worst!
What did you have to meet him for? Was it a good thing or a problem?
Psychiatrist here. Have you had trouble meeting with them?
Oh really? That must have made you a bit anxious? Were you able to relax during this time?
Aw, that's cute! Mine started a few weeks ago. I'm sure it will get a bit busier soon.
Did you enjoy the visit?
That is the worst. I hate when that happens. Did they reschedule the trip?
that must've been aggravating
That is so annoying! How was the service?
Oh, that's too bad. I am sure that was tough.  Were you close to him?
It hit you pretty hard I bet, I am so sorry for your loss
Cool, where did they go?
wow that's cool, i bet it will be an awesome trip for you. where are they flying to?
college? why is it better this time?
That's cool. I haven't seen most of my friends in person in years.
That sucks.. group text is the best way to find people
That was really nice though
That is really irritating. Did she apologize at all to you or let you make up your own story?
Oh no! What happened afterwards?
That is terrible. Did they get in fights?
I'm sorry you had to witness that.
Oh no. I'm so sorry. That's one of my biggest pet peeves too. No niece but I'm so tired of paying bills. Kids just ruin life for everyone.
Oh no, that is hard! I'm really sorry to hear that. Maybe next time?
Nice, school starts today for my little girl!
What an amazing feeling! Isn't it nice to not have to wait until school to go?
how did it turn out
I bet you were anxious. Did everything turn out ok?
I'm so sorry for your loss, but remember he has always loved you and will always love you unconditionally
That is so sad to hear! It is hard to be in those situations and seeing the other side of it.
What kind of games?
That must make you feel very nostalgic.
That's awesome! I'm sure you'll catch something cool! What are you fishing for?
That's really neat! What are you going to get?
What are you playing?
Sounds like a fun time! What are you most excited for?
why were they coming?
I imagine, but I'm glad they're visiting!
What gift are you asking for?  What makes you so excited?
What gift are you asking for?
That is terrible. What did you do to stop it?
That's disgusting! Have you tried talking to your neighbor about what is happening?
That sounds like a lot of fun! I am actually jealous of you. You sound very prepared.
Where do you live? I live in the south.
Oh my goodness that sounds terrifying. Did you find out what it was?
That's so awesome. I love waking up in the middle of the night to hear strange sounds like break in or fire or police or what have you. I live alone though.
Has it rained that often in the past? I remember the same thing happening when I was a student in Athena. Did they get it repaired?
oh no. Keep doors boarded up and someone will watch them out!
That's disappointing. What flavor was it?
Haha, that's funny! Yeah, it's no wonder some things taste terrible! I'm sorry that you were let down!
I hope it went well! Did the job come with a better job, or did you find another one?
Yea I think you're onto something there.
Me too! They are the best aren't they?  What's your sweet tooth?
Oh yea, I love those too! But I'm more of a creamsicle man myself.
Do you remember the first day or the year she was born?  Did you cry?
That's so sweet!
It's great that you're teaching her the ropes!
That is so cool. It sounds like you are a great parent.
Oh man. I have no idea what that is
I can understand that. Dean's French Onion Dip is one I've never had, and I'm not even close.
Congradulations.  I am also looking for an upgrade.  Is it a raise?
Congratulations! That sounds like you've done a great job. Is this something that your company are anticipating?
Is it a pay bump?
Well I wish both ways. I bet you did everything you could and probably got the promotion.
That's a tough position to be in, but I'm happy you're making some money, and hopefully that gives you some relief from stress!
Why did you feel they needed to take care of that?  Did they get off with some fines?
That sounds horrible.  I would feel so awful if I were in charge of any jail.  Do they have to take the punishment themselves?
Wow, I can remember my dad watching that. Was he very proud?
That must have thrilled you when it happened!
Oh I know that feeling.  Were you on a schedule or were you home schooled?
kids are fun but i do miss my 9 month old also being around all the time!
That is definitely the way to look at it!  It will be nice when they are all grown up and no more worries of theirs.
I would have been so annoyed!
That's so gross! I would freak out if something had a stench or rottenous stench!
What a bunch of cowokers.
What type of farm do you live on?
I know. I feel like I'm one of the luckiest people ever when I rescue an animal!  Sometimes I have to rescue the most horrible things...but it's good when I get to help others too.
Yeah it is really ridiculous the amount of people that get into animal shelters and abuse them, and I agree the bond should have been much higher.
That's cool. I hope he's right.
What a nice and motivating kid coach!
Me too. We went to get some laundry and now it's just us. Hbu
Lol.  Kids go back to school???  That's a first for me!
50 and 59.  Both mustaches!
Aww, are they coming back to visit you?
Haha! I feel the same way! It can get pretty monotone if you're all alone.  What are you planning on doing?
Were you able to get him inside.
That must have been very scary.  Glad you got him back.
I'm sorry to hear this. Are you ok taking care of the little guy/her?
That is terrible, I hope everything went okay
That is awesome, kids are so awesome!
Sounds like she might be one of the luckiest girls on this earth.
oh no, that is horrible. what did you do?
Oh man, that is a tough situation to be in. Did she speak to her teacher, or did they just tell her that band fees went to your tuition?
I am so sorry to hear about that. Were you able to get the money back?
That is good, divorce can be very expensive.
I am so sorry to hear that, I am glad you escaped it.
That happened with my wife, it is crazy the amount of people on both ends!
Did it bring shame on your family?
Wow. Did she laugh about that with you?
What movie?
Oh no! Did it ruin your plans?  Did it make you upset?  What was the movie about?
That's a stupid reason to cut your ties.
That's terrible!  I hope you had someone come in and fix that problem for you!  That's so messed up
I can understand that. It can be difficult to find someone to work from home.
Hahaha that's funny! I feel you. At least with my son he doesn't have the energy to drive me anywhere!
Those butterflies are always good. What are you going to be looking for in the air?
Where is the date? Is she taking you out or taking a trip out with your friends and family?
ewww.ye same thing. did you give it back
Oh that is so gross! Did you try eating it without the worm in it?
Wow! Did you try to scare her away? Sheesh what a size difference.
Oh wow! Did you try to scare it away?
What type? Is he a mutt of some sort?
Thats an awesome name charlie!
It's alright, pie is good
Eww. Maybe you shouldn't do that again.
I would have totally jumped out of my skin! I hate snakes so much, especially ones with sharp be heads! Did you get hurt doing it, at least?
I hate snakes soooo much! Did it hurt you?
That is crazy! I hope you are ok.
How much did you get
Nice! I hope they gave it to you in the form of a check?
That really sucks! Did they have a good reason? Were you really alone?
That's too bad, are you going to see someone new?
I would love to try and grow an overwatch plant! How big was the plant?
I love butterflies! What kind of photo were you using for it?
how gross! did you say something?
Hahaha that's so disgusting! Did your dog get the memo that no matter what she does you have to keep her from trying that?
did he get tired or did he keep bothering you?
My cat does that too, he is so mean!
Oh nice! I bet you are excited!
Good luck! I'm sure that if you just keep being yourself you'll do great!
Oh my, I bet that must have worried you!  Was it an easy landing?
That must have been very turbulence y
Oh wow! What a devious scheme! What are going to do to repay this debt>
Oh my gosh! Why didn't he take you on the trip?
Oh no, that's awful! Did you get in and say anything?
What stuff were they stealing?
oh sorry about your cat, how old was your cat?
That's so sad. I can imagine it must have left a very big impression on you as a pet owner
Really? How did that make you think so?
That's cool, are you going to see him in concert?
What was the project on?
Congratulations! That's great. Sometimes hard work can pay off!
Why is the song so bad?
what is the song? i'd love to know
What did you say?
im going back to my original passion of writing.
Oh my gosh. Why did you do that?
Oh no! I hope she didn't get hurt
What did he do with the borrowed car?
That is very nice of him.
Are you worried?
Nurse! That's sounds like an amazing passion! Are you already in school?
Have you been trying this entire time?
That's great. I think it is important for couples to work towards a better financial future.
Oh no! What a bummer!
I hate when that happens!
Is he usually okay with that?
Making the relationship better is important. Having an open relationship is great.
I'm so understand.  You have to make a budget and budget for everything.
That's really sweet of you! What do you guys do for money?
I'm sorry to hear about that. It must be very upsetting for you and your family.
That's hard, to hear about.. how long has he been gone?
Is that an issue for him?
That's smart, school starts next week for both my parents, I think school runs longer for them than most parents
That sucks so much! I bet you are really sad.
15 years is such a long time! What kind of problems do you have?
It does, and it does. But, in this day and age, it's hard to imagine someone not caring what you think.
That is a difficult position to take. It is an opinion shared by alot of people.
Do they have any real talents to show you?  I'm always curious to see what kind of gifts they would want from you.  It would be interesting to see what kind of gifts they'd want to receive in return.
Oh my god. I can imagine that would be scary! I can just picture you crumpling up and giving that look.
What a nightmare! I am so glad that all went well for you!
Wow, that is really good. I am sure you are a great person.
Congratulation! That is awesome.  I have never been able to do that for any video game.  Only singleplayer ones.  What is your favorite video game?
Oh that's sweet.  How is she doing today?
oh no! that sounds so gross!
Wow. That's a pretty bad incident to fume upon...well unless you're a lunatic.
oh no that sounds terrible. I'm glad you're ok now though. did anyone see you fainted? did it look like you might be sick for days?
I'm so sorry! Did you not mean to do it?
oh no did any of them see what happened
That is great. Is this your first year?
That is great. I finished school 5 years ago. Its a good feeling to be done.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did it get better?
It sounds terrible, i am so very sorry to hear about this.
Where is she moving too?
Children, you are amazing. How old is she
That's nice, how did it go?
That's cool, you guys got a good relationship going!
That's a good sign you should be careful what you decide to study.
that is great, what is the class?
Ah yes! What was the song?
What song is it?
Oh wow. Im so sorry to hear that
Oh wow. I'm so sorry. Are you handling it ok?
That's terrible! I'm sorry that she's going through that tough time.
That's really rough. I hope that it wasn't serious.
Nice. What was it?
Nice! What kind of drink was it?  Did it have fruit in it, too?  That's what my friend calls it, ha ha.  I love fruit!  What about yours, if you don't mind me asking?
How do you like it now?
I am sure you did great, what industry did you start?
Caffeine is the devil in coffee, I would take God with me on any journey to quit.  I've been told so many different types of people have had their issues and it is very addicting.
Try AA meetings or online forums. That helped me with my addiction.  Sometimes the members are really helpful and willing to listen
What kind of job?
I hope it works out for you!
Did they get in while they were cleaning?
That's infuriating. Maybe you should have them explain it to you in detail.
That is very nice of you.  What kind of pie was it?
That sounds awful. I hope you feel better as well as get some sleep. But yes sounds like a possibility!
That sounds so awkward and unwanted.  How did it turn out?
How do you think it would feel to have your crush talked to by someone you don't even like?
that was me back in july
maybe he was on shrooms
It must have been so special to do that as an adult, I can't imagine doing it as a child!
I can only think of my wife when my kids were babies. holding them in my arms and hearing my thunderous screaming.
That sucks, hopefully no one was hurt. Did she wish me a Happy Birthday then?
What an lovely surprise.  I bet she was delighted to see you again.
Thats cool! I bet that was really exciting!
I bet you'll do great. What kinds of paintballs do you play?
Wow! How'd it go
Oh wow! I have never done that before either! I am happy for you! I am afraid of heights, but love to see the wonderment in the sky!
What kind of dog did it turn out to be? Was it a hound?
Oh man. I feel bad for laughing at your pain.
On no! Are you ok, are you ok, are your legs bruised or anything?
Oh no! Did they laugh at you?
Cool. What kind was it
I bet that was a happy memory for you
Congratulations! What was the award for? Something that you've been working on for a long time?
Congratulations! That sounds great!
I love bbq!
thats great, i love playing baseball or basketball sometimes
That's sounds like a blast, do you play any sports?
snorting is a very bad idea.
That's really impressive. How did she find out about this
Did he know you were going to be sad about it?
Aww, that's so sweet! I hope the same for you!
Oh yeah? How'd she do?
that is really nice, kids can be so amazing
That is so scary. Are they okay now?
It's really frustrating when people blame others for other's misdortunes.  Are you ok?
She is a wonderful person! I am glad that you had someone to help you. :)
That was nice of her. You guys are close.
Oh that sounds very scary!  I've never been on a flight before, and I'm always worried about that!  What happened?
That's okay. As long as you were able to land safely, I'm fine with that.
I hate when wife's are that way!  Wife's never get tired, right?!
Well that's good that you made up for it. Hopefully, she doesn't find it too bad...
I agree, it is always good to visit
That's good! Dogs can get crazy when they feel stressed! I'm happy that you got to see your old dog again!
Neat! What are you going to get instead?
Maybe if you save up a bit you can get some good wheels for cheap!
That was thoughtful of you. Did he enjoy the visit?
That is too bad.  Have they fixed the issue yet?
That's terrible, is she okay?
That sounds sooo healthy.
Do you like her being married, or are you excited for her?
Are they having a big wedding?
Oh, kittens are so cute!  I love kittens myself!  Did they cost you a lot to adopt, at least?
I have a rescue cat.  You should adopt one!! adopt an animal that is not abused.
That sounds scary! What did the car do when the storm hit it? Was it OK after all?
Thats good you have a garage
That is awesome!  I have never been good at any kind of programming
Must have taken a while to get the hang of things.
That's awesome!  Did you get a big raise?
Well, I hope that it works out!
That is a great deal. You must be very excited to do well.
That's great!  What type of charities has this been?  So I can be prepared for when I have lost before.
What did she end up with?
Sounds like fun! What did you guys decide to do while we were there?
That sounds awesome, I live in Florida too! High humidity, hurricanes and all that!
I can imagine. It's not far at all from where I live now either, so when I go back to my childhood home I love it as well!
What did he start?
What an awesome day! How old is he?
And how do you feel about it?
That sounds like a lot of studying!
How did it go?
That's good, interview nerves can really get to someone head.
What movie? Was it an action movie?
What was the movie?
I'm so sorry to hear it. That really is a tough one. Did they offer to cover the bills?
I am sorry, that sounds awful! You could have offered to pay the bills yourself.
Oh no! Did she say how it went?
That is so sad. I hope you are doing alright.
Is it a big deal?  What kind of problems?
That sounds so frustrating! I am sure there is something wrong.
That must be so exciting for them!
Aw that's so sweet, I love visiting my grandma. Does she live close to you?
I am sorry to hear that, but happy that he got a healthy baby, that is what is most important
Oh, that's very sad. I'm happy for your loss though!
That is a bummer.  What happened??
That is unfortunate.  I have had that happen to me before.
That is terrible. I would hate to have to deal with that every time I have to clean my house!!
Maybe he had a bath or took a nap on your property!
That is great, did you have any help with the language? like tutor and stuff
Congrats! I know that feeling at times where you have more time to spend working on something you really want.
How many years did you have to learn?
Good work. Skating is pretty much my favorite exercise
Oh, that sounds awesome! What beach?
That should be so much fun!  The beach is really popular where you are going.  Where are you going?
That sounds lovely.  Where ya headed to?
Oh no! Did you have a lot of stuff with you that was important?
That's awful!  I am so sorry that you had to go through that!
That was nice of her!
That is very sweet, I bet you were shocked when she got you an apple watch!
Did it go over good?
It sounds like it was.  Did it go well for you?
Thats great!  Did he notice?  I bet that made your week!
Nice! Did he notice or did you not get a raise?
What car is she talking about?
Dang, hopefully the budget tightness isn't gonna keep you from spending more?
It will be a tough situation. But you must do it! You got this.
That is always a nice thing when you get a chance to remember a past!
I love dressing up with my kids! It is so fun!
What happened?
That would really upset me too. How are you trying to clean the cord?
Did you have plans for the day after?
Driving always feels extra special on a Sunday, no matter what.
I know the feeling. It is wonderful to wake up early to extra work. I hope that it continues. :)
Congratulations.  What will you be doing?
It is always a good sign when you have a fresh new experience. It will drive you hard
That sounds like fun! Is he a big kid?
You are going to have some nostalgia tears, my friend. But I'm sure he will have fun.
What type of job is it?
Excited for you. Is it a pretty demanding job?
That's great! I have a friend who got a job with a company that is in his line of work recently.
That is great, you must be really excited, but also know that the right person is always in demand!
That's sad. Did he get hurt or just miss?
What happened in the accident?
How did it go
I bet that was!  Were you nervous about it?
What was awkward and stressful about it?
I am so sorry to hear that. You should probably find a different doctor.
Oh my that's really bad! I really hope you can get some answers to your pesky pain!
Wow! That's great!
That's so awesome, how old is he?!  He must look so good.
Oh no! That must have been frightening, I can imagine how the dog felt!
Haha, that's cute, sounds like a fun day at school
That's a nice surprise!  Did she enjoy it?
That's really nice! I used to also play a lot of video games when I was a kid, but I never got into them. I ended up buying the SNES instead!
I love the SNES version, I played it a lot as a kid
I'm here for you.
Oh no that's rough. I hope you feel better. Drink lots of water and take some Gatorade.
I'm not sure what other people may have had as far as deep- rooted problems but I've never wet the bed before! I think you might have just woke up to a random number on the lottery ticket, lol!
Well, that sounds like a pretty awesome uncle...and I suppose as time passed, it probably didn't really work. But, at least it was something you were willing and able to try, and that your uncle knew about.
I am so happy you found that oil
I bet! Did they find anything wrong with him?
aww, that's great! i love cats, they are so sweet and devoted
Oh my, I hope you weren't hurt!  Did the police come?
oh man. that sounds super scary
I agree, I am so sick over it too.
Maybe you could talk to a salesperson, they usually know what they are talking about
Me too! It seems like an eternity waiting to accomplish something!
That's pretty smart!  It makes you smart to always be prepared and to never let hindsight or research take over your life
Wow, that's brutal. Were you scared?
Wow that's so cruel of them to do that.
Was everything cancelled, or do they just take their sweet time making them?
That happened. Don't feel bad. It happens.
I'm curious. Why would he feel the need to do that?
That is strange, since he is a Brit...but I suppose it makes total sense given our relationship with Trump
What a nice thing for the holidays!
I know that must be very nostalgic
That sounds like a fun trip
That is good to know! I am in Florida and was scared to fly.
What are you going to do there?
That sounds like fun!
That's so sweet!  That's one of the most beautiful things I've heard all day!
I've always wanted an empty eye. That's so cool! I bet you really appreciated her.
Me too. I like the candy outfits. What's your favorite Halloween costume?
Sounds like a lot of fun! Halloween is one of my favorites!
That's great!  In which company did you loyalty?  In which area>
That is bad. Why didn't you get rewarded?
What was the lie?
That was very courageous. Was it a good or bad lie?
That's great!  Did you find a good job or is the job really hard to get into?
That's amazing!  It's nice to hear people can be excited for the good of society sometimes.  Did you get a raise, too?
Oh no!  How are you feeling now?
That's nuts! What happened? Were they okay?
That sounds really nice! Did they get everything all right for it?
Wow. That sounds like a good surprise.
Nice! Did you get it as job of your choice?
Nice! Did you get it?
Oh no! I hope you didn't miss anything.
Oh no! I hope you and your family were okay? That can be super unsettling!
That's pretty cool. What charity?
What! How much do the tickets end up worth if you won one?
Good for you! Moving can be so stressful.
Did they fix your tire?
Sorry to hear that. What was the prize?
I know how that feels. I wish I had your luck.  Good job saving up.
That must of sounded really awesome.
That is interesting I have never heard of that game before.
That is very true, they don;t even try to hide it anymore
I agree. The Republicans really have nothing better to do with the American people than to keep him in check.  It's sad that they lost the 2008 elections because of that.
Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that!
That's so sad. I'm really sorry about that, how old was he/she?
How did it go?
That sounds rough. Did you eventually get the job?
That's not good. Did it take long to fix it?
I hate when that happens!
That sounds terrible. What was your favorite part of it?
Oh I hear you! I'm a Reds fan, you?
Oh no, is it swollen shut? Maybe it needs to see someone to see what the issue with the retina is?
Oh no. I hope it's nothing.
Oh how cool. What was the show?
What show was it?
How do you feel? Do you think you are ready?
I hope it goes well for you!
How'd you do it??
Thats great!  Did you celebrate
Wow, what a nice gesture. What did you guys make?
Wow that is very nice of her!  You are lucky to have such a good mother.  Do you often thankful for her?
How is that working out for you
That sounds lonely.  How far did you move?
That's too bad. I am sure that was tough, but I am glad you had the means to do it
That is very kind of your aunt.
Aww.  I know the feeling of taking care of kids during the day.  Did you have a pull out game?
Sounds wonderful! What was the stuff you were doing? I need some company in the evenings.
What was his/her desk job?
That's good! I am glad he is able to keep his commitment and get to spend time together.
Wow that's lucky of them! You must've really grateful people!
That was very nice of them! You are lucky to have such a caring family!
That's really sad. You must have felt sentimental you got passed down to you
I'm so sorry. That's a hard thing to deal with. I bet that brought a tear to your eye?
I hate when that happens! Did you catch them?
That's nuts! Did they get charged?
That's awesome, what was it on.
That's great she gets to do that! I bet she's full of joy right now!
Oh nice! How did it come out?
Wow that's awesome! Hawaii sounds amazing!
that is awesome what kind of cat is it?
That sounds adorable! Congratulations on your adoption :) What kind of cat is she?
That's really sweet, I hope you guys had fun and are doing good things again soon!
That's sad to hear about. I hope things work out for you in the end.
How'd he do?
Oh no! Did you scare the little feller?
What happened?
Haha well thats just classic brother thing to do
Good for you! It's such an exciting time!
Going back can be a bit scary. But it can be a lot of work (and money, I suppose).
What kind?
That is nice. I bet thats brought back a lot of memories too
That's great. Makes working hard enjoyable.
That's great! I had to have shop do a bunch of things when i was younger. You're lucky to have that saved up!
Oh that's a tough situation! I'm sorry. But he should be strong for you all, quitting definitely won't help him in the long run.
That's really rough. He sounds really depressed. Maybe you should go and talk to them?
Well, great friends really are worth the drive - and are a blessing to have on such a short time!
I bet you had a ton of fun.
That is horrible! Did they do it on an off chance or did they just want to get a dollar?
that is horrible i hate when that happens you just got a tip stolen from you blind people are the worst
I can understand.  Do you have friends now?
I felt that way as well when I separated from my highschool.  College just wasn't fair.
That's sad. How long were friends for?
thats great, how long have you been friends with her?
Oh man did the police have any leads?
I hope they didn't steal anything
Did you treat him to something really special?  It's always nice to see someone special after they left their childhood friends behind
That is a strange situation.  Did the friend treat him well or were they not good at all?  I am guessing he was mad that he didnt get to leave sooner.
did you say something to the supervisor?
That's great that you played nice with her. It's nice when you can back that up.
What about a bank account?
Wow, that is really lucky!
Nice, what kind of race was it?
That's great! Was first place a marathon, or a bike race?
I like to drive around in my blindfold too. I hope I don't get road rage like you do lol.
wow that is a big surprise, I would feel the same way. Where did they get the gift?
Do you miss your family and friends?
I agree.  I love looking through my old photos albums
That's so cool. I bet your mom was proud
I hate bullies, they are so bad!
It's definitely safer than most sports! Are you okay?
Hahaha I can understand that
Where did you guys meet? Is he still very close to you?
What type of hobbies do he have?
How come, are you scared of the interview? Do you feel that you can't handle the pressure?
Don't feel anxious!  It's perfectly valid to feel anxious in an interview.  Just be confident that the questions they ask will be helpful to you!
Why were you nervous, is it a nice place?
That is exciting! Have you met before?
Oh no.  What happened to him??
That's pretty sad. Have you thought about getting the dog yourself?
How old was it?
I'm glad it turned out well. I have no idea what my tattoo looks like, but i'm glad you had a nice time with it
That is really good to here! What has he been doing to make you so kind!
That sounds like a nice husband :)  What kind of wine and what kind of taco Bell?  I'm happy to hear it!
Why, whats happening?
Congratulations! That is awesome!
I know exactly what you are talking about! Sometimes I feel likeMusic brings me to a different time period. Sometimes even space!
oh no im so sorry for your loss, i know exactly what you mean
That sounds really comfortable! I love stuffed animals! What's the name of the rabbit?
That is really cute! I love stuffed animals.
Oh no! Is he ok though?
Oh no. Is he okay now?
Oh wow! Did it look pretty big?
Hahahah that's so funny, did he do it without permission?
That sucks to hear about. I hope they are doing okay
What happened to him? I'm sorry!
That sounds like a great relaxing time! I'm jealous! You should go out and enjoy the weekend and get a nice comfy blanket!
I watch that show too! It is so funny. It feels like I'm in high school again
That's unfortunate. What are you getting your degree in?
Do you think you have a realistic shot at getting into a higher position at your next job?
Are you hurt?
Did you cry?
Good for him. soup is good for many things.
soup is a good soup
Oh no.  That's not cool at all!  What did you do after they said they noticed?
That's really cool of you! Did it take a lot of time?
That's really exciting! Good luck to you!
Wow! Good luck! I hope all goes well!
That's terrible! How are you feeling about it?
Oh no. Does he think she is cheating?
Those are bad dates too
That is probably true and you still miss him a lot.
Woo hoo! That's awesome!!!  You must be so excited!  Where are you getting your grades?
That's awesome! I hope you did great and crush the last few nights of studying!
A kitten found its way back through the dog door and probably hit a person or something? How old is your cat?
Oh no, that is heartbreaking.
That's really neat! I love it when you can spend some time out there with family and have an awesome experience.
Visiting nursing homes is very special. It's an incredibly beautiful place to visit.
That's fair, it can be nice to see your daughter happy!
Wow. You are pretty lucky. I am sure you are great parent!
That's so sweet of her!  You're a lucky person.
Sounds like a great secret to keep.  How did you discover the full extent of her love.
Oh that must have taken forever!  Did you get the acceptance?
That's amazing!  I'm so proud of him!  3rd years is a very hard goal to set for anyone!
oh my god i'm so sorry to hear this! My grandmother passed away 3 month after he was diagnosed with athereatics
That sucks, my sister is getting older. She is 50 now. I'm sorry for the loss.
You must felt so much happiness with his college career.
Amazing!  I am proud of your son also!  Does he have a major in science?
I love the beach! I'm glad you got to enjoy it.
I agree, I get so relaxed and free with life sometimes.
What do you guys plan to do?
That sounds wonderful. I hope he comes home with a new girlfriend!
That's good! How long will he be gone?
What do you have planned for this night?
I remember when my son went to college. They grow so quickly!
True. They grow up so fast! I have a granddaughter that's almost 5. It goes by in a blink of an eye. So many changes and adventures.
That is great, I am happy to hear that!
that is good, it is always a goal of mine, and theres nothing like family!
Oh my, please don't let them upset you! If they continue to do it call the police, because that's hate crime!
I can believe that!
Oh that's exciting! Is she excited?
What a precious moment! How did she grow so much in such a short amount of time?
Did everything turn out OK on your trip?
It happens to everyone, dont feel bad!
That sounds so disgusting! How long ago was this?
That's really disgusting!  I don't know why some people are willing to do that.  It isn't right.
What happened?
Who are they?
Wow. You must be so surprised. What did they buy ya?
That sounds like so much fun! I wish I had a surprise party!
I am so sorry you went through that! Are things better now between the two of you?
Its okay. We all have our bad moments. It's good to realize everyone has their bad moments.
I would be scared too!!  What did you do?  Did you see it?
That's awesome that it turned out to be your shadow!  Did it freak you out?
I'm really happy for you.  Sometimes hard-working people are overlooked and it can make you feel less important.
It's ok to give Sometimes you have to live without it
Congratulations. You must have a very happy and joyful time now.
That's amazing! You're speaking my language right now! I'm so happy to hear you had such an amazing experience and your kids became great adults!
Why did you feel like you had to walk away from certain occasions?
I understand that. It can be a little annoying at times, but it's better than being miserable all the time.
That's exciting!  Are you excited about driving it?
Those hondos are like cars from the 50s!  Did you find it difficult to drive?
That's great! It's always nice to be able to have supportive friends!  Keep it up!
That's great to have a group like that. Keep it up and you'll be on the right path soon!
Did they give you a chance?  I've always wanted to go into politics, and have a shot at it :)
Congratulations!  What was the test about?  How do you think the test determined your national eligibility?
Oh, what wonderful times we live with.
Naw! You're right, because if they were thoughtful and wrote properly, it doesn't matter what the writer had to say.
That is a great way to look at it
It's always a bit of fun to think about the things that you didn't have before you become a parent!
Slipped on ice cream?
That is so scary! Are you ok?
Why, what was the secret?  Do you want to talk about it>
I'm sorry, secrets are always hard! Have you talked to your husband about this? Maybe he can comfort you.
A part of what play?
Oh, no! That's never fun when something good like that happens, especially if you're trying to build suspense! What was your favorite part of the play?
Wow, you must be so proud of her!
Slow is not bad. Has she started drivingpool?
Wow, that's impressive. She sound like a very determined person.
That is awesome! I am happy for you guys!
Don't worry, you will look fabulous and save a ton of time!
That's funny, you almost sound like me last month.  It's hard to clean up after everyone when they make a habit of doing it when I'm not home.
That's unfortunate, but lucky to have a brother you can count! What was wrong with his house?
That's so great! I'm so happy for you! I'm going through something right now myself, and I'm so close to having to sell a house too! I can see it happening!
Aw, that's great! Sounds like you have a great family. Sounds like you have a great friend too!
I understand. Are there things that you are both are not as close as you thought?
You must be very proud of him!
My son was also placed ahead in certain activities at his school. He is very good at math. He really blew me away with his math and understanding of the material. He is very forthright and listens to what he says. He can also use the internet to help him along!
You must be excited! Where will you be doing this?
Sounds good. Where are you going?
Oh I'm so sorry. I've lost both of mine. It's hard when you don't really have anyone to talk to.
I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm in the UK - my grandmother died in Hawaii not long after she lived here.  How old were you at the time?
Oh no! I'm sorry for your loss!  I can only imagine how hard that must have been.
That is so sad to hear about.  I hope it wasn't too serious of an infection.  Is it still treatable?
I am sure you are excited, but you are in for a world of pain and frustration. I would just wait until you get it and try it out!
Sweet. I just got the one too. I love it. Halo is my favorite video game of all time
Thats so wonderful! i'm so sorry for your loss! :( I recently lost both my parents in a car wreck. I know how hard that is. :(
I'm sorry to hear about your loss as well. At some point you have to recognize their greatness.
That is awesome. I love being able to have a little space while they are away
That is so awesome! I bet you will enjoy it!
Oh awesome. Was there a special occasion?
That's cool! How long has it been since you seen him?
That's so heartbreaking!  I hope the kitten was fine, did you take it home to feed it?
That's awesome!  I love babies, and babies don't have to be scared of other people!  What kind of cat do you have?
aww that was really nice of you, baby birds are the best
awww. that was sweet of you.
Was it a difficult class?
What class was it on?
Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry! Did you ask around and see if she's calendar able?
Oh wow! I can't imagine what that is like.
I'm sure nobody noticed
How long were you out of the party?
Yeah, I've been there. It's not a good thing
That would be really terrifying.  I can relate.  I'm terrified to have dreams that are too realistic.  It gives me so many nightmares!  What techniques can you suggest to deal with them?
I could see how it might make you feel bad.  What happened that made you feel that way?
It's not that bad in the grand scheme of the world, it's stealing that's worse.
That's really good to hear! How did you do?
I'm not familiar with Headspace, but if it helps you focus, then it would work out pretty good for you!
Me too! where are you goiing?
That sounds like a lot of fun!  Are you going alone or with kids?
When will you hear back?
That's amazing! I hope your acceptance letter comes in soon! I had two acceptance letters and three acceptance letters in the last four years... neither worked so I'm hoping mine comes soon too!
What kind of cookery do you do
I'm not vegetarian either but I've always loved trying new things. I like Mexican especially. You should totally try it out and let me know if you like it. I bet you will love it. vegetarian btw.
Oh yeah? How old were you at the time?
Did you cry when you saw it happen?
Oh my goodness! How old is he?!
That is great.  Being ill and pregnant is tough
Thats great. How often do you see her
That's great! It's amazing how many people don't view other people as a partner. How does that make you feel when it happens to you?
Oh no! That's horrible!
Uh oh!  Is she going to be upset if you admit to the mistake?
That really sucks.. landlord aren't supposed to provide help for things like that! Landlords should really train their own employees better.
I'm so proud of you!  Not everyone gets lucky like that.
That's great! How did it happen?
That is good. How did it happen?
that was nice of her.. anything special you got in return?
Well that's nice! What was the class?
Why did you steal from them?  Did you need money for food?

Oh no! That's pretty funny! Was it a good swim or was it a bad swim?
Really? gallon? How much dairy did you drink?
How did it feel after you took a sip?  Did you feel sick afterwards?
That sucks, hope it didn't lead to anything bad
That is really bad!  Why did he do it??  She had better things to do.
How does that usually work out for you?
I know exactly what you mean! They micro manage me so it never works out and it makes me so bitter when they don't listen
why do they cost so much?
I am glad that you get carette.
That's terrible. Have you try Go to sleep with an pillow next time?
That's terrible. Have dreams often?
I'm glad to hear it. Keep at it

What makes you so confident?
Congratulations. What song did you write?

Yeah that is exciting too
I agree! I find it helps me relax and clear my head.
I've heard about meditation a lot. What do you find the benefit from?
I get that way too! How often do you get to have fun
Yeah, sometimes we take those feelings for granted. I'm sorry that you feel that way.
I'm right there with you. I used to be really scared of the dark but now after trying out a few different techniques I am starting to be a little less scared and have been using them more.
I am in the same boat right now.  I have too many emotions going on right now.  Keep trying!
That's great. I think skinny kids need more confidence.
That's awesome. I'm glad to here that!  Do you exercise?  Do you diet?
Where are you going camping?
That's awesome. Do you have everything ready to go or are you just going to go outfit?

Wow that is so crazy! Did it take long to recover?
Did it take long to get to the place?
Oh wow. Glad your ok!! Did you have to get it towed home?
That's awful, I'm glad you got the help
That is no good. I bet that was really gross.
Connecting to who and to God is something that every Christian must do at some point.
Connections are important but what do you mean by connection to god?
That is terrible. I hope that you feel better soon!
I know what you mean, I can't stand waiting around waiting for a breather in the day.
I can understand that! popular kids have more talent than we do! I was never the best at reading though, so don't take it too seriously. I was never a reader either... always had to be fast!
I hear you there, kids just have a sweet, innocent way of getting everyone else involved.
I like to do hot baths.
That's great! How deep was it?  Sometimes when you're in a hurry, you bath extra shallow!  Did it work for you??
Good job! I need to start eating less food as well.
Oh wow, so you're taking in the big meals? That's awesome! I need to get back in the gym myself.
They call them scammers when they talk bad things about other people.
I feel you.  I always wait till the person is looking before they start talking
Oh no!  Did the whole thing get inside her mouth?  That must have been frustrating.
Oh no! I hope she doesn't feel guilty for something that small!
That is awesome, do you listen to a lot of different kinds?
What is the song that you are referring to
How did it go?
I'm glad to hear that! I've always been more of a car person myself.
That's really annoying. Did they get it for any reason?
That's terrible, I hope they get caught and locked up somehow!
That's unfortunate. Do you have any leads on any new activities?
That's too bad. I guess you have to do what you have to
What a cheater. Does he know it is wrong?
I hate when that happens!  Has he gone to the doctor?
What's really up?!?
I know it makes you feel so awful. I'm a teacher and I'm constantly checking my phone to see if there has been an intruder or someone at the door with a gun!
I'm sure if you just stay calm you'll do fine!
Thats great. I hope it goes well.
Why did you leave it with the car mechanic?
Oh man, I hope it doesn't end up like that. Did you at least go get a locksmith to check it?
I see.. Do you think I will be able to pass?
I bet! Hopefully the wait will pass quickly!
Did he ever get into an accident?
That's pretty metal
Why almost stealing?
What made you do that?
Oh wow! Congratulations! Is this the first pregnancy?  I'm sure it feels exciting to have a healthy baby, but I'm sure you nervous about the surgery!
Congratulations! I'm sure with all that preparation you have it shouldn't be an issue.
I agree with you there! What was the best Christmas present you got as a kid/r/t?
I agree, it's like Christmas came right when you got your hands off it.
Did he at least ask you before walking away?
that sounds like it would make someone very angry. did you talk to your mom to let her know?
Oh no! I'm so sorry! Was it a bad accident or did they not leave any information?
That is so awful and frustrating! Walmart is the worst for that, so many scammers there!
I have never seen it before! What kind was it
That sounds so good! What's it like now, with HARibros around?
That's good. Is she feeling better at home?
That's good to hear! I hope it stays like this!
That is so awesome!  Did you play on it at all?
That sounds so fun!
Are you really upset about that?
That's a bummer. What did you guys do instead?
That is a very true statement.
What is the gift that keeps on giving?
yikes that sounds scary
That's disgusting! Do you know if it's a female roach?
Did you study for it?
Have you gone to the gym?
