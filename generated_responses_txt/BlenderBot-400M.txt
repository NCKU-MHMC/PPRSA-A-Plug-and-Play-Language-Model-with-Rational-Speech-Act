Wow!  That is terrifying!  I am glad to hear that they were okay.  It is amazing how reckless some drivers can be! <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's hard to tell who's fault it is. Sometimes you just have to do what's right for you. <|endoftext|>
I went to a haunted house and there was a chainsaw there. It was scary. <|endoftext|>
I am okay, but I was really shaken up. I didn't know what to do at the time, and the police didn't do anything about it. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. 8 years is a long time to be together. <|endoftext|>
I love that feeling of being together with the one you love most! I am so happy for you! <|endoftext|>
Did you get to go earlier than the show?  I missed out on going to a concert this summer. <|endoftext|>
That is great. I bet you had a great time. I have not been to an concert in a long time. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is so sad! I don't know why some parents don't take care of their children. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Poor baby.  I'm glad the parents were there to help her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  How is he doing today?  I hope he didn't break anything. <|endoftext|>
Awe how sweet! How old is she? I hope she was having a good day! <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. Has he applied to a lot of places? <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite thing to do in your free time? I like to read and play video games. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, that sounds so scary. I'm glad you're in a safe neighborhood! <|endoftext|>
That is a very noble goal that you have. I hope that you are able to fnd a way to achieve that. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet they are excited for you as well. 3 years is a long time to not see your parents. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! US is a great place to live, though. <|endoftext|>
That is a very bad co worker. Did you talk to him about it or did he make it up to you? <|endoftext|>
I agree, you shouldn't go out and just have fun without your spouse. I hope you get to spend more time together in the future. <|endoftext|>
That is a huge bummer! I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to get it resolved soon! <|endoftext|>
I hate it when that happens. You can't win them all, can you try again? <|endoftext|>
Well that's terrible!  Did you tell your husband?  I would never cheat on my husband, even if I wanted to. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that is such a delicate situation. I can't imagine how you would feel if you had to tell her. I don't know if I could ever tell a friend something like that. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so nice!  I wish I had a baby to sleep with.  I miss having someone else to snuggle with! <|endoftext|>
I don't know why but it makes me feel good to know that I have done something right. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry. That must be really hard to deal with. What country do they live in? <|endoftext|>
That's a great idea! I bet there will be a lot of moms in need of help in the future. <|endoftext|>
That's frustrating. Sometimes you just can't have nice things. I don't have any kids, but I've always wanted to have some. Maybe that's why I'm still single. <|endoftext|>
I have a 2 year old nephew who I absolutely love but can be a handful. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate bugs too! I hope you washed your hair after that experience. <|endoftext|>
I hear you. I still have feelings for my ex as well. Sometimes it's just nice to remember the good times. <|endoftext|>
I miss my grandmother every day too. I hope that you can heal from your loss soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I can imagine how amazing that was! I would love that feeling! <|endoftext|>
Absolutely. I don't have any kids myself, but I can relate. It's an amazing feeling, and I'm happy for you. :) <|endoftext|>
Yes, I have been in that situation. It made me feel so grateful and happy! <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean. I moved away from my hometown after graduating college and haven't looked back. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. What happened if you don't mind me asking. Sometimes things aren't what we think they'll be, but sometimes they can have a big impact on our lives. <|endoftext|>
That's very kind of you. It's good to have friends like you who care about them. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's helpful to take a leap of faith and be confident in yourself, even if you don't feel confident. <|endoftext|>
I like your way of thinking.  I'm going to have to use that sometime in my life. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun! I wish I had some friends that did that for me. I'm glad you had such a fun time! <|endoftext|>
I hope you were able to study without the headphones!  That must have been so frustrating. <|endoftext|>
I can relate to the feeling. I have a large family as well. Sometimes you just need to get out and meet some new people. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel.  Keep your head up, there are plenty of people out there who are jerks. <|endoftext|>
Not at all! I know exactly what you mean. As I said, they are very different and I'm glad to see them grow up. But at the same time, I miss when they were so little and had so much energy! <|endoftext|>
That is so funny. I've never seen a baby carrier do that. I always thought it was just for babies. <|endoftext|>
What is a "deal" at a fast food place? I've never heard of it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Are you going to go back and get it fixed? <|endoftext|>
I bet that was very shocking and sad. I hope you are thankful for them now. <|endoftext|>
That's good, I'm glad it worked out well instead of turning into a disaster. <|endoftext|>
I hope so. I have a friend who is going through a rough patch right now as well. <|endoftext|>
Mom had hair down to her knees, and my dad had a beard. <|endoftext|>
6th grade was a long time ago, I'm sure if you look at it now, it's not that bad. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. It sucks being an adult and having to deal with kids that don't want to be with you. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. At least you were able to find out that way. I can't imagine how hard that would be. <|endoftext|>
That is great, I am sure it is very satisfying to see their hard work pay off. <|endoftext|>
I strive to be a better person. I don't like to admit it but I feel like I deserve it a lot more than other people. <|endoftext|>
I just try to be as good of a mom as I can. I really need to learn how to stop it, though! <|endoftext|>
That is so great to hear! Is it a boy or a girl? I hope they are happy and healthy! <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's too bad, but I hope you get to see her soon! At least you can talk on the phone! <|endoftext|>
Wow! That is impressive! How long did you train for it?    And congratulations! <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that sounds like it would be such a fun and rewarding experience! I'm glad you enjoyed it so much. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That does sound impressive. I've never done that before. But I've always wanted to. <|endoftext|>
Who did you not like? I hope it wasn't a close friend or someone you knew. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find peace and happiness where you end up. <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way! It shouldn't be that hard for kids to just get along. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just have to let it out. Embrace the negative emotions and let your emotions guide you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is so sad! I am glad that you were able to tell her though. <|endoftext|>
At that age, they don't really understand what's going on.  I think you handled it well. <|endoftext|>
Oh I know that feeling! What was your favorite thing to do while you were there? <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm so jealous! I actually live in Orlando now, but grew up in Panama City. I know what you mean, it's a great experience no matter how old you get! <|endoftext|>
That must have been difficult. How old were you? > I speak with my parents every day, and I always feel like I have to "fake it till I make it." Were you close with your father? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate to hear that, hopefully he isn't too broke for it. <|endoftext|>
I hate it. I hate folding and everything in it. It is so stressful. <|endoftext|>
Yes! I have a toddler as well and would not have it any other way. <|endoftext|>
I find that emails are a little rude as well.  I don't use them anymore but I used to use them all the time. <|endoftext|>
I agree, texting is convenient, but it's not the same as face to face. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Did things turn out alright in the end, or did she take it out on you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you don't have to go through anything like that anytime soon! <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I can only imagine how lonely that must have felt. How did you get through it? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun. What was your favorite thing to do while you were there? <|endoftext|>
I agree. That is why I try to be as helpful as I can to those in need. <|endoftext|>
Well, I guess it taught me a valuable lesson, I won't be taking that class again any time soon. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he forgave you.  My husband would do the same thing.  It is hard to be in a situation where you need to tell someone something, but you have to do it. <|endoftext|>
Well I hope he learned his lesson. We don't want our friends to get mad at us. <|endoftext|>
Uh oh.  Did you talk to her about it?  I bet you never want to see her again! <|endoftext|>
That's good, it's nice when people can admit fault. It makes things a little easier to deal with. <|endoftext|>
That is inspiring, I need to do the same thing. Good luck, stay healthy. <|endoftext|>
Yes! I am happy for you that you do not have to worry about that for a while. <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean. I have a photo album full of old pictures and videos of my kids doing fun things. <|endoftext|>
Yes. They are all adults now. It took a lot of work, but it was worth it. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you had such a great day! You should be proud of yourself for taking the time to look good for yourself. <|endoftext|>
I understand, that day was a long time ago, but I still think about it sometimes. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you two are able to make things work. It's great that you're able to support each other. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm glad you found a balance and are able to still enjoy your work. <|endoftext|>
Oooh, tell me about it. I bet you were a bit apprehensive. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's rough. Sorry to hear. Do you still have feelings for her? <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! I hope you have a great time! I don't know the last time I've been to the beach. <|endoftext|>
I'm jealous! That sounds like a wonderful time, and I'm sure she'll love it! <|endoftext|>
That sounds fun, but I'm sorry that you didn't get to go. Hopefully you can make it up to your friend. <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's pretty rude for her to do that. Did she offer an explanation yet? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's terrifying. What did you guys do? Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
I would have been terrified! I am so glad you managed to get out safely. Stay safe! <|endoftext|>
What happened? I did not watch that. Living is about to change and I am not looking forward to it. <|endoftext|>
I really hate when that happens. I'm glad the officer was able to help you out! <|endoftext|>
It's okay, I'm sure everyone has made that mistake at least once in their life! <|endoftext|>
Nah, I don't think you did anything wrong. Everyone has a little too much from time to time. <|endoftext|>
No, I missed it by chance?  I hope you are able to go another day. <|endoftext|>
OH! That's even better! I am so happy for you, I would have died if that happened to me. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I think it was me. I slept on the sofa last night. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Benny must have been a good friend. <|endoftext|>
That is very sweet and thoughtful of him. I'm sure you really appreciated it. <|endoftext|>
That is great to hear! I'm sure he really appreciated the gifts as well! <|endoftext|>
Why not?  Why shouldn't you be counting them?  I'm sure you did a great job. <|endoftext|>
Oh you did? That's awesome! I do a lot of work for other people, so I'm always on the look out for new ideas! <|endoftext|>
No, I'm still on the fence about it.  Please tell me about it! <|endoftext|>
Diabetics should not be allowed to have access to such things. It is a dangerous thing to do. <|endoftext|>
Wow. How did you feel about that. I probably would have felt the same way. <|endoftext|>
Did your friend do something to cause you to do that? Or was it more of an argument type situation? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I am so sorry!  That must have been awful!  Do you have anyone home to help you out? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's frustrating when technology doesn't work the way it should and then there's nothing you can do about it. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's a tough situation. Did you ever tell your friend about it, or was it a one time thing? <|endoftext|>
I feel really bad for her. I hope she learns from this and does better in the future. <|endoftext|>
I can! But you mom knows mistakes happen. It's good that you apologized. <|endoftext|>
Well I am sure everyone has done something they are ashamed of at one point or another! <|endoftext|>
Nice! I love vacations. Do you have any special plans while you're on vacation? <|endoftext|>
I am so jealous!  I hope you have a great time and that the hurricane passes by so you don't have to worry about it. <|endoftext|>
That is absolutely amazing! I am so proud of her, and you should be proud of how hard she has worked! <|endoftext|>
Haha, that's a good point. I didn't think about that. Maybe I should tell her that. <|endoftext|>
I agree! I don't understand why people don't care about other peoples property. <|endoftext|>
Exercise is good for you! I need to start doing more of that myself. <|endoftext|>
Dang, you must have been pumped!  How far along is he/she? <|endoftext|>
I hope you have a lot of happy memories to come from this happy time. You are a lucky person! <|endoftext|>
Me too! I love meeting new people and going to new places. It makes my job so much better. <|endoftext|>
No I am not, what is that exactly? Sounds impressive and interesting! :) Is it something you have been doing for a while? <|endoftext|>
Me too! It makes the job so much more enjoyable. I really like working with people who are passionate about helping others. <|endoftext|>
I think we're headed in that direction, where people are becoming more and more self-conscious. <|endoftext|>
Wow that's crazy, I love them too! They are so cute when they are that young. <|endoftext|>
Haha! I know exactly what you are talking about! I hated bugs when I was a kid, but I love bugs now as an adult. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. It's good to have moments like that to remember our loved ones. <|endoftext|>
That's so thoughtful of them, I'm sure it meant a lot to you. <|endoftext|>
I don't know, I think I was too nervous. Maybe I'll try again next year. <|endoftext|>
No, just the usual responses that don't offer useful feedback.  It's driving me crazy! <|endoftext|>
I know, I am so disappointed in myself. I need to find something before it is too late. <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful!  I can tell they are excited!  How far along is she? <|endoftext|>
I guess she didn't want to tell anyone then. That's cool that she was able to keep it that way. <|endoftext|>
I watched a lot of Netflix. I am so sad I didn't catch up on the OITNB. <|endoftext|>
I've never heard of it, I'll have to check it out! My favorite tv show is stranger things <|endoftext|>
Sounds like fun! I love super naturallty type stuff. I hope you have fun! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I bet that was scary to go to. I hope you were able to get the job. <|endoftext|>
Awesome!  Congratulations!  I bet you were euphoric that day! <|endoftext|>
Ugh, I know that feeling!  It's worse when you're trying to get home from work and it's a long drive! <|endoftext|>
Did you honk your horn at them? Some people are so rude. I would've pulled over and yelled at them. <|endoftext|>
I saw that movie too! I think I was around that age. It was the first one I remember seeing. <|endoftext|>
I felt that way when I was waiting for the last of the mohicans movie. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. Not everyone can do that, and it's great when friends do well no matter what. <|endoftext|>
That is a very loyal and caring friend. You are lucky to have a friend like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you try to wipe it off with a shoe wipe? I hope it didn't damage your plant! <|endoftext|>
Hopefully it's nothing too serious! I'd check to see if you can get a loan. <|endoftext|>
Dang! Did it work? I've been thinking about it for the past couple of months. <|endoftext|>
That is great, I am so happy for you, I know how hard it is to get a hold of a good job. <|endoftext|>
Man, that's the story of my life too. Parents did the same for me, but I ended up having to get a second job just to make ends meet. <|endoftext|>
That is great!  It is always good to be supportive of your kids no matter what. <|endoftext|>
That's very true. I wish I had more time to travel. I hope to go to Italy one day. <|endoftext|>
5 years is a long time. I wish you the best of luck. Remember to always stay faithful. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is way too low! Surgery is no joke and requires a lot of school. <|endoftext|>
That's always a tough situation. I hope he gets the help he needs and gets better. <|endoftext|>
What is the future like? Do you think you can live a happy and fulfilled life? <|endoftext|>
Office jobs are boring, you should try something more exciting like forensic chemistry! <|endoftext|>
I cleaned it up but I was so mad at the little tyke I shrieked a little. <|endoftext|>
That's not a bad idea, I will try that. I'm just so irritated about it. <|endoftext|>
That is a very good and trustworthy friend. I am glad you have such a good friend. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I hope you have a great time in your new apartment. It's nice to have your own space to yourself. <|endoftext|>
That's quite the household you have going on! I hope you get along with your roommates well. <|endoftext|>
I get nostalgia thinking about the good ole days as well.  I hope you have good memories of it. <|endoftext|>
That is so cool. I bet he was so happy that you were able to talk to him about it. <|endoftext|>
90s were good time. Social media makes it easy to stay connected with friends and family. <|endoftext|>
Well that's a relief! Hopefully you can find some cool things to get into to see what they have been up to! <|endoftext|>
I am 50 and grew up in the 90's. Graduated High School in 85. <|endoftext|>
I do, too. It makes me thankful for the freedom I have as an adult. <|endoftext|>
I just tried to be as respectful as I could. I'm still a little mad at her for a little bit. <|endoftext|>
I saw the Incredibles and it was pretty good! Did you see it in the theater? <|endoftext|>
It was more than I was willing to pay, and I was already in the theater. <|endoftext|>
That is not good. Do you think they are going to change their ways when they get older? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I hope you can save up enough for a new one some day! They really do need them. <|endoftext|>
I think it has to do with the fact that they are adults and not children. I don't get it. <|endoftext|>
They were Pistachio.  And you are right, I do not want that happening to me or my girlfriend. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. :(  What was the hardest thing that happened to you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she didn't suffer. I bet she wanted to be up with you. <|endoftext|>
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find some way to enjoy your time with her. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through that.  How are you healing now? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that must have been really hard. I'm sure you two worked really hard to make it work! <|endoftext|>
Little ones always seem to have a way of getting their way! Someone gave you a car! How nice of them. <|endoftext|>
I am sure that is a great feeling. I am happy that you got to experience that. <|endoftext|>
No I have not. I would love to have one though. Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|>
Haha!  I'm sure he was glad you kept it in the memory!  This was the first time I've ever gotten one. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate it when that happens. It's happened to me a few times too. <|endoftext|>
Ah, candles. That's a good idea, maybe I'll get a few of those, too. <|endoftext|>
I bet psychology was hard! Did you end up passing it? I never studied that hard. <|endoftext|>
Heck yeah!  That's amazing!  Congratulations!  I'm so happy for you! <|endoftext|>
I don't, but I really want a cat. I hear they are great pets. <|endoftext|>
Sorry about that, hope you can get some sleep soon. I know how it is to have a cat that wants to be with you but you have to train them not to. <|endoftext|>
That is a huge accomplishment!  You must be so proud!  What is he going to do now? <|endoftext|>
Ah, you'll have so much fun, don't worry. I wish I could go back to high school, it was so fun. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. How old are they now? Do they live with you? (If they're your children) <|endoftext|>
Dang, that stinks. I'm sorry to hear that. I've felt like that before, and it can be pretty lonely. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is impressive. Most people don't even own half of their own business. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's quite the transformation! Roasting coffee beans is one of the most difficult things to do. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Well I'm sure she'll forgive you eventually. It was just an accident. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Well maybe you can talk to your aunt and get her to give you a gift of some sort. I'm sure you're not a jerk! <|endoftext|>
Aww, that is too bad. Hopefully she is able to pay you back somehow. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that happens to me all the time! Sometimes it's fun to go back and listen to stuff from my childhood. <|endoftext|>
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  I think those days are gone for me. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm so sorry. Losing a pet is so hard. They become a part of the family. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope you're doing okay. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry for your loss as well. It is just a crushing experience is all. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, the coughing, wheezing, runny nose, and itchy nose are the worst. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so gross!  I am so sorry you had to experience that.  It must have been so scary! <|endoftext|>
I had no idea! Shellfish are so important. I hope you don't get sick. <|endoftext|>
OMG!  That is awful!  I would be so mad at my friend!  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
It happens to the best of us! I'm sure she'll let it go eventually. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry. Do you want to talk about it? I will try to make you feel better. <|endoftext|>
Well that is very sad. I am sorry for your loss. Maybe you should talk to him about it? <|endoftext|>
We did a long distance trip (600 miles) when I was in college. It was tough, but it was worth it in the end. I hope you guys are able to work it out! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I don't have any pets, but I really want a dog. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. That is a hard thing to deal with. Have you talked to her about it? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will find someone. Just be patient and they will come around when you are not looking. <|endoftext|>
Ohhh, good luck!  I hope she says yes.  I know how hard it is to get a woman you like. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a good idea! I'm sure she would be excited to meet you if you do. <|endoftext|>
My best birthday was a couple years ago. I was really happy with my friends as well. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you deserve it after all that hard work. I hope you enjoy your night! <|endoftext|>
What does that mean exactly? Do you not like the taste of apple martinis? <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens.  Hopefully there wasn't too much of it and you guys can talk it out. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is scary! Did you go out and check to see what was going on? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I hate to hear that people have to deal with that kind of stuff. <|endoftext|>
No, but it sounds delicious. What's a hot coconut? Sounds like something I would enjoy. <|endoftext|>
I think I will, it will be a nice break from work. I hope you have a good rest of your night! <|endoftext|>
That is very nice of her. Not too many mothers care about their children like that. <|endoftext|>
It is nice that you are able to do that. I hope you can send her more gifts in the future. <|endoftext|>
I thought I did well but I guess not. I guess I need to practice my interviews more. <|endoftext|>
I did and I am pretty sure I lost it.  I am so upset about it. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's nice of her! What kind of car did she get you? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I absolutely love her. She has done so much for me in my life. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's rough.  Does she know that you have a thing for her? <|endoftext|>
Ah, that is a tough situation. I hope you guys get to talk it out when she gets back. <|endoftext|>
I work from home. It's been a miserable year. Lots of emails and nothing to write about. <|endoftext|>
I make more than my parents, so I am happy about that. But I really did have to put in a lot of hard work to get here. <|endoftext|>
Don't worry, just do your best and you'll do fine. I'm sure you'll be fine. <|endoftext|>
Hey, if it makes you happy, then by doing it you should do it! I'm glad you enjoy it as much as I do. :) <|endoftext|>
What movies do you like to watch?  I don't really like scary movies.  I used to be able to watch some when I was younger but then I grew out of it. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you could talk to your friend about it. I'm sure they'd be more interested in your story than you. <|endoftext|>
I like action and comedies mostly, but I also like dramas and tragic movies. <|endoftext|>
I don't really have a favorite, I just like watching them for the fun of it. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I didn't know that! I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you feel that way? <|endoftext|>
I am also for the environment and all that. People need to take better care of the earth. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That is a great accomplishment! I hope you have a great experience! Florida is a fun state to be in! <|endoftext|>
Awesome!  That has to be one of the hardest degrees to get!  I'm glad you like it! <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I hope you continue to feel that way because faithfulness is important in a relationship. cherish him <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should ask him out on a real date. Go on a couple of dates and see how he feels about it. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes. It can bring back good memories. Do you have any good ones to share with me? <|endoftext|>
Her childhood must have been very interesting. Do you have any children of your own to share the story with? <|endoftext|>
What kind of woman is it, if you don't mind me asking. And how can you be jealous of someone if you can't even trust them? <|endoftext|>
That courage will help you a lot in the long run. She will love you for it. <|endoftext|>
A couple of months.  I'm just not used to it at all.  It's so quiet! <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about the new pokemon game coming out? I think it's going to be great! <|endoftext|>
That's really great! I bet she loves you just as much. Moms are the best. <|endoftext|>
I agree. I felt so bad for him because I didn't know what had happened to him. I hope things are better for him now. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope he is at least at peace now. <|endoftext|>
It's good to have faith in yourself! I'm sure you'll make it through the tough times. :) <|endoftext|>
What kind of car did they get?  Is it a newer version of the Ford Focus? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will, just keep doing what you are doing and you will be fine. <|endoftext|>
That is very nice of you. I hope she reciprocates your love and caring. <|endoftext|>
No, I am still looking. I hope to meet someone special one day though. I am happy for you. <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful to hear! How long have you been with them?.   Families are so important and it's great to hear that they are so supportive!. <|endoftext|>
I am, but its still hard.  I know people who are much closer to their families than I am to them. <|endoftext|>
Why did you do that?  Was it a special occasion or just because you wanted to show your friend you were a better person? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that, I hope you're able to get some help with that! I know how hard it can be to lose someone you love <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it wasn't too traumatic for you. I hate when that happens. <|endoftext|>
Well, at least you were able to get a new towel. I guess it could have been a lot worse! <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! You must be very proud of yourself and are looking forward to what's next in your life. <|endoftext|>
West Coaster is nice but if you don't like the cold you should try the East Coast. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I hope she gets better. I know how it feels to have loved ones pass away. <|endoftext|>
That's a relief! I'm glad it worked out for you guys, and congratulations on the baby! <|endoftext|>
I know right. I get lonely sometimes but I think it's good to have company. <|endoftext|>
I would be bored too. Maybe you can get out and do something you like to do on your own? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you win. What are your favorite games to play on it? <|endoftext|>
PS4 is such a great system, I have one and it is great for playing my favorite games like COD MWII <|endoftext|>
It's really hard to do that with kids, they have no idea what they're eating! <|endoftext|>
I see, hoarding is a bit much. Maybe you should start throwing them away? <|endoftext|>
I would be quiet! that is no fun, i guess she will be back before you know it. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sad to hear. I hope she comes back soon to visit you and your family! <|endoftext|>
On no! Were you able to get away without getting trauma? Or just look like a mess? <|endoftext|>
That's awful! I hope it didn't ruin the rest of your trip. to travel is one of the most expensive things to do. <|endoftext|>
What do you do for a living? Who promoted you, if you don't mind me asking. <|endoftext|>
Yes, many times. It can be very disappointing. But, there are plenty of other opportunities out there. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Did they have a nice reunion at her funeral? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope memories of you two were able to share. <|endoftext|>
Being the best at something is always a good thing.  What kind of job is it? <|endoftext|>
What does that have to do with what I said?  What did he do for you to need 2 forwards? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it was for the best, anyway. <|endoftext|>
Good to hear that you've grown and learned from your mistakes. It's always good to hear about people who have learned from their mistakes. <|endoftext|>
Haha thank you! I do love a good deal. Do you play any instruments yourself? <|endoftext|>
No way! How old is he? That sounds like a fun time! I don't have any kids of my own yet. <|endoftext|>
Wow! He must be really good at what he does. Maybe he'll be on America's got Talent one day! <|endoftext|>
Dating is hard. I hope he is a good guy and not a hoarder! <|endoftext|>
Oh gosh! I feel like I should tell you about her. They break up all the time. <|endoftext|>
What would you like to know? I'll gladly tell you about my life if you'd like. <|endoftext|>
I am not sure how old it was exactly. Just a few months old. It was still very painful to see. <|endoftext|>
Can you tell me what happens when you go there? I've never had that happen to me. <|endoftext|>
I like any caramel frappe, but I think I like the strawberry the best <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's a huge accomplishment! You must be so proud. I hope he has a great career ahead of him. <|endoftext|>
Yes, but don't forget that Doctor Patience is the key to a happy life! <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did you get it for free?  I hope you didn't get sick. <|endoftext|>
What's your favourite topping?  For me I like olives and mushrooms. <|endoftext|>
Do you get it delivered or pick up at a different place? I can't stand messy food ordering! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. That must make your job very difficult. I hope things get better for you. <|endoftext|>
Haha, I think we've all done that. Don't worry, she'll get over it. <|endoftext|>
She sounds like a wonderful lady. I am sure you will have fond memories of these cookies. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That's one of my biggest fears!  What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I would be so embarrassed if that was me! Were you able to clean it up and get new shoes? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I always follow the recipes to be sure that I am getting the right amount of nutrition. <|endoftext|>
I did. I was going to make chicken alfredo but the sauce got in the soup. I am so disappointed. <|endoftext|>
Oh that is so exciting!  I'm glad you finally got to see it!  Was it a boy or a girl? <|endoftext|>
hahaha I bet he was excited to see the "daughter" when she opened the mailbox. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you should sit down and talk to him and tell him how you feel? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I need to start paying more attention to my kids when I'm not at work! <|endoftext|>
Haha! I feel you! It was definitely worth it though. I am now a nurse. I love what I do. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I'm glad it worked out for you. And faith is great when it works out that way. <|endoftext|>
That is so cool.  I bet you were impressed!  How long did it take him to learn? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am glad he has a good story to tell now. :) <|endoftext|>
That's horrible! I'm so sorry to hear that! I hope everything turned out okay. <|endoftext|>
Why do you think the cars are not on the road anymore? Must be something wrong with them. <|endoftext|>
Wow that's great! Boys can be a handful but I'm sure you'll be a great parent! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I could do that. You should do it again sometime! <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary. What do you do about it? I would be afraid to go to bed. <|endoftext|>
Oh gosh, that's even worse! I'm glad you didn't see anything, but I would have been so scared. Were you able to find out what it was? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is a long time. Why is he in prison if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness that is so terrible. i am so sorry. i hope everything works out for you <|endoftext|>
That's incredible! Is he going to be playing in the NFL? (National Football League)? <|endoftext|>
How exciting for you. You must be very proud. Will you miss him when he is gone? <|endoftext|>
I am sure he will love that you were able to do that. I bet he is going to be so smart! <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I hope you two have a great life! Sending positive vibes your way! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that must have been scary! Did you get it out of your home? Did it have rabies? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Maybe you can track it down and get it back. I hope you feel better. <|endoftext|>
Amen to that! I would be too. God is good to have in our lives. <|endoftext|>
Exactly! He just takes advantage of us in so many ways, it's not right. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you get hurt badly? I hope you didn't have to go to the hospital! <|endoftext|>
5 years is such a long time! I'm glad everyone made fun of you and you didn't take it to heart. <|endoftext|>
Ah yes, the oldie but goodie.  I've been bumping some old school rap too. <|endoftext|>
I started with just 2 and ended up going to prison and never ended up making it past freshman year. I know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I had a dog die a few years ago and it was traumatic. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's too bad. Hopefully they don't do it again because that's really inconsiderate of the workers there. <|endoftext|>
Blessing's are a blessing. I hope things continue to go well for you. <|endoftext|>
I will never give someone a dollar unless they are willing to give me a dollar, lol. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I have been in that position and it is terrifying. I hope things work out for you soon. <|endoftext|>
I hope she does too. I am also a believer in God. I will pray for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope he was okay!  That sounds like it would have been embarrassing. <|endoftext|>
That is exactly what i would have done. I would have been so mad at the kid. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, you checked her out?  Did you think they were kissing and if they were, you would know? <|endoftext|>
I hope you can both work it out, it would be awful for a friendship to end over something like that. <|endoftext|>
That is very admirable.  Most people would just quit or get fired, or even worse, they would kill their spouse. <|endoftext|>
Wow that's a long time to be saving up that much money. He must have been very smart. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's actually not bad. I thought it was a lot worse than that. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's cold.  At least now you know not to associate with her? <|endoftext|>
Oh my god! Why would she do that? I would be furious! Did you ask her why she did that? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you didn't either.  It's hard to know what to do in that situation. <|endoftext|>
That is not fun, but maybe it was for the best. I hope you find happiness where you are now. <|endoftext|>
That's really annoying that they won't just split the time up and split it up like that. Sorry you had to deal with that. <|endoftext|>
I am sure everyone has forgotten at some point in their lives. It is a fact of life. <|endoftext|>
How did you feel about that? Homeschooling isn't for everyone of course. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks. Well, you can always buy your own. It's not the same, but at least it's something. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I am sure he is in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
I hope it does. It would be nice if they could find a way to make it more enjoyable for everyone. <|endoftext|>
Adopting is a good thing.  It takes a lot of courage to do that. <|endoftext|>
That's an interesting friend. Did he give you a reason why he thought you needed it? <|endoftext|>
That is no good. Are they going to separate or is there a chance that she will change her ways and earn her trust again? <|endoftext|>
People like that are not worth the time of day. Ignore her and try your best to forget about her. <|endoftext|>
Did you report him to the police or just let him know how unhappy you were? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. Hopefully he'll learn that that it's not worth it and won't happen again. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! I bet that took a lot of work, you should be proud of yourself! <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I was that determined when it came to trying new things in my life. <|endoftext|>
Hahaha, I hope so one day! Right now I'm just enjoying having some me time. <|endoftext|>
That's great! working from home is the best. I do it from home about 3 times a week and it's great. What do you do? <|endoftext|>
That's a long time to be stuck in a rut. It's great that you were able to make the change, and I hope you're enjoying the new position! <|endoftext|>
That was really nice of you, we all need to do things like that for our loved ones <|endoftext|>
Oh, is that a thing? I thought maybe you were hearing something like a gunshot or something. <|endoftext|>
What instruments do you play?  Do you tour with your band or is it just for fun? <|endoftext|>
That is true, they have not been putting out the same type of music that they used to. <|endoftext|>
What game is it? I hope it isn't a bad one. lol  I hate when they take forever to release games! <|endoftext|>
farcry 5 what? i have no idea what that is, but i hope you have fun when it comes out <|endoftext|>
How exciting! I bet you were very proud of yourself when you heard the good news! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure there is another job out there for you. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a plan. Senior Manager is one of the highest paid positions in the world. I hope you get it. <|endoftext|>
That's no good. What have you tried to do to improve your chances of getting one? <|endoftext|>
I am the same way, I have had to use the emergency brake a few times. <|endoftext|>
What are you talking about? I think those are close to death...cancer spares no one. <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you!  That must be a great feeling.  What do you do for a living? <|endoftext|>
I'm so glad you got accepted! I have a friend who recently graduated as well and she had to work really hard to get into college. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! That must be a great feeling of accomplishment. Now the hard work will be worth it! <|endoftext|>
I would have been so embarrassed, what did you do? did you ask him to stop? <|endoftext|>
What happened? I hope you are alright?    You are telling me this was in real life, so I am beginning to believe you are telling the truth, even though it is fictional. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I hope so too!  Interviews can be nerve-wracking, so I'll keep you both in good vibes.  What kind of job is it? <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing. You should be proud that your country has the best armed forces in the world. <|endoftext|>
I used to be a night owl but got a job so I could go to work during the day. <|endoftext|>
Eek!  That must have been so scary.  I am so sorry you had to experience that! <|endoftext|>
Congrats! I bet that is a very sought after degree. I hope you do well. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear, at least. I'm sure it was stressful, but at least it's over now. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I have been in three. The worst part for me was not knowing how to drive my car. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry! That must have been so awful! Were you okay? <|endoftext|>
A few fights, but not many. Why do you want to fight me? ;-) <|endoftext|>
Oh, that doesn't sound good. What ended up happening between you and your step father? <|endoftext|>
I have not, though I have heard of it.  Is it a role playing game? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that is a long time ago. I bet you had a blast playing it. <|endoftext|>
I love Hardees!  I'm a sucker for a big juicy cheeseburger and fries from there. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I didn't know that! Maybe that's why I don't like them, too expensive. <|endoftext|>
I haven't, have you?  I've always been interested in them.  Have you? <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. I am glad you are okay though! That must have been so frightening. <|endoftext|>
I rode one at Six Flags once. It was so scary! Have you? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a good use of the machine.  Did you ever use any of the safety features on the bike, like brakes or pedals? <|endoftext|>
I do not like when friends try to get intimate with others, it is not right. <|endoftext|>
That's good, at least you didn't have to clean it up yourself. He will learn not to do that pretty quickly. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! When are you going? I hope you pack light so you don't get too tired! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.  I have never been there, but would love to go. <|endoftext|>
Hey, that's awesome!  I know how hard it can be to leave a job you like, but sometimes it's for the best. <|endoftext|>
Hopefully she continues to get good news about her future endeavors. Good luck to her! <|endoftext|>
Sad that the school didn't offer to replace her.  She was probably missed out on a lot of valuable lessons. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What a sweet and thoughtful surprise. You must be a happy person. What type of puppy did she get you? <|endoftext|>
I love those dogs! They are so smart! I have a Great Dane and I love taking him to the dog park. <|endoftext|>
I hear you. Sometimes you just got to make a move and take a leap of faith. <|endoftext|>
That is a great feeling! I love when you wake up and everything is just peachy! <|endoftext|>
I would have been pretty upset as well! Did you tell her to go to the next place you were going to go? <|endoftext|>
That's good. I'm glad it worked out for you and your girlfriend in the end. <|endoftext|>
I know right! It feels like it just started, but it's going to fly by. <|endoftext|>
I hear you.  I have a one year old son and sleep in my own bed with the window open. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's terrible, I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can take some time off in the future to go see him. <|endoftext|>
That happened to me the other day! It was terrifying, I'm glad I was paying attention to the road! <|endoftext|>
I would have done the same thing. I don't like driving in the snow at all. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. How old were you at the time?   Were you impacted by the divorce? <|endoftext|>
It definitely sounds like it. It sounds like you've got a good head on your shoulders. Congrats! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's the worst. Did you guys have to go to the pool to get wet? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you had fun! And don't worry. If you had waited, you wouldn't have been able to go. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Did she know that you knew about it, or was she just going to surprise you? <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's awesome! I hope you had/get a lot of gifts! <|endoftext|>
Did you feel bad about it after? I know I would feel guilty if I was in your shoes. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. I hope he changes his tune. <|endoftext|>
I would have been too! How did you get through it? Did you talk to her? <|endoftext|>
I love video games. What was you favorite game to play at your time? Mine was COD MWII <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is not fair! I can't believe they wouldn't allow a dog in that apartment. I hope you can get another one soon. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's too bad. Maybe you can find a cheaper place to live closer to home? <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet of her! I bet you were very happy. I wish I had a mom like that. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, gaming is my favorite past time.  What are you going to do with it? <|endoftext|>
I've never been on a roller coaster before, but that sounds like so much fun! <|endoftext|>
Almost poop yourself, huh? Well, I hope you're able to laugh about it now, because I know how you feel. Back when it happened to me, I thought I was going to die. <|endoftext|>
Wowza! That must have been shocking. Did you do or say anything to her? <|endoftext|>
Don't feel bad. It was an accident. I am sure if you explain it to them, and maybe treat them to lunch or something they will forgive you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did you take him to the vet right away?  Were you able to clean it up and get the smell out? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it was a bit nerve wracking. At least you made it through! <|endoftext|>
I bet it did. You must be very proud of yourself. What did you get your degree in? <|endoftext|>
You should be proud. You put in the work and took the time to do it. You should feel proud. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you're able to work through this with your girlfriend. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes we make mistakes when we're young. It's good you realize your mistake. Learn from it. <|endoftext|>
What the heck is with people like that. What do you think is wrong with people? <|endoftext|>
I think that would be a good idea. And then you could go on a nice, relaxing bike ride. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you find out who did it? <|endoftext|>
What a great surprise. You'll always have those memories of you guys together to cherish. <|endoftext|>
Dogs can be so destructive. I hope you were able to clean it up. <|endoftext|>
I know right? Such a lame thing to do. Lesson learned I guess. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you had to go through that.  It is difficult to have to deal with things you don't like in the church. <|endoftext|>
I hope everything turned out okay. Did you end up making it through the day without too much trouble? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great day! I hope you guys got some more time to recharge. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes we have to do things that we don't like to do, to make sure we're standing up for our values. <|endoftext|>
Yes it is.  I am very lucky to live in a place that is so picturesque. <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure if you're talking about the city or the country. The latter is usually a lot better in my opinion! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did they change their ways eventually?  If not, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
Haha!  Very true, although I never thought about it that way.  I do feel a little better now that I think about it. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I think I was the same way as a kid.  I remember being so terrified that my parents would take us outside to wait for it to happen. <|endoftext|>
Haha, I know what you mean. Every time I see one now, I want to go in and buy one! <|endoftext|>
That was so nice of her!  It's so nice to have a mom who cares so much. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling. I bet they appreciate you for your anger even if it doesn't always stay with them. <|endoftext|>
That's a great way of looking at it. So have you decided to move on or are you going to keep the friendship? <|endoftext|>
What was your first international trip? Was it for work or pleasure? What did you guys do? <|endoftext|>
I'd love to give it a go one day. I love trying different types of food. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I am afraid of that too, but I don't know if I should give him a gift or not. I hope he will like it. <|endoftext|>
Dang, nice phone. Does it have any cool features that make it stand out from the other ones? <|endoftext|>
Ah, so you're not a big tea drinker. That's too bad, but good for you! <|endoftext|>
That is awesome that he is able to do that for you. It sounds like he is a great guy. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is impressive. I hope he is safe and that you have a great time at the party! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Maybe you should take a taxi? <|endoftext|>
Have you tried using a strap to hold your glasses? Maybe that would help to keep them from falling off. <|endoftext|>
Please tell me that they were able to get everything in the store for you. I would have been so excited. <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. Incredibly annoying. I'm glad you weren't hurt. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes babies need a lot of attention, even when they're asleep. Don't feel too bad, it happens to the best of us! <|endoftext|>
I hear you.  I have a 2 year old and an 8 month old son.  It is hard to get sleepy at night.  Do you have any kids? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you have a great time and they come home to visit you! <|endoftext|>
I do. I get to spend a lot of time with them. But it doesn't feel the same. <|endoftext|>
I bet they are! That is so exciting! Are you at all worried that you might not be able to handle them all at once? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I can relate as I have a nephew who is also on the spectrum. It can be tough <|endoftext|>
That's great! It's such a relief isn't it? I know the feeling well. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling! I am struggling myself! But it is so worth it to be able to pay off your bills and have a roof over your head! <|endoftext|>
Law is a tough career. You must have been studying very hard. I hope you did well. <|endoftext|>
Great, congratulations! You must feel so relieved and proud of yourself! <|endoftext|>
That is a great surprise. Did you thank the flight attendants for saving you some money? <|endoftext|>
Haha, that's always a plus. Something you can do with the money you won't have to spend on clothes. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe he was having a bad day and didn't mean to upset you. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, love can be a hard thing to deal with. Hopefully he can learn from it and not do it again. <|endoftext|>
Driving is scary, I still don't trust people even though I have my own car. <|endoftext|>
I understand. You have to do what is best for you and your family. I hope he gets well soon. <|endoftext|>
I have never tried that, but I hope it works out for you. Tomatoes are my favorite vegetable. <|endoftext|>
Maybe the weather had something to do with it? I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. <|endoftext|>
Tomatoes are my favorite vegetable, I eat them raw or in a salad. <|endoftext|>
I know! It's terrible everywhere! And I'm the only one who knows how to drive because I created the automobile! <|endoftext|>
Of course, they should use their blinkers! It's not safe for anyone. <|endoftext|>
That's so cool! I wish I could play video games like that but I'm always too busy. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I met my friends through a mutual friend actually. I've never been married before. <|endoftext|>
Thanks, I care too, but sometimes I don't know how to act socially. <|endoftext|>
I try to be, but I have had a lot of trauma in my life so it's hard to be compassionate <|endoftext|>
Sometimes one night out with an old friend can be a good time, and it can even be a great learning experience! <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it is difficult to keep in touch. I hope you can continue to communicate though. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's impressive! I'm sure she must have a lot of hard work and determination to accomplish that! <|endoftext|>
You do if you want to go to college, but some people just aren't cut out for it. <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens.  My dog still has accidents when we take her outside. <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure, maybe she wants to show you she doesn't want to be locked up. <|endoftext|>
It's awesome that you have a great partner like your husband. How long have you two been together? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I have lost many best friends over the years. It is never easy. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, that can be pretty scary. I live alone, so I don't really have to worry about that. But I do get anxious when my alarm goes off, since it could happen at any time. <|endoftext|>
Haha, oh no! Well, at least you know what kind of dog it is. They are very resilient. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I wish I loved mine as much as you do. :D <|endoftext|>
That is great.  I wish I could work from home.  Then I could do what I want! <|endoftext|>
Exactly! I don't understand why people have to try to make new friends. It is so mean. <|endoftext|>
No, I can't. But I'm sure they were happy to be there for you! <|endoftext|>
Hey, if it was for you, then all that matters is that you had a good time! <|endoftext|>
I agree. I hate it when I forget things. It makes me feel like I'm not living my best life. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. I hope she returned the favor at some point though, right? <|endoftext|>
Did you go to the zoo?  I love going to see animals.  The zoo is one of my favorite places to visit. <|endoftext|>
I love their nachos! I get them every time I go to Northern Mexico. <|endoftext|>
I can't! That must have been so exciting for you. Congratulations on graduating. What did you graduate in? <|endoftext|>
How did you end up doing on the test? Did you get a good grade? <|endoftext|>
I know, I felt so bad for him and I know he will never do that again! <|endoftext|>
I hope he didn't get sick! I know how unhealthy those can be. <|endoftext|>
I would be so mad. Legos are my favorite toys! Were you able to get him some new ones? <|endoftext|>
Well hopefully they learn that that is not the place to do that. I would be furious if that happened to me. <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of that before, is it a seafood place?  I love trying different types of food! <|endoftext|>
Dang. I bet you were pretty mad. At least you can make a good meal out of it. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty amazing! I don't think I could even do that if I tried really hard. <|endoftext|>
What is a wonder kid? I've never heard of that before. Wonder why they're called that? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, how long have you two been together?  Long distance relationships aren't easy but it's possible to do it! <|endoftext|>
I am sure he will continue to improve. It takes hard work and you will see results. <|endoftext|>
I love soccer.  I bet you were so proud.  Was it his first game? <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's so sweet. You're lucky to have a dad who cares that much. Not too many parents care about their children. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. It is difficult when no one laughs at your story. I know exactly how you feel. <|endoftext|>
Maybe, but most people are too nice. I've had my car broken into a couple times for the same reason. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool! I took French in high school and it was a pretty fun class. <|endoftext|>
There you go! That is a great way to get out of the house and exercise your dog. <|endoftext|>
That is so nice! You are lucky to have a neighbor that is so generous. <|endoftext|>
It is always good to help others in need. I hope that you can give back to him in the future. <|endoftext|>
That sounds really annoying. Have you complained at all? I can't stand noisy dogs. <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of that breed before, so I am sorry you have to deal with that. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure she will be fine though. Is it a boy or girl? <|endoftext|>
I see. Well I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you come out of it as a stronger person. <|endoftext|>
I bet that would be fun, get together with them and shoot some hoops! <|endoftext|>
She must be so excited! Hopefully you guys can maintain communication through social media. That's how I've been able to keep in touch with my family. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing okay. <|endoftext|>
No problem at all! We need to look after each other, you are so lucky to have her. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that must have been nerve-wracking. Did you end up getting the job? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm really happy for you! I wish you continued success in your new field. :) <|endoftext|>
Dang, kids can be tough. Maybe you should take a break for a while and then try to mend the fences. <|endoftext|>
Ahhh, so cute! Feed her now, she will be your best friend for life! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I hope you do well on it. What do you think you are going to cook? <|endoftext|>
What kind of restaurant is it? I love me some good eatery.   I just got back from a great trip to Italy. I ate so much good food. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I need to start saving money like that. It's hard for me to always have money to spend. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
How long did you wait for? I bet you were very annoyed when it was time to arrive. <|endoftext|>
Angels are such a blessing! I'm glad you have such good friends in your life. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! Congrats on being able to overcome such a difficult time! <|endoftext|>
What did you punish him for, if you don't mind me asking? And how did he behave? <|endoftext|>
Yes, that is very important thing at that age. I am sure you are proud of him. <|endoftext|>
I feel you. My little brother is in the same situation and it makes me so envious of him. <|endoftext|>
I understand. Those jobs are hard. Just keep looking and you will find something that works for you. <|endoftext|>
Rock it! What kind of job did you apply for? I hope you get the job. <|endoftext|>
I hope you get it too! I will send out some good vibes for you. <|endoftext|>
That must have been a trip down memory lane. Did it bring back a lot of good memories? <|endoftext|>
That's good you were able to take care of it! Too bad it didn't go in one piece. <|endoftext|>
I don't think I would mind doing some of the school shopping now that I am done with school <|endoftext|>
Ah I see. Well I'm sure they are concerned about you and that you will keep up the good work! <|endoftext|>
That is so incredibly kind of you!  You are a wonderful person!  What did you nickname him/her? <|endoftext|>
I love the name! a long time friend's nickname is actually alfred. I'm sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
I understand, I have 2 teenage daughters and I feel your pain. It is challenging but it is so worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
Please don't do it. It will be messy and you may end up on the Internet. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! You must be so proud of her! What kind of job is it? <|endoftext|>
Thats because she is passionate about something. That's what makes great teachers. You should be proud of her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I hope he's okay. Did they find anything wrong with him/her? <|endoftext|>
That's the best you can do for him. I hope he feels better soon and I hope you guys can spend more time together. <|endoftext|>
Don't feel too bad.  She would have probably eaten it before you had a chance to tell her. <|endoftext|>
Yes! I would tell her. She will never know the truth and you will feel better. <|endoftext|>
Yes I hate that. I guess your boss was in a bad mood because he got in trouble instead of you. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I hope you can learn from this and not do it again in the future! <|endoftext|>
OH MY GOSH!  That is going to be amazing.  Take lots of pictures, so you can remember it. <|endoftext|>
I get that, but I am sure you will be fine! It is a very beautiful place. <|endoftext|>
Clarity is so beautiful to have in a relationship with someone that you love so much. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you have people to confide in right now. <|endoftext|>
That is impressive.  What kind of dog do you have?  Did you teach it? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I love big dogs.  What kind of dog is it?  What are you going to do with it? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Is there anything she can do about it? Maybe her husband can help out a bit? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that can be on you. <|endoftext|>
OH! That's awesome! I found out today that my wife and I will be getting married. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, I think that's way too soon. Maybe he can't make it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope you find it.  Did you call her and tell her you did? <|endoftext|>
That's no fun, but I'm sure she'll get over it. As long as you're both happy! <|endoftext|>
award winning trophies are always nice. what kind of award? a best photo? <|endoftext|>
Well, that sounds admirable. You should be proud of yourself. Maybe a nice dinner will be in the future. <|endoftext|>
Thank you!  I am very optimistic that it will be a great opportunity for me. <|endoftext|>
I hope so. I feel like I have let her down for sure. She seemed really invested at the time. <|endoftext|>
I felt the same way when I went in for my first job interview a few years ago. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. No, I haven't had that happen to me, but it sounds like you really like it there. Hopefully you get the job! <|endoftext|>
That is parenting. Some people are just naturals at it. I am sure you are a good parent. <|endoftext|>
Oh that is disgusting. I don't understand why people don't take care of their kids. <|endoftext|>
Does it bother you when you hear noises that are too loud or too high pitched? <|endoftext|>
Deaf people can sometimes be frustrating.  Have you ever thought about signing up for a class? <|endoftext|>
Dang, how old is she now? Guess you have a lot of catching up to do. <|endoftext|>
Shopping is the best!  What did you guys get to pick from the checkout? <|endoftext|>
Where are you going? I hope you have a good trip! Are you going with anyone? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to find some enjoyment in the parks while you are there. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's usually what happens when you don't give them enough exercise. Did you take her to the vet? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she's thankful for you. You probably saved her a lot of money in the long run. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like an amazing day!  I wish I could turn back the time I had on Netflix! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great plan. I think I will do that after work, I need a nap. <|endoftext|>
That can be nerve wrecking.  Did you find out if you got the job? <|endoftext|>
That's not too bad then. I hope you get the job! It sounds like you really want it. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I hope you continue to be faithful to her in the future. <|endoftext|>
Well, hopefully you learned something from it, and don't do it again in the future. <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite thing to do on your leisure time? I like to read and go to the beach. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you didn't lose too much stuff. Maybe you can get a new one next time. <|endoftext|>
What do you mean by that? Do you mean you thanked them for everything they did throughout their life? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. I hope something good came out of it at the end though. <|endoftext|>
That sounds relaxing! What do you grow in your gardening area? Do you sell the seeds or just for the fun of it? <|endoftext|>
Hey, you're welcome. I hope everything goes your way and you end up meeting someone special. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's too bad. Some people are too afraid to admit when it comes to that. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks. At least they gave you something else though. What was the order? <|endoftext|>
I am sure they will take care of it.  I will pray for you and your family. <|endoftext|>
Was it an accident? or was it someone trying to drive on your side of the road? <|endoftext|>
Hah, that's funny. Well, I'm glad it at least made you feel somewhat okay. It's important to remember that we're not animals that need to be nursed to feel okay. <|endoftext|>
What a good friend! Report him to the police so that he knows what he is doing! <|endoftext|>
Well that sucks. I would have thought that the president would be the one to represent everyone. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. Maybe you can find yourself a new hobby that will keep you occupied. <|endoftext|>
It is good to have someone to talk to, even though it is isolating from society. <|endoftext|>
Take out is the best! What is your favorite takeout?  I love southwest food like sweet and sour chicken. <|endoftext|>
Thats a long time to be waiting to play.  I hope you have fun in the game. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  I would love to have a pool in my yard.  We don't have to worry about drainage. <|endoftext|>
That's crazy, maybe you should think about setting up a time frame so you don't have to use it. <|endoftext|>
That's a good one! surprise parties are always a hit or a bummer. Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
Normally, those things are nice. Normal days can get a little routine and monotonous. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! 3 weeks is a long time to be apart, I'm sure you had a lot of catching up to do. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I bet that was nice? At least you get to see them now and then. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine, I hope you are doing all right!.  I lost both of my parents at the same time so I know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
Of course, it's the least I can do for my friends who have fallen on hard times. <|endoftext|>
I would be so excited! I'm glad it worked out for you guys. Do you have any names picked out for the baby yet? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. I hope everything goes well for you! <|endoftext|>
That is good, that is hard to find these days! SO many people cheat on their spouses! <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. I hope you have a long lasting relationship.  My husband and I have been together for 12 years and he's the only thing that's important to me too. <|endoftext|>
What kind of truck is it?  I would be too.  I need a truck for work and I would hate it if I didn't have a truck. <|endoftext|>
It's always a goal to have, to have something you work hard for. I say go for it, if you really want it! <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful! What can you expect from a great day?!?!? ;-) What are you looking forward to? <|endoftext|>
It is always good to be optimistic. Even if it is only positive things can happen in life. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she feels better soon! That's a tough situation to be in. <|endoftext|>
sleep is so important, and it's so easy to miss when you've been sleeping for so long. I hope you get a good night's rest! <|endoftext|>
That's so beautiful! I'm glad you were able to see it and your soul was touched! <|endoftext|>
It is always good to be kind. Even if it is only to help someone in need. <|endoftext|>
That is so wonderful. I hope she keeps it up. Is she in a choir? <|endoftext|>
Awe a little young.  I bet you are having such a fun time with her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I think you should tell him no matter what. It will hurt him more if you don't. <|endoftext|>
Hope you have a great rest of your night!  Drink a few beers and have a good snack! <|endoftext|>
Hey good for you!  What kind of job are you looking for?  I hope you get it! <|endoftext|>
That's good, more people should get into it to make a living, it can be lucrative. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll find something. You can always watch some movies or read a good book. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. It's hard to feel like you have so much on your plate at once. <|endoftext|>
What was the bad thing you did? I hope it wasn't something you meant to say. <|endoftext|>
That's awful. I hope you can get that problem out of the house somehow. Maybe an exterminator will be able to take care of it for you. <|endoftext|>
That sounds really good to me. Don't be too hard on yourself. Just do better tomorrow. <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that diet works but it's not for everyone. You have to be careful about what you eat. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure he was very worried about not having a source of income. <|endoftext|>
No you deserve to be home with the baby.its just you and your husband after all. <|endoftext|>
That was rude of her, did you ask her to stop her dog up? (I know it can be annoying) <|endoftext|>
I'm on the 3rd floor, I just feel so bad for my neighbors. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope you find it.  Maybe you left it on the couch? <|endoftext|>
Ahh, that's too bad. Well, I hope you find a way to make it work out! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet they are excited too! 3 weeks is a long time to be apart. <|endoftext|>
That is so exciting!  I bet they are going to be best friends when they see you! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet you had a lot to catch-up on! <|endoftext|>
You should get out and about and meet some new people!  Go to a coffee shop or bar! <|endoftext|>
Whoa, that's pretty rude! Have you said anything to them about it, or did you just get used to it? <|endoftext|>
That is so annoying.  I would complain to someone higher up.  That is not ok to do. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh, that is so funny. I would be so embarrassed. Did your friend say anything to you about it? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that must have been silent for a long time then. At least you don't have to wonder what she thinks anymore! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks. Did you ask her why she did that? Sounds like she might have a good reason. <|endoftext|>
What kind of video games are you into? I've been playing a lot of COD lately. <|endoftext|>
I give a lot of money to charity. I wish I could give more to people. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I'm glad you were able to get it figured out. It's always nice when hard work pays off. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it can be hard to tell who is responsible. But I hope things work out for you in the end. <|endoftext|>
What is that? I've never heard of that before. Is it a new drug or is it something that's been around for a long time? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry. That must be so difficult. Are you getting any donations to help? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes nothing can really change. I will keep my fingers crossed that everything works out for you. <|endoftext|>
That is too bad. Maybe you will be able to come back later in life. Is there a reason you had to change your plans? <|endoftext|>
I didn't! I stayed put because I knew I wanted to move there and it was the right choice. The job was even better! <|endoftext|>
It is a good day for that. I think you are on to a winning streak. <|endoftext|>
That's really all we can do, is teach and try to be the best we can. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried looking up organizations in your area to meet people with similar interests? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should try going out and meet some new people. I'm sure if you keep at it you will get the hang of it. <|endoftext|>
Ooh, that's exciting. Long distance can be tough. How do you feel about that? <|endoftext|>
Yes I did, but it was a long drive.  I am glad she is coming back as well. <|endoftext|>
How long is that for? I would be so excited if I could go on vacation too! <|endoftext|>
Dang! That sounds like fun. Did you go on a tour with the osarks? <|endoftext|>
That's so rude of them! I hate when people can't keep up with each other's needs. <|endoftext|>
Maybe she was trying to tell you something? I don't know, I wouldn't take it so seriously. <|endoftext|>
Why did you feel bad about it?  Did you accidentally eat it or was it a mistake? <|endoftext|>
Wow, I would have called and complained. You shouldnt have to deal with that. <|endoftext|>
It was pretty good! I got to workout at the YMCA after a long week. <|endoftext|>
My name is Sonia.  I am so thankful for her willingness to help. <|endoftext|>
My day was pretty good! I got to work from home and pack for the weekend. What about you? <|endoftext|>
You as well! Thanks for chatting with me. I hope you have a great rest of your day. <|endoftext|>
That's not really something that should be done in front of others. How did you feel about that? <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. I always try to have a clean room when I go out. <|endoftext|>
How well? I hope you get the job. :) I have had many interviews and it has gone well for me as well. <|endoftext|>
Well I hope they get to you asap and you don't have to wait too long! <|endoftext|>
I bet it is! grad school is such a great step in the right direction, though! <|endoftext|>
I think as long as you stay confident, you'll do fine. People tend to be a bit nicer when they first meet. <|endoftext|>
Did you not feel bad because you were away from her? I'm not sure I could take that long without feeling bad. <|endoftext|>
Well, dogs are a good way to make new friends. They love you for you and always want your attention. <|endoftext|>
Dang, did it get resolved? Did you get your money back? What kind of fight? <|endoftext|>
Oh that is so aggravating! I would have yelled at him too! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds awful! Were you able to avoid the water and get on the boat again? <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm glad that the owner was there to help you.  Hopefully you can make it up to him. <|endoftext|>
That must have made you feel nostalgic. How did you feel about that apartment? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know what you mean.  Sometimes it's good to take time out of our day to reflect. <|endoftext|>
That's no good. What were they yelling at you about, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Ugh, teenagers can be so annoying.  Tell her to get a babysitter. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you get the job, you sound like you'd be a good fit for it. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope you get it! Sounds like you deserve it after going through so many interviews. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that must have looked really bad.  Did you end up sending the picture back? <|endoftext|>
I hear you there, you just never know if they are a good person or not. <|endoftext|>
I am shocked too, but I have a feeling that they will.  I hope not for your sake! <|endoftext|>
I hope it's not something you need super soon. I know how frustrating it is to wait for items to arrive. <|endoftext|>
I hope they come back and tell you that everything is fine. Did you have a hard test? <|endoftext|>
That's good that you had someone to check on you, I'm sure it was a relief. <|endoftext|>
That is nice. I did the same with my childhood friends. When did you move out? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun! I loved playing outside too! We would play soccer, sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that was generous of them. They must have a lot of trust for you. <|endoftext|>
All the best for your future endeavors. I wish you all the best! <|endoftext|>
Good for you.  It is always good to have a focus on the positives in life. <|endoftext|>
I have heard that as well, floating keeps you from being hurt, but I don't think that's true for me. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm so sorry!  Are you looking for another job in the meantime? <|endoftext|>
Why have you been hunting so hard? You should be proud of yourself that you got the job. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm trying, but it's hard when you know you're right about the situation and can't really do anything about it. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I know. It's hard to not compare yourself to others sometimes. But I think it's good for me to focus on what I can do well, and not someone else. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sad! Maybe you can leave him with a neighbor that you trust? <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea. I hope he doesn't get too crazy when he gets older. <|endoftext|>
I feel really bad about it but I only had a $20 bill and I really needed it that day. I don't know if I can ever make it up to him. <|endoftext|>
I agree. It just came out of the blue, so I'm not sure what to do to make it right. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope you found him/her!  Did he ever come back? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that is so sad. Did she get hurt badly? I hope she didn't lose too much. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you guys have a lot of fun and remember all of those great times you spent together! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is pretty far away.  I bet you are going to miss her when she is gone. <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea! Or leave it in the fridge for when you need to go to the store. <|endoftext|>
She is going to be a neurologist.  I am so excited to go see her! <|endoftext|>
I am! It was so nice to see her so joyful and excited about her accomplishments! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. It's nice to hear that people can be successful after they get older. It gives me hope. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you had to see that. I hope you don't have to see anything like that again. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. If it makes you feel any better, I am sure your coworker probably feels the same way as you do about him. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm glad it wasn't a big one that would have gotten you or anyone else hurt. <|endoftext|>
Dang. Well at least you were able to get it fixed. I know how it feels to lose something important. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? Who was that? Was it someone you knew personally, or a celebrity? <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way about my sister. Hopefully you can give her the benefit of the doubt. <|endoftext|>
Used to be? What happened to make it feel like you don't have time anymore? <|endoftext|>
Yes it did! Those were the good old days. Now it's hard to find happiness in the present. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that is definitely a scary situation. Did you have any sort of security cameras? <|endoftext|>
Man, I hope you find the culprit. Maybe they stole your TV, but at least you have some good food to eat. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did you call the police?  Did they catch the people who did it? <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear that they are looking for them. I really hope they do find them. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that, I'm sure something better will come along. <|endoftext|>
I hope you get one that you like! I have a feeling you'll get one soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's happened to me before. It's so embarrassing! Did anyone notice? <|endoftext|>
What did you do after they all laughed?  I can imagine everyone being embarrassed at one point or another. <|endoftext|>
That is funny, I have a cat too but she doesn't shed much, she is a Russian Blue <|endoftext|>
That is so cute!  I hope she doesn't do it on purpose to hurt you! <|endoftext|>
Hey that's awesome! Where are you headed to? I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
I am so jealous! I have always wanted to go there. And I am sure you will have a great time! <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope it was ok for you to just run back into the house and hide it!  Did you tell your friend? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you can get some meds to help with that. <|endoftext|>
What was the prize?  And what were you most excited about?  That must have been a great feeling! <|endoftext|>
Dang!  I really wish I was better at chess.  Was there a good prize for it? <|endoftext|>
That can be very annoying. Have you tried talking to him about his issues? Maybe he needs some help. <|endoftext|>
That would be nice, but it's also annoying when they don't take the time to talk to you. <|endoftext|>
Uhoh.  I hope it wasn't someone you didn't want to see.  What was in it? <|endoftext|>
Waiting is the worst! I hope it works out for you, and you're enjoying your mini vacation :) <|endoftext|>
People are so hurtful. I'm sorry to hear that. How did you hurt yourself? <|endoftext|>
Thanks! I'm glad I could help. And if you need to talk to someone, just let me know. I'm always here for you. <|endoftext|>
That must have been nice.  Did you have a good time?  What did you guys do? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That must have been very nostalgic. Were you happy to see your family? <|endoftext|>
That is crazy! I don't know if I could even trust a baby on a horse! <|endoftext|>
That's very true. She must've been a good mom to raise such a great girl. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. You will get it next time I am sure of it. <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck, and I hope the ideas you guys come up with will be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is a tough situation. Do you think she would trust you if you asked her? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should ask her to set up a time so you can all play together. That way you won't be lonely. <|endoftext|>
You and me both, my friend. What do you do to try and make ends meet? <|endoftext|>
Yep. I can't wait to see what else they have in store for. I hope they don't take advantage of us. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope that they are able to recover from this situation. <|endoftext|>
Sucks that you cant move, but hey atleast you are moving forward and looking forward to new experiences! <|endoftext|>
What is the name of your site? I might be able to help you look for a new place to live. <|endoftext|>
I hope you guys can work it out, I know it's hard when they are so close. <|endoftext|>
Dang, you don't hear that often. Most people just aren't faithful. I am glad to hear that about your friends. It makes me feel good to know that there are still good people in the world. <|endoftext|>
I feel like I have been for as long as I can remember and am ready for it. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that you have a best friend like that. I don't really have any. <|endoftext|>
Dang, sounds like you have a great mom. I need to find one like that. <|endoftext|>
oh wow that is awesome, i have always wanted to be able to do a kickflip <|endoftext|>
Same here! I could never get the hang of it. I always looked like a bunny. <|endoftext|>
It is so irritating! How do you handle it when it comes to your kids? <|endoftext|>
That would be best. There are so many moms out there and so few are good. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I think you just have to do what you can do. I hope he feels better soon! <|endoftext|>
That's good. I'm sure he will forgive you soon enough. Just make sure not to do it again! <|endoftext|>
I would have been so scared!  I don't have any dogs of my own but if I did it would be heartbreaking. <|endoftext|>
Dogs can be protective over pretty much anything. It's good your dog was fine. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun! How long did it take you to potty train your dog? <|endoftext|>
It is painful, but the best thing for them is for us, it gives them a chance to really learn and grow as a person. <|endoftext|>
Well, I hope your dog is doing better now. I know it is very costly to take them to the vet. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I'm glad he's doing better now. I know how hard it can be to lose a pet. <|endoftext|>
Yes, many, many. Those are few and far between, though. I'm glad you enjoyed it. <|endoftext|>
I agree, small things in life really do matter and that is why I try to live everyday to the fullest potential. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's awesome, hope you get the job! Waiting on that can be so nerve-wracking. <|endoftext|>
I hope that you get the job, you sound like a good theoretical candidate! <|endoftext|>
Yes, I have. It was hard at first, but now it's not so bad. <|endoftext|>
I hope you can hang on for a little longer. You sound like a good person and I'm sure your boss would appreciate that. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes they'll sing a song or something. Other times they just want to be in the shadows. :) <|endoftext|>
What are they talking about? Stardevolvalley is a place in the desert right? <|endoftext|>
he is so sweetheart, I love him so much. I don't know what I would do without him. <|endoftext|>
I hope she feels better soon. I'm sure you are doing everything you can to support her. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks but I'm glad you were able to pass the test the second time. Driving is really hard to learn. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. I have a hard time with some things too. Sometimes it's just not enough. <|endoftext|>
That is so gross!  Did you report it to the restaurant?  Did they have to pay you for it? <|endoftext|>
Good for you! Some people have no respect for others belonging and even less for others. <|endoftext|>
None that I know of!  I do hope they keep playing so I can still get some exercise in! <|endoftext|>
Dang, I always wanted to be able to do that! I was never any good. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you didn't get in trouble! That would be so embarrassing! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's too bad. It happens to the best of us though. I am sure you will never make that mistake again. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I wish there was something more you could have done to help. <|endoftext|>
I agree.  We always have to have someone to help when we are short on cash.  I hate it when that happens and you can't do anything about it. <|endoftext|>
What kind of puppy did you get and what is its name?    [Enjoy your puppy while he's young! They grow up so fast. <|endoftext|>
Of course, I hope your child turns out to be a joy to have in life. I know I did. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I don't know about you, but I feel like we got a lot worse for the kids back then. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, that was a good time. No bills, no worries. School shopping was fun. <|endoftext|>
Science is pretty tough. I am happy for you. What are you going to do with the winnings? <|endoftext|>
That's hilarious and terrible at the same time. I can just picture you doing that and laughing. <|endoftext|>
That is a tough age. I have two kids and know how hard it is to sleep with them in their crib. <|endoftext|>
I didn't do anything to hurt him. I just slept all day. But you're right, it is very painful to hear. <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! I'm so happy you had a great time. What was your favorite thing to do at the condo? <|endoftext|>
I can't even imagine. I'm so happy for you guys. Did you do anything special while you were away? <|endoftext|>
It really does! I look back on my childhood a lot too. It seems like just yesterday that I was playing football with friends. <|endoftext|>
That is so precious. I wish I could see my kids getting so excited about the holidays <|endoftext|>
That's too bad!  Why can't you?  Too much work?  I hope you're able to save up some money for a vacation eventually.  Where would you like to go? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that really sucks. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things look up for you guys soon. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Congratulations to you and him! What is he majoring in? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is a great accomplishment! I am sure he will enjoy it a lot. <|endoftext|>
I am so glad to hear that!  Is he feeling better because of his doctor's help? <|endoftext|>
I do not. But i wish someday after getting married i will have my own. <|endoftext|>
I love going to flea markets. Did you find anything good? Sometimes I find really cool stuff there. <|endoftext|>
Ewww, lol. Well at least you got some good stuff. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that is just the best isn't it? They grow up so fast. :D <|endoftext|>
That is so cute! I hope she keeps it up. I know it is hard for kids to see the future sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Poor baby rat, I hope it wasn't hurt! I don't like rats at all, especially little ones. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a tough thing to see.  I'm sorry you had to see that. <|endoftext|>
I am so glad that she is doing better! It must have been so scary for her. <|endoftext|>
That is scary! I am glad she is better now! I hope she never has to go through anything like that again. <|endoftext|>
What did you do with it? Did you post it on social media? How is it doing? <|endoftext|>
How long did it take? I'm glad the cat is back home and safe again. Stressful! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds scary! I hope you were able to find it eventually. Did you get lost in the wild? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is so scary. I'm glad you found your friends though. Did they come chasing you? <|endoftext|>
Haha! That's awesome, sometimes my dog tries to eat my shoes when I'm not looking! <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Whoa, that is a lot for a little kid. I hope she is in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
I would be mad about that too.  You should have told her you were mad at her. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just have to make a budget and stick to it. I know it's hard, but it will save you a lot of money in the long run. <|endoftext|>
I have two boys and I'm having a boy.  I guess you can say one is a boy, huh? <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting! I hope he enjoys his stay. 3 months is a long time to be apart. <|endoftext|>
How is that going for you? I've heard of it but never tried it myself. <|endoftext|>
I love e-books, I have so many ebooks on my computer.  What is your favorite so far? <|endoftext|>
I would be so excited and then so sad at the same time! I hope its a happy healthy baby <|endoftext|>
Hahaha I know exactly what you mean! My daughter is about to turn one and I'm dreading that time. Ultrasound scares me a bit. <|endoftext|>
Hey that's awesome! 16 parties sounds like a lot of fun. Was it your birthday? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there a chance you can get it for your birthday in the future? <|endoftext|>
Good for you! I'm sure it took a lot of courage to do that. <|endoftext|>
That's great! You should be proud that you worked so hard. I'm sure your parents are proud as well. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's incredible! How did you go about it? I've heard of people doing keto and fasting to lose weight but I've never tried it. <|endoftext|>
That is for sure, willpower is also an important attribute to good will hauling. <|endoftext|>
That's a shame, it's so nutritious.  Do you drink any dairy now? <|endoftext|>
Haha, well I'm glad you were willing to give it a try! There are many different kinds of milk out there. Did you try any soy milk? <|endoftext|>
Enjoy it to the fullest because there is so much beauty in the small things in life that we take for granted <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you have to make a choice that makes you happy. I'm glad you made the right choice. <|endoftext|>
Where did you guys end up going in the middle of the night? I hate driving in the rain, so I avoid it all together. <|endoftext|>
It's always a pain in the rear to have to drive back to school after a long day. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! That must have been awful. Do you still have a cordial relationship with him? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, but at least he was honest with you about it. Some people just don't care about other people's feelings. <|endoftext|>
Oh my that is a long time to wait for a toll, did you get a chance to do anything during the wait? <|endoftext|>
Phew! That's awesome. I'm glad you were able to get over your fear! <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet. Who did get you the roflers. Was it from someone special? <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. anniversaries are always a nice time to remember people you love. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god! Are you ok?  I hope your aunt was nice to you after? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks. Well, on the bright side, you don't have to deal with that anymore! <|endoftext|>
How did you find the cave? Did you hear any funny sounds while you were exploring? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's very interesting. I didn't know people hunted exotic animals in the cave! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I can imagine how joyous that feeling must have been. How did you feel when you found out? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that you guys could work something out like that. I hope everything went well for you guys. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that sounds awful! I'm glad you're okay now. Did they find out what caused it? <|endoftext|>
Well, I am so glad everything worked out for you. It can be very scary to have a baby on the way. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear about your dog passing away. I have been through the same feeling when my childhood dog died. <|endoftext|>
I got my dog at the same time. She was a rescue. Do you have any other pets? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope you were able to get out of there without too much confusion! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's kind of messed up. Did you confront her about it, or just let it go? <|endoftext|>
That is great that you are able to do that. I wish i was more financially responsible. <|endoftext|>
That's a tough situation to be in. I hope you guys came out of it okay. <|endoftext|>
You are so sweet. You must be a very good dog owner. Did you find one that matches your personality well? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear about your dog passing away. It's hard to lose a pet. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope you're doing okay. Why do you feel blue, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations on the baby!  I'm sure you will enjoy it while it's still young! <|endoftext|>
What made your skin look so good? genetic or lifestyle changes? I'm glad you're so happy! <|endoftext|>
Yes, even just a little bit can make a big difference in the way your health looks. <|endoftext|>
How did that work out for you? I am sure it was exciting to get that dress. <|endoftext|>
That's so aggravating! I would be furious, too, and I would never go there again. <|endoftext|>
I used to love those games too, but I always played them a lot when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
I remember those games! They were ahead of their time! Sonic Drive came out in 1985, that was a long time ago. <|endoftext|>
What did you do? Did you call the police or just leave it there for peace of mind? <|endoftext|>
Ghosts are so spoooky! I would have been terrified. I am so sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you are so proud of her. I wish I was more artistic. <|endoftext|>
She must be very talented. I wish I had that kind of focus and dedication to her. <|endoftext|>
Sorry! I meant to say that I am looking forward to my birthday next month and I can't wait! <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? I think it's going to be a great weekend. I'm really looking forward to it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that is so sad. What happened to the kitten? Did you try to save it? <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. I'm glad you were able to rescue an abused cat and make a new friend. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's amazing! I would love to be able to do that one day. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I bet you were so happy. Are you going to spoil the little guy? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I would have been scared too! Tornadoes are one of those weird things for me. They kind of scare me but before they happen and its raining yet still outside I love going out to see whats happening. <|endoftext|>
I am so thankful that they were able to save your dog, I hope that never happens to anyone else. <|endoftext|>
That's great news! How long have they been together in this house?  I know my brother and sister have been together for a very long time and they're ready to get married too. <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that's kind of odd. I thought he was older than you. Well, maybe you can talk to your dad and let him know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
What kind of car are you looking to get? I'm looking at a new SUV myself. <|endoftext|>
RAX4's are really nice. I have a Ford F-Series myself. I love it. <|endoftext|>
How old is he? I remember my room was always a mess when I had a baby. <|endoftext|>
Three months is a long time to be away. I hope you have fun but be careful! <|endoftext|>
that stinks i hate it when they dont ship to you, you should have bought him something else <|endoftext|>
I know right? It's the same thing that you have to deal with if you live in the US. You have to go to the post office and wait for your package to arrive. It's so annoying. <|endoftext|>
That is way too expensive for a tent. Did you have to spend a lot of money? <|endoftext|>
It will get better. Seven years is a long time to hold onto a hurt relationship. <|endoftext|>
It's good you had someone to help you out! Shopping is always a fun time too <|endoftext|>
Save up and buy a lottery ticket, it will come in handy! <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I hope everything has been uphill since then for you. <|endoftext|>
Hahaha, oh grandma, she moves in to everything. You have to love them though <|endoftext|>
Maybe you can make it up to her somehow. Get her a nice gift of some sort. <|endoftext|>
It's sweet you thought that way, even though you didn't know she was ill. <|endoftext|>
That is a huge accomplishment!  She must be a very strong woman!  Is this her first child? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations!  I'm sure you will be happy with whatever the baby has brought up in the past. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope they're both feeling better and you're able to take them somewhere safe. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that really sucks but I'm glad you didn't have to cancel. <|endoftext|>
That is sad. Maybe you can talk to her and let her know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
What kind of club is it?  Hip Hop or House?  Or all of the above? <|endoftext|>
Well, you can't help it. Sometimes we forget things. Maybe you should talk to her and let her know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
Hopefully, she didn't hurt herself. Some elderly people can be a bit of a danger. <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to look at it. I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
That's the spirit! You can do it! I believe in you! What are you working on? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks. Well, at least you know what not to do next time! <|endoftext|>
It could be, maybe you should talk to them and let them know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
What did you do?  Did you sue?  I would sue if I was you. <|endoftext|>
So why did you take so long to shower?  Did you run out of tomatoes? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I hope you were able to find a place to stay until you could get back on your feet. <|endoftext|>
That's no good. Have you talked to your friend about it at all, or is he okay with it? <|endoftext|>
I can't even imagine how I would feel if that happened to me. I hope you don't have to though. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I hope that you are able to cope. <|endoftext|>
That is a long time.  I am sorry to hear you have been through a lot. <|endoftext|>
She must be very talented! What kind of paintings does she like to do? <|endoftext|>
That is a great thing to be proud of. You should be proud that she overcame such a feat. <|endoftext|>
Why did you lie to your parents? Was it about something important to you at that time? <|endoftext|>
Never hurts to try to hit the gym or find a new hobby to occupy your time. <|endoftext|>
Me too! I plan like 10 years ahead of time. I hate not being able to take time off. <|endoftext|>
Perhaps so, but I'm not so sure that's necessarily true. I'm sure you can find someone on the internet! <|endoftext|>
That is a good thing, you shouldn't have to worry about that kind of thing. <|endoftext|>
Model-like girls are hard to sample sometimes. I'm glad you didn't do anything with her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how you must feel. <|endoftext|>
I understand. Take it one day at a time. It will be okay. <|endoftext|>
oh no, did you honk your horn or something? I would have been furious as well <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope you don't have to walk down a path like that ever again! <|endoftext|>
What does that mean exactly? A "white" in reference to breast cancer awareness month, I hope nothing like that ever happens to you. <|endoftext|>
That's no good. Are you going to eat it or send it back to get it fixed? <|endoftext|>
Oh man I bet you are nervous! Just try to stay calm and you will do great! <|endoftext|>
What made you want to be an Ace Atorney? Was it the character's? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that, it must have been awful. Are you okay now? <|endoftext|>
It blows my mind that he can do that to his kids.  He should be in jail! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you manage to get up and fix them or did you have to go home? <|endoftext|>
Well at least you had something to fall on. Hopefully you didn't have to walk far. <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's exciting! How long has it been since you've seen him? <|endoftext|>
American Lego? I haven't heard of that but it sounds like a lot of fun! I hope he enjoys it! <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. At least you were able to get another one though. I hope next time you are able to enjoy it more. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you're able to make it! <|endoftext|>
It was pretty good! I got to work from home and pack for my trip this weekend. <|endoftext|>
Hope you have a good rest of your night! It's going to be a long one! <|endoftext|>
It was in the high 70's so it wasn't too bad.  I just wore shorts and played outside all day. <|endoftext|>
Are you a professional photographer? That sounds like a lot of work to me. <|endoftext|>
Nothing wrong with being silly. It happens to all of us at least once in our lives! <|endoftext|>
Why is that? Is she trustworthy> You shouldn't feel insecure about that. <|endoftext|>
That's really great to hear. I love my girlfriend a lot too. I hope you two have a great life. <|endoftext|>
How do you think you are going to do?  Think you are gonna get an A? <|endoftext|>
You must be feeling pretty good about it!  I think you'll do well if you've been studying so hard. <|endoftext|>
I love animals! I am sure you will have a great time there even if it is a little sad. <|endoftext|>
Eeephants are so cool! I would love to see one in the wild. <|endoftext|>
I would have been so grossed out! I don't think I would ever go back! <|endoftext|>
Yes! You should be directing the conversation so that you can address your problem righhtly! <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure what that means, but I'm happy for you!  I hope you have a great life! <|endoftext|>
I bet that is so exciting! I would be so happy if that was happening to me. <|endoftext|>
I remember those days, they will go quickly once you get used to them, trust me. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you had someone to cover the bills for you. You're a great parent! <|endoftext|>
Me too! I love it when they go really fast down the track.  Do you have a favorite team? <|endoftext|>
Maybe one day you will be as good of a driver as Leonardo DiCaprio. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! What's going on? :D.  Any big plans for the weekend? <|endoftext|>
How exciting! I'm sure you must be really happy. Was it your first time building a house? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What kind of car did you get and how much did it cost you? <|endoftext|>
Audis are pretty nice. I have an Infiniti Q7 and it has killer soundtracks. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet!  What kind of watch did she get you and how much did she pay for it? <|endoftext|>
Well hopefully you will be able to get the same one some day! It would be a great watch. <|endoftext|>
That is a great accomplishment! You should be proud of yourself and your hard work. <|endoftext|>
Just be confident and yourself and I'm sure everything will turn out great! We believe in you. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will do fine, it is always a bit nerve wracking the first day of class. <|endoftext|>
Strate M management seems like an interesting subject.  I hope you do well on your finals! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened between you? Hopefully it wasn't something you caused by. <|endoftext|>
I don't blame you. I wouldn't want to mess with that person either. Maybe they should find a new job. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope that you are getting some time to spend with her now. <|endoftext|>
Man that really blows. I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you guys can work something out to see each other more often. <|endoftext|>
That's disappointing. I hope you didn't pay for the meal. You should report them to the health department. <|endoftext|>
That is quite a large amount of bites, I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can find something else to eat. <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you! I think no one can take away the memories that we have. <|endoftext|>
I was very close to them. They passed away a few years ago, so it's been hard. <|endoftext|>
Dang, was that a good feeling or a bad feeling?  I know I felt a bit nostalgic looking at some of my old family photo albums. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you guys were able to reminisce about old times. It's always nice to cherish the memories. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I'm glad you guys are okay! That must have been terrifying! <|endoftext|>
I did end up being okay, but my house was absolutely devastated. We had everything boarded up. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will be okay. Hopefully it was nothing serious.  Do you have any health problems that would make you nervous? <|endoftext|>
That is not good. What is the problem with your heart. You should go see a doctor <|endoftext|>
That is fast. Did you ask them to take you a look when it was completed? <|endoftext|>
I haven't, that would be so cool though! I always wanted to live in a house on a tree. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  It never is fun going to those things.  What did you do at the funeral? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know you must be very sad right now. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's super frustrating. I wonder why that happened. Did he/she not have any other available patient? <|endoftext|>
Well, to be honest, if he's never given a reason for it, then it's probably for the best that he doesn't. I hope you find someone worthy of your time. <|endoftext|>
Did you tell him to get to his place or no? Sometimes people don't realize they're acting like they're an adult, and need to learn how to take care of things on their own. <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I'm sure you'll do well if you studied hard. What is the test on? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will do great! Just stay motivated and focus on learning everything you can. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I've never been there, but I've always wanted to. I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
I haven't! But I've always wanted to. I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
That sounds so romantic! How long have you two been married? That sounds like a dream relationship. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that is a long time. Congrats! That is very nice of him, do you miss him? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I hope you wrote it down. Congratulations on your new car! <|endoftext|>
I agree. I have a few from my grandfather and it means so much to me. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have a good time at the store at least? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that really stinks. I hope it wasn't too expensive to fix. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he will be fine if he can't do anything wrong! Have you talked to him about it? <|endoftext|>
Take your time and be patient. I'm sure you'll get the hang of it. <|endoftext|>
I think it's very unlikely that they will notice you. Unless you all are really close, then they will ignore you. <|endoftext|>
I think it's better to be honest, even if it might make things worse. At least then you can move on from the situation. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's a real bummer. I hate when that happens and you feel like you've put in the same amount of work. <|endoftext|>
That's great that your hard work paid off! I hope things continue to get better for you. <|endoftext|>
That would bother me too.  What did you do?  I would have sat down next to the baby and talked to the parents. <|endoftext|>
irational as in they way or what? I think you just have to accept that and move on. There are plenty of people out there that are jerks and you don't need to associate with them <|endoftext|>
That sounds like you were confident in your decision.  How do you feel about staying with your current organization? <|endoftext|>
That's not bad at all! You should take the money and invest it in something good for yourself. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sweet of her! You're lucky to have such a caring grandma! What kind of card did she send you? <|endoftext|>
That's the same thing my grandmother did. I feel so sentimental about it. <|endoftext|>
Tornadoes are terrifing. I am glad everyone is ok. Do you have an underground shelter? <|endoftext|>
Hahaha, I get it, and I live in Oklahoma, so I know what you mean. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of you! I moved mine last year and they didn't like it much. Maybe you should water them more. <|endoftext|>
Yes! That's the best feeling. I love to feel loved and cared for. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  You must be excited!  What are you guys going to do? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun! You sound like good friends with her. Are you nervous about the party? <|endoftext|>
Well hopefully she doesnt find out and you dont have to tell her.  Good luck and try to have a fun time! <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you have to be honest with your friends. If it's not a big deal, then it's ok. <|endoftext|>
That is a really tough situation. I would just be honest and tell him how you feel. <|endoftext|>
oh my god. was this at home or at work? and what was the issue with the food? <|endoftext|>
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, your coworkers didn't know it was you! <|endoftext|>
That's disgusting. I don't think I've ever been in that situation, but I wouldn't want to. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you can get some medicine to help with that. I'm sure that's miserable! <|endoftext|>
Why did you steal the TV in the first place? It's not worth the hassle. <|endoftext|>
I think you should tell the truth and clear your conscience. You will feel better. <|endoftext|>
I think it's time to have a talk with her. I'm sure you know what's up. <|endoftext|>
Haha, I would much rather hear your story instead of hearing about it. I'll pm you. <|endoftext|>
It's always pleasant to reunite with old friends! What did you guys do? <|endoftext|>
That's good. It's always nice to catch up with an old friend. I do that from time to time as well. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! Are you going to celebrate now or wait until the semester is over? <|endoftext|>
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I'm sorry you have to deal with that stress in your class. <|endoftext|>
Well that is a good thing, more people need to realize that finances are very important! <|endoftext|>
I plan on it! She just keeps getting better and better. I love her so much. <|endoftext|>
I need to find some good friends to help me.  I don't know where to find them. <|endoftext|>
I see, well suffering is a part of life and it shouldn't be taken for granted. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I hope it wasn't too scary for you? I bet you were glad to be inside! <|endoftext|>
I don't blame you at all. I would have done the same thing. I am so sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, it must be hard to be lonely with a disease like that <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just have to stay positive and hope for the best. I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have friends and family that you can talk to? <|endoftext|>
One month is a long time to be without your loved ones, I hope you feel better! <|endoftext|>
Did you go to the kitchen to ask the cook? Maybe he had something wrong with it. <|endoftext|>
Oh yuck! That is disgusting! What did you do? Did you have to clean it up or did someone else? <|endoftext|>
Where did you go?  Did you stay with a friend or go on your own?  I hope the next trip goes better for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I capitalized well on my own time. I hope you did better next time. <|endoftext|>
I agree with you, you should definitely get some rest before having to wake up at such a ridiculous time. <|endoftext|>
I asked them to be quiet, but they didn't. I was so irritated by it. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, you have a point there. Some people are just too inconsiderate of others. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I would be too. Hopefully it isn't too expensive to have repaired. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he will! How long do you think it will take for him to get there? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope your surgery goes well and a speedy recovery. <|endoftext|>
I had a knee surgery when I was younger. It was a traumatic experience. <|endoftext|>
I hope so too. I feel so bad for the little guy. I don't know what I will do if he is ever home alone. <|endoftext|>
I know right. It's been so hot. Are you in an apartment or a house? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a good plan. I hope you get a lot of sunshine where you are! <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way. You have to keep in mind that you are presenting your ideas in the best way possible. <|endoftext|>
What do you like to do in your free time? Maybe you could find a new hobby? <|endoftext|>
What are some of your favorite movies that you can watch now and then? I know they can be hit or miss sometimes with kids these days. <|endoftext|>
I've never read the Harry potter books, but I watched the movies a bunch of times! <|endoftext|>
Adults should know better than to make fun of kids for no reason. Kidding of course. <|endoftext|>
I am not sure about that, but I do miss the good old days when I thought everything was fake. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I wish I felt that way about my old job. Now I'm stuck in a rut. <|endoftext|>
That's a shame, but maybe it was good for you? I heard they were closing down the one across the street from you. <|endoftext|>
I am glad you found something to keep you occupied. I will keep my fingers crossed that you get the job. <|endoftext|>
That's good, at least you didn't have to stress over it too much. Hopefully next time it goes better for you. <|endoftext|>
It's always a good thing to see people helping each other. It makes the world a better place. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's so awesome! I wish someone would do that for me. I would be so happy. <|endoftext|>
I bet it was! I don't know if I would ever be brave enough to do that. <|endoftext|>
How did you find out if it was a stolen bike or not? Hopefully not too expensive to fix. <|endoftext|>
Hahahaha, I've never experienced that but I feel you. Some people just don't care about what others think! <|endoftext|>
Me either. It is better to just be blunt. That is what works for me. <|endoftext|>
That's great! It's nice to feel good about yourself, even if it's not always obvious to others. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you have a lot of fun and don't get too sunburned. <|endoftext|>
A year and a half.  Costs more than I can afford but my kids are safe <|endoftext|>
Not at all! I'm very articulate and outgoing. I know exactly what I'm talking about. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I've had that happen before, but with a credit card company. I'm glad you got your money back, too! <|endoftext|>
I hear you. Sometimes it's hard to spend money if you don't know what you need. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's awesome! Top performers are usually noticed for what they do, so you must have done something right to get there! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. Are you able to get them to fix it for you? I know how frustrating that can be. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you are so proud of yourself! I'm sure your family is proud as well. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I bet he is so sad. Was you able to get him anything else to eat? <|endoftext|>
That is hilarious and terrible at the same time.  I hope he didn't make you feel bad about it. <|endoftext|>
Aw, I'm happy to hear that! Children are so full of wonder and life. <|endoftext|>
Lol, yes that happens to me all the time. I don't know why but it happens. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope he isn't too upset. I'm sure he'll forgive you soon enough. <|endoftext|>
Well that's good of you, at least he didn't have to drive you somewhere. <|endoftext|>
Haha! That's the way to do it. Easily done in bulk too. <|endoftext|>
That's good that she was understanding. Learning from your friends is the best lesson. <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm sure she understands that you were just nervous. You can't be 100% sure about everything. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I'm so happy for you! What is your presentation about? <|endoftext|>
Excuse me? I am not sure what you are talking about. Explain it again. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling about it? Is it for the best? <|endoftext|>
I hope you can find a way to keep yourself occupied! Maybe watch a funny movie? <|endoftext|>
I hope it is a large one and not a small one.  Good luck either way. <|endoftext|>
Is it a fun job? I mean the job itself, not the hours or the pay? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you had such a good experience. I am sure it was a very happy time for you. <|endoftext|>
Hahaha, I hope so! I think I would be good at it, but I think it would be a little overwhelming at the same time. <|endoftext|>
Haha, yes, it's so hard to keep track of it all. I always end up spending it on something else. <|endoftext|>
Maybe the person behind you was having a bad day. I'm sure it won't happen again. <|endoftext|>
Are you a teacher or substitute or what? I feel for you, I've got 3 teenagers myself <|endoftext|>
Notebooks are great! I have a bunch of those. And a Kindle! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you're feeling better! Did you take days off or was it a Thursday? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I would have been so scared. I don't know if I would be able to sleep after that. <|endoftext|>
Did you get sick? I hope you didn't have to take off work to go to the hospital! <|endoftext|>
Dang that sucks. Well at least you know what to do next time so you will do better. <|endoftext|>
What was the conference about? It's always nice to hear about success stories like that. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear, I'm glad things worked out for him in the long run. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Maybe you can find a cheaper place to eat? Or find a new job? <|endoftext|>
Wow that is coming up soon!  I was going to ask you how it is going to be.  Is it your first child? <|endoftext|>
Waiting is the worst! I have been in that situation before and it is so hard to not think about. How do you think you did on the exam? <|endoftext|>
Well good luck! I'm sure you'll do great. I know I did. :D <|endoftext|>
Dang, sorry to hear that. How do you think you did on the rest of your exams? <|endoftext|>
Like what? Don't let it get you down. I am sure you will be fine. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that must have been a lot of fun! What kind of food did you serve? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll get used to it. Once you settle in, you'll find another job. <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm glad you finally got one! But I can understand why you were lonely. <|endoftext|>
What was in there?!?!? I hope it wasn't a t-shirt or something hah <|endoftext|>
oh thats good! keep doing what you are doing!  i wish i liked something as much as you do <|endoftext|>
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It makes you think about everything. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you can't wait to get fit. Disipline is so important for a healthy body. <|endoftext|>
timing is the key to success. Keto is the way to go if you want to lose weight <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! I hope you are somewhere safe and the damage is being taken care of. <|endoftext|>
That's good. At least you won't be looking for a place to live for a while. <|endoftext|>
I know, right! Well, I'm glad he's safe now. And I bet he won't forget it next time, huh? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that kid had to be put to sleep because his parents were horribly irresponsible. <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's awesome, how long has it been since you've spoke with her? <|endoftext|>
That was very nice of her. Maybe she wanted to tell you about it since you wanted it. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you can figure something out soon. I know how it feels to not be able to make money. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you find a job you love and hate working from home. <|endoftext|>
That is so exciting! Boys are so much fun. Do you know the gender yet? <|endoftext|>
Ill keep my fingers crossed that it goes away for you. I know how bad that can feel. <|endoftext|>
What is an "assentials" I haven't heard of them before. Are they like a ritual? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it will be worth it in the end, you'll be a great parent! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry that happened to you but please don't let it get you down. She gave you the benefit of the doubt. <|endoftext|>
Hope she is in a better place now. That is a tough thing to go through. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes people just don't seem to understand when you're trying to talk to them. Maybe she was having a bad day. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope you were able to get it resolved without too much hassle. <|endoftext|>
That is so exciting!  I bet she will love that!  Did you buy her any toys? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I could have been there to see it! That must have been so fun. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's awesome! 50 metres? I don't think I could run that far. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will do great! I will be watching you in the finals! <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling, nostalgia is one of the factors that drives my love of video games. <|endoftext|>
I remember the genesis! It was one of my favorite video game consoles of all time. <|endoftext|>
Why is that?  Do you not like the train or do you just not like to think about it? <|endoftext|>
I hear you. I am that way with shoes. I hate shoes that go upside down. <|endoftext|>
Yay!  A new car is always a good thing!  What kind are you getting? <|endoftext|>
Those are good cars! I have a toyota and it has not been a problem! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I've been wanting to see that for a long time! How was it? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I shouldn't have gone to bed at such a late age. I should have stayed up all night. <|endoftext|>
That is a good place to be.  There is a lot of things that can help with that. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything in particular that's got you feeling that way? <|endoftext|>
That is so gross. I hope you complained so that they could fix the problem. <|endoftext|>
Good for you! I would have done the same thing, and told the manager as well. <|endoftext|>
That's great! How long did it take you to save up for it? and what kind of bike is it? <|endoftext|>
What kind of gears did you change it up too?  Are you going to let it drive on the road? <|endoftext|>
How exciting for you. A new home is a wonderful place to live. Are you happy with where you are living now? <|endoftext|>
That is a huge step! Refurbishing can be a daunting task. I bet you are excited though. <|endoftext|>
Indeed it ought to be! How long have you been dealing with this issue? <|endoftext|>
I hear you.  I'm in that boat too.  It's hard to find the time or money to even save some money. <|endoftext|>
Aww, I'm sorry to hear that. It's always hard to say goodbye to an animal. <|endoftext|>
I would if I were you, even if it's just for a few more years. I went through the same thing with my best friend a few years ago and I wouldn't have been able to go through with it otherwise. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you going to be able to get the money back? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what that means. Did you get a good grade? <|endoftext|>
I bet that brought back a lot of memories! Did you look through it to find out what happened to them? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope they have a happy life together! I'm getting married next year and I can't wait. <|endoftext|>
What was in it?  I hope it wasn't too bad of a surprise and that you like it as much as you think it will be! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, I'm happy for you. I hope your wife recovers well! <|endoftext|>
Bad parts of town are always scary! Did you get home okay, or did you have to walk? <|endoftext|>
You're very welcome. I hope everything goes your way and you don't have to deal with anything like that again. <|endoftext|>
Did you at least buy food with the money? I hope you learned your lesson, we all make mistakes when we are young. <|endoftext|>
Wow. 17 years is a long time to hold onto something. I am sure he has forgotten most of it by now. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks. How do you think you did on the rest of your test? <|endoftext|>
Hard work always pays off buddy. I am proud of you.    "What do you want to be when you grow up" inspires me to get my education in order so I can be successful one day. <|endoftext|>
Wow, I would have been terrified! What happened? Did you get away from them? <|endoftext|>
Chasing sounds like a lot of fun. I would love to do that some day. I'm glad you got away safely. <|endoftext|>
Pictures are always nice to have, I know how you feel looking back at them can make you feel nostalgic. <|endoftext|>
It's always a nice feeling to come across something you used to have. I still have some but they are probably worth nothing other than nostalgia. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you do get the job, and I hope it goes well! <|endoftext|>
Don't worry. I am sure you will have a lot of fun. Don't stress too much. <|endoftext|>
I've never been to theater to see it, but I've heard it's great! <|endoftext|>
Oh! I don't watch a lot of broadway shows. Are you going to go to it? <|endoftext|>
i love the beaches, sand is just so calming and it feels so good to be close to the water <|endoftext|>
I love the sound of that! I'm glad you got to feel that feeling. I live near the coast, so I know what it's like to be there. <|endoftext|>
I never cheated on any of my exams. Don't feel too bad, everyone cheats at some point in their life. <|endoftext|>
Did you take it? I know it's hard. I always have a hard time sitting for long periods of time. <|endoftext|>
Where are you going to dance?  I hope you have a great time!  Do you have the whole night out or is it more of a get-together kind of thing? <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling, I haven't seen my family for a couple of years now either. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I have lost many this year. They become a part of the family. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I didn't know that was a thing. That would be hard to deal with. I hope you're doing okay! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you get sad about your dad? Is he gone now? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  I know how hard that can be to deal with. <|endoftext|>
Which beach? Did you stay in a condo or go to the wilderness? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I live near the beach, too, so I know what you mean. <|endoftext|>
I'm so jealous! What was it like seeing it in person? I've always wanted to go to theater. <|endoftext|>
Yeah he is. Have you seen the movie "The Grudge"? It is one of my favorites! <|endoftext|>
What did you do with your time? Visiting family always makes me feel nostalgic. <|endoftext|>
I am sure it was! You are lucky to have such good people in your life. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you chase it away and show it who's boss? I hope you didn't get hurt. <|endoftext|>
I am glad you escaped it must have been very frightening for you. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you are a great big brother. You should always care about your siblings. <|endoftext|>
It is good to have someone like that in your life, I am glad you have each other! <|endoftext|>
That can be nerve wracking. How did you end up meeting their parents? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you had a good time at least. Maybe you can invite her back for a beer or something. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that's terrifying. Did you chase it away and show it who's boss? <|endoftext|>
How long did it take to find out it wasn't a ghost? I'd be so spooked out by that. <|endoftext|>
They must be really talented to be able to sing. I wish I could sing too. <|endoftext|>
Well I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you'll get another chance down the road. <|endoftext|>
instructions? like what? how old are your kids? what do you mean by that? <|endoftext|>
complesting is always good, as long as you got what was owed to you <|endoftext|>
Disgusting!  What did you do with them?  I hope you didn't hurt them. <|endoftext|>
I bet.  I would have been sick too.  People need to be more considerate of others. <|endoftext|>
Will you buy me a pizza?  I am so hungry!  You are the sweetest person I have ever talked to! <|endoftext|>
What does that mean exactly? Do you not like the taste of pickles or the texture of vomit? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish my Mother was still around. Hopefully you can spend some time with her soon. <|endoftext|>
That's good! Sorry to hear about your dog, but at least it sounds like it wasn't serious! <|endoftext|>
What do you mean by that? Did you not like the other person's relationship with them? <|endoftext|>
I would still try to talk to them, just to clear your mind. No one deserves to be treated that way, especially if they are your friends. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, that's so gross. I would've freaked out. I hate roaches sooooo much. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I bet you were frustrated.  I would be if my dog did that! <|endoftext|>
That's a tough situation to be in. I hope you can find a way to make it work! <|endoftext|>
I am sure it will be. You just have to keep a cool head and do what you have to do <|endoftext|>
Where did you go?  Did you enjoy yourself?  Traveling is so much fun! <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. How did you try to meet new people? Did you join some sort of club? <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of that what did you eat on your first day alone?  Was it good? <|endoftext|>
Why did you lie to her? Was it about something important to you? I'm trying to understand your situation. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, you definitely don't want to hurt your friendship and I'm sure they know that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That must have been embarrassing. How did you get her to find out? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's good to take a break and reconnect to people you haven't seen in a while. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's so sweet! Did you have a nice time hugging and kissing her? <|endoftext|>
Did she know that you kissed her? That is very sweet and sounds like a great time! <|endoftext|>
Oh, I've been there! It can be intimidating, but I'm sure they were excited to meet you as well. <|endoftext|>
Losing weight is the best feeling. I did it a couple of summers ago. <|endoftext|>
Philosophy is very interesting. What made you want to get into that field? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Maybe you can get a loan from someone to buy you a new one. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope this year is different for you. <|endoftext|>
No, I called the police but they did not do anything because it was a country song. <|endoftext|>
Aww, why is that? Is it because you don't know what he looks like? <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds like fun! Did you guys have a good time at the track and do you think you guys will run again? <|endoftext|>
That is nasty, I am sorry you had to clean that up, I would be so mad. <|endoftext|>
It did! It brought back a lot of memories of when I was younger, and made me feel really nostalgic. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. It takes a lot of practice to be able to move like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that must have been frightening! What happened? Did you manage to avoid it? <|endoftext|>
Good thing you did, it could have been a lot worse, like a zombie out of the mouth. <|endoftext|>
How did you end up doing on the lotto?  Did you win anything?  I never win anything. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's disappointing. You should try your luck playing blackjack some time. You might win some money. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been disgusting. Did you get sick? <|endoftext|>
That's awful and I'm sorry that happened to you. I hope you can find a way to get the money back from your boss. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry. I have had that happen to me as well. It is so hard to lose a beloved pet. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, nostalgia can be a real kicker sometimes. I'm glad you have those to remember her by. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. How are you coping?    I had a close relationship with my sibling too, but we didn't get to spend as much time together. <|endoftext|>
How old was he?  I can't imagine losing a pet at such a young age. <|endoftext|>
I agree, that is why I only watch the news a few times a week, with the exception of the internet. <|endoftext|>
I don't know, but I can't wait to find out the newsletters at my local newspaper! <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet.  How old is she?  I bet she is going to be a sweetheart when she grows up. <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that's nice of you! I'm sure she will enjoy that as much as you do! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you looking for a new one now? <|endoftext|>
That's really rough, but I'm so glad you're getting back on your feet. It sounds like you deserved it. <|endoftext|>
Aldi is a German discount superstore, right? I've never been to one of their stores, but I've heard good things. <|endoftext|>
I definitely will. Maybe they will be my size when I grow up. Haha. Thanks for the advice! <|endoftext|>
I don't watch a lot of basketball, is that a big part of your favorite team? <|endoftext|>
I sure hope so, I am a Carson Wentz fan so I really hope we do well. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you coping with your dad's passing? <|endoftext|>
That is horrible.  I am sorry to hear that.  How long did he live for? <|endoftext|>
That is good that you trust her, that is the best thing for a relationship. Cheating is the worst thing a person can do <|endoftext|>
That is a very interesting and scary thought. I am glad you are confident in her abilities! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. I'm sure you will meet a bunch of new cool people. <|endoftext|>
Best of luck, and a future congratulations on killing it this year! :D <|endoftext|>
I've never been to theater to see a play, but I've always wanted to. <|endoftext|>
I love that show!  Have you always wanted to be a broadway actor? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she wasn't hurt, and I hope that you found out who did it and gave them lots of snuggles! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she didn't break anything, that is so scary. I'm glad to hear she is okay! <|endoftext|>
What kind of dances did you do? Were they hiphop or break dancing? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a really great time, I'm glad you had fun. Who all did you guys battle? <|endoftext|>
How many hours a day do you workout?  I am trying to get in better shape too <|endoftext|>
You are amazing and I am so proud of you! I need to go vegan as well. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Did he study a lot for it? Or is he just really smart? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that.  Do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this? <|endoftext|>
It's good to have those memories, though. Maybe the bad ones can be used as inspiration for something good in life. <|endoftext|>
Why were you nervous? I'm sure they were excited to meet you and were proud of you. <|endoftext|>
Phew! Good job! I'm glad you managed to get it off without too much trouble. <|endoftext|>
Don't be, it's a bold move by her, you shouldn't be able to do that. <|endoftext|>
That's a tough situation. Maybe you guys can move into a bigger home when your son is older. <|endoftext|>
Why were you mad? I think it's really rude to do that to a girl especially when you're involved in a relationship. <|endoftext|>
I would have done the exact same thing. Did he apologize at all or did he just look like he didn't care? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. What do you like to do when you're out in nature? <|endoftext|>
That sounds great! I wish I could garden, but I live in an apartment in the city. I would love to have a garden though! <|endoftext|>
That is so cool!  What did you do or see that you were able to see it? <|endoftext|>
I am so happy that he was able to make it. I hope he gets the part he deserves! <|endoftext|>
That's so fun!  Did she have a good time?  Did you take her to an amusement park? <|endoftext|>
Dang! I bet that was exciting for her. I can't wait to see what she does next! <|endoftext|>
That is so annoying. I can't stand people who don't take responsibility for things that don't belong to them. <|endoftext|>
What are you referring to? I'm sorry I don't know what you are talking about. <|endoftext|>
I am. 2 kids.5 and 14.5 years old. They are the worst lol. How about you? <|endoftext|>
I don't know about that, but I'm happy for him. I'll just try to cherish the moment. <|endoftext|>
Anxiety is the worst. I have had it since I was a little kid. I can relate <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I hope you didn't miss out on too much sleep. I've had to take a lot of naps in the past because of insomnia. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm so sorry! I know how hard it is to fly. Was it because of the height? <|endoftext|>
It's not silly, it sounds like you have a great life. I hope I can find something I love one day as well. <|endoftext|>
Payments are always hard.  I know how you feel because my sister did the same thing about 10 years ago. <|endoftext|>
That's great! You must have a lot of faith in her, I hope it works out. <|endoftext|>
Oh goodness, I'm glad you both moved on.  Did he do something to upset you? <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I grew up with my mom and now I am older and have my own issues. <|endoftext|>
Ohio is a nice state, I have some relatives in that area. Did you guys have a good time? <|endoftext|>
Oh that must be so hard to let go! Do you get to see them a lot? <|endoftext|>
Being late is so unfortunate. Have you talked to him about it and let him know how you feel? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that.  Maybe you can set up a payment plan with a creditor so that you don't have to worry about him. <|endoftext|>
Dieting is hard. I can relate. How much weight have you lost so far? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's fantastic! You must be so proud! What kind of plan did you follow? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. It's nice when our kids are happy about the things we do for them. <|endoftext|>
I hope she enjoys the new job and can celebrate with some wine and good food! <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it can be hard to realize that people aren't really close to you. I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's true. It's part of being a parent, and it takes a lot of strength to be able to do that. I'm sure you're doing a great job! <|endoftext|>
It's always nice to reconnect with old friends! I hope you have a good time. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, middle school was the best time of my life. I hope you're having as much fun as I am right now. <|endoftext|>
I bet you did well. What was the exam for? Do you still have to take it? <|endoftext|>
Don't be too hard on yourself.  There's a lot of things that people do to feel good about themselves just for some reason. <|endoftext|>
Will you have a nice time together and do things you would normally wouldn't do together, or will it be full of surprises? <|endoftext|>
I am sure she is in a better place now. I am so sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. :(  Have you had any seizures in the past? <|endoftext|>
That doesn't sound fun at all. I hope they find out and it's something they can help you with. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I know how that feels. I've been there more than once. <|endoftext|>
It's always tough coming out to that kind of news. I hope you're doing better now. <|endoftext|>
Uh oh, is there something I can do to help? I ACTUEVE you. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully he can get the help he needs. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad! Do you think they are trying to be motivated by something else? <|endoftext|>
Hard work usually pays off. That's what my dad told me when he found out he was going to be a firefighter. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun! I wish I could do something like that! I'm glad you had a good time. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes we have to do that to appreciate what we have. I'm glad you appreciate it that much. <|endoftext|>
That is a huge bummer!  I would be furious as well!  Did they give you a reason why they cancelled it? <|endoftext|>
Traveling Companies are always a gamble. I hope it works out for you guys. <|endoftext|>
What kind of experience did you have? Hopefully it was a positive experience.    Friends come and go in life, it's up to you to determine if you want to reconcile with them or not. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun! I'm glad you had such a wonderful time. :) <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that. Luckily I have roommates, so I don't have to worry about that. <|endoftext|>
That's the spirit! I bet you'll have a great time and make some great friends. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that must have been a scary experience. What did you do? Did you kill it? <|endoftext|>
Good job! That had to be a huge relief. Hopefully, no one got hurt. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I hope you guys enjoy your time there. Are you going with anyone? <|endoftext|>
I know. I am so looking forward to it. This heat in Texas is killing me. It was in the 90's today. <|endoftext|>
You should confront them and if it happens a 2nd time then they are not living with you anymore. <|endoftext|>
Thanks! I've been looking for a good deal for a long time, and I'm near the coast so it's a win-win situation. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that! I have a little sister who is also very young, so I can relate. I hope that you are able to cope. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope they get the help they need. Health is important! <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Sometimes it's better to be rejected than to be played by someone who doesn't deserve it. <|endoftext|>
I am not sure I agree with that.  Do you think there is a god that created all of us? <|endoftext|>
Moving can be both adventurous and a big headache. I hope everything works out for you. <|endoftext|>
I have never been that far north, but I have always wanted to go. I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
I lived in Colorado for a while and would love to move back there. I'm sure there is a place you can learn to ski there. <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear that. Do you have a source that can help you with that? <|endoftext|>
I am hopeful that we can bring some of that to the next generations, and make a change before it is too late. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.  I have been there before and it is hard to watch someone you love turn into a stranger because of their addiction. <|endoftext|>
I really hope she gets the help she needs. I can relate, I had a friend who was in the same situation as you. <|endoftext|>
That is such a heartwarming story. I am glad that you will have a healthy baby. <|endoftext|>
Do you remember going on the ferris wheel? It is one of my favorite things to do in chicago. <|endoftext|>
Yes indeed. They are very majestic. They live in the pacific ocean near the equator. <|endoftext|>
Horror films give me so much anxiety. I cant watch them late at night. <|endoftext|>
I've been wanting to check that out for a long time. I heard it's really good. <|endoftext|>
That is outstanding!  I bet you are so proud of her and can't wait to see what she does there. <|endoftext|>
I hope she is able to! I know she will work hard at it for sure. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awesome!  I bet he is happy.  What kind of ride is it? <|endoftext|>
Preludes are pretty nice. I have a Ford Focus myself. It's a good car. <|endoftext|>
I bet that is a great feeling! I cant wait to graduate myself and start working. <|endoftext|>
Environmental engineering is very impressive! You must be very smart. :) I hope you have a job lined up for when you graduate! <|endoftext|>
Hey, it's okay. Everyone cheats on their significant other from time to time. <|endoftext|>
Just be honest, even if it makes you feel bad. It will make you feel better. <|endoftext|>
What are you going to do with your free time?  I hope you have a good time with them. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I haven't seen them in a long time. I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
I hear you!  Sometimes it's fun to think about the good ol' days.  How many friends did you have in high school? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should set a time and commit to it every day. That's what I do. <|endoftext|>
What was the name of the film?  I'm such a scaredy cat when it comes to horror movies. <|endoftext|>
That sounds about right for MTV, lol.  I bet you were frustrated! <|endoftext|>
That's sweet. I think it's important to cherish the little things in life. <|endoftext|>
That's great you have that type of relationship with your family. I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I bet you were crushed. They are so cute when they are young. <|endoftext|>
Dogs are so much fun, and they really are a man or womans best friend. <|endoftext|>
I know! It is so crazy that he is the president! Do you agree or are you surprised? <|endoftext|>
I'm inclined to agree with you. However, I do wonder if he will reign as president. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope your toe is feeling better now. <|endoftext|>
Healing is always a process. I wish you all the best and I hope your recovery is fast. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.  Why did you have to go to alabama? <|endoftext|>
I've never driven that far. I've only driven a couple of hours. I bet it was fun, at least. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. How did the team take it? Did they try to motivate you? <|endoftext|>
Exactly.  Completely understandable.  I have had that happen a few times. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate it when that happens. Did you manage to get rid of them? <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have a green thumb. Maybe you could hire someone to do it for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm glad you are okay. <|endoftext|>
Proverbillies are scary, I wouldn't want to get up to one. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! I've always wanted to go horseback riding. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow. That does sound like a very colorful horse. I bet it was beautiful! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. Flat tires are the worst to have to drive around in. <|endoftext|>
How do you change them?  By yourself or with a truck?  I've always wanted to learn how to change a car myself, but I've never been able to do it on my own. <|endoftext|>
Nature can be so scary and make us do things we wouldn't normally do. I'm glad you made it through the spring! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you didn't have to go to the hospital to get it checked out! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds fun! I've never been golfing, but I love to watch it. <|endoftext|>
Hey, golf is great for leisure! I'm sure you're having a great time. <|endoftext|>
That does sound like it will be a lot of fun! Do you know where you're moving to? <|endoftext|>
Wow that is a huge difference. Are you going to stay in the same city for the rest of your life? <|endoftext|>
Meditation is a great tool to relax and clear your mind. Have you been doing it long? <|endoftext|>
Relaxation is the key to a good day!  I'm glad you're enjoying it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you call the police or anything like that? I would have been terrified. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I hate that stuff. I had to have a similar experience roofing once. <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. Did they give you a reason why they didn't finish it in the first place? <|endoftext|>
And then you have the people who do it out of their control like those shady people that do it for no reason. <|endoftext|>
I feel you.I tought public speaking was one of the hardest things i had to do. <|endoftext|>
Xanax is a wonderful way to help. I'm glad you were able to get some relief from it. <|endoftext|>
I love farmer's markets. I'm disabled too so I can't always go to the supermarket. <|endoftext|>
I love it there as well, such a great place to live and be a part of. <|endoftext|>
Golf is my favorite sport, and I love the outdoors. Sounds like a win to me! <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that must have been horrible. Was it a big wasp? <|endoftext|>
Not a good thing at all. Hope you don't get that stung ever again. <|endoftext|>
UPS is one of my favorite companies. I wish I could work for them someday. <|endoftext|>
Hopefully they'll take pity on you and return it, if they've lost it in the past. <|endoftext|>
Ah, childhood was the best. No bills, no worries. What are you most fond of? <|endoftext|>
Adulthood is a scary thing, you never know what could happen! But hey, at least you made it through! <|endoftext|>
That's great that you love what you do! It's important to do what makes you happy because life is just too short. <|endoftext|>
That's great, it feels good to have a job you really enjoy doing. Do you get a lot of positive feedback from your co-workers? <|endoftext|>
That's disappointing. I wonder why he didn't bother to make a call. Sounds like he's not a very good friend. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure that was an interesting time for both of you. I can see why you're worried about your friendship. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I don't blame you. I would've been pretty frustrated if someone was messing with me like that. <|endoftext|>
Does she play the lottery often? You should have let you know so that you could win as well. <|endoftext|>
Wow that's awesome! 5000 is a whole lot of money! I hope she was able to manage the money responsibly <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you were very proud of yourself :-) What do you do for a living? <|endoftext|>
Nonsense! You deserve to be proud of your hard work. No one deserves to be called smart or smarter. <|endoftext|>
That's a great idea! What are you going to do to make sure it's in good shape? <|endoftext|>
Those sound like nice things to look forward to. I hope you enjoy your new home and the closure! <|endoftext|>
Oh gosh, that's terrifying. I can't imagine being alone in the dark. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I hope you can find a way to get around. I would be so annoyed at my neighbor for being so careless. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure she'll be back before you know it. <|endoftext|>
No, I haven't, but I hope to one day. I've heard it's great fun! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. How did the rest of the class react? <|endoftext|>
Studying can be nerve wrecking at times. I hope it went well for you. <|endoftext|>
I know right? It makes me so angry. It literally makes my blood boil. <|endoftext|>
I agree. I see so many people drive carelessly all the time. It's a shame. <|endoftext|>
I bet you are excited and nervous at the same time! I hope everything works out for you! <|endoftext|>
I have, it's always a nice feeling! What was it that you were accepted for? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Was it a big one? I hope you were okay!   Big storms can be very unnerving and make you think about things you don't want to think about. <|endoftext|>
I will. I am glad you are okay. Storms are so unpredictable. <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure I know who that is. I'm sorry you had to hear that, though. <|endoftext|>
Yes, there really isn't. It's a shame that so many people can't get the help they need. <|endoftext|>
I am not sure how to respond to that other than to tell you to be confident and wear whatever you want. <|endoftext|>
On no! Did you get a chance to say anything to your boss or get him fired? <|endoftext|>
I really hope you have a good time! That sounds like a lot of fun. What time will you be there? <|endoftext|>
I really like the Haunted House at Universal Studios. It is so much fun! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's awesome! Any plans for what you're going to do with that money? <|endoftext|>
Thats a good attitude to have. It probably wont be long until you are comfortable enough to make the move. <|endoftext|>
Dang! Was that a good thing or a bad thing? I hope it was a good surprise. <|endoftext|>
I still love Santa. He's so sweet. I wish I could see him again. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! did he do it on purpose  or was he just trying to protect you? <|endoftext|>
Trained to what?  I'm sorry you had to go through that.  Training can be tough! <|endoftext|>
Me too! I turn off the tv if its on and I dont know if I can watch the next episode! <|endoftext|>
Crying is never a good thing, but it's natural. Do you have a favorite movie that you can watch over and over again? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun! But I don't think I've ever heard of that place. Is it near where you live? <|endoftext|>
I went to the Williamburg one.  It was awesome!  I hope you had a great time at the one you went to! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, kids are really impressionable about things like that. It's a good thing they didn't get sick! <|endoftext|>
What a naughty child. How did his parents react, if they don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Dang, hopefully he learns his lesson. I wouldn't want my kid to be a bum. <|endoftext|>
That is a very good dog. They are very loyal and it is good to have them by your side when you are feeling down. <|endoftext|>
Well I'm glad to hear that for you and for your dogs.  I hope they continue to get better. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. How long will it take to replace? <|endoftext|>
That is not a good thing to hear. Will your house still be able to hold up? <|endoftext|>
That would be very exciting! Did you all have a good time? I hope so, if you went to the wedding. <|endoftext|>
I understand that completely, I have some fond memories of some of my childhood friends. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. How long will it take them to arrive? (Due to the hurricane, I hope they're not too far away) <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I understand. I am just one in a long distance relationship. So, I get it. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Always nice to see young people have a great time doing something. Was it her first recital? <|endoftext|>
I would love to see that. You should take her to see Beauty and the Beast. <|endoftext|>
I have to do it, or else my parents would disown me. I need to get my life in order, you know? <|endoftext|>
That was so nice of him! You are so lucky to have such a good son! <|endoftext|>
Big jobs are good when you've got a lot of responsibility.  I'm glad you got it taken care of! <|endoftext|>
I do know that feeling.  It's part of life sometimes and it's better not to dwell on it.  Do you have any interview tips for me? <|endoftext|>
No problem! I'm happy to help. Just remember, there are plenty of fish in the sea. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens! Did you throw it away or make a new one? <|endoftext|>
That's such a waste of food. Are you going to make them make it up to them? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I opened my own online store a few years ago. It's so nice to be able to customize everything you want! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that does sound very nice then. I like things that have history and are unique. <|endoftext|>
Hopefully you will be able to take some time off of work and go see her! That will be so much fun! <|endoftext|>
That sounds lonely. How far away did you guys end up getting from each other? <|endoftext|>
Thank goodness for that! It sounds like you had a wonderful time. I am so happy for you. <|endoftext|>
Wow that is a big change! But I think it would be worth it. I heard it's really beautiful. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you are getting better.  My family is very supportive as well. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you have some good memories to remember them by. That's all that matters in the end. <|endoftext|>
I agree. I would never take someone's child in a marriage. That would be wrong. <|endoftext|>
I am sure it will be good for society. It will also help you meet new people. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I've been there. That's a tough one. Do you think he'll tell you? <|endoftext|>
Wow that is a long time. Do you ever wonder why he is so closed minded? <|endoftext|>
Dang, traffic must have been intense. Did you get out and yell at the other driver? <|endoftext|>
Exactly! There are so many people in the world, and they still think they have a right to act however they want. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry. That must be so difficult for you. How are you coping? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I can't imagine what you're going through. <|endoftext|>
Don't give up! I know it can be discouraging, but it will happen. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you should try and get to know people in your field? <|endoftext|>
College is such a great time. I hope she has fun and makes lots of friends. <|endoftext|>
Hey, it's not too late yet. I bet she will come around if you keep persisting. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. That is a lot of things to be prepared for. I hope it all goes well for you. <|endoftext|>
I am going to Cali for a few weeks. I am ready to be there for a change. <|endoftext|>
I don't think I would ever do it. I'm way too afraid of heights. <|endoftext|>
Take care of her! She is in a better place now. I will pray for her! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I think I will. I've got a long drive planned, so it'll be nice to get some rest in the car. <|endoftext|>
I became a vegan about a year ago. I feel like I have so much more energy now. <|endoftext|>
I know! I feel so much better and am so much healthier. I don't miss the taste or texture of meats either! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope that you don't get them. Are they bad headaches or nausea? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that can be. How are you doing now? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  I know you must be devastated. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. Moms are the best. I miss mine so much so enjoy every single moment you have with her! <|endoftext|>
We see each other about once a month. She takes care of me pretty well, so it's the least she can do. <|endoftext|>
Dodge makes some pretty nifty cars! Did you try to see if it was parked? <|endoftext|>
That does sound really nice! I am sure it brought back a lot of wonderful memories. <|endoftext|>
Ewwwwwww!  Sorry to hear that.  Is he just a puppy? <|endoftext|>
ew. did you say anything to her about it? I don't know if I could live with someone who did that to me. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's pretty awesome.  What did you end up having for your dinner? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so good. You are lucky to have a mom who cared like that. Mine just tried to make me a sandwich one time and that was it. <|endoftext|>
I love a good steak, mashed potatoes, and gravy. mmmm <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. It's hard at first, but you'll get over it. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling, spent 3 years together with my wife and now she's back at her old job. <|endoftext|>
What did he make you? I love food, great grandpa sounds like a cool guy. <|endoftext|>
I'll have to try that! Thanks for the recipe. I bet you guys will have a great time. <|endoftext|>
That is great to hear! I bet it is a nice raise and a lot of responsibility! <|endoftext|>
That is a long time. I am sure you have put in your dues. I hope you get promoted soon. <|endoftext|>
How old is she? That's so cool to see them develop and hear their own words! <|endoftext|>
I do not have children. I am still pretty young so I'd like to wait a few more years. <|endoftext|>
Wow, where are you going? Are you traveling for work or for vacation? Have you been before? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That sounds amazing! I have been to Tokyo, but not the rest of the prefecture. I am sure you are going to have a blast. <|endoftext|>
I hope you had fun! Where did they take you? I love going out to eat on birthdays! <|endoftext|>
sushis are the best, i'm so glad you had a good time. i haven't had any in a while <|endoftext|>
That's good, I'm glad you enjoyed it so much. I'm sure your mom is very proud of you. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! How far did you have to go? Did you stop at all? <|endoftext|>
I do! I love going to parks and looking at all the flowers and trees. <|endoftext|>
Do you have any friends around that area? Maybe you could invite them over for a movie or something? <|endoftext|>
Wow that is really far! I think it's good to have a plan and make sure you stay connected to people when you move. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. Where did you move to? Did you have any difficulties with the travel? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear you're going through a rough time. But you sound like you're handling it well. <|endoftext|>
Happy early birthday to your brother! What kind of car is it, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. I hope it's not too expensive to fix. And I hope the best for you. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that does sound like a huge difference. Hopefully you guys can hang out more often now. <|endoftext|>
Yes I have a younger brother and a younger sister. I also have older brothers that are a lot older than me. <|endoftext|>
That's great! How long has it been since you've seen eachother? Did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
Dang, didn't know you spoke with her! Well I'm glad everything ended up okay. <|endoftext|>
Absolutely! I would miss my family and friends but I know I wouldn't miss them if I moved. <|endoftext|>
i try to visit as often as i can. i know exactly what you mean. it's hard. <|endoftext|>
I bet that made you feel awful. Did you have any idea why she would do that? <|endoftext|>
That is good, there is no point in cheating, it is not good for the relationship. <|endoftext|>
Oh cool! What was the play about? And how did your friend handle being in front of the theater? <|endoftext|>
It's nice to have friends you can rely on like that. I hope he is doing well! <|endoftext|>
I used to feel the same way, but then I started to enjoy the peace and quiet. <|endoftext|>
No problem! Hopefully it works out for you, and you don't have to deal with too much drama. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, do you have a good recipe? I've been looking for one to try. <|endoftext|>
That's good, I'm glad you found a way to make it better. I should try and make it sometime as well. <|endoftext|>
Maybe so! Congratulations on getting that extra training! I hope you get a raise too! <|endoftext|>
I agree. Don't let it get to you too much. I'm sure you'll do fine. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations!  I'm sure you will be a great parent!  Is it a boy or a girl? <|endoftext|>
I hope it goes smoothly for you. I know it can be stressful and scary. <|endoftext|>
I do not like scary videos at all. I wish I could have watched them with you. <|endoftext|>
Yes, very much so. I'm very sorry you felt that way. Did you make it out okay? <|endoftext|>
Oh nice! Do you have a favorite team? Or do you just like to watch the games? <|endoftext|>
Are you a big football fan? I don't really watch it, but I know a lot of people who are. <|endoftext|>
Dang! Did you try to see if you could do one, or was it just spectacular? <|endoftext|>
What kind of tv shows are you talking about? Like the one on the Discovery Channel or something else? <|endoftext|>
That's good that you have a nice friend like that. I'm sure he will appreciate the gesture. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that stuff is bad for you. Glad it wasn't anything too serious. Hopefully you won't have to take it again in the future. <|endoftext|>
Hard work always pays off.  What class is it for?  I hope you did well. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's awesome. Sometimes you just have to ask for the help that is needed. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, that's horrible. I hope you and your family can grieve properly. <|endoftext|>
I hope everything works out for them. That is a tough situation to be in. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! How exciting! Do you have any names picked out for the little guy/girl? <|endoftext|>
What a wonderful thing to do. I think most people would do the same if it meant that much to them. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. It is good that you were ready, weather can be fickle. <|endoftext|>
Wow, you're so organized. I wish I was more like you, instead of a mess. <|endoftext|>
Did the get mad at you? I've never done that but I always feel bad about it when I do something. <|endoftext|>
It's okay, we all make mistakes like that, it's how we learn from them is the important thing! <|endoftext|>
That's really nice of you. Is it the flu that is making them sick, or is it something else? <|endoftext|>
Whiny is a good way to describe him. I'm glad to hear he's doing well. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations!  I know that is not an easy thing to do.  What are you going to do now? <|endoftext|>
Hard work always pays off. I am glad that you got that promotion. It is always nice to be commended for your efforts. <|endoftext|>
Movies can be so disappointing. Sometimes we just need a change of pace. What movie was it? <|endoftext|>
Well that sounds like it was a lot of fun! I am glad you all had a good time. <|endoftext|>
I hope it was for a good reason and not the worst case, that would not have been fun. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I'm so happy for you! I hope you lovve it there. <|endoftext|>
What did you do? I can't stand people who leave their dogs out all day. That's no life for a dog. <|endoftext|>
That is sad. I hope she will start to notice her cigarette addiction soon. <|endoftext|>
That was so nice of him! I would have been so embarrassed. Pizza is my favorite food <|endoftext|>
I hope you were able to leave and find somewhere else to go. I know laughing can make you feel that way. <|endoftext|>
That is great! I remember when my son learned. It is so cool to see them learn and grow up so fast. <|endoftext|>
Haha!  My dog does that too!  I have to clean it up afterwards though. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That does sound like a long time. Do you guys still keep in touch? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great time. What kind of animals do you like to see at the zoo? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I'm so sorry. I know how hard it is to lose a pet. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he's in a better place now. I lost my grandmother to cancer not too long ago. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. I know how that goes. At least now you have a good job? <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling, man. Checks seem to be getting more and more common these days. I miss the old days. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Does that mean you have to ride it every day? I would be so frustrated. <|endoftext|>
Cheap? Well, I'm not one to spend a lot of money at a store anyway. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it a friend or family member that is helping you out? <|endoftext|>
That's so sad to hear. I hope you find someone better and you stay happy forever! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Were you able to laugh about it or were you mortified? Hopefully you were close to your family and they didn't make you feel bad. <|endoftext|>
That's good! I love ribs, and I'm glad you enjoyed it as much as I did! <|endoftext|>
How old is he? Time flies so fast, I wish you the best of luck with him going back. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that is just the cutest! I'm glad you were able to look back and remember that time with him. <|endoftext|>
No, I don't. But I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you didn't get hurt. <|endoftext|>
Did you land on something or injure yourself? I hope you don't have to go to the hospital! <|endoftext|>
That is very nice of you. I bet they were very appreciative of it. :) <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I am sure they understood. 19 is still pretty young. Hopefully you guys had a good time. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my sister a few years ago in a car accident. <|endoftext|>
I understand. I felt the same way. I am still not over it, even though I am over it. <|endoftext|>
It sure is a blessing to have a job. Some people don't have that. <|endoftext|>
Amen! That's what I'm saying. I love my son so much, I could not be happier. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I hope you find some soon. I know how it feels to be lonely. <|endoftext|>
How long have you been working for them?  Do you like it?  I've always wanted to get into the construction business. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you try to retrace your steps to find it? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it does take a while. I bet you were itching to get out of there! <|endoftext|>
I love those! Were you surprised by anything in particular, or just that there was a party? <|endoftext|>
Happy Birthday!!!! I hope you had a great day! Did you do anything special? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where do you live? Have you tried calling them? <|endoftext|>
That's going to be so fun! I bet they're going to have such a great time. I've never been to the Philippines, but I've always wanted to go. Have you been there before? <|endoftext|>
I would have been too! What show is it? Maybe you can watch it online somewhere else. <|endoftext|>
I have not seen it yet. Was it good?    I have been wanting to watch it for the last couple of months but never got around to it. <|endoftext|>
Me too! It's nice to be able to give people a ride in case you need it. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just have to take the high road and do what is best for you. I'm glad to hear that things have worked out in the end. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Why do you need a vacation so bad? Is it because you're sick? <|endoftext|>
How long do you think it will take? I think it's good to get used to flying long distances. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Hopefully she understands it was an honest mistake. Maybe she will invite you in the future. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully you can get together with them again soon! <|endoftext|>
Sundays are always so much better when they're done with chores! Did you do anything fun with your extra time? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I would love to have a garden. I just don't have the time or patience. <|endoftext|>
Oh, believe me, I've been working hard on the yard all week. I'm ready for it to be over! <|endoftext|>
That is so hard to deal with.  I am glad you have faith in him and that he makes it work. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure he's going to be fine. I hope he gets to live in those tall buildings while he's there! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, how did you feel when you found out that he was trying to cheat on you? <|endoftext|>
Did she have a hard time getting up and moving to where you were staying? I can see how that would make you feel. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear.  What kind of talents does she like to exhibit? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure she'll be happy wherever she goes. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is so sad. I hope she wasn't hurt. I would be upset too! <|endoftext|>
That's good that you took the right steps to protect the family. Good on you for standing up for your little family. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. What's got you feeling that way? Is it related to his job? <|endoftext|>
I bet! I used to have to work the night shift at a gas station and it was awful. <|endoftext|>
That's really nice of him! I'm sure you deserve it after all those years. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! <|endoftext|>
Well, you know what they say about the grass is always greener on the other side. :) <|endoftext|>
I know, it is really gross. I don't know why people are grossed out by it. <|endoftext|>
I would have been so grossed out! I am so sorry you had to see that! <|endoftext|>
I bet! I hope it's a good bonus and he doesn't have to take too long. <|endoftext|>
I bet.  Well, I hope it's a good bonus and he gets it. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, maybe you should go out and enjoy some single life for a while. <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. At least they have a place to stay until they move out. <|endoftext|>
I feel you. When my youngest started school, I felt the same way. They grow up so fast. <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean. My 13 year old just went off to college, and while it's hard to think of how much longer she's going to be away, I really miss her. <|endoftext|>
That's terrifying! What happened? Did you go home and check on it? Did it sound like gunshots? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well good job finding it, I'm sure it was well-earned! <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you coping with his passing away? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that, it must've been so hard. At least you gave him a lot of time to spend with you. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you continue to feel good about yourself at your new job. It sounds like you worked really hard for it. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! Why would she do that to someone you trusted so much. <|endoftext|>
I don't blame you, I would be upset too. I hope you can work it out without too much drama. <|endoftext|>
Which beach? Did you stay at home or go to the Outer Banks National Park? <|endoftext|>
I love memories like that! They are always a source of happiness and nostalgia! <|endoftext|>
Did you have a talk with your boss? Or did he just ignore it? I'm sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
That's not good, have you talked to him about it? outpersonity is hard to come by these days <|endoftext|>
How was it? I have always wanted to go to New York to see Theater District. <|endoftext|>
I just Googled it and it said it was nominated but won't get a prize. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Is it something that happens often for you? <|endoftext|>
Were you in a hurry? I'm glad you didn't get in trouble for it. <|endoftext|>
What do you think you'll do? I'm sure that's a very exciting time for both of you. <|endoftext|>
Well, I wish you the best of luck. It sounds like you have a good opportunity. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! Why did you feel that way. That doesn't seem right to me. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  I hope you can find the courage to talk to her again. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Why couldn't you be there?  That must have been so disappointing. <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear it turned out well.  That must have been quite an ordeal for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's awesome! What concert? And how long have you been together? <|endoftext|>
That is so awesome!  You must have felt so loved!  What a great experience for you! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  It's hard to find a good boss these days.  What kind of work do you do <|endoftext|>
That doesn't sound good. Maybe you should talk to him and let him know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that must have been terrifying. I bet you didn't sleep for weeks! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds terrible. I hope you get some solutions to get rid of them. <|endoftext|>
I hate that! I wish I could just go back to sleep and not wake up so tired. <|endoftext|>
I think it has to do with the circadian rhythm being off and all that. <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I hope it goes well for you. Buying a house is a big deal. <|endoftext|>
That must have been a very exciting sight. Were you able to paint it a certain color? <|endoftext|>
That's great! Are you guys usually not a lunch-or-today kind of person? <|endoftext|>
That is unfortunate, I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is at least at peace now. <|endoftext|>
I know how that goes. I have a lot of work to do too. Don't feel bad. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you need to lay down the law and ground her. That's what my Mom did to me when I was a child. <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet.  You must be her role model!  How old is she now? <|endoftext|>
That's nice that you can trust your wife like that. I can't grow a beard so I don't know what I would do. <|endoftext|>
That was nice of you. You sound like a good aunt or uncle. Age is just a number. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome!  You must feel so proud of them!  Did it make you feel good to see? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you do get the job, you sound like you would be a good fit for it. <|endoftext|>
recruiters are great. i wish i would have gotten a better job out of the one i have now. <|endoftext|>
I love looking at my old photos, and remembering the good times I had when I was younger. <|endoftext|>
I have a lot of photos of me and my sister, too. It's nice to look back on them and remember when they were so little. <|endoftext|>
I hope it wasn't for any reason that you shouldn't have been! I'm sure it was for a good reason. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find someone worthy of your time again. <|endoftext|>
What kind of job is it for? I'm in the process of interviewing for one myself. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you get the job, you sound like you really want it. <|endoftext|>
Did you eat it all? That would have been a gluttonous day for me. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad, I'm sorry it didn't turn out well. Did you ask for a refund? <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that. why did she do that? i hope it wasnt a bad thing. <|endoftext|>
That is a long time.  I hope you both have a lot of good times together. <|endoftext|>
That sucks. Did you mention it to them? Maybe they were just busy with life and didn't have time? I hope it wasn't too bad for you. <|endoftext|>
You are very important to me and I care about you! You are an important person in this world and I am important to you! <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's awesome! I can't wait to hear back from them because I really think I have this one in the bag! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's a pretty prestigious position! I hope you get the job, you deserve it! <|endoftext|>
What happened? I hope it wasn't a ghost!    Are you always scared to use the bathroom? <|endoftext|>
Dang. Did you get out of the toilet? Did you take a picture at least? <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! That is so sad. I am so sorry to hear about that. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm happy for you. Maybe one day I'll be able to conquer my fear of heights that way, too. <|endoftext|>
I hate that! At least you can take comfort in knowing that your toilet will be replaced. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well at least you watched a bunch of videos to practice. You'll get it next time I'm sure! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, old people can be rude sometimes.  Did you speak to her about it? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just have to let those things go. Embrace the anger and the anger. <|endoftext|>
I bet you were.  How long have you been married?  Did you have any difficulties at first? <|endoftext|>
Ahh, I see. Well, that is a bit different, but I am sure you will meet again someday! <|endoftext|>
Old people can be so troublesome.  Did you try to talk to her about it? <|endoftext|>
Did everything turn out okay? I hope she didn't get in trouble for something that wasn't true. <|endoftext|>
I am so excited for you!  I hope that house warming party is super fun! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. It's always nice to have a new home. <|endoftext|>
What kind of car did you get?  I hope it was worth the excitement! <|endoftext|>
Dang, nice. Mustangs are sick. I bet it was a fun day for you <|endoftext|>
That would scare the heck out of me! Were you able to get back to sleep? <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that's terrifying. I'm glad you made it out okay. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean.  My wife and I took the kids to the mountains last weekend and it was just wonderful.  But I guess it is true what they say about the grass is always greener on the other side. <|endoftext|>
Me too! Surfing is my favorite thing to do! Watching the waves and the people is so fun! <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you win! What is the prize for being the best speller? <|endoftext|>
Hard work always pays off. I am sure you will knock it out of the park. <|endoftext|>
How is it going?  Have you heard back from any potty training consultants? <|endoftext|>
That is a tough one. At least now you can introduce her to the rest of the world! <|endoftext|>
Dang, I can imagine. How long will she be gone for? Does she have anyone to hang out with? <|endoftext|>
That's a long time. Give it some time and I'm sure you'll be fine. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! How long did you have your dog for? <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I lost my best friend last year. It will get better. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I bet you two are going to have a great time. I just got married 2 months ago and although it was hard at first, it's been an amazing adventure. <|endoftext|>
Well, as long as you're making an effort, that's all that counts. I'm sure you'll do fine. <|endoftext|>
Horror movies give me so much anxiety. I can't watch them late at night. What was the name of the film? <|endoftext|>
I don't think I would be able to sleep if one of those had a gun pointed at me. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! Where are you headed to? I hope it's a good time and you have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome. take lots of pictures, you will want to remember all of those memories you are going to make. <|endoftext|>
Wow, you must be really excited for her. I hope you guys have a great time! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awesome! I bet you'll have a lot of fun. I've always wanted to go to Europe <|endoftext|>
What are you having for dinner tonight? I hope it was a great night for you and your family! <|endoftext|>
I hope you have some canned goods. Can't always go wrong with food. <|endoftext|>
What movie is it? I've never seen it.   Was it good? <|endoftext|>
That is a scary movie! I am glad you made it through the night without too much trouble. <|endoftext|>
That's really sweet of her. You're lucky to have such thoughtful and thoughtful women in your life. <|endoftext|>
That's so great to hear. I hope things work out well for you guys. :) <|endoftext|>
Hey it happens to the best of us. I hope you didn't get too mad at yourself for it. <|endoftext|>
Maybe it was just a tree branch, but you still found it interesting none the less. <|endoftext|>
That's nice to hear! Did she do anything extraordinary to make you proud of her? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you get to spend a lot of time with her! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope you weren't too angry with him. Kids can be kids and make mistakes. <|endoftext|>
Well, that's unfortunate, but at least you got a good story to tell! <|endoftext|>
Being nervous is totally understandable. They chose you, so they definitely think you can do it! <|endoftext|>
Just take a deep breath and treat it like any other interview, I'm sure you'll do great! <|endoftext|>
It's good that you were able to leave them with your friend. I'm sure they were happy to be with you. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad it was a happy ending. It's those close friends that matter the most, after all. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's a long time to be apart. How do you feel about that? <|endoftext|>
I've been playing a lot of COD lately. I can't wait for the new COD to come out. <|endoftext|>
That must be tough. I'm sure you miss her a lot. How long will she be away for? <|endoftext|>
Will you be going out or are you just going to sit and drink wine and eat pizza? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Maybe you should invest in some good comfy comfers. <|endoftext|>
Could you move to a different part of the city?  I moved to Colorado from Tennessee and it was the same way. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! How did they get the position if they didn't have the right qualifications? <|endoftext|>
I hope it all works out for you. Just don't give up hope. Maybe you'll win next time. <|endoftext|>
I've never heard of that movie. I'll have to check it out, thanks for the rec! <|endoftext|>
I think I will save it for my boyfriend, he loves sci fi and horror. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I don't have to worry about paying bills or having to pay for anything. It's pretty great. <|endoftext|>
It's nice that you have good friends to turn to when you need them the most. I'm glad you have them. <|endoftext|>
What did you eat? I hope it wasn't something you ate from a cockroach. <|endoftext|>
I love liver. Hopefully it wasn't salted and peeled though. That stuff stinks. <|endoftext|>
Labs are the best! They're so sweet and gentle. I bet he's a great companion. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you got to feel better. It's the little things that count the most I think. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm the same way.  Thankfully, I don't have any dogs of my own, but I volunteer at an animal shelter sometimes.  I could see how that would be an overwhelming experience. <|endoftext|>
Moving to a new place is always hard. Are you going to be able to visit them often? <|endoftext|>
It is a lovely place to live. I hope you do end up there some day. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think the wedding would have been better if you went with someone else? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just have to do what is necessary. I hope the next person is more deserving. <|endoftext|>
Did you ever try talking to your supervisor about the problem? Maybe they could help you solve it. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you don't have to deal with that anymore. It must make your job a lot easier. <|endoftext|>
Ooh, where to? I've been all over the world, but would love to go to another country. <|endoftext|>
Gatlinburg and Panama City Beach, Then I took an adult trip to New Orleans. Great summer. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you holding up? Did you have to go to the hospital? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I would have been so scared. Did you find out who it was eventually? <|endoftext|>
Did they give you a reason why?  I would think they would just want to forget about it and do it so you don't have to worry about it. <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that's convenient. At least you get to get it back now. <|endoftext|>
School shopping is a good way to get out of the house and get some stuff done! <|endoftext|>
That happens to me too. I always end up having to go to the store after I get there. <|endoftext|>
Well that's good, at least you have that to fall in love with. Too bad it didn't work out. <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's awesome! Did you ask her why she took time off, or was it a surprise? <|endoftext|>
That's great. The summer is a great time for beaches and relaxation. Did you go to one of those local beaches or one of the national parks? <|endoftext|>
Aw, well maybe you can take her out for dinner after she gets home. I'm sure she'll understand! <|endoftext|>
Maybe you could go on a day that she would like to go as well and that way you can share it with her. <|endoftext|>
What movie?  Was it good?  I've never watched a horror movie in my life! <|endoftext|>
I love me some good screaming during the night!  Nothing like it to lift my spirits! <|endoftext|>
Well I really hope that it will happen for you soon. I'm sure you'll get there! <|endoftext|>
Please do go in to detail! I would love to know the ins and outs of these things! <|endoftext|>
What is the name of the book? I love reading a good book every now and then. <|endoftext|>
Well I hope the best for you and your new puppy! I'm sure it's going to be a great adventure. <|endoftext|>
Yes it is good to have someone that is always there for you no matter what. I am thankful for that in my life. <|endoftext|>
It takes a lot of patience, but it is totally worth it.  I wish you the best! <|endoftext|>
That's a tough one. My oldest was the same way. You just have to keep trying, and I'm sure he will get better with age. <|endoftext|>
It's hard for kids to stay disciplined, but he will grow out of it. <|endoftext|>
Surprise parties are so much fun.  Did you have a lot of fun planning it? <|endoftext|>
That's so sad, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you get to see your friend soon! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. How long have you two been together?   (And congratulations to the both of us!) <|endoftext|>
That's so great to hear! I'm happy for you and your new daughter! I hope the future holds many more wonderful moments like these. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's a lot! I actually don't like any kind of insect. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that, it is pretty funny. I guess I was just a little kid then! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Why couldn't you go? That sounds fun to me...and you shouldn't feel guilty! Sometimes life gets in the way and we can't always get time off. Maybe you'll be able to make it up to them somehow. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible, I'm sorry to hear that! Hopefully they at least gave you overtime. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she knew you were thinking of her. And she would want you to feel loved. <|endoftext|>
train her to understand when you want her to come back, so that you can give her a treat when she gets back <|endoftext|>
What movie are you going to see?  I haven't been to the theater in a long time. <|endoftext|>
Are you going to buy a purse? I hope you have a lot of money in it. <|endoftext|>
I do the same thing sometimes. I feel bad because sometimes I don't know what to do. <|endoftext|>
It's a Korean snack that you get when you go on a vacation and it's supposed to be really good. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Hopefully it wasn't too big of a problem. Did you figure out how to fix it? <|endoftext|>
Thanks for the tip! I am a sucker for some good etsy finds! <|endoftext|>
That's a long drive! Did you have trouble sleeping? I have a friend who drives a lot and he says it's better to sleep in than drive. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I'm glad you got to see it, and it sounds like you have fond memories of it at least <|endoftext|>
I'll have to keep that in mind the rest of the day is going to be pretty easy. <|endoftext|>
I hope they didn't hurt you, that was very irresponsible on their part. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is exciting! Do you have a lot of stuff you need to get done? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I hope you have fun and don't spend too much money! <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. It's an important moment in a kid's life. Did you graduate? <|endoftext|>
Not sure what that means, but it's good that you are there for him no matter what. <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's awesome! I don't like going to pools because I feel like everyone is always watching me and it makes me feel self conscious. <|endoftext|>
Are there any other types of sports you like to watch or play besides soccer and tennis? <|endoftext|>
I was lonely for a while. But then I got a good group of friends and started hanging out with them a lot. <|endoftext|>
That's awful, my friend. I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together? <|endoftext|>
That is a beautiful song. I am sure you will have a nice night listening to it. <|endoftext|>
80s were good time. Social media makes it hard to be kidnapped and kidnappers <|endoftext|>
Well, kids are just kids, and they need to learn how to motivate themselves at some point. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should start with a small garden? You could start with that and work your way up to bigger ones. <|endoftext|>
Haha, I think I would have done the same thing. Did you ever find out what it was? <|endoftext|>
I hope you didn't have too much trouble getting out. I know basement living can be scary! <|endoftext|>
Yeah it can be annoying. What is the worst thing that has ever happened to you on it? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you got to just do it and hope they don't charge you more. I HATE when they do that. <|endoftext|>
She sounds wonderful! What kind of a job does she want to have when she graduates? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that should be fun, at least. I hope she has a good time! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she'll be flattered if you're honest about your feelings. If she's a good friend, she'll understand. <|endoftext|>
I hope it works out for you, I know how you feel because I had a girlfriend like that. <|endoftext|>
Whoops! I bet that was a bummer. Were you able to find anything else you wanted to buy? <|endoftext|>
It is! Bison is also a lot cheaper than the meat you'd usually find at a butcher. <|endoftext|>
I love dogs, they are so sweet and gentle. Do you take it for walks? <|endoftext|>
Poor little guy. I hope he feels better soon. Maybe some kind of water will help to soak up the smell. <|endoftext|>
Aw, I bet you miss him. Toddlers are so fun, but can be a handful! <|endoftext|>
I am sure he will when he gets back. Thank him for his sacrifice and service! <|endoftext|>
Uh oh.  Did anyone notice?  Did you try to play it off like nothing happened? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty lucky, pretty sure I would've cried a little bit if that happened to me. <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling. Do you have any hobbies that could keep you occupied while he's gone? <|endoftext|>
I am sure he will be home soon. Thank him for his sacrifice and for his country. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Is she okay? I hope she wasn't in too much pain. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope she gets better.  Is there anything you can do to help her? <|endoftext|>
What kind of issues does your cat have? Sometimes cats can be problematic when it comes to issues with humans. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she didn't do that! Did you tell her you weren't feeling it? <|endoftext|>
What are you working on, and why are you trying to complete it?  Is it too slow to get it done? <|endoftext|>
Don't give up! I know it can be disappointing and disappointing, but there are plenty of fish in the sea. <|endoftext|>
I am so jealous of you. I have never seen The Last of the Mohicans. <|endoftext|>
I LOVE musicals. I saw it in the theater once. I can't wait to see it now! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you're feeling better. <|endoftext|>
Dang.  Well, I hope you can still remain friends with your coworker, even though you didn't have to. <|endoftext|>
Where has she been going? Is she scared to go back to her home country? <|endoftext|>
That's not too bad, but I imagine it would be annoying and a pain to deal with. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! That is a great accomplishment. Do you feel relieved to be on your own? <|endoftext|>
That's exciting! I'm sure you'll make a great home. Just keep working hard :) <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you have a lot of nice memories you can cherish together. <|endoftext|>
Thats good to hear. I hope she continues to get better and you can enjoy many more years with her! <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way. I always give them some money when I see them on the streets. <|endoftext|>
That's very kind of you. What is the name of your charity? <|endoftext|>
What did he do?  Was it something that he really enjoyed doing or was it just for the heck of it? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well you know what they say about dogs, they can't all be good. <|endoftext|>
I know right? I would never cheat on my wife. I could never hurt someone I love like that. <|endoftext|>
I haven't, but I've had my car broken into a few times. Not a fun thing to happen. <|endoftext|>
Please tell me it wasn't a big thunderstorm. Those are some of the most terrifying moments in life. <|endoftext|>
Did you find out who did it yet? I hope its not some jerk and rip you off. <|endoftext|>
Ah, so you're the new dad. Congratulations! That's such a wonderful thing. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel.  My wife and I had a set of twin 3 month ago.  At first I was jealous, but then I realized it was fine. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling, It's nice to have someone that loves you unconditionally. <|endoftext|>
It is hard, but I try my best to stay busy to keep my mind off of it. Do you have any siblings? <|endoftext|>
Oh man, why do you have to do that? Don't you just hate grocery shopping? <|endoftext|>
I hear that! I moved away from my hometown for college and now I'm back in the city. I definitely don't miss the rural areas at all. <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! I hope you have a great time! Is it your first time going? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you have a good time and remember it for a long time. <|endoftext|>
Wow, you must be a great student and teach as well! Good job, you should be proud of yourself and the hard work you put in. <|endoftext|>
Hard work tends to pay off. I look forward to winning the lottery one day! <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! You must be very proud of them. I am sure they appreciate you very much. <|endoftext|>
Do you have a favorite picture of yours that you are looking forward to sharing with your kids? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Is there anyway you can go to him and ask him to slow down? <|endoftext|>
promotions are always good. i hope you guys will celebrate and eat something great tonight! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Hopefully you qualify for unemployment while you get back on your feet. <|endoftext|>
Best of luck with that, I hope you find something good.  New jobs can be stressful. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I hope you get it, you sound like you would be a good fit for it. <|endoftext|>
I have not, I don't think it is in the cards for me right now. <|endoftext|>
Why do you feel like you have to do that? Does your girlfriend not trust you to go alone? <|endoftext|>
guys always want to talk to their girlfriends. it's so weird. i don't get it. <|endoftext|>
That is so cool, I bet you were happy to see them after such a long time! <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope you have a great time with your friend! I am sure it will be fun. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! Maybe you should get a new one, and keep him out of the house. <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I hope you can get through the day without having to see it again. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I have been through that before! What kind of job did you move for? <|endoftext|>
Awesome! That's great to hear. Sometimes all you need is a little push through and you'll do great! <|endoftext|>
That would make me mad, too. Why do parents have to let their kids get hurt in the first place? <|endoftext|>
I hope he learns his lesson. I know it stinks to lose your sense of humor over something like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm sure you are devastated. <|endoftext|>
Well, I hope that you can find a cure one day. I know how much it stinks to be in a situation like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I bet you were happy to see her after such a long time. <|endoftext|>
Dang! A year is a long time. I'm glad you got to see them finally. <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I'm sure if you stay focused you'll do great. What subject is it? <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck, and try to stay as organized as you can! <|endoftext|>
What was the drawing of? Was it from when you were a child or an old photo album? <|endoftext|>
Ah yes, I can see why that would make you think of them then. They grow up so fast. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it was a cute proposal at least. When did you get married? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I black out every time I get a cold lol. I hope your friend is ok! <|endoftext|>
Where do you live? I'm in Oklahoma and we have hurricanes all the time but not many tornadoes. <|endoftext|>
I always keep a spare tire in my car in case the weather is rough. <|endoftext|>
Puppies are the best birthday present ever! What kind of puppy did you get? <|endoftext|>
What a cute name! I bet she is a joy to have around. Dogs truly are man's best friend. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I bet she is a cutie pup. Aren't they supposed to be scent hounds? <|endoftext|>
Oh my god! Are you going to ask them to pay for it? That is so messed up. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I would take it to the dealership and tell them what happened. <|endoftext|>
I hate that! It is so noisy and makes you feel like you are in trouble. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you could find a way to work your way up to it by doing a lot of research? <|endoftext|>
I bet you'll get in, I know you can do it! What is your degree in? <|endoftext|>
I bet it is, but I am sure you will make a great parent.  Do you have any children of your own? <|endoftext|>
I love gardening. It's so relaxing and therapeutic. What did you grow? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I love gardening. It's so relaxing. What do you grow? <|endoftext|>
That was very nice of them. Did they help you move your stuff out or fix anything in return? <|endoftext|>
Dang. Well karma will get them someday I guess. At least you got your yard cleaned. <|endoftext|>
Wow that's great! You must be so proud of him. What's he going to do now? <|endoftext|>
That's going to be a tough course for him, but I'm sure he'll do well. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  I hope you have a lot of fun and that she does, too! <|endoftext|>
I am thinking of a waterpark we have down here, it only had a few more weeks before they close for the year. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you are ok!  It happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
Well, at least you were able to laugh it off and not take it to heart. I'm sure your date felt the same way. <|endoftext|>
I've had that happen before. Customer service is very important, and they should be more considerate. <|endoftext|>
I've actually applied to jobs like that, but have never gotten a call back. Maybe I need to try harder. <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing that the employee was there to help. I'm sure that helped you feel a little better. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure it was just an accident. People make mistakes all the time. <|endoftext|>
How are you doing now? Did you lose anything you can't replace? I hope everything is okay! <|endoftext|>
I'm so glad you and your family made it out okay! That must have been so frightening. <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet.  Was it a special occasion or was it just out of the ordinary? <|endoftext|>
Did you know that the word "date" actually comes from the Greek words "dialect" which means "to win"? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! Are you going to be in the room with them? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry that happened and I hope you are able to find something else to eat that is good for you! <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh!  I bet you are so excited!  Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
I hope she does too. Christmas is a great time to visit. I am sure she would love to see you. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. It must be very hard to see loved ones with alzheimer's. <|endoftext|>
That is good that you have that kind of relationship. It is important to have that type of relationship with your kids. <|endoftext|>
They must really like you!  Did you get any presents?  Also, how old did you turn today? <|endoftext|>
Well, now you do!  You are loved and appreciated and I am sure it will make you feel even better! <|endoftext|>
Did you study for it? If you did well I'm sure you did. Don't worry. <|endoftext|>
Almost makes me wish I was still in school!  What are you getting your degree in? <|endoftext|>
Aw, shucks, I don't have any kids. I bet I would be proud of mine if I did have one. <|endoftext|>
Thats not good at all, did he research what happened for that test and why he got it? <|endoftext|>
Good for you guys! I hope you get it.  Don't be afraid to take a little vacation or a nice vacation you've been wanting to go to.  You'll enjoy it more when it's all paid off! <|endoftext|>
Well, I wish you luck. And try not to stress too much about it. There's no reason to be worried. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, why didn't he come? That seems like a really jerk move on his part. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I would be pretty upset too if I was in your shoes. Hopefully he has a good explanation for not showing up. <|endoftext|>
That's great! What's going on tomorrow?!?!? ;-)  I love a good positive attitude and a good outlook on life.  It's a great way to start the day! <|endoftext|>
That is a great attitude to have. Tomorrow is a new day and a new start. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult. Do you have friends and family that you can trust? <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. That happened to me a couple years ago and it sucked to be by yourself. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? Did you end up flying with the help of someone else? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I bet you were glad to be done with those nervous times! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure there must be someone out there for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I hate when that happens. I bet you were frustrated that it didn't work the first time you tried. <|endoftext|>
A surprise computer is a great gift!  I'm glad you were able to get one.  What do you like most about it? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, no one can ever take your love for them over a stranger. <|endoftext|>
That is so cool! I have never played poker but I would have loved to. How much did you win? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! It's always worth it in the end, as long as you're happy! <|endoftext|>
I was having a nightmare and a spider was on the ceiling.  I jumped and ran back into the house. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you could find a moisturizer that will help with your skin. <|endoftext|>
What are some of your favorite games that have come out in the last year or so? <|endoftext|>
Yeah it's really grown in popularity. I can't wait for the new Metroid Prime. <|endoftext|>
That's so annoying! I hope they made it right for you guys.   Sometimes there can be a glitch with the machines, but it's still frustrating when they do that, especially when you're trying to be impatient! <|endoftext|>
I understand. I would feel the same way in your shoes. Hopefully your next meal is better! <|endoftext|>
I bet you miss her a lot. That's very nice of her to do that for you though. <|endoftext|>
Being alone can sometimes be a good thing to break the mold. I'm sure it gave you a lot of time to think about what you want in life. Sometimes it's good to be alone. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet he's a lot like you, and you probably feel really proud of him as well! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that you don't see him that often. I hope you have someone to take care of him when you see him. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. How old was she when she had the cancer? <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that. what did you miss the most from the movie? i hope it wasn't a super hero movie <|endoftext|>
I bet! I can't wait to graduate myself! What did you get your degree in? <|endoftext|>
It's crazy how fast time goes by. I wish we could go back to those days. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How much will it cost to get the car fixed? Hopefully it's not too bad. <|endoftext|>
What a horrible thing to do while driving. I agree, you should probably stop doing that. <|endoftext|>
Oh gosh, stay safe! Tornadoes are one of those weird things for me. They kind of scare me but before they happen and its raining yet still outside I love going out to see whats happening. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, no kidding.  It's been out for 5 minutes so far, and it feels like it's going to take forever to come back. <|endoftext|>
That was so nice of her! I'm glad you were able to get that done so quickly. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I need to start expecting people to do things like that for me. I have a hard time expecting things sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Dang! Good for him! That's an awesome thing to have in a relationship. <|endoftext|>
I hope you get to spend a lot of time with him, and I hope he knows how lucky he is to have you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did the mail man have a bad face or was he just trying to get your package? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I'm glad he didn't take anything important! Hopefully he left a note so you could at least get it back. <|endoftext|>
I am not a fan of snaked either. What I don't like is that they can kill me. <|endoftext|>
I would have done the same thing! I am terrified of snakes! Did your friends tease you? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. That must be tough. How long were you together? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope things start looking better for you. Can I ask what's going on? <|endoftext|>
That's understandable, how did you feel when you got to the theater by yourself? <|endoftext|>
I can understand that, going through something like that can shake you for the rest of your life. <|endoftext|>
Traveling is great and so is being married! It sounds like you guys have a great relationship. <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck. Trust is a key driver in any successful relationship. <|endoftext|>
Parties are so much fun. I am sure you will have a great time and make many new friends. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. My dog is my child, I don't know what I would do without him. <|endoftext|>
Exercise is great! What kind of exercises have you been doing? I do HIT training on my treadmill at the gym. <|endoftext|>
It's crazy how many people cheat nowadays. I don't understand cheating, but I've seen people do it and it doesn't end well. <|endoftext|>
I am so glad to hear that! I bet she is very happy to have you as her partner. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That is a long time. I wish the both of you well and excitement! <|endoftext|>
Wow! That is really good luck! I have never won on a ticket. You must have been so excited! <|endoftext|>
You will win someday. Just keep playing and don't let your expectations get you down. <|endoftext|>
Wow! $1000 is a lot. Did she give it to you because she feels bad? <|endoftext|>
i know how you feel, i used to be left out a lot as a kid too. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! Did you reschedule your vacation? I hope you got to go eventually. <|endoftext|>
Yes! I know exactly what you mean. I hope that the weather takes a better turn for you soon. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I bet you were very excited when you heard the good news. Congratulations! <|endoftext|>
I hope you enjoy your new position! I'm sure it'll be a great place to work. <|endoftext|>
Oh geez! I hope you didn't get hurt. Did your co-workers help you up? <|endoftext|>
What did you do to try to keep yourself energized? I'm thinking you might be me... <|endoftext|>
I used to have to work the night shift at the hospital. It was hard at first, but I got used to it after a while. <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling. It's even worse when you're with someone else. At least then you have to deal with their antics. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's exciting, but also makes me a little anxious. Is there anyone you can ask to help you out with? <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck! I hear it's very expensive to move there, so I hope you have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Oh I know! It's so rude. Have you ever noticed that happens a lot in movies? <|endoftext|>
I was so mad, I almost went to the police station just to tell them about it. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? Do you like the old movies or do you want to watch something new? <|endoftext|>
I usually do not like the ones that do not have a good story. I have been lucky and have not had that happen yet. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh!  I know exactly how you feel!  It's so gross! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope they aren't too expensive to replace. I know how upsetting that can be! <|endoftext|>
That is so awesome!  Congratulations!  You must be so happy.  Will you wear it? <|endoftext|>
Oh you do! You deserve it for sure. 22 years is a long time, I hope you have many more happy years together. <|endoftext|>
I know! It is so lazy. I wish there was a way we can make people care more about the environment. <|endoftext|>
I wish I could do that, but I have a hard time with my back and knees. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? Are you scared of heights?    On a scale, what is it about hikes that scare you? <|endoftext|>
Last year I went to Disneyland and I went on Space Mountain. I thought I was going to die! <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. You think they would be a little more considerate of the time you have spent preparing for it. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I'm so happy for you. I really hope this job goes really well for you for a long time. <|endoftext|>
Oh I love Disneyland! Did you go as a kid a lot as I'm sure you do by now? <|endoftext|>
Oh, how exciting. I hope you guys have a great time! I love going to the beach. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What kind of car is it and how much are you paying for it? <|endoftext|>
I love BMWs. I hope you get a great deal. Are you leased or purchased? <|endoftext|>
That is so nice of them!  You are lucky to have such generous people in your family! <|endoftext|>
If you find anything great, you can always donate it to a good charity. <|endoftext|>
They sound like great people. I wish I could be around more like that. Unfortunately I have to work all the time. <|endoftext|>
She sounds like an elderly woman. What did you do? Did you have to help her? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you were able to make the paper work, and I hope that you didn't get in trouble for it! <|endoftext|>
What is the reason that they do that?  Is it because you don't have time to do it for them, or do they just not like you? <|endoftext|>
Why does she make you anxious? Is it because you are in love, or does she not trust you? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you can visit him at least once before he moves! <|endoftext|>
I hope you get to talk to him soon. Maybe he will have some fun activities to do. <|endoftext|>
Wow that's amazing. I need to have a set of goals. I just don't know what yet. <|endoftext|>
That is a good way to look at it, to use others as a source of inspiration and a goal to strive for. <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way! Have you ever been to an animal shelter to help out? <|endoftext|>
It is very sad. I would like to donate some money to help them but unfortunately I don't have enough money. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations.  What did you graduate in?  Did you have a job lined up for after you graduated? <|endoftext|>
I am sure it did, but it will be so worth it! Time is the most important thing we have. <|endoftext|>
What is the tv for? Are you going to watch it on the weekend when it comes out? <|endoftext|>
I hope you are able to find one soon. I know how much you must be missing it. <|endoftext|>
That is so nice of you to be there for her.  It can be hard to be an only child with no siblings to lean on. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she feels better soon. I'm sure you're doing everything you can to be with her. <|endoftext|>
I agree, but it seems like it will take a lot of work and sacrifice. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a plan.  Let's get this done and get started.  What do you think we should do? <|endoftext|>
That must have been very lonely, working on your own computers must be very fulfilling. <|endoftext|>
I am sure your boss understands it was because you had to get some things done. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. What happened to Kat? Did she pass away of old age? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is never an easy thing. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's awesome! Congratulations to him! What's he doing well, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Well that's great. It's good to work hard for that recognition. But even if you don't get it, it's still nice to be commended for your efforts. <|endoftext|>
I agree, that is not right. I have a dog myself and I love him to death! <|endoftext|>
hit and run? thats the worst, i hate that feeling, as i used to live in miami, i know exactly what you mean <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great time but I'm sure it was scary at the same time. <|endoftext|>
Hey, if it was a good group of people then it was worth it. I'm glad you got out of that situation. <|endoftext|>
Aww, I'm sorry. I bet she had a great life, though. Dogs are amazing. <|endoftext|>
I bet it was! I'm so sorry you had to go through that. But she is in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I remember that stage with my kids, they were so miserable and would cry for everything! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that! I hope he gets better soon and lives a happy and fulfilled life. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just have to give it a shot, and I'm sure you'll be fine. <|endoftext|>
Well at least you are going to be able to rest now. I hope you get to feeling better soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh Italy is one of my favorite places to go! Where in Italy did you go? <|endoftext|>
That is a place I have always wanted to go. I hope you are able to make some new friends and explore more of it. <|endoftext|>
I want to go so bad. My friends are going to hate me if I don't go. <|endoftext|>
That was very nice of them. What kind of lunch was it? I hope it was something healthy! <|endoftext|>
I love fries, I could eat them all the time.  What kind of toppings did you get? <|endoftext|>
Yes that is annoying as hell! I wish people would just get out of the way of doing what they want to do. <|endoftext|>
How scary! I'm glad you're okay. People can be so reckless out there. <|endoftext|>
I think a lot of people have that fear. I am not sure if it is really a good thing or not. <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea. It's always good to be able to be safe while you're alone. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet of you to do! I love dogs, but I'm allergic to them so we can't have any. :( <|endoftext|>
Dogs are so much fun. I really like their playfulness and loyalty. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that must have been scary! I am glad you are okay though! It could have been a lot worse. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you were okay! I know how freaky it can be when you don't have any power. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How did that happen? I hope your moms insurance covers the car. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. It sounds like it's gotten a little easier to deal with. <|endoftext|>
Did you throw it out? I would have thrown it out right away! So gross! <|endoftext|>
I do hate that!  I used to eat so much when I was pregnant, but I had to stop. I don't want to gain any more weight, so I just stay away from it all. <|endoftext|>
I love listening to the sound of rain, I wish I could have listened to it too. <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds so relaxing! I'm glad you had a good experience. :) It's always good to cherish the little things in life. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Was anyone hurt in your car? <|endoftext|>
I know how that goes. Keep your head up and keep looking. You'll get there. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it was just the fact that I didn't win anything. But gambling is a very interesting phenomena. <|endoftext|>
Haha, that's awesome, man. $20 bucks is nothing to sneeze at. I mean, it's not like you went on a diet or something, right? Just kidding. <|endoftext|>
I've never been there, but I've always wanted to. I bet it's beautiful! <|endoftext|>
Omg that sounds like a crazy night. I love mardi gras but I would be so embarrassed if that happened to me. <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean. That is why I am looking for someone that will stay with me for the rest of my life. <|endoftext|>
That's not a very good story, but at least he was honest about the bike. <|endoftext|>
What does that mean exactly? A 1 in a million rhymes? I am intrigued. <|endoftext|>
It's okay! I'm still trying to get over it, but at least I have some pictures to hold on to. <|endoftext|>
I guess that says a lot about you, haha. I probably would have tried to find a new place to live after that. <|endoftext|>
Ewww, that's disgusting. I wouldn't have been able to eat there again. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hate presentations. What are you going to do? Are you nervous? <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing to do. Better to be organized and ready to crush. <|endoftext|>
No, I've never had that happen before. But now I kind of want to. I hope it won't be awkward. <|endoftext|>
Maybe she had a good reason. I wouldn't let it get to you too much. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's great! I'm happy for you! I've been working really hard to pay off my student loans. I hope I can pay mine off soon. <|endoftext|>
Bless your heart. You are lucky to have such a considerate and caring sister. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How did that happen? Was it a full blown break or did you have to get a cast? <|endoftext|>
That is super nice of him! I bet you were thankful he was able to do that. <|endoftext|>
That is a lot of work! But I am sure it will be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! Early starts are always a good thing. I aspire to have that some day. <|endoftext|>
That is never fun. I try to get most of what I need in bulk before the crowds get there. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope everything is okay. What could have gone wrong if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you drop it on something, or were you trying to eat it? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I love it when things go well and you don't have to stress about it. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that does sound crazy! I hope it wasn't too crowded for you. <|endoftext|>
I do not like going to check out in person. I like to buy things online as well. <|endoftext|>
I hate it when they do that. Makes me want to leave and never return there again. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I would have peed my pants! I hate spiders! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Were you able to get away from it without hitting anything with your face? That would be my worst nightmare! <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of that play. What was it about? Did you like it at least? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's a strange request. And they had no idea that it was you? Maybe they thought you stole it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I bet that's frustrating. Is there any way you can take it to him and see what happens? <|endoftext|>
Waiting always drives me nuts.  I never know what to do with my time so I just end up doing whatever it takes. <|endoftext|>
Do you still give him the money? $400 can be bought with a trust fund, I wish I had one of those! <|endoftext|>
What a steal!  I hope you got to spend it on something good for the weekend! <|endoftext|>
Oh, well I hope you've been able to move on from those fond memories at least. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that does sound embarrassing. I hope it didn't affect you too much. <|endoftext|>
I am withdraw from studying now. I think I am going to fail this test. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I hope you did well! Studying can be a real challenge some times. <|endoftext|>
Did she? Did you get a good night's sleep? I love cats but I'm allergic to them. <|endoftext|>
Well that was a nice thing for her to do. I'm sure you are a great dog owner. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Why did it take so long to get back into school? You must be so proud of yourself. <|endoftext|>
EElectrical Engineering is a great career. You will make great money. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. What would you have applied for? And why didn't you get accepted? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just have to accept and move on. I'm sure you will do great where ever you end up going. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That's a bummer.  Did he have a good reason to do so? <|endoftext|>
Competition can be good or bad. It can make things very stressful if it doesn't work out. <|endoftext|>
They are! It's very sad. I used to love playing Super Mario Brothers on the Nintendo Gamecube. <|endoftext|>
I know, it's crazy what you can do with a game now a days. I remember playing games on a Nintendo 64. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. The rollercoasters always seem to be at the right time. <|endoftext|>
Oh man I know how you feel. I have a big trip coming up and I'm dreading it. <|endoftext|>
It sounds like you are on the right path to success. I wish you all the best. <|endoftext|>
I'm a political science and social work major. I want to be a social worker. <|endoftext|>
That's good! It's always good to focus on the positives in life. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! It's nice that he was able to show you how to be a good kid. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Maybe he'll get good at it and you can teach him :) How old is he? <|endoftext|>
I do! I'm not the best, but it's a lot of fun. I was on a team for a little bit in high school, but that was a long time ago. <|endoftext|>
That's so scary! Have you tried to contact the police or local pharmacists? <|endoftext|>
That's so funny. Maybe you should get a bunny! They're good pets. <|endoftext|>
I used to be the same way, but then I started taking lessons from a professional. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm glad you weren't hurt, but it must have been so scary! <|endoftext|>
Why did you feel guilty about it?  Was it something you decided to keep a secret from your friend, or just for the sake of keeping it a secret? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you had to go through that, but it's for the best that you don't have to tell her now. <|endoftext|>
That happens sometimes, maybe you'll end up in a new part of town or something! <|endoftext|>
Drugs are bad, you should try to get away from them, I know it is hard. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll be fine! You'll be glad you did when it's all over. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's a lot of hours, hopefully you can squeeze it all in. <|endoftext|>
College is so much fun, you are going to have a great year!  What are you studying? <|endoftext|>
I can relate to that to some level, I used to have the same problem until I started taking classes closer to my degree. <|endoftext|>
That's good, do you think there's a renowned chef in your room? <|endoftext|>
Ally's pizza? I haven't heard of that place. Was it any good? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I remember when my son was doing that I felt so bad for him and wanted to do everything I could to keep him from it. <|endoftext|>
That is not good at all! Maybe you should find a new place to eat then. <|endoftext|>
What game are you playing? I love video games, but I've been so busy I haven't played in a while. <|endoftext|>
I've never been into those games. My husband played them though and I tried to get into it. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, maybe you can have a talk with them about it? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, they will grow up to have great characteristics, be sure to cherish them! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that is not fun! It has happened to me a few times, but thankfully it hasn't happened too often. <|endoftext|>
Extra loud huh? Did you ask him to turn it down? Maybe he was just having a bad day. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do great! What are you majoring in? (*Master's) <|endoftext|>
Well that's a good attitude to have about it. I'm sure you'll do great! <|endoftext|>
Who was it?  Was he as good as you remembered or was it just as good? <|endoftext|>
Carefree? I wish I could go back to those days. Being carefree was the best. <|endoftext|>
That is pretty cool!  I am a terrible bowler and have only been a few times!  Does he have a big family? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure if you just keep going he will get better. I know it does for me! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, why are you nervous? I hope it goes well. Are you nervous about being in a new environment? <|endoftext|>
Oh, in that case, I really hope you get the job! Despite your earlier apprehension, I'm sure you'll do great. <|endoftext|>
I am sure it happens all the time. Don't feel bad, they are probably used to it by now. <|endoftext|>
Exactly, you will find someone that completes you and makes you perfect. Don't lose hope! <|endoftext|>
I love road trips, that must have been really disappointing. What did you do instead? <|endoftext|>
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?  What do you do for a living? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What's the matter with him? Haha. What kind of car is it? <|endoftext|>
I understand. Maybe one day you will win the lottery and be able to buy another car. <|endoftext|>
What kind of vehicle do you want? I'm in the market for a new SUV. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling! I hate car problems! What do you think is wrong with your car? <|endoftext|>
People are just so lazy and don't care about other people's property anymore. It's sad. <|endoftext|>
I would be mad too. That is a lot of money to lose. Did you lose everything? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is horrible! What did you do? Did you have to take it in? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a new car that will give you the same joy that you deserve! <|endoftext|>
I do too, I always feel like I'm about to choke and start sweating. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you need to go see a doctor about that. You should be more concerned about your health and well being! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, but I'm having a hard time believing that's what you told me. <|endoftext|>
I agree, I wouldn't be able to move for the next day! I hope your day went well and that nothing like that ever happens again! <|endoftext|>
They were probably thinking the same thing as you, if they were looking at you weirdly. <|endoftext|>
Man, I would have been so embarrassed. At least they didn't get mad at you. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I know how that goes.  I'm still paying on mine from last year. <|endoftext|>
That is great that you have such a great partner. They are always there for you no matter what. <|endoftext|>
Thank you for your service! I'm sure that was a tough and thankful experience. <|endoftext|>
What country do you live in? It's great to be supportive of our country no matter what. <|endoftext|>
What did you get for it? I hope it lasts a long time for you. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! Sometimes used cars can be the best, if the person really knows what they're doing. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I know how you feel, I wish I could stop. <|endoftext|>
Normal is good! As long as you are happy and healthy. That is all that matters. <|endoftext|>
Oh man!  That has happened to me before.  Did you manage to get it out? <|endoftext|>
That's not too bad. You'll be able to laugh about it when you get home. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. How did that happen? Was it the hurricane? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm glad you guys are okay! That must have been the scariest thing! <|endoftext|>
Me either. That's like the worst habit. I always flush my toilet at least once. <|endoftext|>
I like to go to this coffee shop called Starbucks. It's local and really good. <|endoftext|>
Who are you leading?  The people you work with?  If you're good at it, I'm sure you'll do great! <|endoftext|>
Dang, they didn't even bother to leave you a thank you or anything? The least they could do is give you a free drink. <|endoftext|>
I can understand the feeling. I hate rollercoasters too. Too scary for me. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun. I'm glad you had a good time. I've been thinking about getting one. <|endoftext|>
Oh they knew about you? That was nice of them. How old are you now? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should have a talk with your boss. I'm sure he'll work with you. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! That is so scary! Were you able to get her out? What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine. It must have been very frightening for her. I'm glad that she was okay. <|endoftext|>
That's not good. Can they take money from you? Have you tried calling them to see what's going on? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I've had that happen to me before too. It's a pain in the keester. <|endoftext|>
What time is it there? It's 41 over here and I'm about to go to bed. <|endoftext|>
I hear you!  I can't even get out of bed most of the time now.  I hope things get better for you! <|endoftext|>
Oh, did you ask him what it was? I'm always curious about these kinds of things. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope you don't get any more weird things in your house. Maybe you should invest in a dog garden. <|endoftext|>
You must have been really nervous. It happens to the best of us. How did it turn out? <|endoftext|>
I would have felt the same, but I am sure you did great.  It sounds like it was for a good cause. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. She must have been sick for a long time. How did she live? <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel, my dog was like a child to me too. They say time heals all wounds, I hope it does for you as well. <|endoftext|>
She must be a keeper. How did you do it? Rescue her from the ground? <|endoftext|>
I hope so that would be terrible if you didn't get what you were looking for. <|endoftext|>
It's good to be confident. I'm sure you can do anything you put your mind to! <|endoftext|>
Nothing better than being prepared! It's a good feeling to be prepared for whatever comes your way. <|endoftext|>
What kind of position is it? I hope you'll be happy and making a lot of money. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure you'll do great. Have you done something like it before or is this your first time? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened to your old one? Do you have a new one lined up? <|endoftext|>
x-tereras are nice, but i would go with a dodge challenger! <|endoftext|>
Good for you! I wish i could go back to college but i have a family now. <|endoftext|>
All you need is a hope and a good attitude! You've got this. What's the class? <|endoftext|>
Ahh, you're so lucky. I wish I could be relaxing right now. What did you have? <|endoftext|>
That sounds delicious. I'm a vegetarian, so I miss out on a lot of that stuff. <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful. Good for you being responsible and saving money. It is one of the most important things to do. <|endoftext|>
safety is the first priority of every one, and it's imitative that you want to make sure that you are in control of everything <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. How did it make you feel to have a new baby and see it for the first time? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! It can be so devastating to turn your life around like that. I'm glad you're reaching for your goals now. <|endoftext|>
That should be fun. Take lots of pictures, you will want to remember all of those memories you are going to make. <|endoftext|>
That's still a great idea, I'm glad you all were able to come up with something to do together. <|endoftext|>
What did she do to inspire such pride in her sister?   (And you ;-) <|endoftext|>
What a lovely wife you have. She must really love you a lot to do that. <|endoftext|>
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  Did you get her anything nice?  Did she get you anything cool? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, it's nice to have someone who cares about you though. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well good luck with that, sounds like it would be a pain to deal with <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a nice way to end the day. What did you watch on the TV? <|endoftext|>
That's good. It's always nice to catch up with old friends.  I hope you have more nights like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That must have been so frustrating.  How did you get dogs back? <|endoftext|>
That's great you had a friend available to help you out in that situation.  I'm glad you're ok. <|endoftext|>
I've done that before! It's hard to get back to sleep once they wake up. <|endoftext|>
Ahh, well it sounds like you have quite the household. I bet it was a lot of work. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, how boring! At least she's coming back soon. Do you have fun activities to do together while she's gone? <|endoftext|>
I understand that completely, but you will find someone new and they will be waiting for the right person. <|endoftext|>
That must have been fun to see all that stuff again and remember the good old days. <|endoftext|>
I love it when that happens! I do it all the time with my old baby pictures. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's kind of you to be there for her! Is she coming back soon? <|endoftext|>
Awww, I bet it is! But I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. Just take your time :) <|endoftext|>
Uh oh. What happened in the store? Hopefully nothing too bad happened. Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
What did he say in response to you?  Did he actually do it, or was he just drunk and inconsiderate? <|endoftext|>
Oh geez! I hope he is better now. That is a tough thing to endure. <|endoftext|>
Love is a crazy thing, and hard to explain. I hope you're right and that he learns to love you in the future. <|endoftext|>
I do too. I don't think I've ever been in a situation like that, though. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. You just have to try to get it done quickly and not worry about it. <|endoftext|>
I love them too, they really are a man or womans best friend. I hope he is in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
Aww, I love puppies! What kind of puppy is he or she? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she recovers well. I love cats but I know they can be difficult to take care of. <|endoftext|>
That is a scary situation, I'm glad your dog is okay! I know how animals are the same as family members. <|endoftext|>
shootings always seem to happen in the middle of the night, i would be scared too. <|endoftext|>
That sucks. Hopefully you can find the video and show the footage of the crime so that you can at least share the story with your friends and family. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! How long did you have your dog for? <|endoftext|>
I can only imagine.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.  Keep your head up. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel.  I have days like that where I don't feel like talking to people. <|endoftext|>
No way! That's awesome! Did you steal it to see if you could take it back for a test drive? <|endoftext|>
You and me both. One day we will both get rich and get nice cars! <|endoftext|>
Tell me about it. How long has it been since you last spoke with them? <|endoftext|>
Do you have a bus or a friend that can help you out?  I hope you are able to get to them soon so you can see them again. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?  Did you get in trouble with the restaurant? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I would have sent it back too, they should at least give you a discount! <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did you get in trouble with anyone?  I hope you didn't have to pay anything for it. <|endoftext|>
Well, I hope you can get it fixed, I know it sucks driving around with a scratch on your bumper. <|endoftext|>
That's nice of her! I hope you're feeling better. What kind of care did she give you? <|endoftext|>
I know someone else that was in a similar situation, and I do not wish that on my worst enemy. <|endoftext|>
God isn't something to mess with.  I hope everything is alright and nothing really bad happened. <|endoftext|>
Dogs are the best. They are so loving and devoted. I am glad you were able to get away safely. <|endoftext|>
That is a very nice surprise. You must have done very ywell to get a car. <|endoftext|>
Oh sweet.  Is it your first?  I've always wanted a new car myself. <|endoftext|>
oh why is that? did something happen to make you feel that way? family is always there for you no matter what <|endoftext|>
Dang, that stinks. Do you ever ask them why they don't invite you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's not funny! What kind of pranks did they pull on you? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should confront them about it. If they are truly your friends, they will find a way to not make you mad. <|endoftext|>
Movie theater is such a fun place to go! Did you see any good movies? <|endoftext|>
Horror movies give me such a bad feeling. I can't watch them late at night. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! Where are you going to go with your family? I hope you have a safe trip. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is a long trip.  I hope you guys have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Why do you think she will leave you? Is everything okay? <|endoftext|>
Ouch, that would make me feel insecure too. Have you talked to her about how you feel? <|endoftext|>
Awh, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can watch it on DVD? <|endoftext|>
i haven't seen that yet, but i hear it's good! i hope you get to see it <|endoftext|>
I love vacations like that! I'm glad you had a good time. Did you stay at a beach resort? <|endoftext|>
Phew!  I'm glad you had a good time, even if it was a little rainy. <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! Where are you going to go cruising? Have you been before? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun. I've never been on a cruise. How long are you guys going for? <|endoftext|>
What a glutton! I've done that before, too. No shame in that. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're able to look at it that way and not take it for granted! <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a huge relief for you. How long had you two been together? <|endoftext|>
I know I can't wait!  I feel like it's been forever since I got one. <|endoftext|>
I would be frustrated too. You should have a talk with him and let him know you need to finish up on time. <|endoftext|>
He may just be busy right now but you should give him a big hug and make it up to him! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do great! Just relax and think of all the good times you'll have with your new hire! <|endoftext|>
It's always best to be prepared! Good luck, I'm sure you'll get the job. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, it can be tough to deal with people who argue in front of others. <|endoftext|>
That is frustrating.  Maybe you could try distancing yourself from them.  You have to do what is best for you and your family. <|endoftext|>
I understand that feeling. I used to work at a car dealership. The same thing happened to me. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that really sucks. Did you end up getting a promotion or getting a different job? <|endoftext|>
I do have children, ages 2 and 4. They were not as happy as I was about losing my job. <|endoftext|>
I do attend school. I am one of those crazy people who has to wake up every day and go to school every day. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. I lost my dad a few years ago to cancer. It is a horrible thing to go through. <|endoftext|>
I am glad you got to spend more time with him. I hope he is in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
What happened? I wish I could have been there to see it! Hopefully it was a good experience for you. <|endoftext|>
LOL. Clean door? Well, I'm not sure what that means but good for you! I never win anything. <|endoftext|>
Well it happens and you should feel bad but kids will be kids. I am sure you will make it up to her. <|endoftext|>
I hope she was able to move on from it. If not, you can always apologize to her and ask for her forgiveness. <|endoftext|>
That is true, it is sad when someone you know is in a bad situation, but it can also be good to be there for them when they need it. <|endoftext|>
That was very nice of you. I am sure that driver was very appreciative of your help. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm so happy for you. Was it your first time away from home in a while? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm so happy that you got to go and have a good time. <|endoftext|>
Ouch! I hope you weren't hurt! I love fairs but I've always been too scared to try and ride some rides. <|endoftext|>
I know, I was horrified but I tried to play it off as best as I could. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear about that. It must be so hard to lose a beloved pet. <|endoftext|>
That's a good attitude to have about it. I wish you healing and comfort through this very difficult time. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, tell me about it. My daughter is the same way. What did your son do? <|endoftext|>
What a good little pup! Did you teach him any tricks for taking it back? <|endoftext|>
That's not something I would ever be able to do. You are braver than I am! <|endoftext|>
Why do you feel bad? Did you eat it all or were you able to save some? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Maybe you should lay down the law and make him clean up the house. <|endoftext|>
Well I hope he is able to make some time soon to spend with you and your friends. <|endoftext|>
That is a great accomplishment!  You must be so proud of her!  What does she want to do after she graduates? <|endoftext|>
Will you still be able to see her? I hope you can make it up to her somehow. <|endoftext|>
Hey, that's pretty awesome. You're very lucky to have such thoughtful people in your life. Did you enjoy the cake? <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's awesome though, I'm happy for you guys. Celebrate with what? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I would be so excited to see all of my old pictures. I hope they were all good memories. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful!  It's always nice to look back on old memories.  Do you have a favorite memory that you want to share with us? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you can get it fixed before it gets too hot or it gets cold. <|endoftext|>
That's awful. I hope you didn't have to get rid of the cake. Did you have to throw it away? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is exciting!  A whole new part of the world, right?  What state, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
I can now pay my bills and buy food. I feel like I can breath a little bit with out them. <|endoftext|>
Oh, how wonderful that is! Great stress relief indeed! Well, I'm off to bed soon, so I hope you have a great rest of your day! <|endoftext|>
I'm a fitness enthusiast. I run, bike, swim, and lift weights. <|endoftext|>
Oh, well I hope you get a good rest of your night! I know you worked hard for it. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have someone to help you out! It's the little things like that that make the world go round. <|endoftext|>
I am so happy to hear that! I hope everything continues to go well for you and your family! <|endoftext|>
That's fantastic! I bet you're super happy for him and can't wait to go visit! <|endoftext|>
I know, it seems like she was just a month ago that she was born. It goes by so fast. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she'll do great! Is she going to be a beauty queen? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's terrible! I'm so sorry to hear that. Is everyone in the area affected? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. Hopefully that's the only thing that will keep them from worrying. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so relaxing!  I wish I had the baby sleep!  How many kids do you have? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I remember those mornings with my kids. They were up so late playing video games or something. <|endoftext|>
You can always make it up tomorrow! Don't let it get to you too much. Just start again tomorrow. <|endoftext|>
It is hard, but it will get better.  Do you have any hobbies that could take your mind off of it? <|endoftext|>
I think that would be a very good idea! Why are you thinking about doing it? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. You should quit if you are not happy with the way he is treating you <|endoftext|>
How exciting! I hope they have a good time and they don't forget to wear sunscreen. <|endoftext|>
I am glad you had a good time. I hope you got the chance to go back. <|endoftext|>
How long did it take her to potty train? That is great news and must be such a relief. <|endoftext|>
Aww!  I have a little Yorkie myself.  She loves cuddling too! <|endoftext|>
That sucks.  How far did you have to move?  Are you going to get another one? <|endoftext|>
It is nice to have memories like that to cherish. I hope to have a house like that one day. <|endoftext|>
You must be feeling pretty good about that.  What makes you feel that way, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
That's no good, sorry to hear that, man. Maybe you'll get better at it with time. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're getting the help you need. Anxiety is the worst to have. <|endoftext|>
I hope the doctor can help you figure it out! I know how frustrating chronic pain can be. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear about your father. I hope you had a good time. Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
That is great that you have those good memories. I am sure he is in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
It's frustrating to try and help someone who doesn't want to do what you tell them! <|endoftext|>
Just focus on what you can do and don't worry about what other people think! You'll be able to do it if you want to! <|endoftext|>
Wow that's horrible. I hope they catch the person and you get your card back. <|endoftext|>
Dang! Well, I hope it doesn't happen again. I would be so upset if it happened to me. <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet.  Cats are so fun.  What is your cats name? <|endoftext|>
Dang. Well at least he didn't hurt it. Some people would be pretty upset. <|endoftext|>
That is great! Now he is just getting to the fun part of life. Before you know it he will be saying his first full sentimental sentence! <|endoftext|>
hahaha, he must be so cute! I hope he is a boy and not a girl! <|endoftext|>
It was really only a matter of timing. I was going to be able to get out of work on time. <|endoftext|>
refunds are always nice, but i would be so mad at the person that did that. im sorry. <|endoftext|>
That sounds awful! What did you guys do? Did you have to use the bathroom on the road? <|endoftext|>
Oh yuck! I would have a hard time finishing that trip. Did you have to go home? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're okay! Yeah, bikes can be very dangerous when it comes to traffic. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear! I hope your knee feels better as well as your knee. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That is a lot of courses to take. I am sure you will make it up next semester! <|endoftext|>
That's not too bad, but I would have been so embarrassed if I was in your position. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's never fun. Hopefully you don't have to replace too many parts in the future. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that you got it done! I'm glad it ended up not being too bad a problem. <|endoftext|>
Yes, many times! It's one of the worst things that can happen to a human being. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that is hilarious and terrible at the same time. I would have been so embarrassed. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I love heavy metal!  I'm sorry it upset you so much.  What was your favorite part? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Yeah, I think live music is an amazing way to experience it. <|endoftext|>
I sure do. That is a great way to look at things though. I guess everything has its ups and downs. <|endoftext|>
That's a bummer, but I'm glad you guys atleast had something to do. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Is he doing better now, or is he still in the hospital? <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I hope you're hanging in there. <|endoftext|>
Dang! I've wanted to go to a theater to see those movies before. Glad you get to go a lot! <|endoftext|>
That is so fun, I wish I could go back to these days and do some things again as well. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That sounds like a really risky move on your part. How did it turn out? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I could see my dog do that! She's too stubborn. <|endoftext|>
Mine, too! That's why I moved to Alaska to escape the cold, haha. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear about your father. But, I'm glad that you have something of hiss to remember him by. <|endoftext|>
It's always nice to look back on happy memories. I hope you have a great time at the reunion! <|endoftext|>
Oh, I know.  I've been there.  But, sometimes you just have to move on. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, did she get mad at you? Hopefully you can trust her again one day. <|endoftext|>
How come? Are you scared of heights or going up in high places? (I'm neither, but I don't care for them either.) <|endoftext|>
That's too bad, but I'm glad you were able to overcome your fear! Heights are actually one of the most viewed things in the world! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sounds like a fun time. Do you go to the rave often? <|endoftext|>
I would have been nervous too! What did you do? Did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Why did she break up with you if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I hope you two can make it up to each other somehow. <|endoftext|>
Did you go to one of those where the ghosts are chased by the actors? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I usually go by myself, but I think it would be fun to go with a group of people. <|endoftext|>
I think you should talk to her about it instead of letting her know it bothers you. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I would be pretty upset too. I hope you can work it out without too much drama. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! Did you guys get to talk to each other or did you have to keep it to yourself? <|endoftext|>
Sweet!  I love it when they do that!  How long have you been playing? <|endoftext|>
Hey that's great!  How far along are you?  I'm sure you will be great parents! <|endoftext|>
That is so exciting! Boys are so much fun. Do you have any good ideas what to name him? <|endoftext|>
Where are you headed to? I hope it's somewhere you're really looking forward to! <|endoftext|>
Oh, I hope you do too! California is a great place to go, I have many good friends that have moved there. <|endoftext|>
Did you enjoy that time though? You must have felt a lot of peace and relaxation. <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I hope you're doing better now! Losing your wallet is one of the worst things that can happen to a person. <|endoftext|>
Calc 1? I always had a hard time with that.  I'm glad it's over and you should be feeling good about it now. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's awesome. I might have to take some classes so I can pay this off. <|endoftext|>
Why did she leave for so long?  Was she going to visit her family?  I hope she had a safe trip and that you guys were able to spend a lot of time together when she returned. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you were able to get it fixed! That is a huge bummer. <|endoftext|>
I am so glad to hear that! I hope I'm as happy when I move soon. <|endoftext|>
That sounds really nice! I really want to get a pool in my backyard. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you get the job - assuming it's one you really want. <|endoftext|>
That's great, I hope you get the job! It sounds like you really want it. <|endoftext|>
hahaha naturals are usually the best type of people to play against. naturals is the way to go <|endoftext|>
Dang, well at least you got to be there with your friend. That's a good story for when you are together again. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. What are you planning to do now? Are you applying again? <|endoftext|>
At least you have something to look forward to now. A new year is a new start. <|endoftext|>
That's really good to hear! Have you had good luck with that lately? :) Anything in particular that you're looking forward to? <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet.  I hope you got everything you wanted and didn't get too stressed out. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is a great achievement! I am sure you are very proud of her. <|endoftext|>
That is a great thing to be proud of. You should take her out to dinner to celebrate. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. What do you like to do when you are alone. I usually watch movies. <|endoftext|>
I understand that completely, I need a break every now and then too though, I work too much. <|endoftext|>
ewwwww. I hope it wasn't something gross. My dog has done that before so I know your pain. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes when we are in a rush, we don't pay attention to what other people think. <|endoftext|>
Having a baby is something I want to do one day as well. I'm so happy that you get to experience it for the first time! <|endoftext|>
That sounds so relaxing! You must be feeling pretty good today. :D Have a great rest of your day! <|endoftext|>
That is very nice of them.  It is good to have generous people in your life. <|endoftext|>
I hope it goes well for you. You are more brave than I am for sure! <|endoftext|>
Where did you go?  Did you have a good time?  Sometimes it's good to travel on your own if you're adventurous. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was hard. Do you have a lot of catching up you can do? <|endoftext|>
What does she do for a living? I could get you a job if you needed one. <|endoftext|>
Where are you going on your trip? I haven't been on a plane since I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? Are you scared of them or just not able to trust people? I'm a people person, but I can see how that might be a problem for you. <|endoftext|>
Ah, I see. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to trust him again soon. <|endoftext|>
Yikes!  That is expensive!  I would have told him to give you a loan! <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's too bad. I wonder if he had it in for a good reason. <|endoftext|>
Oh congratulations!  Boys are so much fun.  What are you having? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! Enjoy the weekend and keep your eyes open for more opportunities. <|endoftext|>
Good for you! How long is your flight? Are you going for work or pleasure? <|endoftext|>
That's great. I organize flights too. I love checking out new places. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That's awful. Will you be going to her to say goodbye? <|endoftext|>
Ouch, that's not a good thing to do. I don't know why people do things like that. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so exciting! I'm happy for you. Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
That's not too far away.  I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! How long have you been together in college? Did you guys have a good time? <|endoftext|>
Eight hours is a long time to be sitting in trash water! I'm glad you had a good time though. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is a long time ago.  Did she have it as a puppy or as an adult? <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you're hanging in there. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's rough. What did you do to make her realize she was still in love with you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope she didn't think badly or embarrassed about it!  It's hard to feel embarrassed. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I would have freaked out. What did you do? Did you have to move? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is horrible.  Did you confront him about it, or just ignore him? <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting! I'm sure you'll be a great parent, I have a couple of nieces and nephews that have turned out to be great parents! <|endoftext|>
Will you be able to go out and celebrate now that it's your birthday? I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
That's really sad. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing okay. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I bet they were happy to see you come back to life. I would be the same way in your shoes. <|endoftext|>
That's interesting. Physics is pretty tough. Did you end up going to the concert? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I'd love to hear some of her music. I bet she puts on a great show. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, I hate elevators, they are so scary.  I always feel like I'm going to throw up. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is so scary! I would have been screaming, too! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I thank god every day as well. I just bought a house on the beach this past week! <|endoftext|>
5 months is a long time to be having fun. I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's pretty awesome that you have that kind of work. You must work very hard! <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That sounds horrifying!  I'm so sorry you had to experience that! <|endoftext|>
Oh, how exciting! That must have been a very special moment for you. Did you feel proud? <|endoftext|>
I bet he felt very precious about it! I am happy you have such a good friend. <|endoftext|>
Ugh, I hate that too! Especially when I'm trying to talk to someone on the phone and it's taking forever. <|endoftext|>
I think you should have a talk with her. Organize your thoughts so you don't stress out anymore. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great day! I love pizza, what is your favorite kind?  Mine is pepperoni. <|endoftext|>
I hope so! I am a bit nervous about it, but I will do my best. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! You must be very proud of yourself and feel like you have accomplished something great! <|endoftext|>
Where did you go and what did you see?  I hope it was all worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Did they give you a reason? Maybe they just don't like you. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's rough. Maybe you'll get offered the next promotion that is available! <|endoftext|>
What did you do? Did everything turn out okay?.  I hope everything was ok. <|endoftext|>
Why do you like those places so much? Just the noises and the mess they make? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did she ask for you to help her out or did you have to make her own? <|endoftext|>
That is terrible!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Maybe she will come around? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Sometimes it's hard to find the right place, so it's great when you find one that is perfect for you and allows you to be comfortable. <|endoftext|>
Well I hope you find what you want and don't settle for something you aren't happy with! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. Good for you for being prepared for an emergency. Hopefully, your family was able to cover the cost. <|endoftext|>
Payday is my favorite day of the week!  I love being able to spend it on things I don't need or need. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That sounds awful.  Are you feeling okay?  I hope you didn't have to go to the hospital! <|endoftext|>
I know, it's a good thing I had my phone with me the whole time so I could call my husband to tell him I was crying. <|endoftext|>
I bet you were. That is a big accomplishment! I am an only child, so I do not know what that is like. <|endoftext|>
I understand, I feel that way every time my kids go off to college. It goes by so fast. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hate that too! Did you take it up with your supervisor? <|endoftext|>
I would have just as mad as you, but I'm glad you didn't get fired! <|endoftext|>
Oh I know that feeling, people are so inconsiderate of others sometimes.  Did you do anything to make them notice? <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear, it is always nice to have someone that is there for you no matter what. <|endoftext|>
Really? Why is that? Because you don't have to think about all the people around you? <|endoftext|>
That is true for me too. I love swimming in pools. It's so relaxing. <|endoftext|>
That was nice of you. I hope she feels better soon. You sound like a good husband. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear she is doing better. I hope she continues to get better. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear, it's always nice to have family to turn to in times of need. <|endoftext|>
Dang, sounds like you got some good people around you. It's always nice to have people you can count on. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  Did you have a good time?  And what was the occasion? <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude to have! Positivity is always a great quality to have. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope it didn't cause a lot of damage. <|endoftext|>
That is horrible! I am glad you are okay. I would be so scared, too. <|endoftext|>
That is so cool! What kind of dog is she? And how long did it take her to win? <|endoftext|>
That's the way to be! I'm sure she appreciates all the hard work you're doing! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, how long were they together?.  I hope it wasn't for any good reason. <|endoftext|>
It's nice to have someone to lean on when things get tough. I'm sure she loves having you there. <|endoftext|>
That's a bummer. Does he at least appreciate what he's doing for the job? <|endoftext|>
Well, you know what they say, "The grass is always greener on the other side." Maybe you'll have better luck next time. <|endoftext|>
Oh gross! I have to say I have seen worse in food before. I hope you got a refund! <|endoftext|>
Forgetting a card is pretty bad, but at least you have a credit.  At least you got your money back. <|endoftext|>
Oh really? Why were you anxious? Did you do anything fun while you were there? <|endoftext|>
Haven't been on one in ten years. I bet that will be exciting for you, even though you don't like rollercoasters. <|endoftext|>
That's not a friend at all. I hope you told them how unappreciated they were. <|endoftext|>
Hopefully he learned his lesson. I wouldn't let it bother you too much. People make mistakes. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will try to make friends at school? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, but I'm sure you'll do fine if you just go for it. <|endoftext|>
Did she tell you that it made you feel that way? I know how hard it can be when you think your partner is talking to others. <|endoftext|>
Well maybe you should think about opening up a trust so you don't have to worry so much. <|endoftext|>
What movie was it? I've never seen a horror movie. I'm too scared to watch them. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well good job man! I'm proud of you! Hopefully you get another shot at it. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. How long ago was that?    "What's the craziest thing that happened to you?" <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. That is a long time ago. I am sure you will find someone great. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together?.  Was it a big decision?. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that is a tough one to have to deal with. I hope things get better for you. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I could do that. Did you stay in a condo or something? <|endoftext|>
That's good, at least it wasn't a big one that would have been dangerous. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I don't know why people have to talk down. It's not like we have anything to talk about. <|endoftext|>
I get that, I used to be the same way, but the more you do it the easier it gets! <|endoftext|>
That sounds great!  Do you make a lot of meals or is it pretty unexpected? <|endoftext|>
I bet it is! I am so happy for you. I am sure you deserve it. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was awesome! I hope you had a great time! I love big parties. Did you get a lot of gifts? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you had a good time. Maybe you should go again sometime. :) <|endoftext|>
I know right? I don't get it why people can't just be nice to each other. <|endoftext|>
To the end of the day, all we can do is try to do our best and hope for the best. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. Have you ever talked to them about this issue? Maybe they just don't realize they are doing it. <|endoftext|>
I understand. You just have to take the time to do so and you will do fine. <|endoftext|>
Did he do it on purpose to annoy you or was he just trying to impress you? <|endoftext|>
That is not good at all! I hope you get it soon so you can spend your money. <|endoftext|>
Ugh! That is so annoying! Have you spoken to her about it yet? Maybe there is a reason she is so noisy at night. <|endoftext|>
Man, that's so aggravating! I'm sorry you have to deal with that! <|endoftext|>
Why does it get you in trouble? Does it seem like you get into lots of trouble? <|endoftext|>
That is so true. I don't understand why people do that. I am so sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you have to go through that, but I'm glad you have a support system to help you through it. <|endoftext|>
What career are you going to be starting? That sounds exciting!.  I hope it's a career that you love and you can make a lot of money doing it. <|endoftext|>
Going isn't fun, but unfortunately it's necessary some times. I hope you feel better soon! <|endoftext|>
Evil is a hard word to define, I agree. What's done is done. What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
That's great! Everyone deserves to be commended for what they do. It's a very noble thing to do. <|endoftext|>
I'm going to give it a go! Thanks for the encouragement! :) I wish you the best of luck too! <|endoftext|>
I could never! She seems to have it so much easier than I do. I wish I could be like her. <|endoftext|>
Haha, that's awesome.  I don't really follow sports much.  Are you from the US? <|endoftext|>
I love it when something like that happens! Especially when the crowd is having a good time! <|endoftext|>
Oooh, what kind of car is it? I'm sorry you're going to have to replace it, though. <|endoftext|>
Those are good choices! I'm partial to Toyotas myself, and they last a long time. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I would have been so scared. Was it already in your house? <|endoftext|>
Haha! I would have done the exact same thing! I am terrified of rats! <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's pretty awesome. I haven't had good luck with AA meetings before. <|endoftext|>
I love a good creamy cheese like that, sounds heavenly! My go to is blueberry cheesecake. <|endoftext|>
She's Italian.  I'm not sure where the word cabot is from. <|endoftext|>
There must be, I have a couple of them by my house, they are always waving at me. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It's never easy losing a loved one, I know from personal experience. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you get to talk to him more often now. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! It's been raining a lot here, too! I'm sorry you didn't get to go. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible, I hope you can get it fixed or have someone come out and fix it. <|endoftext|>
That is sad, did you tell them you were sad about it? I'm sure they will be happy to see you soon. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have such friendly coworkers.  It makes work a lot less stressful. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a wonderful time. I hope I can do something similar one of these weekends! <|endoftext|>
I would complain!  That is not cool!  I hope you got a refund. <|endoftext|>
It really is divided, and it's sad to see it like that. Hopefully things get better for all of us soon. <|endoftext|>
I think that we will. There are too many people in the world who are too stressed to do anything about it. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing family is so hard. Do you have close friends and family that you can talk to about this? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. I lost my father last year to cancer, I know how hard that can be. <|endoftext|>
Why do you feel so bad about it?  Maybe you can talk to them and make it up to them. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, I hope you get to see them soon. Why didn't you go with them? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What kind of music is the concert for? Are you going with anyone? <|endoftext|>
I'm not familiar with them, but I hope you have a good time at the concert! <|endoftext|>
That's so frustrating! Maybe you could try to get in touch with your landlord on social media? <|endoftext|>
How long have you had the lease for? I hope it's a good move for you. <|endoftext|>
Are they ready for school to start back up? It can be tough getting them ready for a new environment. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure they'll be back before you know it and you'll be looking back fondly. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is always so disappointing. Are you going to do anything to make it up to her? <|endoftext|>
I love the beach! Did you stay at home or go to a resort? <|endoftext|>
Wow, they are really missing out! The beach is a great place to relax and have fun! <|endoftext|>
Wow! That would be a dream come true! What will you do with all that money? <|endoftext|>
What a fun thing to do! I bet you were having a blast while you were trying to figure out what to do with the winnings! <|endoftext|>
That's great. How big was it if you don't mind me asking? And what was it for? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. It's always nice to get unexpected good surprises. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that must have been a huge event for you. How old is your son? <|endoftext|>
Dang, he must have saved up a lot for it. Was it his first car? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, that sounds frustrating. Do you know what place you want to go to? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, my friends always want to do something different and I just end up eating the same thing over and over. It gets old after a while, I think. <|endoftext|>
I hope they get it figured out for you. That really stinks that they won't be able to enjoy it for the sake of everyone. <|endoftext|>
I know right! It's been ages since I've had Friday off. It's almost as good as the weekend. <|endoftext|>
I had the day off too! I went to the beach and had a relaxing day. <|endoftext|>
Why would your friend want to fight with you? That doesn't seem very friend like. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that then. I love my pets as much as I love them too. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I have heard good things about the ketogenic diet, might be worth a try? <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck!  Dieting is hard, but it's worth it in the end if you stick to it. <|endoftext|>
Tornadoes are terrifing. I live in the midwest and we have them all the time. I am terrified of them. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're not one of those people who can handle that! I had a roommate who would do that to me all the time. I moved out so I could get away. <|endoftext|>
What kind of music do you play? That's so nice of him, how long have you been married? <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's pretty awesome. Mine has never done that for me. I'm glad he did that for you! <|endoftext|>
Oh yes. I love decorating. It's so therapeutic in my opinion. Do you have a favorite holiday? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, did she pass away recently? I hope you have some good memories of her to remember. <|endoftext|>
That's really nice of her. It's nice to have someone you can count on. <|endoftext|>
That is very nice of her. She sounds like a very good and caring person. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate, but I'm glad you got to go at least! I live near a beach, so I'm very familiar with the pain of being rained out. Sand gets everywhere! <|endoftext|>
That's a long drive.  I hope you guys at least got to talk about it! <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Is there any other possibilities for promotion in the future? <|endoftext|>
That is a good thing to be proud of. Hopefully it carries on when it gets harder. <|endoftext|>
That's good, the kid must have a lot of patience for such a big responsibility. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad but I'm glad you're able to see it that way now. Outdoor pets can be great companions. <|endoftext|>
What was the secret?  I hope it was something she didn't mean to tell you? <|endoftext|>
What did you guys do the last time you trusted her with those other things? <|endoftext|>
Oh my god. I would have been terrified. What did you do? Did you find out what it was? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is so scary. I am so glad it was nothing serious. I would have been so scared. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lovely time! What movie did you end up watching? <|endoftext|>
Drama free is always a good thing. Maybe you should go watch it sometime again just to take the mind off of it. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad, I am sorry for your loss. He will be in doggy heaven now. <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear that. But I still think it is terrible that you had to experience that. <|endoftext|>
Did you ever tell her? I bet she would have been pretty upset. I am sure you regret it now. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like she's in a much better place now. <|endoftext|>
How is that working out for you? I've never heard of that before. (Then again I'm not a doctor) <|endoftext|>
I feel for you. I hope that you can find a medication that can help you feel more at ease. <|endoftext|>
I have a similar situation at work. I have to follow the instructions but a lot of work is being done behind my back. It is frustrating! <|endoftext|>
I would try angies list or homeadvisor. I bet if you explain in a nice way she will listen. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. Was the cat old or sick? <|endoftext|>
It's hard to lose a pet. I hope she restocks her faith in the afterlife. <|endoftext|>
I would be so excited. Congratulations. How much did you win? And what will you do with the money? <|endoftext|>
Will you be going on a cruise with her?  That might be a fun time. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's a good amount to just be able to get by. Helps with the bills for sure. <|endoftext|>
What happened? I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully, it wasn't something you need again in the future. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did you catch them?  Did they have a good reason?  I backpacked last year and the same thing happened to me! <|endoftext|>
I can see how that would make you angry.  Did you talk to him about how you felt? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I can imagine it was a little awkward at first. But I'm sure it's a good story for when she grows up! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened? Did you end up getting the good news of what you got in the mail? <|endoftext|>
Did you call the post office to complain about it? I would if I were in your shoes. <|endoftext|>
Maybe she will come to your town and you can go out and have a nice, quiet life! <|endoftext|>
If you have a phone, you can always take pictures of your pets in case the police get involved. <|endoftext|>
Mexican food is the best! Did she enjoy your aunt's visit?  Did she bring you anything special? <|endoftext|>
Road trips are great, but I'm sure it's even better that she's home!  Hopefully you can take advantage of the time you have to spend with her. <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about it? Think you're going to get an A? Think positive? <|endoftext|>
Well done, you must be quite proud of yourself. When do you find out your grade? <|endoftext|>
I love hockey, who was the game you went to? was it a good game? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. They are a lot of fun. If you ever get the chance again, I'd suggest checking it out. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is so sad. Were you able to save the dog? I'm glad you were able to catch it! <|endoftext|>
Haha! No, I don't live in Texas. I was just visiting a friend there. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how you feel, I've lost both of mine so I know what you're going through. <|endoftext|>
I hope time will help you get over this loss. I've lost many people and it doesn't get any easier. <|endoftext|>
That's a bummer! Maybe you can get yourself a nice TV or something to keep yourself occupied. <|endoftext|>
Yes. Turn the tv up. Or turn the lights on. That's what I would do. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you're really happy! Congratulations to you and him! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a good plan. It's always good to get out and try new places. <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome.  Good for her.  What does she want to do after she graduates? <|endoftext|>
How many did you eat?  Did you feel bad about it once you had eaten them? <|endoftext|>
Tell me about it. I'm dieting and working out at the same time. It's hard. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, what did you do? I would have been terrified..  I am glad you are ok. <|endoftext|>
Don't blame you! I wouldn't be able to sleep for the rest of the night. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I've never heard of that show but I'm sorry to hear you're sad. Why is it your favorite? <|endoftext|>
I've never seen that but I love watching shows like that, maybe I should check it out! <|endoftext|>
Good evening. I'm about to take a break at work. I work in a warehouse. What do you do? <|endoftext|>
I wish I could fall asleep that early. I have a toddler who is always waking me up at 4am. <|endoftext|>
Don't worry, you'll be fine. As long as you have everything you need to take from you. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that sounds like a big change. Has he been deployed for a while now? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! How are you settling in? Do you like it so far? <|endoftext|>
I understand that completely, I have a daughter that's 2 and a half and I feel like I barely get to spend any time with her! <|endoftext|>
Are you sick or just going in for a check-up? I hope everything is okay. <|endoftext|>
I would be mad too. They should be required to pay you for the time you spent waiting. <|endoftext|>
Awww, that's so sweet.  I had a cat who loved to cuddle.  Did you give him some? <|endoftext|>
Awwww!  That is so sweet!  I am glad you were able to take him in.  What a sweetheart! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens! Did you call back and ask for a refund? <|endoftext|>
Tell them it's my birthday. That's what I tell people when they lie to me. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! That's so exciting! I hope everything goes well for you guys. <|endoftext|>
I love the outdoors and being able to go anywhere you want is one of my favorite things to do. <|endoftext|>
Where do you live? I love dressing up and going to the haunted house. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that sounds like a very interesting job. I bet you saw some interesting things! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry! That must have been devastating. Were you able to find another home? <|endoftext|>
That's crazy! I am so glad no one was hurt, and I hope your car got fixed as well. <|endoftext|>
I would have thought the same thing! I hate being out in the dark. What did you guys end up doing? <|endoftext|>
Sweet! I love Chevy trucks! I have a Chevy Traverse and love it! Did you have a lot of fun? <|endoftext|>
How did that go? I am sure the teacher was nice and wanted to talk to her. <|endoftext|>
Teachers are some of the most underpaid people in the world. I'm glad she was able to make you proud. <|endoftext|>
i hate horror films, they are too scary for me!  what was the name of the movie? <|endoftext|>
I hear ya.  I don't do horror films well.  The jump scares are too real for me! <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I wish I could go back to high school just to relive some of the fun times. <|endoftext|>
It's always good to see your old friends, I agree! It's just not the same. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find some closure to the loss. <|endoftext|>
Will you be able to make it work? You should try to get the best of both worlds. <|endoftext|>
What did you do? Did you call the police or just leave? I'm sorry that happened to you, that must have been scary. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I would have been so scared. Did you report it to the police? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's great! How old is she? What kind of car is it? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well at least you can ride in style for free while she waits for you! <|endoftext|>
Where are you headed to? I hope you have a great time! I love taking vacations. <|endoftext|>
I am so jealous! Have lots of fun! I am sure that will be a great time! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. A year is a long time. I hope you have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  I've actually never been to a casino but would love to.  Make sure to play blackjack! <|endoftext|>
It's been a while since I've played blackjack, I bet you're good at it. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear about your situation. That must make you feel awful. Have you talked to your husband about it? <|endoftext|>
Did you tell him? Maybe he'll take better care of you next time. I'm sure it was an accident. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you had a good time with your father. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry for your loss. I am sure he would have wanted you to be happy. <|endoftext|>
Well done! How much did you pay for the ticket if I may ask? And how many tickets did you buy? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a wonderful idea. I'm sure it will make your weekend much happier. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful that you husband is so handy! It's a lot of work to be able to do that. <|endoftext|>
How awesome! I am sure you have many good memories of attending college with this award. <|endoftext|>
Dang! I bet that was fun. Did you have to do a lot of phone work? <|endoftext|>
I don't think I would have done that, did you talk to her boss about it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, that sounds rough. I hope you guys can work it out, especially since you guys have been friends for so long. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was so hard on you. I can't imagine not being able to get my son anything. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. I love animals. I have a dog myself. What kind of Christmas did you have? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That must have been so embarrassing! Did you get hurt at all? <|endoftext|>
Well at least it sounds like it was mostly your pride that was injured.  I bet you will never make that mistake again! <|endoftext|>
I am happy for you two.  It takes a lot of hard work to be able to accomplish that. <|endoftext|>
Definitely. Congratulations on graduating! I'm sure your parents are proud of you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so glad you were okay. Did your coworkers help you up? <|endoftext|>
Quite literally, as you can see. Quality is more important than quantity when it comes to movies. Glad you enjoyed it! <|endoftext|>
That's understandable. What do you do to keep yourself occupied when your husband is gone? <|endoftext|>
It is not the same at all, it is quite sad.   I don't know what to do about it. <|endoftext|>
I felt that way when my kids went back to school too.  I felt like I had so much free time and was missing so much time with them. <|endoftext|>
That is such a hard thing to think about. I'm glad you have some good memories with them though. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! I am glad you scored high enough on it to boost your self confidence! <|endoftext|>
Well I hope you get a good night's rest tonight. I know you worked hard for it. <|endoftext|>
Secrets are the best.  I hope you had a great time.  Where did you guys go? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun! I'm so glad you got to spend time with your family. <|endoftext|>
What did you lie about and how did it make you feel? Hopefully it's over now and you've learned from your mistake. <|endoftext|>
It's such a terrible thing to do, but it's so good that you're honest about it! <|endoftext|>
Hey that's awesome! I would take that any day. I hope you have a lot of fun. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it does get hotter there in the summer. But I love the weather, I'm just not a fan of the humidity. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! How much did you win and what are you going to do with it? <|endoftext|>
That's still a lot of money! Maybe you should try to find the culprit and confront them. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, it's really hard to lose touch with people you care about. <|endoftext|>
I hope it works out for you, I'm sure you'll meet a bunch of new cool people. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's awful! I hope you had insurance and they're okay. It must have been so scary. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope you didn't have to use your credit card to get it fixed! <|endoftext|>
Dogs are loyal like that. Did he do a good job observing you? <|endoftext|>
Aww, I bet you're going to miss him. At least you get to see him soon! <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! You guys sound really happy, which is always a good thing. <|endoftext|>
Not really. I am still looking for that unexpected rainbow that shows up when the sun is down. <|endoftext|>
What was it? Was it something you were looking for, or was it unexpected? <|endoftext|>
That is pretty awesome. I hope you find out who did it and give them an award of sorts. <|endoftext|>
I would be too! Did you tell her it was your vase? Did she offer to buy you a new one? <|endoftext|>
Dang. Well at least you were able to talk to her about it and save her some money. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hate to hear that. That must be so hard for you to be away from your daughter all the time. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad to hear! I hope he feels better and you are there to support him. <|endoftext|>
I have not, is it similar to that on Project Runway or Basketball? <|endoftext|>
I didn't know that, I will definitely be looking forward to it. Maybe I will even start playing it now. <|endoftext|>
Really? I had no idea, I loved those toys when I was a kid! <|endoftext|>
It's always nice to look back on old memories. I hope you had a great time! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you at least try to make it up to her? <|endoftext|>
It will be ok. As long as both of you are working it should work out fine. <|endoftext|>
That is such a wonderful thing to hear! Cheating is the worst thing anyone can do in a relationship. <|endoftext|>
I wouldn't want to either. That's why I don't want kids, I can't understand how people are so cruel. <|endoftext|>
It really is. I try to be really good at understanding her needs, but it's hard sometimes. <|endoftext|>
That sounds lonely. Maybe you could get a pet to occupy the room with you. <|endoftext|>
Are you excited for him? I hope he gets some cool gifts! :)  I know birthdays can be a bummer sometimes, but sometimes they make you feel really good when you get good news like that, so it's worth it. <|endoftext|>
That is a long time to be without a girlfriend. I hope you have a great time. <|endoftext|>
Me too! What is your favorite part of the holiday?  Mine is the giving and getting gifts. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's always a risk with airports, but it's worth a shot! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I hope it's not going to do any damage! Do you think you'll be evacuating? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Hopefully the weather takes a better turn for you soon.   Stay indoors if you can! <|endoftext|>
What game is that? I just pre ordered Call of Duty BO4, so I can relate to your excitement! <|endoftext|>
I never got into those games.  I was never into the "real" world. I was always into the fantasy" stuff. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. You must be very happy. Will you be getting a raise as well? <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you!  I bet you are,  are you going to celebrate? <|endoftext|>
I do too, it makes it so you have something to remember the holidays with. Do you do that? <|endoftext|>
I agree. People should be more considerate. It's not just coffee shops that do that either. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be awful. Do you want to leave him? <|endoftext|>
Oh, have you found a new place yet? How do you feel about the new place? <|endoftext|>
That is a great accomplishment.  Did she initiate it or was it gradual? <|endoftext|>
Haha! I hear you! My son is 3 1/2 and is getting to the age where he refuses to use the potty. Diapers forever! <|endoftext|>
What kind of puppy did you get? I love puppies. I don't have any right now but I hope to get one soon. <|endoftext|>
You are so lucky. Enjoy every minute with her. She will be gone before you know it. <|endoftext|>
That is good, keep doing what you are doing, you will get the results you desire. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's a lot. Good luck, and I hope it's worth it for you! <|endoftext|>
Not silly at all!  Getting something you want is the best!  What was it that you wanted? <|endoftext|>
Little things like that can make up for a lot of things in life, I think. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I can still remember watching that movie with my kids. It was so nostalgic <|endoftext|>
Movies are the best way to spend time with family! Did you see it in the theater? <|endoftext|>
What does 5 mean? I am not sure what you are trying to tell me. Do you have a test coming up? <|endoftext|>
That is not cool, move to where they are and you can be there all the time. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that is pretty far. I am sorry for your loss. I lost my grandmother last year. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. What's been going on, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. I have been fired before and it is not a good thing. I hope you won't lose your job. <|endoftext|>
Can you explain more? How are you feeling about it? I'm sorry you feel that way. <|endoftext|>
I agree, I think it has to do with people's insecurities and insecurity. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully you can spend more time with your family next time. <|endoftext|>
That is pretty far.  How do you keep in touch with them?  Skype or something? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope he feels better soon! I know how that feels. It's awful! <|endoftext|>
That's the best nurse. I have a friend who became a nurse a few years ago. She said it's one of the hardest jobs out there, but she loves it! <|endoftext|>
Oh I am so sorry! I have lost many this year. They become a part of the family. <|endoftext|>
It's always hard to lose a pet, I lost my dog when she was young.  They become a part of the family. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's horrible! I bet it's really scary when it happens. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad someone can see it! Everyone needs someone to talk to and I don't have many friends. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's awesome. What are you going to do with it? (I'm assuming you already spent it) <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should look for the culprit. It could be any number of things. <|endoftext|>
Did you ever find the spider? I bet your heart was racing and shaking. <|endoftext|>
That is scary!  I hope you didn't have to call anyone to help you get back to sleep. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do fine if you studied hard enough. What subject is it on? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do fine if you're really studying. I believe in you! <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about it? Are you ready? Do you have enough time to prepare? <|endoftext|>
I am the same way, I feel like I have no idea what to say most of the time <|endoftext|>
Dang, did you get rid of them at a good time or at least get them back? <|endoftext|>
Hope you have a great rest of your weekend. I am about to go out with some friends. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? What has made you so confident in their ability to be faithful?. <|endoftext|>
Yes, that is very important. I have been in that situation and it can be very devastating. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I am so sorry to hear that. How is everyone doing now? <|endoftext|>
I would have been so scared! I'm glad everyone is okay though! That could have been really, really bad. <|endoftext|>
That is horrible! I would be so furious! Did you complain to the staff about the situation? <|endoftext|>
That is not cool.  I would try to get a new one and tell them to go find it! <|endoftext|>
That is great. You must have worked really hard to get that promotion. I am happy for you. <|endoftext|>
I have always had a special place in my heart for kindergarteners. I am glad it worked out so well for you. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun. I've never been fishing before. What kind of rod and reel do you have? <|endoftext|>
Mine is 2 1/2 years old. They grow up so fast.  ha ha <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it wasn't too expensive. It happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hate when that happens. At least you were able to save your money. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I'm glad you were able to get it fixed! It can be hard getting things like that fixed! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's smart. I'm glad you got it fixed! I hope you have a speedy rest of your weekend! <|endoftext|>
Are you a big college football fan? I've never been to a college game! I went to high school, but that was a long time ago. <|endoftext|>
Ah, I should have known that. I'm a diehard Cowboys fan. <|endoftext|>
What did you do? Was it something that made you feel embarrassed, or just because? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. That is frustrating when things like that happen. <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's crazy! I bet you were so proud. Congratulations to him! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I'm sure he appreciated all the hard work he put in! <|endoftext|>
That is very nice of him. We need more people like that in the world. <|endoftext|>
Well that's not a very nice thing to do.  I think you should talk to him and let him know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That would have made me mad, too! Were you able to get away from it? <|endoftext|>
Did you take the dog to the vet? I hope it heals up soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you're able to get it fixed, those transmissions can be expensive! <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. At least you will be able to buy a new home soon. <|endoftext|>
That is horrible. Did you find the culprit? Did he leave a note? <|endoftext|>
Dang, people can be so cruel. I'm glad you didn't get hurt. <|endoftext|>
Excellent! How far did you go? Did you have to walk? Did anyone walk with you? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, I've always wanted to do that myself. Did you do it with your family or alone? <|endoftext|>
Dang! I would have been so excited if I saw that! Did they play any songs? <|endoftext|>
Oh that is really cool, wish I could have been there to see that, bet it was a really fun show. <|endoftext|>
I bet I could do that with my bowling! What were you using it for? I love bowling. <|endoftext|>
I bet it is! I hope you have a lot of fun with your friends over there! <|endoftext|>
Ewwwww. Dogs can be so gross. I don't understand why people don't clean up after their dogs. <|endoftext|>
That's true, it's always good to have someone with you. I hope you feel better! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What are you doing to get rid of all the debt? I know it can be tough to stick to it sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Well, I hope you have a good time and it doesn't rain or anything like that! <|endoftext|>
It's a big learning process for sure, but I'm sure you will continue to improve. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's hard to be patient, but it helps to stay patient and to not take anything for granted. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I'm sure you will, you sound like a motivated person. :) <|endoftext|>
Sure, you can't just drop out. You need to keep your GPA at least, otherwise it won't be worth it. <|endoftext|>
That's great for him. I am sure he feels a great deal of pride in that accomplishment. <|endoftext|>
I remember when my place was that cheap. It was a struggle, but we made it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How did that happen? Did it end up going in the end, or did you have to leave the game? <|endoftext|>
I bet it was! Were you able to go home and laugh it off or were you too shaken up? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet he is stoked! Did he buy it used or new? <|endoftext|>
I hope so, too! If not, then it's time to find a new job, I think. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I love it when you can enjoy your new ride. What kind of car is it? <|endoftext|>
That's a definite plus! And you can take it to the drag strip any time you want! <|endoftext|>
Dang, I love listening to my childhood playlists. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy. <|endoftext|>
I love old school hip hop, but to be honest, I'm not too familiar with the newer stuff. I'll have to check those out! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I can't imagine how anxious that must make you. I hope everything is okay. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine.  I hope you get the answer you're looking for.  Keep your head up! <|endoftext|>
Yay! I hate bad neighbors, I'm so glad you got a new place. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so relaxing! I love being in the countryside. I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
Did it end up going all right? Did you end up with the same score as the other person? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I am sure you can make it up to her! Don't feel bad, it happens all the time. <|endoftext|>
Do you have a rather large family, or do you just have the one brother and sisters? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I'm happy for you. Hopefully you two have a lot of catching up to do! <|endoftext|>
Wow, congratulations! That's a great accomplishment. What did you do, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
It's paying off! Keep up the good work. Maybe one day you can start selling those drawings for money. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I need to work on improving my self-confidence a bit more. <|endoftext|>
That is a great attitude to have about it. I am sure you will make a great plan for the future. <|endoftext|>
How fun! I bet he is really good at it. Have you ever bowled before? <|endoftext|>
I love bowling!  I'm not very good myself, but it is so much fun.  I hope he has a great time! <|endoftext|>
Hey, it happens to the best of us. I bet they didn't even realize it was you. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I hope you find them again. I would be so irritated if I was losing my pet. <|endoftext|>
That's really a long time to be going on a tinder date, I'm sorry. I hope you find someone worthy of your time. <|endoftext|>
Haha, yeah that's a good idea. Or maybe some rock music. I'm sure you'll be able to find something that will keep you from getting too worked up. <|endoftext|>
Uh oh, did you ask him what it was? Did he ask you to check it out? <|endoftext|>
That's so gross. Did you say anything to the chef? They should have told you. <|endoftext|>
That must be exciting! Do you have any idea where you're going to go while you're away? <|endoftext|>
I bet they are! That's so exciting! I hope they have a great time. <|endoftext|>
True, those were the days. Now I just want to buy a bunch of stuff lol. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's always nice to get together and have a good time, but it's not the same. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a great feeling! Did you end up getting the job offer? If so, I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you got out of that situation. It sounds like it's for the best. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! That would have scared me so much. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
What a nice person! Did you end up telling her it was you who saw her? <|endoftext|>
That is really good!  It is hard to stay on a diet for more then a day.  I do not think I could do that! <|endoftext|>
I feel you on that! I used to be a food addict as well, but I've been doing my best to stop that. It's hard to stop once you start though! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I would be jealous too if I were you! Do you think you can save up for one? <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling. Just keep working hard and maybe one day you can afford one. <|endoftext|>
That is true, there are some shady people in the world.  I hope you sell the phone.  What kind of phone is it? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad and devastating. I hope you can find some fun activities to keep yourself occupied! <|endoftext|>
That sounds so relaxing! I wish I had a place to live that was so spooky. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that does sound like an interesting place to visit. I hope you have a good time! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that is not a good thing to do. I hope they catch the person and you get your money back. <|endoftext|>
Man, that's awful. Fingers crossed that it doesn't happen to you again. <|endoftext|>
That's great.  I'm glad you're enjoying your life.  There are a lot of people who would take it for granted. <|endoftext|>
I agree. I try to be a lot more grateful everyday because you never know when you might lose it all. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  I wish I knew how to use a sewing machine to do that. <|endoftext|>
That is very nice of you. I am sure they will enjoy that as much as you do! <|endoftext|>
I bet! I have always wanted to go to California. I heard it is beautiful. <|endoftext|>
That must have been heart warming. I am glad you got to spend some time with him. <|endoftext|>
That is a lucky thing to be thankful for. I am glad you feel that way. <|endoftext|>
That is a great attitude to have! Positivity is always a great quality to have. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sweet. I love my dog too. What kind of dog do you have? <|endoftext|>
I have a cat. Her name is Venus. I rescued her from outside after she was attacked by a dog. <|endoftext|>
Oh man I remember those days!  They always seemed to go by so quickly.  What are you most nervous about? <|endoftext|>
Right, I feel you on that one, at least for me it's only going to be a month before I head off to work. <|endoftext|>
That's good, it keeps you level headed and grounded, that's what I like about it! <|endoftext|>
I understand that. But that's not the end of you. You have to look out for yourself first. <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck, study hard and you'll do great! What are you studying? <|endoftext|>
Part time jobs are hard to find and very hard to maintain. I really hope you do get it. <|endoftext|>
What a great accomplishment! You must be so proud of him. What kind of car is it? <|endoftext|>
xterra? is that like a luxury brand? i don't know too much about cars. <|endoftext|>
Hey that's awesome! I just bought a used car myself. What kind are you getting? <|endoftext|>
Xterras are nice. I have a jeep, its not much but it has killer gas mileage. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that sounds scary! What happened? Did you guys get into a wreck? <|endoftext|>
That is scary! I am glad you are okay.  Maybe they have cameras in the parking lot? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan to make it up to him/her? <|endoftext|>
That's true, kids do grow up fast.  Do you have any kids of your own? <|endoftext|>
That's great! It's so important to take care of yourself, and feel good about yourself. <|endoftext|>
That's okay. That's a great habit to have. I just started working out too. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I love finding new places like that. What did you get to pick out? <|endoftext|>
Dragon beans are the best! I wish I could try some of that curry. I'm sure it will be great. <|endoftext|>
So they are more like a miniature version of the regular beans! I love them! <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds great! Organic is the way to go. Do you buy a lot of organic stuff? <|endoftext|>
What did he do?  Was it a good thing that he was your stepdad, or did he scare you? <|endoftext|>
Dogs can be a little squeamish when it comes to that sort of thing. I wouldn't feel too bad, it sounds like he was trying to protect you. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is pretty cool.  How long does it take to get a muscles fibre? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's what I thought too. You'd think he'd get the hint from the other people around him. <|endoftext|>
I heard that he was having a rough time. I hope he is in a better place now. That is so sad. <|endoftext|>
I think mental health is something that everyone should be aware of, and should be taken care of. <|endoftext|>
I totally agree. We as a community really do need to step up and start helping those in need. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can see her next time she's in town. <|endoftext|>
That's so wonderful! I'm glad you were able to visit and remember the good times. <|endoftext|>
That's crazy! I love watching F1. It's such a spectacular sport. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a crazy night but I'm glad you had a great time. I need to get out more and see the world. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is very interesting. I wonder what that will be like in the future, when kids are older. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. I used to get scared when going to the store by myself. <|endoftext|>
That was a very nice thing for him to do. It is very nice of him. <|endoftext|>
Yes! I prepared for this day in my life and it came out great. I did not think I would get this promotion. <|endoftext|>
That is outstanding! You must be so proud, what did he learn if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing.  You must be proud.  Does he have any interests that you can expedite with? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so peaceful. I wish I had peaceful neighbors. I get too worked up. <|endoftext|>
Hahaha, yeah, it's already too late in the summer. I guess I better start planning for next summer. <|endoftext|>
Did you take care of it? It could have been a stray for a long time. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm glad they got it out! Allergies to cats are the worst. <|endoftext|>
That is impressive.  She must have a lot of willpower to go through with something like that. <|endoftext|>
That's great. I love when people take initiative and go out of their way to help others. <|endoftext|>
I just started watching that. I need to catch up on the new episodes. I've been so busy I haven't had time. <|endoftext|>
I've never tried it myself, but I've heard it's really good. I might have to check it out! <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness!  I would be too.  I love my animals so much. <|endoftext|>
What a bummer. I hope you didn't have to pay a lot for the vet. <|endoftext|>
That would be devastating. I hope they are all okay and you are finding ways to cope. <|endoftext|>
Yes, it is. I was crying so hard when I heard she was killed in a car accident. <|endoftext|>
Dang, was it a suprise?  Did you get any cool gifts? <|endoftext|>
Dang, now I definitely need to start doing something like that for my neighbors. I don't know how I would feel if my car was hit by a truck though. <|endoftext|>
Good luck with that. Waiting on those can be a pain. Especially when you know you've waited for a while. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should go ahead and make your own pizza, it's never too late for pizza to be delivered! <|endoftext|>
Me too! It makes me so mad. Have you seen the video's on the internet? <|endoftext|>
I know, it makes me want to adopt all the animals in the shelter. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun!  I can't wait until Christmas!  What is your favorite part of the holiday? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I guess you're right. I just miss how carefree everything was. No responsibilities. <|endoftext|>
I know someone who does the same thing. If you work hard you can do it too. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's a lot. Eating out is so expensive these days. I try to avoid it. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's exciting! Are you moving to a new place, or to a different state? <|endoftext|>
Texas is really big, huh? What's there to do in the big city? <|endoftext|>
Ah, that's a good plan. I live in Florida, so I'm always worried about hurricanes. I hope you stay safe! <|endoftext|>
That's good. Evacuation is always a good thing. But I would hate to have to deal with the aftermath. <|endoftext|>
That is so nice!  It's always nice to reconnect with an old friend. <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you.  I hope I have a family like that some day. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she feels better soon and you are able to take care of her. <|endoftext|>
I am glad she is okay!  That is so scary!  I have had to do surgery on dogs before and it was traumatic. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that.  It must have been hard at the time, but it will be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it is helpful to remember the good times you had together, and to grieve. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a crazy situation. I am glad you guys got back on your feet. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. Where did you guys go on vacation? I hope you had a good time! <|endoftext|>
Are you going to start a new journey with your family?  Packing is always a pain, but packing is one of the first things you do when you get to a new place. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear that you've got something to look forward to. I'll keep you in my thoughts and pray you get the job! <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you! I have been married for ten years and it is the best decision I have ever made. <|endoftext|>
I hope you find that special someone, and that you stay happy and together for a long time! <|endoftext|>
That's cool, what was the name of the station? I may have heard of it. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I used to love those comics when I was a kid! I can't believe they are still going on and making new episodes. <|endoftext|>
How'd it go?  Did you get an A?  I hope you did well. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you did fine. It just takes time. How many hours did you study? <|endoftext|>
Good for him! I bet he was stoked. Was it your friend's first time? <|endoftext|>
Are you a big baseball fan? I'm a New Orleans Saints fan. <|endoftext|>
Yeah it really is a great time when your team wins, it feels like you are part of the team. <|endoftext|>
skydiving is insane to me, but awesome if you love it. I could never do it <|endoftext|>
I'm in the southeast. I would love to try it, but I'm afraid of heights. <|endoftext|>
Haha, I'm the same way. Organized is a great way to be, as long as you're keeping it neat. <|endoftext|>
That's a good motto to have. Boy Scouts also have a lot of spirituality to it. That's why I'm a part of it. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that is so aggravating! I am so sorry that happened to you! <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Do you have any way of getting them back without too much trouble? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. How are you holding up? <|endoftext|>
What kind of dog was it? I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you can find some peace during this difficult time. <|endoftext|>
That's not good. Do you think your friend will be mad at you when he finds out? <|endoftext|>
Not bad at all! You must really be looking forward to his arrival. I bet you will have a great time. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! What did you get a degree in? I'm sure it took a lot of work. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! It always feels great to see hard work pay off. I hope to be able to say the same one day. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you're having a lot of fun and relaxing time together! <|endoftext|>
I'm bilingual myself, Italian is my native tongue. Maybe she'll pick it up while she's in school. <|endoftext|>
Wow, you must be excited.  But also anxious at the same time.  Congratulations on getting back! <|endoftext|>
It's the little things that can make the biggest different in the world to a happy wife and husband! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you didn't get too many weird looks. I bet it will look fabulous on you, though! <|endoftext|>
How long did you let it get for? I let mine grow out to finally let it grow back out but I always keep it on the back of my head no matter what. <|endoftext|>
What happened? Hopefully it wasn't too bad. I love eating out with friends or family. <|endoftext|>
So you don't go there anymore? Or is there a different place you like to eat? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did any of the groceries break? That would have been embarrassing. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! That must have been so embarrassing! I hope you got a refund. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun! What are you going to do while she's gone? Play video games? <|endoftext|>
Why don't you take up a hobby or interest to take your mind off from it? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I imagine that must have been a very lonely experience. I hope that you made some friends along the way! <|endoftext|>
Not at all! That was so nice of him! I wish I had a friend like that. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Gas is very expensive right now. Hopefully you can move somewhere else soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh I've been there! So nice and green. We went to Lake Powell in Utah. It was so beautiful. <|endoftext|>
How did you manage to do that? I've always wanted to go to Cali...from the Midwest, moved to TX to escape the desolate tundra haha <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's a pretty long drive. I bet it was nice to stop on the highway and listen to your own music. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Is she better now? I hope she will be soon. <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear she is doing better. I know how upsetting that can be. <|endoftext|>
I feel that way too.  I'm looking forward to being able to go back to school <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that my friend. I hope things start to look better for you soon. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she'll be okay! I had surgery a few years ago and it wasn't too bad. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow! I didn't know she was having surgery. That is a lot to take care of. <|endoftext|>
I know right? It's the worst, especially if you have nothing to do with it. <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling.  Getting last is the worst, and it always seems to happen to everyone. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? What did you do to make it a wonderful monday? :D <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's awesome.  I love cruises.  Where are you going to go cruising? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I hope they were not too hard on the animals and that the family was able to move on from it. <|endoftext|>
I know right! I don't know what I would do if one of my pets was sick. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope everything is okay with your dog. Why is he gone for so long? <|endoftext|>
What did you guys do when you first saw each other? Go out and do fun things together? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I can only imagine how tough that must have been. How did you manage? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. :) <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that sounds rough. I can't imagine trying to get into loans. I hope everything worked out for you guys! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's rough. Hopefully they can help you out some more in the future. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! I bet you all have a lot of catching up to do! How far away are they? <|endoftext|>
Who are you seeing and why are you so exited about it?? I wish I had a long term relationship like that! <|endoftext|>
I am the same way.  I hate spiders.  Especially if you know what kind they are, like the black widow. <|endoftext|>
I was also just born with a fear of them. I can still see them from my nightmares. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a great time at the party without her knowing? <|endoftext|>
Dang! I bet you were happy to see everyone. I wish I had a party like that! <|endoftext|>
That's annoying. Have you told him not to do that yet? Maybe he just doesn't realize he's doing it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it can be annoying at times. I hope he stops soon, so you can enjoy some peace and quiet again. <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. I was almost hit by a truck when I was going to school today. <|endoftext|>
Maybe she had a mental illness. I don't know, that was pretty brave of you all, I wouldn't have been brave enough. <|endoftext|>
Oh gross! I hope you didn't finish your meal. Did you tell the waitress? <|endoftext|>
That's good, at least they were responsible and didn't charge you for the lost items. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe he'll get some more for you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's even worse! I hope you didn't have to throw it away! <|endoftext|>
Why do you feel surprised?  Did you not expect her to come?  I hope it was a good thing for you and not for her. <|endoftext|>
Awe, that is so sweet of him. You are lucky to have such a good friend. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad.  I am sorry for your loss.  How did he die? <|endoftext|>
Aww, I'm glad he came back home with you. He sounds like he was a great addition to your family. <|endoftext|>
I do! I have a little toy poodle. She's a doll. <|endoftext|>
I know, it was so sweet of her and my husband to do that for me. I am so thankful for her. <|endoftext|>
Haha!  I think that's a good thing!  It means you two are cooking for one another and sharing the joy of food! <|endoftext|>
Chocolate lover, hu/ What's your favorite kind of chiropractor? <|endoftext|>
Uh oh. I think homework is one of those things where you have to do it yourselves <|endoftext|>
I am so proud of your son!  He will do so well in math that's for sure. <|endoftext|>
Good for you! How long do you think it will take you to complete it? <|endoftext|>
What is your training regimen? How well do you think you are going to do? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, but just remember that it's just another day at a time. <|endoftext|>
Sure thing! I hope it works out for you, and that you have a safe trip. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! That sounds like so much fun! I have always wanted to go there! What was your favorite thing to do there? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I bet that was a crazy experience. I would be so nervous. <|endoftext|>
How many do you bench press? I'm proud of you for going to the gym. It's hard to start. <|endoftext|>
I would imagine so, vikings were quite the force to conquer the world. <|endoftext|>
No, thankfully. Have you? It's one of my worst fears, honestly. <|endoftext|>
That does sound scary! I hope you didn't have any serious issues because that sounds like it could have been serious! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. It's probably best to spend as much time as you can with her so she doesn't feel alone. <|endoftext|>
That's really rough. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing okay. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty crappy. Did they give you a reason why they are doing that to you? <|endoftext|>
That's awful! I don't why they would do that! I'm so sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
I've had a few close friends that have committed suicide. It's one of the hardest things in life. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, it must be hard on all of you. I hope you're able to be there for him. <|endoftext|>
I have! I got him when he was a puppy, he's the cutest thing. <|endoftext|>
My dog used to poop in the house.  In the house, she would go outside to use the bathroom.  She would use the backyard as her area. <|endoftext|>
Chocolate is my lifeblood, along with coffee. I have to keep it cool in there or else it gets too melty. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's the worst. Hopefully you can find a replacement piece to cheer you up. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did they not take care of it when you called them to ask if they could bring it back? <|endoftext|>
You should never feel bad about something that wasn't your fault. It happens to all of us at some point in life. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you guys will figure it out soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you didn't damage anything. <|endoftext|>
Scrapbooks are pretty awesome.  Did you find anything interesting?  I like to look through mine every now and then to see what other people have been up to. <|endoftext|>
That is pretty neat! Sibling rivalry is pretty common. I have seen it in movies and TV shows. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That must have been so disappointing. How did you feel when you got to the airport? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I'm glad you had a great time!  I went on vacation to Florida not too long ago. I went to Orlando, FL and it was so awesome! <|endoftext|>
Did the police get involved at all? I hope they did something about it, people need to be more responsible. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's always a bummer when you can't make it out to the water. Hopefully you can plan something else to do! <|endoftext|>
Oh no that sounds like a bummer! Were you able to go later on with them? <|endoftext|>
What did he do that you didn't believe him? Rockstars are usually quite the famous individuals. <|endoftext|>
That is crazy! Crazytrains is a crazy old movie. I used to watch it as a kid <|endoftext|>
That sounds like it could be pretty interesting. What was the weirdest situation that you have dealt with? <|endoftext|>
That's awful. I'm glad the cats were there to protect the man and his pets. <|endoftext|>
Does he do it on purpose to annoy you or is he just a little rambunctious? <|endoftext|>
That is a bad habit. I still have one of those cell phones with videos on it. <|endoftext|>
How did it go? Did you like it?  I just got a haircut myself. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Sometimes we have to make changes to feel better. I did the same thing a few months ago and it made me feel amazing. <|endoftext|>
Ewww, that's gross. Sorry to hear that. What do you think happened to it? <|endoftext|>
That is horrible I would be so embarrassed if that happened to me I would never go back to that restaurant again. <|endoftext|>
ebay is such a great place to find good deals, you got a good deal <|endoftext|>
Don't you hate when that happens? People should be more considerate and clean up after themselves. <|endoftext|>
How did you do?  Did you study a lot for it?  I loved chemistry in high school and I'm trying to get my kids into it. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! That's great to hear. Congratulations on your hard work paying off. <|endoftext|>
Yeah it sure can. But we all have to do it at least once in our lives. <|endoftext|>
Hey, no problem. You'll make it through it, and remember her no matter what. <|endoftext|>
How do you think she is doing?  Are you nervous?  I am sure she is ready to do anything she wants to do. <|endoftext|>
I am sure she will continue to do well.  second week is a good amount of training <|endoftext|>
What are you planning on getting for Christmas?  I love Christmas time, the best time of the year! <|endoftext|>
I like it better than the winter honestly, I like to be able to wear shorts and a tankuit. <|endoftext|>
That is very irresponsible from your side. I would have walked out right away. <|endoftext|>
I would have been so embarrassed. You could have stayed in the toilet the rest of the day. <|endoftext|>
Used to be? Did something happen to make you scared? That doesn't sound good. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear that you got it back. But I would be so scared to do that. <|endoftext|>
Online dates can be scary! I hope it goes well for you. Are you nervous? <|endoftext|>
It doesn't take much to impress someone these days so you should be good to go. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations!  What are you proposing them for?  I am sure you are excited to do it. <|endoftext|>
What are you worried about, if you don't mind me asking. And why do you have so much preparation? <|endoftext|>
Does your boyfriend wake you up that early too? Or does he just like to get up early? <|endoftext|>
That is so funny. Maybe he is stressed out. I hope it isn't anything serious <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! That is a great accomplishment. I am sure it took a lot of determination. <|endoftext|>
Are you in college? If so, I wish you the best of luck. It can be tough but it can be done. <|endoftext|>
Yea the weather has been so extreme this year it's hard to play some hookeys. <|endoftext|>
That must have been embarrassing. How did you feel when you realized what you did was wrong? <|endoftext|>
Where do you go when you are on a trip?  Do you stay in a hotel or a hotel? <|endoftext|>
So sorry to hear that. Did you enjoy your trip by yourself or did it get lonely? <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about that?  Do you feel like you can trust the other person? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  What happened?  Is she crazy or just needing some assistance? <|endoftext|>
I haven't seen it yet, but I hear it's good! Did you like it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Have you tried the circadian rhythm? I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That must have been so scary! I'm glad you were able to come back and get it fixed. <|endoftext|>
Death can happen to anyone, don't feel too bad. It could have been a lot worse. <|endoftext|>
I would have asked for the manager!  That is not cool!  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That is not good, you should return the candy to the store and get your money back. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no. That's scary. Did you give him the money you were supposed to give him? <|endoftext|>
That is not a very nice thing to do. Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's the little things in life that make all the difference. Congratulations on your sobriety! <|endoftext|>
It's hard to be patient and patient in the morning when you know you've done everything you can. At least it's over and you can rest now. <|endoftext|>
That happened to me a couple of weeks ago. I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully it's just a temporarily thing <|endoftext|>
That's good and bad I guess. Glad you're happy about it. Me on the other hand, I'd be so jealous. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great time. Did you guys have a picnic or go for a walk? <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! You are lucky to have such a wonderful wife. She sounds like a treasure. <|endoftext|>
I know how that is. I play a lot of video games during the day because it is so hard to study. <|endoftext|>
Me too, I hate being in situations where I feel like I have to make a lot of eye contact. <|endoftext|>
I have had that happen to me before. It is not a good feeling at all. <|endoftext|>
Wow. I would be really upset, too. You should try to call your bank and see what happened. <|endoftext|>
Arcade machines are so much fun.  Did you play it?  Did your friend give it to you? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I know how it feels to lose something that was part of your family. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it's not too painful of an experience for you. I know I was when I had to have dental work done. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it's just a tooth ache. Have you been to the dentist? <|endoftext|>
Star wars is the best! My husband and I saw it yesterday and really enjoyed it. <|endoftext|>
He should be ashamed of himself. How could you let that guy get the tickets? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she's okay? That sounds so embarrassing. Was it her first time at the parade? <|endoftext|>
That's sounds like a fun and easy way to spend your day. I'm sure she really appreciated it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I guess he/she wanted to go up there for some reason. Was he okay? <|endoftext|>
Maybe, but at least you don't have to think about what could have been if it was real. <|endoftext|>
Did you bench more than you were supposed to or were you given a failing number? <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  It's always good to take a break from work and go outside. <|endoftext|>
What do you have in mind? I'm always happy to help out a friend in need. <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure, maybe try and find something you're passionate about and do it as a hobby? <|endoftext|>
Hey that's awesome!  How much did you win?  And what did you buy with it? <|endoftext|>
Wow that would be a good use of the money! Where do you plan on going first? <|endoftext|>
What play did you go to? Was it by any chance The Little Mermaid? <|endoftext|>
I saw that movie, it was really good! I love how the horn is used for magic. <|endoftext|>
Aww, I love puppies! What's her name, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
That is a great name. I hope you have a great time with your new pupper! <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of them.  What kind of music is it?  Did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I know what you mean. Being a kid was so easy. We didn't have to worry about anything. <|endoftext|>
Puppies are the best! What kind of puppy is it? My friend's got a little yorkie, I love him. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is an energetic dog, I had one years ago, she was nice though <|endoftext|>
Dang!  Did you get it back?  Did Christy get you another one? <|endoftext|>
Well, I guess you'll just have to get some more chickens, then. ;-) <|endoftext|>
That is so gross! I would have been so grossed out. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you have to walk home barefoot? That must have been so embarrassing. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that sounds scary! What happened next? Did you find out what it was? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I would be so scared. What if it was an intruder? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's always rough. Did you end up feeling like you could at least get the job? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I wish there was something I could do to make it better for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did it smell like smoke? Or did it have to be on something else? <|endoftext|>
Ew, that's gross. I hope you took it to the mechanic for that. <|endoftext|>
Ouch! That sucks! Did they stick around to exchange info? Hope you're not hurt. <|endoftext|>
Did you get their license plate? You might want to contact the police to see what happened. <|endoftext|>
Wow, so you must be very prepared and confident. I bet you'll crush it! <|endoftext|>
LOTR was a great game, i played it a lot when i was younger. I was sad when i had to stop playing it. <|endoftext|>
Dang. Did you at least get your money back? lol. I've been in that situation before. <|endoftext|>
Did you get in trouble with the bank? I hope they didn't fine you for it. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's unfortunate. Did you talk to the teacher/professor about it? <|endoftext|>
That's great that you were able to recall, even if you didn't understand what the problems were. I'm sure you will do better next time. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sweet! Did it bring back memories of when you were a kid? <|endoftext|>
I grew up during the 90's, so I can relate. What was the show about? <|endoftext|>
I love baseball. Who were the playings? Who are you rooting for? <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm glad you got to see it at least. I hope you take more trips like that in the future! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope his gramma is in a better place now! That is great that you were able to come and help him out. <|endoftext|>
Well, that sure is a sight to see! I hope that you don't ever have to see anything like that again! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope he is okay. That must have been so scary! Was it his fault? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's unfortunate that your car got damaged but at least you weren't hurt! <|endoftext|>
Congrats! What kind of car is it and how long did you have to wait for it? <|endoftext|>
Oh sweet.  I bet it was fun driving around in it.  Did you take it to the drag strip? <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I hope you do well. Not everyone is as fortunate as you. <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you! I wish I had the discipline and determination to get into a program like that. <|endoftext|>
Well congratulations!  I am sure you will do well on your finals. <|endoftext|>
Dang. You must have been pretty annoyed. At least you got it done in the end. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope someone turned it in soon to find it! I have had that happen to me before too. <|endoftext|>
Glad to hear it. Did the people in the seat ake a clue what had happened? <|endoftext|>
I know right? It made me feel so grateful for having such nice neighbors. <|endoftext|>
What concert was it?  Was it a first time?  I have never had the guts to do that. <|endoftext|>
What did she do to make you so proud? Sounds like you're a great parent! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's unfortunate. At least, if she won, she probably didn't have to wait too long before she could start dancing. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean.  I used to have to work long hours too when I was working in a Nike sweatshop.  Now that I am retired, I have a lot of free time on my hands. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. Maybe you can find a new job that is a bit more accomodating? <|endoftext|>
What are the clubs? I wish I could be more involved in clubs but I have a lot of work to do. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm a political science major, so I don't know too much about the field. What made you want to get into that field? <|endoftext|>
What does that have to do with the dump? Do you have to take it to the dump every few days? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that must be a bummer. It's a lot of waste of good food. <|endoftext|>
What did you eat?  Was it good?  Hopefully it was something you can make again at some point in the future. <|endoftext|>
Oh yuck! I would definitely not eat that again. Crunchy is a good word to use. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sure that will make you anxious to know what you did. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. I can't wait until they find a cure. <|endoftext|>
What happened at the wedding? Did something bad happen or not go through with it? Hopefully it was something you guys had talked about beforehand, and not something you had to hear. <|endoftext|>
That's good. Hopefully he can get sober now. I'm glad you stepped up to help. <|endoftext|>
Can you talk to a friend about it? Or maybe you can find a cheaper place to live. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you can get it all sorted out swiftly. <|endoftext|>
What system do you have? I haven't played video games since the Atari 2600. <|endoftext|>
Those are nice too. I like to have some sad ones in my life. It makes me feel like I have something good to look forward to. <|endoftext|>
Microbreweries are so cool! I didn't know they didn't exist in your town. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Microbreweries are so fun. You should try some time. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? Do you think they are checking you out or just admiring your love? <|endoftext|>
I would never go that far, but I would definitely not be able to live with her again. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. I'll keep you in my thoughts and prayers. <|endoftext|>
That is so great.  Food is the gateway to life.  If only people were more compassionate... <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! You must be excited. Are you having a boy or a girl? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I'm glad that you had that experience at least. They sound like really great people. <|endoftext|>
That's good, I bet they really enjoyed that! I'll bet they'll be wanting peaches now. <|endoftext|>
Wildlife is so needy. You are a good person for doing what you do. <|endoftext|>
That's a long time to be without your wife! What are you going to do with your time? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! I took a few years in college in America. I wish I would have taken more languages. <|endoftext|>
He didn't give you a reason why he's leaving? That's pretty rude of him. <|endoftext|>
Well I'm glad he did! I think it was a very sweet thing for him to do. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that sucks. Did you at least get a chance to use your overtime hours? <|endoftext|>
I would be too. I am sorry you have to deal with that. Maybe you should ask your boss for a pay raise? <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. Those kids need to be punished for their behavior! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's good, at least he didn't take anything to personal from you or anyone else. <|endoftext|>
Ooh, that's awesome! Job hunting can be so nerve-wracking. I hope he gets it! <|endoftext|>
That is awesome.  Good for him!  I am sure he will do great things with that. <|endoftext|>
I love coffee, I am going to get some in a bit. I am glad that you are enjoying your day, it sounds like it. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I hope your day goes well and you have many more! <|endoftext|>
I would have to agree with you. Those are the most nerve wracking things to do. <|endoftext|>
That's good, at least you were able to get it worked out. I don't know why people have to do that. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope I can still do that when I get older. That's awesome. <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of places! I hope you enjoy your time there, I know I would! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you feel better soon and can drive safely. Maybe take a friend with you so that you don't feel so nervous. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I bet you two are going to have a great time. You should go on a date while she's gone. <|endoftext|>
Did you adopt her or buy her.  Either way I am so happy for you. <|endoftext|>
Dang! Did you end up getting the job? Interviews can be so nerve wrecking! <|endoftext|>
Well I hope it all works out for you. School is just a part of life. <|endoftext|>
Where has she been going? Is she calling you while she's on the phone? ;-) <|endoftext|>
Dogs can be a handful when they want attention. It's good that she's coming back though. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's the worst part about interviews. You always feel like you're in purgatory waiting to hear back from them. <|endoftext|>
Awesome, I bet you will do great at work.  Do you already have a job lined up? <|endoftext|>
Have you tried using it for anything? Like watching movies or playing games on it? Maybe he just wants to show you how to use it. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I hope it wasn't a lot of money. Sometimes things work out better for the best. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that sucks. I bet you miss her a lot. I'm sure she'll be back before you know it! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's a long time to be apart. At least she's coming back soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I hate wasps too. They are so creepy and slimy. Your husband is a brave man! <|endoftext|>
What did he say?  Did he actually kill it?  Hope you didn't have to call an exterminator. <|endoftext|>
Yes, they are so annoying! Have you tried spraying lemon etc on yourself, or eating them? Helps me a lot! <|endoftext|>
I do too. It's best to just stay inside and avoid the rainy weathers. <|endoftext|>
I would have done the same thing, I hate spiders.  What did you do to kill it? <|endoftext|>
It sure is! I would never want to go on a rollercoaster! I'd be too scared <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Have you ever done it before? I would be so scared to do it! <|endoftext|>
extreme is good as long as you have fun with it. I am glad you are having fun <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you didn't get too cold!  My family has done that a couple times, so I know how it is. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That is definitely not something I would want to come home to seeing.  Did you send it back? <|endoftext|>
That's awful! I hope it was a simple operation and they can give you the right amount of relief! <|endoftext|>
Well I wish you the best of luck.  I hope it all goes well.  You are going to need it! <|endoftext|>
OMG I would have been so happy to have a friend like that. Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
She sounds like a wonderful person. I am so glad you have someone like that in your life. <|endoftext|>
I agree. Sometimes they are used for their purpose, but other times they are just for their own good. <|endoftext|>
I would have been so embarrassed.  I hope you were able to laugh it off with them. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! It's always tough to lose a pet. <|endoftext|>
I am so heartbroken thinking about it.  I hope her cancer is going to be successful and she gets to spend lots of time with you guys! <|endoftext|>
That sucks. Did she at least have a good time on the vacay? Sometimes vacations can feel like a long time without someone to talk to. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's not too bad! I'm glad they got to spend some time with you guys. <|endoftext|>
That's great! congratulations and good luck with the new place. Are you getting a new roommate? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! They do that all the time here, too. I think it's because they have no idea what they're doing, but it drives me crazy. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. You must be really looking forward to her coming back. Where has she been? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Maybe you should try and find a new hobby to occupy your time. <|endoftext|>
Applying and getting in is one of the hardest things in life, I wish there was a way to make it easier. <|endoftext|>
I would be too! I am terrified of spiders! Were you able to kill it? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you have a great game. Training is the best part of being a soccer player. <|endoftext|>
What game is it? I hope it's a Super Smash Bro's game! I love me some Smash Brothers! <|endoftext|>
I bet that was tough. How did you get by? Did you get a new job? <|endoftext|>
Moving always helps. I moved about 3 years ago and it still hurts. Just takes time. <|endoftext|>
India is a great place to visit. you'll have a lot of fun there i'm sure. <|endoftext|>
Well, at least you can look forward to it. I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great week!  What did you do with your time that you got to do what you wanted? <|endoftext|>
That is crazy! I had no idea tooth aching could be that bad. I hope you feel better soon. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I hope it will be like that for me as well! <|endoftext|>
I hope they aren't too noisy! I can relate, I had to live in an apartment when I was younger. <|endoftext|>
OMG I would have been so embarrassed. What did your secretary do? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope you didn't get too many funny stares.  It could have been worse! <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens.  Did you get to do anything cool while you were laying around? <|endoftext|>
I would have thought the same thing! Were you in the city or out in the suburbs? <|endoftext|>
Aww! I love my dog too! What kind of dog do you have? I have a Husky and a maltese Shiz Tzu! <|endoftext|>
Well, I hope you have a great time! I am sure it will be worth it! <|endoftext|>
How exciting! I bet you are a proud parent. Kindergartens are so fun for the kids. <|endoftext|>
I bet!  I am sure you will be glad to have some free time though. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Weddings are so much fun. Did you have your wedding? <|endoftext|>
That's great, I'm glad you gave it a chance and that it was good. I might have to try it out myself! <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way! That is so rude. Have you ever talked to them about it? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should talk to him and let him know how serious of an issue it is to you. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is a very high position. I hope that he enjoys the role! <|endoftext|>
I am glad he is doing so well! I am a strong believer in God, and I wish all the best for him! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you were able to get it cleaned up. What kind of dog do you have? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope she didn't get you too badly.  My dog does that all the time so I know how it feels. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? Was it any good? I'm always looking for new places to eat. <|endoftext|>
That's so disappointing! You should let them know that it was an error on their part and that you will get your money back! <|endoftext|>
What were some of the beliefs that they had?  Did you ever have to talk to them about it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's hard to refuse to go with someone else at times, but it's just not worth it. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I wish I had a lumberjack to carry around with me. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I am so happy for you!. Go you two, live happily ever!. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I have lost many this year too. It is never easy. <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling, but you are talking to me so that is a good start. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Did he give you a reason why? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you can go see him when he comes to visit! That will be the best birthday present you can ever get! <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. She will always be in your heart. How wonderful that you were able to reach out to her. <|endoftext|>
That's really nice of you. I'm sure she appreciates you doing that. Family is all that matters in the end. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you find her soon. <|endoftext|>
That's so sad, poor kitty! Did you take her to the vet right away? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad about your hip, but golf is a great way to relax too. <|endoftext|>
Yeah.  Physical therapy is a good idea.  I hope it helps you get back in the swing of things. <|endoftext|>
I think I would be okay with it, as long as I'm the only one on board. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I had a brother like that. I am an only child, so I never had siblings to do things with. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do mine! (I just got a new one as well!) What kind did you get? <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite movie? I like action and comedies mostly, but some dramas are good too. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I would have been so mad! Did you manage to get it out? <|endoftext|>
Lol! Poor guy must have been terrified. I would have done the same thing probably. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll be fine. Just prepare for it and it'll go great. <|endoftext|>
I hope you get it too! government jobs are usually good paying and you get to make a big impact on the lives of many people <|endoftext|>
Sometimes when I have a good dream I feel as if I'm still in high school haha. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can repair your friendship with your husband. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I do that all the time. I love to see what she's up to. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a wonderful surprise! What kind of puppy did she get for you? <|endoftext|>
What kind of dog is it?  I have a little terrier myself that I got as a gift for my birthday last month. <|endoftext|>
That's such a shame! I hate when that happens. What kind of dress was it, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's too bad. Well, I hope you can save up for it soon! <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I love German Chocolate Bars! They are my favorite. Don't feel guilty, it is a once in a while thing. <|endoftext|>
I really do feel bad for you. I hope that you find the courage to tell the truth in the future. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope he feels better soon! I'm sure you are keeping him very hydrated and keeping him as comfortable as possible. <|endoftext|>
I am sure he will. Funny movies always make me feel better. What is your favorite? <|endoftext|>
That's so cool! What kind of competitions did you win? Were you the lead dancer? <|endoftext|>
You should reach out to them! 8 years is a long time to hold onto a friend! <|endoftext|>
That's cool! I've never actually watched golf. But I do play a lot of golf <|endoftext|>
I just don't know if I have the patience for it, I get so frustrated with it after a while <|endoftext|>
I hate to hear that. That's so mean of that person to say that to her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, was the daddy angry with her? Hopefully he wasn't scarred for life! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you find the culprit? I hope you didn't have to pay anyone to clean it up! <|endoftext|>
No way! My cats do the same thing! I love cats, but I'm allergic to them. You know what they say about allergies. <|endoftext|>
I know right? It makes me want to adopt all the animals in the shelter! <|endoftext|>
I agree with you. They need to be punished for their actions. I hope they get their life together. <|endoftext|>
What was it?  Did you call the police or just leave it begging for help? <|endoftext|>
That is a relief! I hope you didn't have to call the po-po. <|endoftext|>
It's always a good thing to have a friend that will help you in a time of need. <|endoftext|>
Yea, as long as you can pay it back, I don't see why you shouldn't. I would hate for you to have to take out a loan again in the future. <|endoftext|>
I would have been too! I can't stand when people do that. It's like, don't you know you don't do that! <|endoftext|>
Dinners are the best. I am so glad he was able to enjoy himself and share it with you. <|endoftext|>
I have seen a few. I always think they are bugs until I get up and move. <|endoftext|>
It could be a number of things, I suppose. But I would be weary of any kind of critter, even if they're more afraid of you. Maybe you should invest in some bug spray. <|endoftext|>
Nosy can be annoying when they don't take the hint. I have a friend like that. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say to that. I hope you can trust her again. <|endoftext|>
I am sure he is in a better place. Have you thought about getting a new pet? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope everything is okay! Did you find out what was wrong with him? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that, but I'm sure it's for the best. <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. I'm glad to hear you got to talk to her again. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is horrible. I am sorry to hear that, I hope you get it cleaned up. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry that happened to you but I am glad you are getting money out of it. <|endoftext|>
Are you driving in the snow? Good thing you have a kit to help you out in the future. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's terrible! I hope you were able to get it fixed quickly! <|endoftext|>
What are you getting your degree in?  And congratulations on being able to do that! <|endoftext|>
I bet it is! That is a long time to be working on a project. I am sure you deserve it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I bet that was scary! I've never been on a roller coaster. Are you scared of them? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I get scared of heights too. I always have to rely on someone to bring me up. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun but not at the same time. I would have been bored out of town. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a new hobby to occupy your time. <|endoftext|>
I know, it's even worse when it happens to people you know and are close to. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. They are loyal and devoted dogs. You should be proud of their loyalty. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. I hope you were able to get on the ship at least. <|endoftext|>
Maybe I should go then. I've never had the guts to go on a rollercoaster. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. Do you know what the reason she was diagnosed with? <|endoftext|>
I thought A-- students were the ones with the highest GPAs? I hope she does well in eighth grade. <|endoftext|>
I hate the cold.  Did you put on a rain coat?  Hope it got better for you. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. It's been raining a lot here, too, so I know how that feels. <|endoftext|>
I don't think I have ever seen a horror movie. I hate being scared so much. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's so scary! I'm glad you didn't get into an accident. <|endoftext|>
Ah, the game of thrones. Good luck, friend! I'm sure you'll be fine. <|endoftext|>
Yeah it's insane what they cover. I had a coworker who was insured and was out for a week and came back to life. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Maybe you should have a piece of cake by yourself next cake day, to cheer yourself up. <|endoftext|>
Tell me about it. I have a hard time staying disciplined sometimes with how much I eat. <|endoftext|>
I know how that feels. I get them sometimes when I'm stressed. Are you seeing a doctor about it? <|endoftext|>
Well that's a relief! I'm glad you didn't get stressed over it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you find him/her. I know how careless it can be losing a pet can be. <|endoftext|>
I hope you find him soon. I would be searching all night if i was you. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I was ghosted by a friend the other day. It sucks. <|endoftext|>
That's still hard. Do you have any other friends that you can talk to about it? <|endoftext|>
That is so nice. I wish someone would do that for me. I could really use a cup of coffee right now. <|endoftext|>
That is a very good point! Maybe you can think of a way to help them out next time you see them. <|endoftext|>
How exciting! Are you in college too, or will he be attending post secondary? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I'm sure you are a very proud parent. I hope he has a great career ahead of him! <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That is the worst!  Hopefully the new place makes up for it! <|endoftext|>
That is really gross. I hope you didn't have to pay for the burger either. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you didn't get hurt! Did you laugh it off or were you so embarrassed? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm glad you didn't get burned, but I'm sure you were very embarrassed! <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. I used to love watching scary movies when I was a kid. Now that I'm an adult, I don't find them as scary. <|endoftext|>
OMG.  That sounds like something I would do too.  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That sucks. I hate when dogs bark during the day. It is so inconsiderate. <|endoftext|>
I can imagine.  I live near a lot of people too and they don't seem to know how to use their cars. <|endoftext|>
What kind of pizza was it? I'm about to order some myself. I like my pizza topped with all kinds of stuff. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great plan! Why do you think you haven't eaten so healthy in the past? <|endoftext|>
Did you get a bonus for your job or did you have to worry about the expenses? <|endoftext|>
That's great. Procrastination is the worst habit I've ever picked up. I need to start doing that as well. <|endoftext|>
Are you nervous? I bet it will be fun, but also a lot of stressful at the same time? <|endoftext|>
That's got to be exciting!  You'll have to get used to dealing with kids, but I'm sure you'll do great! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you coping with that? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. Kids do need a lot of attention. Maybe you guys can hang out outside of school. <|endoftext|>
It really does. Especially when you have to use it to buy things like groceries and stuff. I hate that so much. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I hope you can get it all sorted out, and maybe they're not going to be so greedy. <|endoftext|>
That is great news! Congratulations to your sisters! What will she be doing at her new billet? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome. I wish I had more time to work on things like that. Maybe I should have taken an accounting class. <|endoftext|>
You must have a very close friend. That is very nice of you to help her out. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Well, I am sure she will forgive you. It was a honest mistake. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is new. I bet you are nervous, but I am sure he will do great! <|endoftext|>
Sometimes that happens when you get older. My parents went through that when I was young. It will get better though. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, you're right. It's gonna be hard, but it'll be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
I bet he will be a great athlete. Good for you being his role model. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling! I got an NES classic for Christmas one year and I was ecstatic the whole time. <|endoftext|>
Probably! But I am sure you will look back fondly on it later in life. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. What is your major? Sometimes you just need a little help. <|endoftext|>
86? I barely passed physics 1 in high school. How did you do in physics? <|endoftext|>
Dang! That must have been a good day for you. Did you have any fun plans? <|endoftext|>
That's when I have to get up and do something! I need to be ready for her to go to bed! <|endoftext|>
I will make sure to do that, thanks for the advice. I hate being without coffee! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds awful. I am so sorry that happened to you. I hope you didn't have to go to work sick. <|endoftext|>
What does that mean exactly? I'm not sure what you are talking about. Do you mean 4 hours? <|endoftext|>
I didn't know that! I had always wanted one but my wife didn't want one. Now she has one and I want one! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  You must be feeling really good about your life.  What makes you feel that way, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Peanuts are a great source of protein and I'm pretty sure they help you lose weight too! <|endoftext|>
Sometimes when I'm feeling happy I like to lay in bed and think about the good times I had when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
That is great to hear! I think its great to be content and happy with your life. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when I get a cold! I feel like I can't wait for it to go away. <|endoftext|>
I know, I would have been sick too. I am so sorry that happened to you, and I hope you never have to drink that again! <|endoftext|>
What kind of ice cream was it? I'm sorry you had to go through that, it must have been frustrating. <|endoftext|>
Awww well that's good that you didn't then. I'm glad it didn't turn out bad for you. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is pretty reckless. I hope she learns her lesson, and doesn't do it again. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that's awesome, but a little scary too. Is this your first child? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should talk to a friend or relative about it. I know it can be hard but they will be there for you if you need them. <|endoftext|>
Awww, that is awesome!  I love cats!  Did you go and get it? <|endoftext|>
That's good, at least you didn't hurt it. Hopefully it didn't take too much to get rid of. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do well if you've been studying that much.  It's normal to be a bit apprehensive before a big test though. <|endoftext|>
Oh you got this! I was in the same boat, but I ended up doing really well. I know it can be stressful though <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks. Did you ask her why she didn't pick up her stuff? <|endoftext|>
I understand. It's like that all the time. The only thing that helps is time. <|endoftext|>
I agree.  They are sworn to an oath and they should be held to that oath. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I hope you were able to stop on the side of the road! <|endoftext|>
I feel your pain. It is scary to be on a highway and not knowing what to do. <|endoftext|>
I was so mad at him, but I forgave him. It was an accident, and he did say he was going to pay me back, but he didn't. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Have you tried calling animal control or putting up flyers?  I hope you find it soon! <|endoftext|>
That is so scary. I hope you don't have to see any more of that. <|endoftext|>
Sibling rivalry is tough.  Maybe she got into it because she wanted to be close to you. <|endoftext|>
Younger siblings are so cute! I hope you two have a great time together when she gets older. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. It is always good to have a friend that you can rely on. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am glad that she is there for you during this tough time. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, I am so sorry to hear that. :( How long before you can get treated? <|endoftext|>
Well, I wish you the best of luck. I'm sure you'll be fine. Don't stress too much. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that must have been really scary. Do you live in a bad neighbourhood? <|endoftext|>
That's terrifying! I'm glad you're okay. I would have been so scared, too. <|endoftext|>
Oh, man! I can only imagine how that must have been for you. I hope it all went well and that he is okay! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I hope his life recovers from this. I know it's hard to lose someone you love. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, I'm so sorry to hear that. That really sucks. Have you had any tests? <|endoftext|>
I think if you really do want them, you will be able to make it. :) <|endoftext|>
Ah, I know what you mean. It's always fun playing video games, but it can get a bit repetitive after a while. <|endoftext|>
My favorite game of all time is definitely Super Smash Bros. Brawl. I played that game for hours on end with my friends. <|endoftext|>
How did it go? Did you get the job? :)  xD  xd <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Were you able to make it up to your friend? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! I couldn't imagine having to deal with that type of disease. I hope your coworkers are able to cure it. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you can make it up to him somehow. maybe buy him a gift of some sort <|endoftext|>
That sounds lonely.  Did you enjoy your movie alone?  I've done that before. <|endoftext|>
Ah, I've never been a big fan of dinosaurs. Was it at least decent? <|endoftext|>
That's annoying! Did you end up getting your money back at all? I would be so mad. <|endoftext|>
That is not good, you should talk to him and try to figure out what is causing it. <|endoftext|>
I haven't heard about that, could you tell me about it? What did they do? <|endoftext|>
Midterms? I haven't heard of that before. What's that mean, exactly? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I think I've done that before too.  Did you make it out ok? <|endoftext|>
That's good! Don't worry about it. You'll get the hang of it soon enough. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I'm so sorry to hear that. That's awful. Have you confronted her about it? <|endoftext|>
Well, you just have to trust that she won't do anything to hurt you anymore, even if she does. <|endoftext|>
That is a very admirable sentiment. Good on you for standing up for your family. <|endoftext|>
Did he come back with them? That's pretty cool you were able to help him out like that. <|endoftext|>
Dang!  That is unbelievable.  Well done to him.  What grade did he get, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. If it's any consolation, I think you'll do better next time. <|endoftext|>
That is so cool! How long have you had your dog? What did you teach him? <|endoftext|>
I'm not suprised. I'm from New York and I've heard the same thing. <|endoftext|>
Well, you must have been very pleased with yourself. You should be proud of yourself. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that sounds like a challenge! I'll need to prepare some food to take with me to the next battle. <|endoftext|>
That's good that he was there to help. I hope you're feeling better now! Drink lots of water and stay hydrated. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I hope you continue to feel better as time goes on. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know that must have been very painful. Was it a nice trip down memory lane? <|endoftext|>
I am sure she is in a better place. Looking down on you from the past is the best way to remember her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Is she still a puppy?  She may just have been ill. <|endoftext|>
that is not nice at all, did you do it in front of her? or do you think she will ever find out? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that sounds like he's going to be a great man. Good for him! <|endoftext|>
Ouch! Clay is such a hard thing to work with. I hope he doesn't get hurt! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible, I'm sorry to hear that. Will there be other chances available for you? <|endoftext|>
Well that's no good. You should probably not tolerate that kind of attitude at all. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  Cats are such nice pets.  You must be really sad. <|endoftext|>
I hope everything works out for you, that is a tough thing to go through.  Just know that it will get better. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm sure it's for the best. Do you want to get back together with him? <|endoftext|>
It's going to take some time. But you'll find someone new and be happy again. <|endoftext|>
Mmmm... I love pies! What kind of filling did you use in it? <|endoftext|>
That does sound really good. I'm not a big fan of the pit. Was the ice cream good? <|endoftext|>
Oooh, new to the style, huh? What kind of shoes did you get? <|endoftext|>
Or they could've stolen my favorite Yeezys.  I'd be so upset if that happened to me. <|endoftext|>
How warm was it? and how did it make you feel? I've always wanted to build a fire! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you are in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hate it when the power goes out!  What did you do while you were alone? <|endoftext|>
How small of a fire? I hope it wasn't a big one that got clogged. <|endoftext|>
oh why is that? are you scared of the hurricane? i hope you are ready for it <|endoftext|>
Yes they can be, but it was worth the risk. The hostel I was staying at was very clean. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Hopefully they have an app you can use to call someone to come get it back. <|endoftext|>
Dang, now I am even more worried about theft. People are so desperate these days. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. Stressing about money is the worst! What's going on that's making you so stressed? <|endoftext|>
Ouch! That's awful! I am so sorry to hear that. I am sure you were very upset. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. 3 weeks is a long time. Did you do anything fun to keep yourself occupied? <|endoftext|>
I played games on my Nintendo 64.  Those were the good old days. xbox live was the best. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things start looking better for you. Do you have anyone you can talk to about it? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you have a great rest of your day! Sleep well. <|endoftext|>
I hear you.  I have one like that too.  You can get it repaired, but it's not cheap. <|endoftext|>
I know right? Some people are just so childish and don't understand that you have to do what is right for you. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do great! Just relax and think of all the good times you'll have with your new hire! <|endoftext|>
I'll keep my fingers crossed that you get it, and I hope you like the new job! <|endoftext|>
How long did it take you to get the upholsterer? And how did it turn out? <|endoftext|>
I know right? I'm in a 3rd floor and it's just so disgusting. I think I'm going to buy a carpet cleaner to clean it up. <|endoftext|>
Juggling is a great talent to have! I'm sure she'll be a great parent! <|endoftext|>
I am sure she knows you love her anyway and I bet she feels the same way about you! :) <|endoftext|>
I wish you luck in your new apartment, hopefully you won't have to deal with the annoying neighbors. <|endoftext|>
I hope it works out for you. I would hate living in an apartment with horrible neighbors. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's a bold move! Did it turn out well, or were you a mess? <|endoftext|>
That is great to hear.  Enjoy the time with your kids while you can.  It goes by so fast! <|endoftext|>
Sometimes I do that too, it can really take me back to the good ol' days. <|endoftext|>
I hear you! Sometimes you just need a little "me" time to relax and recharge. <|endoftext|>
Those are the good old days. What do you miss most about those times? (other than the good times) <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you find them soon. Maybe they are still out there. <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's amazing. I wonder if they do that for you often? I would be so grateful if they did that for me. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that you are handicapped.  Thankfully he was able to help you though. <|endoftext|>
I love Nintendo. I use to play games like mario and stuff on nintendo 64. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you guys are able to communicate more often in the future. <|endoftext|>
It sounds like a great time. I'm not a big wine drinker, but I enjoy a good cheeseburger. <|endoftext|>
I love reading and watching documentaries. I find both to be very therapeutic. <|endoftext|>
Dang, did you ask her to send you the video?  Maybe she didn't mean to do it. <|endoftext|>
I hope you continue to enjoy your new home and that it doesn't get too busy! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope you don't have to move ever again. Planes are scary! <|endoftext|>
Those are the best kinds of memories. I hope you have a great time at the wedding! <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet of you to do! What kind of dog do you have? Is he small or big? <|endoftext|>
That is so cute. Frenchies are known to be very loving dogs. I hope you have many more years of love with him. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  What happened?  Did you laugh it off or were you so shocked you didn't know what to do? <|endoftext|>
I hope you didn't get too mad at them for it. It was an accident after all! <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. It's a tough situation. Do you have any charities that you like to support? <|endoftext|>
That's a great idea! What charity do you usually donate too? I'll have to keep that in mind next time I donate. <|endoftext|>
Wow! How often do you play the lottery? And how many tickets did you buy? <|endoftext|>
Well congratulations! That is a lot of money to win. I hope you spend it on something good for yourself. <|endoftext|>
Saving is a good idea! Use it as motivation to save more money. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it at least turned out well for you. <|endoftext|>
Confidence is the golden key to success.  It's a good thing you have that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, did you have any luck trying to get the cat out of the house? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'd be mad too. Hopefully he learns that that's not the place to do that. <|endoftext|>
well did you? the most i ever won was like 20 bux hahah <|endoftext|>
Hey that's $25 bucks still!  I would take that in a heartbeat! <|endoftext|>
It is? I will have to keep that in mind the next time I go to the store! <|endoftext|>
That is a scary thing to happen, but I am sure it was an awesome experience. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, I hope everything is okay! Why is it so hard? <|endoftext|>
Hope they are ok. Hospitals can be a scary place to be when you don't know what is going on. <|endoftext|>
Wow, where are you going? Home is where ever you want to go. I hope you have a safe trip and a good time! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I have never been there, but I hope one day to. <|endoftext|>
I would be too! That is a great accomplishment! What did they major in? <|endoftext|>
I couldn't agree more. I think it's important for anyone to go if they want to. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun! I hope you have a good time and don't get too bitten by mosquitoes. <|endoftext|>
OMG. I would have been so mad. How did you handle the situation with the dog? <|endoftext|>
Evil is a very interesting way to describe someone. Did he succeed at getting toys? <|endoftext|>
Camping is great! Has she been doing it a long time or is she a beginner? <|endoftext|>
Camping is so much fun! It's a shame that the first time you went it didn't go so well. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What game will you be playing? I hope you do too, so you can win! <|endoftext|>
I love playing video games. I can't wait for the newest Call of Duty game! <|endoftext|>
Skydiving is so much fun. I think you should feel proud that your students were able to accomplish what they wanted to do. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Have you gone before? I would be so scared to do that. I like the idea though <|endoftext|>
That's fantastic!  You must be very proud of yourself and your hard work. <|endoftext|>
Well I hope you have a great time on the dancefloor. I know you will! <|endoftext|>
That sucks. Are there any other public roads you could use to get around? I know how you feel though. I get upset when my car is in the middle of nowhere, or when it's raining. <|endoftext|>
That would be so annoying. I can't stand people who do that and not paying attention. <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I hope you win too! I love to buy things off of eBay! <|endoftext|>
What is the name of the comic? I might be able to find it on eBay. <|endoftext|>
That would scare the heck out of me!  I don't like dogs off leash. <|endoftext|>
That is scary! I am glad you are okay! Some dogs can be very destructive. <|endoftext|>
I know right! It's amazing how far we have come in just a few years! <|endoftext|>
I know right! It's crazy how technology has evolved from the 1990s. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! How were you not able to fit it all in your stomach without it exploding? <|endoftext|>
Hahaha, you're so funny. I hope you have a great rest of your day. <|endoftext|>
That's very kind of you to help them out. I'm sure they appreciate it a lot. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, as long as you can pay the bills and get by, I guess you can't complain. <|endoftext|>
I hate horror movies too.  What was it?  Was it good?  I don't watch them late at night. <|endoftext|>
I haven't heard of that but I will look it up. Sounds like a fun challenge! <|endoftext|>
I love surprises like that! What's your favorite place so far that you've visited? <|endoftext|>
organic is great! my husband is a certified organic farmer and it makes us both very happy. <|endoftext|>
That is disgusting! I don't blame you, I wouldn't want to eat again either. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I've had that feeling before. It's no fun, but it's good to know that at least you're not alone! <|endoftext|>
I really hate that too. Have you ever noticed that some people don't pick up after their kids? <|endoftext|>
I wish I could afford a new car like that! I'm stuck with an old clunker for now. <|endoftext|>
I know! It is so annoying. They should have been more considerate of the other person's time. <|endoftext|>
I care about those type of things a lot. I don't know why people are so cruel. <|endoftext|>
Oh god, you must have been terrified. Did you do anything to try and get it out of your yard? <|endoftext|>
Yes, there are some cruel people in the world. It's good it wasn't suffering, that's for sure. <|endoftext|>
What kind of food did you pick up at the last place?  What was holding you back? <|endoftext|>
I hope you end up liking it! If you think you'll hate it, you can always try something else <|endoftext|>
Indian food is the best. I can't get enough of it. Now I want some! <|endoftext|>
I love indian food! I am so sorry you missed it, but I am sure you had a great time while you were there. <|endoftext|>
What are you going to do to prepare for the jump?  Are you shooting for a jump? <|endoftext|>
That would be awesome!  I really hope you win.  What is the prize? <|endoftext|>
That's very annoying. I can't stand people who are so inconsiderate of others. <|endoftext|>
It might be time to call the noise control unit. They should be able to help you get sleep. <|endoftext|>
Seriously! If you're not going to the bar, why go home and ruin your night? <|endoftext|>
That might be time to lay down the law and ground him - or at least tell him. <|endoftext|>
That is very true, I just need to make sure I don't spend too much time thinking about it, I have a lot of free time. <|endoftext|>
Omg. I would be so excited. Are you bringing anyone with you. I love her. <|endoftext|>
I am sure she will he is a great singer! Have fun at the concert. <|endoftext|>
That is great news! Did they give you a good news letter as to how much they wanted to give you? <|endoftext|>
You'll find your niche in the new place, I'm sure. It's just a matter of time. <|endoftext|>
No, I don't but I hope to move soon. I just don't know anyone here. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, that is so gross! I would have been so freaked out! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that sounds awful! I really hope you didn't have to clean it up! <|endoftext|>
That's not too bad.  I used to hate long drives.  They're so boring. <|endoftext|>
That's creative! I like the way you think. Maybe I will do that to scare my dog away when he finds me. <|endoftext|>
Computers are ambitious. Did you have to save up for a while to get one? <|endoftext|>
That sounds great! I hope you post a lot of pictures of it so I can see it! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I wish we had a company that did that for us. Whatrocery store do you get it from? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Shopping can be a lot of fun if you have the right group of friends. <|endoftext|>
I've not seen that in a long time, I used to watch it all the time. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I've never read it so I can't judge you for that. I do love a good love story though! <|endoftext|>
That is amazing.  I bet you are so proud.  Does he want to be a musician when he is older? <|endoftext|>
months is not such a long time, i am sure he was very happy when he got there <|endoftext|>
I love the park! Did you have a nice time there? Did you take your dog? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that stinks. I hope your toe is feeling better now. I hate when that happens. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's annoying. Why didn't he just ask you to help him clean it up? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I hope you find the culprit and you get your stuff back. <|endoftext|>
What was it?  Did you find out what it was?  Was it a cat? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that is so gross! I'm glad it wasn't something really gross like a rat! <|endoftext|>
That is so cool! I have never been out of the country. Did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
Those are some nice places to visit. I hope you get to go back some day. <|endoftext|>
That's such a surprise! I wish my house was that clean when I took a vacation. <|endoftext|>
How many people are in your family? I have 3 brothers and we are a big family. <|endoftext|>
I hope so, because if not, I am doomed to a ferrari. <|endoftext|>
I have never done that before, did you have a good time? zippinglining sounds like so much fun. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, those are always a pain. But at least you found out now and didn't wait for it to get cancelled. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's no good. Did you at least go to the doctor to get it checked out? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I hope it gets fixed soon and you can still enjoy your evening! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. :( Have you had your dog a long time? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that she gets better and you are there to help her as much as possible. <|endoftext|>
That is a scary thing to go through, I am so glad you got through it. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through that. But, it sounds like you did it the right way. <|endoftext|>
Are you moving to a better home?  A better job?  Your kids are going to be so excited! <|endoftext|>
California is a great place to raise a family, I wish I could have moved there when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
That is a real problem. I don't understand why people don't take care of their mess. <|endoftext|>
I usually end up having to go the extra mile to get them back, but it is a hassle to deal with. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. That can be very lonely. Maybe you can get out and meet some new people? <|endoftext|>
Animals are great companions. Dogs are my favorite, but I get what you mean. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you should have been more attentive? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I could find some cards like that! I bet they were really valuable. <|endoftext|>
That won't be fun, but I am sure you will be able to make it work. <|endoftext|>
boarding is so cruel. I hope you find a good home for your fur baby. <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I'm sure something will come up for you, I know it's hard now but it can happen for a reason. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure something good is right around the corner! <|endoftext|>
I love the fair! Have you won any tickets before or is this your first time? If so, I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
mustangs are sweet. i hope you win too. i know for a fact that i would win <|endoftext|>
That is scary, do you think you are going to call the police or just let it go? <|endoftext|>
That sucks.  You should at least give it a try to see if you like it or not.  Could be you hate it and never want to leave! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great time! Did you get to see any cool stars?    By the way, what does that mean? I don't know what "gaze" means. <|endoftext|>
I get that, it can be overwhelming, what did you do to try and pull yourself out of it? <|endoftext|>
Oh that is awesome!  Did you have a great time?  And how old are they? <|endoftext|>
Man, I am sorry to hear that. I hope you get to video chat with them soon. <|endoftext|>
Dang, did you win the lottery or something? I don't know about you, but that would be a dream come true for me. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I would have freaked! Were you able to get new shoes? <|endoftext|>
Dang!  You must be excited and nervous at the same time!  Hope it goes well! <|endoftext|>
Good luck! How long do you think it will take you to complete the marathons? <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park! Have you had time to prepare? <|endoftext|>
Studying can help you with that. I'm sure you'll be fine! Good luck! <|endoftext|>
Oh my god! I hope you didn't have any money inside. Did you get it back? <|endoftext|>
That is good, there are some sketchy people in the world so it is good to be safe. <|endoftext|>
Really? That is something to brag about. I can't do that even if I try really hard. <|endoftext|>
Well, it's good that you have that memory! Maybe you should consider entering a spelling bee! <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! Are you doing research on this one? I wouldn't be able to stop looking at them. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. I hope you can learn to drive soon so you don't have to be on the phone while driving. <|endoftext|>
Did you have any idea who it might have been? Maybe they were just looking for something to steal. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I hope you find out who did it and give them an earful. <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary. I hope he is okay now! I would be so mad at him. <|endoftext|>
I can only imagine how painful that must have been. I feel sorry for the parents having to deal with that. <|endoftext|>
Deadliftting is one of my favorite things to do.  How much did he bench? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's impressive. I wonder if he has a machine, or just a lot of free weights. <|endoftext|>
I love cats!  I bet you had a great time there with no one around to bother you. <|endoftext|>
That is very sweet. I am glad you had such a fun time. I love kitties! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you are okay! Do you have to go to the doctor to get it checked out? <|endoftext|>
What did you do? Did you shoo it away or make your husband get it out of the house? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I have a cat that does that too sometimes. Did you clean it up? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that really stinks. I guess you won't be getting a new door for a while. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. How long did you have the cat for? I hope it had a good life. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can at least cherish the memories you had with her. <|endoftext|>
runnning through your head is one of my favorite past times, i used to do it all the time when i was younger <|endoftext|>
Ahh, I used to love listening to emo music in high school and college. I haven't listened to it in a while. <|endoftext|>
I would have been so scared! I hope nothing happened. Did you make it out okay? <|endoftext|>
Animals can be very trusting. I'm glad she was able to take care of it safely. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  What did you do with it?  Did you try to save it? <|endoftext|>
I hope it's not too costly to fix. I once stepped on a bird, and it wasn't even that big of a deal, but I still hate when it happens. <|endoftext|>
Dang, you must be anxious waiting for them to come. I hope they're not going to be upset when you tell them they're coming. <|endoftext|>
That roast sounds delicious! Roasts are one of my favorite things to cook. <|endoftext|>
That's great! Did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected? <|endoftext|>
That is something to be excited about!  Where are you going to go for your vacation? <|endoftext|>
What is it about? Are you worried about not doing enough work or not being able to finish what you have to? <|endoftext|>
That's really frustrating. Maybe you should try distracting yourself with something else, like Netflix or something. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should get yourself a new roomate.  You don't want to be lonely anymore, right? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should get a dog.  They are good for socializing and they don't need to be alone all the time. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she gets better. Is she a puppy or is she an older dog? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope she didn't suffer too much. I'll keep her in my thoughts. <|endoftext|>
Oh good luck with that. I hope it all works out well for you guys. :) <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! Where are you going to go on the crusise? > <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I hope you guys have a great time at the wedding! <|endoftext|>
It's nice to have roommates you can rely on.  What did he make for you? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you had such a great time and that he was happy. You should definitely surprise him next time! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope it's not as bad as some of those storms! Have you been watching the weather? <|endoftext|>
Its good to be prepared. I should do that as well. I hope its not going to be too bad for us. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a nice surprise. You must have been happy and shocked at the same time. <|endoftext|>
What kind of gear was it? Was it expensive gear? I hope you didn't have to pay too much for it. <|endoftext|>
Mac and cheese is the best! My mom used to make it for us a lot when I was a kid. What kind did you make? <|endoftext|>
I'm not a big fan of hot sauces on my food, but I'll take your word for it. <|endoftext|>
Are you going to wear them on the beach this weekend? I hope you have a great time. <|endoftext|>
It never hurts to try, worst case scenario, you can buy a bunch of tshirts <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Is it a young dog or an older one? Maybe you should take him to the vet to get it checked out <|endoftext|>
I hope it works out well for you all. I'm sure she'll learn quickly that what she's doing is wrong. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great! I bet you felt really proud of yourself. What kind of work do you do? <|endoftext|>
Yes, long movements can be tough. It is best to find a place that you like and then stay there for a good amount of time. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun! I love water parks. What kind of water park is it? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I'm sure they'll love it as much as the adults. <|endoftext|>
I love cats, but I'm allergic to them so we can't have one. <|endoftext|>
I am glad she is away and you are able to spend some time with her watching youtube and playing with her. <|endoftext|>
What a nice gesture! Did you play with it a lot when you were a child? <|endoftext|>
Aww that's awesome, I have a photo album and every time I look at it I smile. <|endoftext|>
That is so exciting! I hope to one day get married as well. Congratulations! <|endoftext|>
Awww, that's so sweet.  Congratulations on your marriage!  I hope you have many more happy years together.  :) <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Is it a career kind of thing? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see. Well, I'm sure he'll be gone before you know it! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I love my pets so much. <|endoftext|>
How long did you have your cat for? Mine used to roam the neighborhood a lot and one day he didn't come back at all. I thought I was going to lose him forever. <|endoftext|>
Wow, congratulations to her! You must be so proud. How old is she? <|endoftext|>
It sounds like she has a bright future ahead of her. I'm sure she will be very successful. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How did that happen? I hope you weren't hurt! Were you okay? <|endoftext|>
Phew! That was a close call. Did everything go as expected? Did you get it done? <|endoftext|>
Ew, I hate that. Flies are so annoying. Did you manage to get rid of it? <|endoftext|>
That's really gross, but funny at the same time. I hope you got a good night's rest! <|endoftext|>
That is super gross! I hope she didn't have to go to the vet. <|endoftext|>
That's a relief! I'm sure it was nothing too bad. I hope she doesn't do it again. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you are going to do great! Just relax and let everything fall into place. <|endoftext|>
talk about impressive, i wish i could order food online at my house, instead of having to drive to the local store. <|endoftext|>
That's a bummer, but I'm sure it's happened to her before. Hopefully she doesn't do it too often. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I hope you can get that fixed because that's really not good for her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That must have been embarrassing. Did you get it out of your shoe? <|endoftext|>
empathy is a good thing to have but sometimes you have to be a little tough as well <|endoftext|>
Was it any good?  I hope it was at least good enough to satisfy your cravings. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That's the worst!  Did you send it back?  Normally they will fix it! <|endoftext|>
Oh no that sounds like a nightmare. I've never been out of the country but I've always wanted to. <|endoftext|>
Did you use a guide or did you try to figure it out on your own? I'm glad you made it there! <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that must have been very shocking. What kind of race was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Well, at least you realized that it's not for you now. I hope you didn't get too many weird stares! <|endoftext|>
How did that go? Sleeping with a girl is hard work. I do not do it well at all. <|endoftext|>
That's no fun. I hope you didn't miss out on too much good food while you were away. <|endoftext|>
What did you have for dinner? I bet it was delicious. Dinner and family time is the best! <|endoftext|>
It's weird how that kind of thing can just happen out of nowhere, and you don't even realize it at the time. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that is not good.  Did you call the police and have them do a wellness check? <|endoftext|>
What did they tell you? I hope you didnt have to call the police in order to get your stuff back. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Were you able to get your dog a new one before he started eating it? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad she's ok! I hate it when my food makes me sick, it's the worst. <|endoftext|>
Eww, I have a brother like that too. Did you ask him to turn it down? <|endoftext|>
That's all you can ask for, really. I hope he was able to help you, though. <|endoftext|>
What did you do to prevent her from trying to eat the poop? I bet you were very frustrated with her. <|endoftext|>
Will you be able to enjoy the rest of your vacation without your mom being mad at her? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! You must have felt terrible. Did they say if they had seen you use it? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I'm sorry to hear that! Hopefully you can get another goldfish soon. <|endoftext|>
Ooh, that's sweet of him. What did you get? Was it something you had been eyeing for awhile, or was it just out of the blue? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you got it worked out, those are the kind of people you need to watch out for <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, do you plan on moving to a different city soon? <|endoftext|>
Out of state would probably be a nice change of scenery, I'll give you that! <|endoftext|>
Perfect is such a great word to use, I'm glad you use it. I'm sure you're a great baker as well! <|endoftext|>
I've been single for a few years now. It used to be that I would go out and try to meet new people, but that was a while back. Maybe I'll get back into it. <|endoftext|>
How close are you to being done? That's great that you have a house to close on! <|endoftext|>
I am sure it has.  That is very nice of your parents to help you out. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's kind of a sucky situation. I hope she pays you back! <|endoftext|>
Maybe try and reach out to her again? Im sure if you do, you will hear from her again. <|endoftext|>
Don't feel too bad, we've all done stupid things.  I'm sure you won't do it again. <|endoftext|>
How did you do that? I hope you didn't get in too much trouble! <|endoftext|>
I have never been on a rollercoaster. I am too scared of heights. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Maybe you could give it another shot and see if you like it then? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is like losing a family member. <|endoftext|>
I had a brain issue that got worse and then my organs started shutting down. <|endoftext|>
It's good to care about things like that. It keeps things interesting, at least. I care about that kind of stuff a lot. <|endoftext|>
You and me both, friend. I hope things work out for you in the future, though. <|endoftext|>
I know right <3 It's a shame we don't get to go back in time sometimes. <|endoftext|>
I wish I had a large family like that.  Just me and my husband.  Maybe one day! <|endoftext|>
No, I don't really watch Youtube. Why, did I miss something good? <|endoftext|>
I like the cooking shows. I am a good cook and I like to see the food preparation. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you have a slice before you went to sleep or was that too late? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope you were able to save some of it at least. <|endoftext|>
Eww. Lol. I hate when my wife cooks. I want to be a butcher, but I don't think I have the patience. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I would be too. Hopefully it didn't take long before it left your area. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I could look at some of my old photos from my youth. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I could go back in time and be a kid again. Being an adult is so much harder. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's hard to have faith when you are starting out. I will keep my fingers crossed for you. <|endoftext|>
That is a good way to look at it, I need to try and be more positive, thank you! <|endoftext|>
That is sad. Do you think they will be able to keep it going and still be needed for demolishing? <|endoftext|>
That's a real bummer.  I hope you can find something suitable for you soon. <|endoftext|>
off? did you hurt yourself? what did you do? are you feeling okay? i hope you are okay <|endoftext|>
Nothing to be embarassed about. It happens to the best of us. I once peed my pants at a wedding I was laughing so hard. <|endoftext|>
Hey! Yes, I used to play a lot of video games when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
I am too, can't wait to roam the wastes and find some cool weapons. <|endoftext|>
It is. I always try to be as good of a friend as they are to me. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. Just remember though, it is okay to feel that way sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Good to hear that, You must have studied hard. My year is good so far, exams can be really stressful. <|endoftext|>
That is a good outlook to have! It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders. <|endoftext|>
It's been pretty good! I got to work from home today, so that was nice. How about you? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I'm sure you earned it, and I hope you enjoy your new billet! <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I hate it when that happens. Did you get stitches? <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. I hope you're able to work it out with them, though. <|endoftext|>
I sure do! Super Mario Bros. was my favorite game when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
I will try it out this weekend. I will let my kids play with it like I did when I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
I'm doing pretty good.  I'm glad to hear things are going well for you. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, we're going to have to work a lot harder, but I'm optimistic. <|endoftext|>
Did you give her a copy? Maybe she could have asked you for a key but you didn't have it. <|endoftext|>
Dang. Well, if she's that good a friend, I'm sure she won't be mad at you for it. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I love Chinese food! Did she forget to make it or did she forget? <|endoftext|>
What kind of sandwich was it? I hate when that happens, I always want something good and then it's not there <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Is your dog okay?  Did it take anything to clean it up? <|endoftext|>
Eww, that's good it didn't turn into a big mess, but at least you didn't have to clean it up. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  How are you holding up? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope he was able to come to pick you up. That must have been really tough. <|endoftext|>
That does sound scary! How did you end up visiting it? Did you find it interesting? <|endoftext|>
Hey, at least you conquer your fear and went to that awesome concert! <|endoftext|>
How did it go? Did you get the job? :)   I had 2 interviews today and I am hopeful as well. <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. I'm sure you did a great job. Anxiety is a terrible thing to have. <|endoftext|>
Chocolate lover, hu/ What's your favorite kind? I'm a Snickers man myself. <|endoftext|>
I agree, but I guess some people are like that, and I am not one of those people! <|endoftext|>
Did you go with a group or on your own?  I would be so scared to do that. <|endoftext|>
Did you have to use a ladder or a plane? I'm glad you were able to overcome your fear. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice! I wish I had kids so I could practice being a good parent. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. It's like the schools are trying to protect all of us, but at the end of the day all we can do is teach and hope for a better future. <|endoftext|>
I know it takes a lot of time, I don't really have much time for them anymore but I used to play them a lot when I was younger. <|endoftext|>
Wow thats a long time to play a game. I dont think i would last that long. <|endoftext|>
Why did you have to dec line? Is she still looking for you or was she just wanting to talk to you? <|endoftext|>
Dang! Maybe I should try one of those out too. I've never been to one! <|endoftext|>
Family reunions can be so much fun! Did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
Sorry for the delay. I had a technical difficulty. I'm glad you enjoyed it so much! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. Did you sell it because you needed to buy dairy? I'm lactose intolerant so I feel for you. <|endoftext|>
Well that's a good reason to keep holding on to it. Maybe you can sell it on Craigslist or something. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's a coincidence. I'm a preschool teacher and my daughter just started 5th grade. <|endoftext|>
I know right. They grow up so fast. Next thing you know she'll have a job and a car. <|endoftext|>
Did he buy any? I hope you didn't have any money lending it to him! <|endoftext|>
It's always nice to have a friend you can trust that will pay you back. I hope you get paid back as well! <|endoftext|>
Did you go? It would have been so exciting! Birthdays are amazing and should be enjoyed no matter what. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, but what would you do if you were immortal and lived for 100,000 years? <|endoftext|>
Dang! I would have been so embarrassed! Did you dry it off or put a towel on it? <|endoftext|>
On no! Did you hurt yourself?  On the bright side you can always take it again tomorrow <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! That is horrible. I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you can find the culprit. <|endoftext|>
That's a good thing you had insurance, I'm glad you didn't have to pay for the repairs. <|endoftext|>
Do you have any lasting memories of the funeral that you would like to talk about? <|endoftext|>
That was very nice of you. You are a good person. :) Don't worry about it. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. Do you think you'll be able to keep it going? 12 years is a long time to work at a place like that. <|endoftext|>
Will you be working more than 40 hours a week when you are done?  I hope so, so that you can have time for all the fun things you want to do. <|endoftext|>
I bet it is! I would be so scared to do that though. I'm glad you are brave enough to do it! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you get to the airport at least? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that was a close call. I'm glad you didn't have to walk far! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun. I wish I could have a buffet like that. <|endoftext|>
Why? Naps are awesome! Why did you have to take a nap? Was it because you didn't want to go to work? <|endoftext|>
That must have been nice. Did you remember any of the places you went to? Did you feel nostalgic? <|endoftext|>
Me too! It's why I try to stay productive as much as possible. No matter how old I get, I'll always want to be a kid again. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! That is so sad! I am so sorry for your loss. How are you holding up? <|endoftext|>
I hope you are doing better now. I have lost many people and it is an awful thing to go through. <|endoftext|>
Birthdays are supposed to be a day of happiness and moment. What did she sing? <|endoftext|>
No problem! Enjoy the sunshine while you can! It's going to be so bright out soon. <|endoftext|>
Marriage is a scary thing. I am glad you found someone that matches up with you. <|endoftext|>
Exactly. My husband and I got married after only having been together a year. We still feel the same way about it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Do you have any leads on where it may have been stolen from? Did you file a report? <|endoftext|>
What kind of restaurant was it? I hope it wasn't too expensive.   [And thankfully there are still some good people in the world. <|endoftext|>
That's really awesome! Did you get any food for yourself or were you able to get some things for the kids? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I was there with you. That sounds like a really great time. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet it feels really good to be in a good place financially! <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear, it is always nice to be thankful for what you have. <|endoftext|>
I love when my girlfriend cooks for me, I am so thankful to have her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's awful. Did you have to get it towed to a shop? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's awful, sorry to hear that. I hope you can get it fixed soon! <|endoftext|>
I don't blame you! I hope you can find a reasonable solution so you don't have to worry about it again. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you get hurt badly? I hope you didn't have to go to the hospital! <|endoftext|>
Well, you know what they say about pride...if you can't get it back, it's time to start over. <|endoftext|>
They're lucky they didn't hurt you, and I hope they learned their lesson. Alcohol is a very serious thing. <|endoftext|>
I am the same way. I have to order things all the time because I have so many things to order. <|endoftext|>
I am the same way. I check my email at least twice a day! I check the email once or twice a week. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am sure she is in a better place now looking down on you. <|endoftext|>
I am sure she had the best life. Dogs are mans best friend after all. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I hope you have a safe trip. What lake are you going to? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun. I hope you have a good time.  Drink a few beers and relax. <|endoftext|>
I wish I had that!  I'm working hard to get a good job and hopefully won't have to work ever again one day. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you all, you sound like a good person. <|endoftext|>
Maybe one day you will have enough to do what you want. Until then enjoy the little things in life. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling, it sucks when you have to wait for the next project. What was the project about? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you got it done in time. I'm sure they were very thankful for your help. <|endoftext|>
Well that's a good attitude to have! I'm sure you will do great on your next interview! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a shortage of doctors that can help you? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you have some good doctors to go with you.  It can be hard to find a good doctor these days. <|endoftext|>
That's not so bad. Everyone cheats on their diet from time to time. I would just pick up where you left off. <|endoftext|>
That's happened to me before and it is so frustrating! I'm sorry that happened to you! <|endoftext|>
I bet you will do fine, just stay confident! What grade do you want to teach? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do fine, don't worry. Are you in your senior year? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that! You can always make it up to your friend next time. <|endoftext|>
That's good! Always nice to have a good memory to remember the good times with. :) <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear, it is always nice to have someone that is there for you no matter what. <|endoftext|>
Love is a great thing for all to see and hear. I am glad you have that in your life. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's always hard to say goodbye to a loved pet. <|endoftext|>
I can only imagine.  My dog is 14 years old.  She's my constant companion.  I wouldn't be able to live without her. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's too bad. What were the pros and cons of getting the other one? <|endoftext|>
Oh, don't worry. It will get better. As long as you have a reliable mode of transportation, everything will work out. <|endoftext|>
That is a great thing to have in a relationship with someone that is there for you always. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet.  It's always nice to have a friend you can count on. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! That must have been so gross! Did you have to clean it up? <|endoftext|>
Oh, you got the whole prize too! Lucky, you. Well, I'm glad you moved on from that situation. You could have ended up on the Internet otherwise. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I've never been there, but I've always wanted to go. I hope you have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great time. I hope you have lots of pictures so you can remember it. <|endoftext|>
What kind of knife is it? I hope it wasn't a serial killer knife. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I'm sorry to hear that he's going to move away. At least you have those memories to cherish. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you want to have kids in the future? <|endoftext|>
That's good. I'm glad you've been able to get back in touch with people. <|endoftext|>
I hope it went well for you and you get the job.  Is it something you really want? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm so happy for you. Sometimes all we can do is prepare the best we can and hope for the best! <|endoftext|>
Why did it make you feel down on yourself?  Did you not have a home to live in? <|endoftext|>
When my girlfriend and I went out to dinner the other night, she was very flirting with another guy. I thought it was weird. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun. You should skydive sometime if you ever get the chance! <|endoftext|>
That is good.  It sounds like you were able to work through it and come away from it stronger. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I know how you feel. I do that all the time. I am not sure if I will ever be able to watch them. <|endoftext|>
It's funny how we can look back and remember the good times. I bet it was a nice trip down memory lane. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How much did you end up spending on new socks? Did you try talking to the manager? <|endoftext|>
Oh, they didn't notice, but I do know that if you do it again, you better make sure that you wear pink! <|endoftext|>
That's so cool! Are you a ballerina or a hiphop dancer? <|endoftext|>
Dance off? I don't even know what that is, but I hope you win! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you were able to laugh it off or at least understand that it was an accident! <|endoftext|>
Dang! A little late for your bus ride. Well, I hope you have a good time! <|endoftext|>
What was the interview for? I hope you get the job! :) Interviews can be so nerve-wracking, but so much fun. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you have to do what you think is best. I hope it works out for you. <|endoftext|>
No problem at all! I wish you continued success with your business endeavors. <|endoftext|>
That is a great attitude to have!  I wish you and your family the best!  Take care and be safe! <|endoftext|>
Oh you must be quite prepared then. I wish you the best of luck. Do you feel prepared? <|endoftext|>
That's really frustrating. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Maybe you could park your car in the driveway? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you are not that bad. It just take some time to warm up to the slower pace. <|endoftext|>
Do you drink it everyday or do you have a special occasion where you have to drink it? <|endoftext|>
I know.  It's annoying.  I wish there was a way I could get rid of it. <|endoftext|>
Doesn't mean you can't do another today. Do what you have to do to get that pump. <|endoftext|>
What are you talking about? Did you eat pecans? I love pecan pie. <|endoftext|>
Ouch! I hope your toe is feeling better now. I know how it feels to be careless and not paying attention. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Have you thought about getting him a few toys that he can chase? <|endoftext|>
Chad, that's a unique and unique name. I have never heard of that before. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's kind of a pickle. I hope you can figure it out! <|endoftext|>
I would have done the same thing. Don't feel bad, it happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks.  Well I hope you find something else to eat.  Don't give up! <|endoftext|>
Cheesecake is amazing, and so is 20 dollars for a slice of that cake. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that! Maybe it needs to be fermented again in order to make it better? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's really impressive! I've been trying to get into better shape myself. What kind of program are you doing? <|endoftext|>
Well, I hope you have a great time at the butcher's!  I'm a vegetarian, so I don't know much about steak.  What cuts do you like? <|endoftext|>
Horror movies give me so much anxiety. I can't watch them late at night. <|endoftext|>
I will gladly do that. Just message me your address and I will send you the invite. <|endoftext|>
Good for you!  I know that nicotine is really bad for you, and I know it's hard to give up. <|endoftext|>
That's crazy! So everything went as expected? Everything okay?    (Not that it's too late, I hope. ;-) <|endoftext|>
Did you show your best friend who's boss?  Did he give you a high grade? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a real challenge! Did you eat anything that might have been in it? I know some people are afraid of that kind of thing. <|endoftext|>
I don't. I hate getting out of the house. I wish I didn't have to go to work. <|endoftext|>
I feel that one deep in my core, man. Paying the bills is important. I'm glad you do what you love to do. It's important to do that to feel good about yourself. <|endoftext|>
Why are you so proud of yourself? I would be if I could leave the gym! Did you have a good workout? <|endoftext|>
I wish I could do that. I injured my knee a few years ago and haven't been able to work out since. Maybe I should start again. <|endoftext|>
That's not good. What are you going to do? clean it up or did you have to wash the cat? <|endoftext|>
It's good that you apologized, do you think he will ever find out the truth? <|endoftext|>
I hope you are feeling better! That is very nice of him. I wish I had a roommate like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry that happened to you. I hope that you feel better soon. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel.  I have a photo album and every time I look at it I smile. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. It is good to work on yourself before you try dating. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know what you mean.  I don't like to be all sad all the time, but I do it from time to time.  What's your favorite thing to do when you're sad? <|endoftext|>
It really is like that sometimes. I hope that you can find a way to enjoy life still. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  What happened to the poor thing? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you can find some comfort in knowing that your loved ones are in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
I feel you on that one! I don't have a lot of money to spare either so I always have to cook! <|endoftext|>
Ah, well that's still good, even if it's just a little extra weight. It's hard to put that off, honestly <|endoftext|>
I saw that too! It was very inspiring. I wish we could go back to the way things were. <|endoftext|>
Keep spreading the word! Maybe you can donate food to a food pantry? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is great! Good for you adopting an abused puppy! Do you foster pets or have you adopted one from a shelter? <|endoftext|>
Oh thank goodness! I was worried about that. I'm glad they all made it. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I would have been so shocked! I hope you didn't get sick. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it wasn't something you were too embarrassed about! Dad's can be so funny like that. <|endoftext|>
Garlic is one of my favorite things in the world, so I understand how you feel. <|endoftext|>
Well, I'm glad it didn't make you sick. Did you end up eating it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope they aren't upset with you!  It happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
That is bad. You could have gotten sick. You should always wear your rainproof clothes. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you weren't too embarrassed? I've done things like that before too. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you won't, people have done worse things than you have already done. <|endoftext|>
Oh nice! I'm glad you were able to go and see it. I've never been to one of those myself. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am sure it hurt her feelings. Dont let it happen to you. <|endoftext|>
Oh, man. I hate when that happens. It's one of those situations where you'd almost rather not go at all. <|endoftext|>
Did you go to the dentist? He might be able to give you a free tooth <|endoftext|>
Dang, I bet there is nothing you can do about that. I would switch providers if I were you. <|endoftext|>
It is!  It has saved me in the past when I didn't have a car.  I am so glad I have it. <|endoftext|>
It is, but I wish I could sleep more hours.  I need to be up early for work in the morning. <|endoftext|>
Ah, that happens sometimes. Maybe you should go to the store and pick up a few more packs? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Did the dog make a full recovery? <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I'm glad you enjoyed your time with him, even if he wasn't alive. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I don't have to do anything, I'm pretty happy about it. I guess I shouldn't take it for granted. <|endoftext|>
I know right. I miss being so carefree and not having to worry about anything. <|endoftext|>
I know how that can be, an old trip down memory lane can really take you back to when you were a kid. <|endoftext|>
tell me about it.. i haven't even started saving yet! haha.. i'm excited and a bit sad at the same time. <|endoftext|>
Well, that's all that matters.  Did you have to study a lot for it? <|endoftext|>
Why are you done with semester? Did you passed all your classes? Congratulations by the way. <|endoftext|>
Dang! I hope you didn't have any car troubles. That sounds like it would have been stressful. <|endoftext|>
I suppose, but I would have preferred to know if he really liked me or not. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling, it's awesome. Do you usually workout at home or at a gym? <|endoftext|>
That's a great attitude to have! I'm sure you can do great things when you work hard! <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I bet that was embarrassing. Did you do anything to make it stop? <|endoftext|>
Well, truth be told, I've done much worse things than that. I'm sure most people have! <|endoftext|>
Awesome! What kind of gym do you go to? I go to a planet fitness place. <|endoftext|>
Nothing wrong with that.  Its good to be confident in yourself.  What do you write about? <|endoftext|>
Meditating is so therapeutic. Why did you feel relaxed after? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's really impressive! Do you work out at home or do you have a gym membership? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you confront him about it, or did he just assume it was none of his business? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Do you know why he would do that to you? Maybe he just needs some time to process things. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I bet you are pretty nervous about that. Do you think you will do well? <|endoftext|>
Thats good.  You should keep at it then.  Selling stuff online is a good way to make some extra cash! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's rough. How did you find out? Was it a big deal or not at all? <|endoftext|>
Dang that is a bummer! I am sorry to hear that. At least you now have a child. <|endoftext|>
I agree. I don't like to think about it because I get so nostalgic about it. <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! I hope you have a lot of fun! :) Payday is always a great day. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope it all turned out well, though. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes we have to face our fears head on. Do you think it would be worth it? <|endoftext|>
Hey that's awesome! I need to get back into the gym myself. What kind of gym do you go to? <|endoftext|>
I've been at my job for about the same amount of time. I think it's going to be a good year. <|endoftext|>
That's good. I think the most important thing you can do is just be honest with them about what you're feeling and feelings. They'll love you no matter what! <|endoftext|>
Relationships can be tough. It's good to find someone that you can trust and that makes it easier. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am sorry. Losing a pet is just the worst. <|endoftext|>
Dogs are so precious and it's so hard to say goodbye to them. I hope you feel better soon. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. You just don't know who you can trust anymore. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope they will learn to be kinder and good to you. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I just went through the same thing so I know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I had a dog that got cancer and it was awful. They say time heals all wounds, I hope it does. <|endoftext|>
Did you introduce it to your roommate? How did it go? I would have been nervous too! <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. I hope he doesn't get into any more trouble. Swiping is something cats are good at. <|endoftext|>
Were you able to have a healthy baby? I'm guessing that was a scary thing to go through. <|endoftext|>
I am glad you are okay and your baby is healthy too! Emergency surgeries can be so scary. <|endoftext|>
A week is a long time to be relaxing! Are you going to be going to college? <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. You should take a break and go for a walk or something. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you are so happy for her. How long has it been since you have seen her? <|endoftext|>
That is nothing to be embarrassed about. I am sure he loves you for being faithful. <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! What kind of dress is it? A formal, informal, or a more formal one? <|endoftext|>
That is a good way to look at it, and it is a great way to get attention. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty impressive! How long did it take you to get to that point? And what kind of training have you been doing? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I'm sure you'll continue to feel confident up to the next level. <|endoftext|>
What kind of job is it? Don't you get a little anxious when you hear something like that? <|endoftext|>
Will you be going on vacation with your family? If so, I hope you have a great time! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Good luck on your future exams! I'm sure you'll do great! <|endoftext|>
How did you do on the quiz? Did you study hard for it? If so, you should be proud of yourself and not take it so personally. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope you didn't cut her off.  Hammocks are expensive. <|endoftext|>
It would have been nice to have someone else to lay with you while you read. I'm sorry you had to go through that. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Do you guys still keep in touch? It's always nice to catch up and see what's been going on in people's lives. <|endoftext|>
That must have been very nostalgic. It's nice that you have those kinds of moments to look back on and remember the good times. <|endoftext|>
Nothing wrong with that!  Sometimes it's good to take some time for yourself.  Are you going to be relaxing at home or elsewhere? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a wonderful plan. Maybe I will do the same because it sounds like I will be relaxing by the end of the day. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's terrible.  Do you have a lot of clothes that you are wearing right now? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I hate them too, and I feel the same way. I can never shake the fear that I will die in the dream. <|endoftext|>
Maybe they will give you a loan? I know it can be stressful but it will be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
We are in the same boat. I want to buy but don't know where to buy. <|endoftext|>
I have done that too.  Sometimes you just need a little "me" time you know? <|endoftext|>
Lord of the Rings is such a great trilogy. You should check it out if you get a chance. <|endoftext|>
Ah, that must have been nostalgic. Did you guys grow up in the same town? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you had to leave but I am glad you got to see her.  I hope she has a good life. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh, that's terrible. Are you able to get there early next time? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you didn't get into trouble with your boss. <|endoftext|>
That is great to hear, it is always good to have friends to lean on when you need them the most. <|endoftext|>
Yes, you will learn from it, and you will be better for it in the long run <|endoftext|>
Me too. Social cues seem to get lost so easily on people these days. <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean.  It is very difficult to not take them for granted. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's annoying. I hate it when people do that! They should be more considerate of others. <|endoftext|>
You should be careful and give them the cold shoulder until you can figure out what is the problem. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I hope you have a safe trip. Stay safe. <|endoftext|>
Climbing is an amazing sport. I wish you the best of luck. Do you have a guide? <|endoftext|>
Have you tried anything to help? I know people who have had trouble sleeping because of nightmares. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I used to live in a small town where everyone knew you. <|endoftext|>
That's a great accomplishment! How did you get the endurance to lose so much weight? <|endoftext|>
It will be worth it in the end, you will be that much happier and healthier! <|endoftext|>
I am glad it worked out for you and your baby was healthy!  Those are the most exciting times in life. <|endoftext|>
I am so happy that your son was okay! I am sure that gave you a lot of relief. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's pretty sweet. You must be pretty coordinated to do that. <|endoftext|>
Balance is always good. I'm sure you could do it if you really wanted to. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that! Have you tried joining any clubs or getting to know people in your dorm? <|endoftext|>
You should try joining some clubs or get to know some people in your classes! On the bright side, you won't be lonely. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll be fine! Don't be too hard on yourself :) What are you studying? <|endoftext|>
babies are so much fun. i have 2 kids and they are both in school now. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  How long have you two been together?  What makes you so serious about it? <|endoftext|>
I sure do. I just had my first date with my girlfriend 2 weeks ago. How about you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hate that! Winter is my favorite because it's cool, not too hot, and there's less mosquitoes! <|endoftext|>
Yes, they are. And the bites take forever to go away, even with medication. <|endoftext|>
That is so great to hear! Being a parent is a scary thing, I'm happy for you! <|endoftext|>
I am sure they will recognize it when they see the progress you are making. Just keep up the good work! <|endoftext|>
That is a long trip, did you get to see your friends beforehand? I hope you had fun though. <|endoftext|>
It is! And I just drove from Florida to Indiana. That's a long time. Did you do anything special on your drive? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. I have been there myself and know how awful it is. Are you okay? <|endoftext|>
You'll be more careful next time. I'm sure your mom will forgive you though. <|endoftext|>
It's so nice that you have such a close relationship with your mom. Do you guys do anything fun together? <|endoftext|>
That is so true. Being patient is the key to a long relationship. It sounds like you two are going to be very happy together. <|endoftext|>
Did you use any training for her? I've never had a rat as a pet, they seem like they'd be a lot of work. <|endoftext|>
That is surprising. I guess she just wants to be near you and wanted to be close to you. <|endoftext|>
I am so jealous of you. I have only been to six flags once in my life and it was amazing! <|endoftext|>
Wow. It's always fun to visit an old favorite place from your childhood. I hope you had a great time! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Have you taken her to the vet? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you have plenty of memories of her to cherish. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's a shame to hear. But why did you sleep with her in the first place? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I think so too. I am sure you will be happy in the end. :) <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! That must have been so embarrassing! I'm glad you found them. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I bet that was embarrassing. I've done something similar before, though. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. Hopefully you can learn from this and be better in the future. <|endoftext|>
Well that's a good attitude to have!  It sounds like you're a very content person. <|endoftext|>
That's great! What kind of music do you play? Do you write your own lyrics? <|endoftext|>
Wow, an hour is a long time. You must be really anticipating it. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that sounds exciting! How long are you going to be there for? And what do you plan on seeing while you're there? <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! That must have been very scary for you. I am glad you made it out safe. <|endoftext|>
I agree. Unfortunately we have to deal with it though and try to make the best of it. <|endoftext|>
Yes there are. I met a man who I thought was my best friend. Turns out not everyone is as nice as you think <|endoftext|>
I bet.  That can be frightening.  Did you find someone to walk with you? <|endoftext|>
I bet it was! Sounds like it would be a cool experience to go on a vacation too! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Was your dog able to get the poop out of the house without it? <|endoftext|>
That's awful. I hope you don't have any allergies to that kind of food! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. How long ago was it?    I recently lost my uncle in a car accident, and I have a hard time remembering him. <|endoftext|>
That is so kind of her! School supplies are so important for kids growing up! <|endoftext|>
That is so nice of you. I am sure she really appreciated it. I wish I had a friend like you. <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! Are you nervous at all, or is it kind of exciting for you? <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting! I hope you have a great time, I would love to go some time. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. I hope she has a good support system to help her get through it. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I can't imagine what you're going through. :( <|endoftext|>
Yes! Positivity is always the best attitude to have. It will help you in the long run. <|endoftext|>
Driving tired is the worst, I've had that happen to me a few times. <|endoftext|>
That sounds terrifying! I'm glad you made it home safely.  I hate when that happens! <|endoftext|>
That's really nice of you to do that for him. I bet he appreciates it. <|endoftext|>
That poor kid! I hope he feels better as well as you do! You sound like a good friend. <|endoftext|>
Does she have a big family? Maybe you can go visit them when you get the chance? <|endoftext|>
That is indeed unfortunate. I do hope that you are able to make her feel cared for one day. <|endoftext|>
Oh, goodness. I'm sorry to hear that. That must've been infuriating. <|endoftext|>
Did you tell her the truth, or did she make you feel like you had to tell her anyway? <|endoftext|>
Oh my!  I hope it wasn't in front of the whole class!  That must have been humiliating! <|endoftext|>
I would be too! I would have had to get someone over the next day to hold me over. <|endoftext|>
That would be so cool! I would do the same thing, but I would be too scared to do it. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awful!  pranks are so mean!  I hope you can get him back! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? Is it because you didn't go or that you don't want to take them? <|endoftext|>
Where is it that you would have went had you not been able to?  Maybe you can take them next time. <|endoftext|>
How much money did you win? I wish I could win something cool like that! <|endoftext|>
I would love to go someday. I bet it was a very interesting and informing trip. <|endoftext|>
I bet you are excited. Are you going to be there all night? I always have to be up early for work in the morning. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I hope you guys have a great time! 40 is the perfect age to have fun! <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! Do you have a good relationship with any of your high school buddies? <|endoftext|>
What was she doing that was so bad? Sometimes people need a good kick in the face. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I am so sorry to hear that. I hope everyone is okay? <|endoftext|>
That's crazy! I hope it didn't affect your electric bill too much... or at least your internet! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Was it a bad hurricaine? <|endoftext|>
I can respect that.  I don't think I could give that up for moral reasons, but I can understand not eating it. <|endoftext|>
That's a long time! Why did you decide to go vegetarian? Was it for health or animal rights? <|endoftext|>
That is bad. How did you manage to break it? Was it a bad break or was it fixable? <|endoftext|>
That is super frustrating. I would have been frustrated as well. At least you stuck to it! <|endoftext|>
What is the certification for?  Is it something that you have been studying for? <|endoftext|>
That's good. I hope you do well on it. It sounds like you have done your best. <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet! What do you say to her when she eyes are looking at you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope they feel better soon. Maybe they can stay with their grandparents? <|endoftext|>
That's great! Are you going to save it for something fun?    Paid-rises are always nice. <|endoftext|>
I hope he is able to pay you back in some way. Maybe a nice trip to the beach. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be awful. How long were you together? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that! Try to hang out with friends or find a hobby to take your mind off of it <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel.  I'm in a new town too.  You should put yourself out there and meet some new people! <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel.  Meeting new people can be tough, but it's worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes that happens, maybe you were just nervous. Did you talk to the professor/teacher? <|endoftext|>
That really sucks, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can get a tutor this time. <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. I wish there was a way to get it off of computers. <|endoftext|>
Why does it drive you bonkers?  Does she know that you don't like it when she doesn't clean up after herself? <|endoftext|>
Do you still have them today? Those pens must be like a treasure. Do you wish you could buy them now? <|endoftext|>
I've never tried one of those pens! I've always wanted to, but I always end up with Ferraris <|endoftext|>
How much will you get for it if you don't mind me asking? I'm in the process of buying a house myself. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's pretty awesome. I guess all you can do is hope the rest of the day goes well! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Why couldn't she come? That must have been very disappointing. <|endoftext|>
I hope you are able to make it out of town and see her. Why did she move so far away? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope she's okay. That sounds like it would be disgusting to clean up. <|endoftext|>
That is nasty!  I would have been so mad at her.  I don't think I would ever let her live that down. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you file a police report? I hope you can find out who did it. <|endoftext|>
I would have been so scared. I'm so glad you're okay! It's so scary. <|endoftext|>
I bet! I am looking forward to seeing my kids get out of the house again too! <|endoftext|>
Yes it does! I have one in prek and one in kindergarten now! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun. I wish I could have been there to see it. <|endoftext|>
Diabetics need to watch their sugar intake, or else it can get very bad. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  Will you be able to visit his gravesite? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's hard to prepare for something like that, but in the end it's all worth it! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Did you guys have a special day or something? Or was it just an impulse thing? <|endoftext|>
That was really nice of you to do. She's going to really appreciate it when she wakes up. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.  I have been fired before it is a terrible thing to go through.  Keep your head up and keep looking.  You will find something soon. <|endoftext|>
Right, hopefully something good will come along soon. Maybe you should try a new career field? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope you find it.  Did he say how he got it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you should check with your local animal shelter? <|endoftext|>
Did you mention it to her? I'm sure she didn't mind she just wanted you to be happy. <|endoftext|>
Hey, it's okay. You only get one chance at a time. Maybe you'll get picked the next time around. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. I used to love waking up in the morning and running downstairs to see my mom's door. Now that she's gone, I miss her. <|endoftext|>
You know what they say, if you ain't happy, you're not happy! Go enjoy the simple things in life <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! That must have been so embarrassing! I hope you were able to laugh it off and not take too much notice! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it wasn't too embarassing for you! People make mistakes. <|endoftext|>
Uh oh. That's not good. How do you think he feels about the situation? Have you talked to him about it? <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet.  It is sweet that you are able to care for him and show him that you care. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know that must be very hard on you. <|endoftext|>
I love antiquing!  It's one of my favorite things to do when I have time to get something from my grandmother. <|endoftext|>
Dang, hope it wasn't too much of a hassle...did you have any problems with it? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! A lot of people aren't that lucky so it's good you have someone like that in your life. <|endoftext|>
What happened?! I won't pry, but I hope it wasn't something too bad. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I've had so many dreams about that! I'm glad it was just a dream and not something that actually happened. <|endoftext|>
That is so great of you to help the animals! They must be so grateful. <|endoftext|>
You sound like a very kind person. I hope that you help those animals as much as you can! <|endoftext|>
Aww, I love dogs! What kind of puppy is it? Is it your first? <|endoftext|>
I love little dogs! I have a little dog myself, but I'm thinking about getting another one. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear about that, I hope you can find a way to move on from this somehow. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes honesty is the best policy. At least, it seems like you've learned your lesson. <|endoftext|>
Soda is addicting.  I am so glad you got it off.  How do you feel now? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I can't imagine having a headache and being so dehydrated. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it was frustrating for you.  Did you tell your friend how you felt? <|endoftext|>
I think as long as you apologize and show her the error of your actions, she will forgive you. <|endoftext|>
I love finding old cds!  What were some of your favorites?  Did you play on them a lot when you were a kid? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. It's always nice to play games that you enjoyed when you were younger. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Did they give you a reason? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it takes more than the interview to get a job. Keep trying and you will find something soon. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope everything is going well for you now. How long ago was that? <|endoftext|>
Well, it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders. You will find someone that makes you very happy. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet it will take you to all kinds of places. <|endoftext|>
That's a lot but if you have good insurance I'm sure it will be worth it! <|endoftext|>
Maybe you can make her a romantic dinner out of it?  I'm sure she'll love that as much as you do! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a plan to me! We'll get chocolate wasted to celebrate when we're done! <|endoftext|>
I'm right there with you. I loans to my friends all the time because I know they'll repay me back. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's good! I lent my friend money to a friend and I didn't get it back either! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's terrible. Did you ever find him again? What happened to him? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad.  I hate to hear that happened and I hope the police took care of it. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I haven't tried that in a long time. I bet you and your kids have a blast doing it. <|endoftext|>
How long did it take to build up to where you are now? I can't wait to see where it takes me. <|endoftext|>
Oh that is a bummer. How did the rest of the party go. Was it a small gathering or a large one? <|endoftext|>
They sure do! Does she have any close friends that can help to watch her during the day? <|endoftext|>
Ouch, that must have felt bad. Do you have anything else lined up for now? <|endoftext|>
pay is always nice, but less pay is great to have too!  Keep up the good work <|endoftext|>
That sounds like something that I would do. Did you have any clothes on you that day? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Well, at least it wasn't in the dress or anything. I'm sure husband didn't mind too much. <|endoftext|>
That must be hard, I'm sorry. I hope that you are able to find some ways to still enjoy your time with your family. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I hope you can find a cure for the common cold one day! <|endoftext|>
That is so cool!  What kind of car is it and what does he like to do on his leisure time? <|endoftext|>
Playing with toys is one of the best ways to spend a day! I'm glad you got to spend some time with it. <|endoftext|>
Did they take anything or just bust in? I would be so scared to have that happen to me. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you can contact the police and see if they can help you. I hope you feel better. <|endoftext|>
That was really nice of you guys!  I bet she appreciated you being nice to her. <|endoftext|>
Awwww, poor little doggie. I'm glad you were able to help her out. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I bet he had a great time, did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, I haven't played zelda since gamecube I think. <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! Being healthy is so important, and it sounds like you have a great support system to help you. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I agree. Have you felt any change in your life lately, or is it just a general trust thing? <|endoftext|>
Dang, time flies doesn't it.  How old are they now?  What do you think about them? <|endoftext|>
Yes, it does. I have a nephew who just started 6th grade and I can't believe he's in 1st grade now! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you going to be ok?    I know how you feel. I had a friend who recently passed away and it was hard. <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean. I've lost a lot of people in my life and it's sometimes hard to realize they aren't going to live forever. <|endoftext|>
I am so jealous, that sounds delicious. I wish I had some rice right now. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I didn't know soaking was that effective. I'll have to try that next time I make pizza. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything that you can do to help? <|endoftext|>
What is the reason that he was granted a court date instead of her being able to see him? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awesome! Was it a lot of hard work or was it just a general test? <|endoftext|>
I hope so to. That would be good and avoid having to wait any more time. <|endoftext|>
Are they ready to go back to school already? I remember that feeling, it's exciting but also a little sad at the same time. <|endoftext|>
That's good. It shows that you care a lot. That's a good trait to have in a relationship. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure she'll be fine. Bullying is a terrible thing. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of you. I'm sure she appreciates all the love she can get. <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you end up telling her the truth, or did she find out another way? <|endoftext|>
Some people have no respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope he's okay! I'm sure you were worried sick. Did you do anything to make sure he wasn't sick? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear she got better. That must have been really tough for you. <|endoftext|>
I love kittens, but I'm allergic to them.  I hope your kitten is okay! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I hope I can have a cat some day. They are really great pets. <|endoftext|>
How did you do?  That sounds so fun.  Are you a cello player? <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about cellos?  I always wanted to learn how to play but could never get the hang of them. <|endoftext|>
Maybe they just didn't notice. Don't feel bad, it happens to the best of us! <|endoftext|>
Well, you should be proud that you were able to overcome your fear and accomplish something. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. How are you doing now? Did you guys ever reconcile? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I'm sorry you're going through that. Maybe you can get him a promotion? <|endoftext|>
That is a tough situation. I would probably feel the same way. Do you have any children? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That sounds awful!  I'm sorry to hear that.  What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I'm sorry that happened to you. What were you going to cook? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry that happened to you. Some people are just cruel to others that are not within their social circle. <|endoftext|>
That's a very trusting thing to do, did everything turn out well? . <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. Yeah, my wife usually doesn't let anyone watch the kids unless I'm out with friends. <|endoftext|>
What is wrong?  Do you want to talk about something else.  Is it your day off? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so gross! I hope you were able to clean it up. Did you have to? <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. It probably wasn't as bad as I thought it would be though. <|endoftext|>
Adult soccer is growing in popularity. You'll have a good time I'm sure! <|endoftext|>
What is the situation? Do you think you could get away from it if you called someone to help you? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. How are you now? Do you still have the dog? <|endoftext|>
Dang. Did the other person get in trouble? I hope he didn't have to go to jail. <|endoftext|>
What was the bet?  Did you like the Switch?  What were you playing on it? <|endoftext|>
That's not too bad of a loss!  You must be feeling pretty good about things. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I miss my friend, I hope you guys have a great time! What are you guys gonna do? <|endoftext|>
That is all you can do, stick to your word and hopefully she will come around. <|endoftext|>
That's crazy! Did you end up finding out who the perpetrator was eventually? <|endoftext|>
Kids can be so hurtful. Give him time and I'm sure he'll come around. <|endoftext|>
I think it is a great idea to keep such precious things. Why do you want to sell it? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well if she is your friend you should try to let her know your feelings for it! <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! I hope to be able to do that someday. How did they do it? <|endoftext|>
I can understand the feeling. But I am sure there are other things you can be proud of too. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did they at least pay you for the new bedroom?  Did you ask them to fix it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I would be too!  Are you going to ask them to pay for it? <|endoftext|>
That's really sweet that your ex got you stuffed animal stuff. Why did you break up in the first place? <|endoftext|>
I understand how you feel. But I'm sure you will find someone. Just be patient! <|endoftext|>
I bet it was! I hope I have a day like that one day. :) Family time is the best time. <|endoftext|>
I do too. A good day at the beach, playing video games or just hanging out with friends and family is heaven in this world. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was fun, but I know what you mean, it is always sad to leave an animal behind. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Maybe they had a hard time seeing you and wanted to be alone. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I would be so excited! How long will you be there for? DC is awesome. <|endoftext|>
Hey, if it's about saving money then go for it! I'm sure you could find a lot of interesting things about it online. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Where are you guys moving to/from? I hope you have a safe move! <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will meet some cool people. I moved to Colorado not too long ago and I love it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That must have been so embarrassing. Did you do anything to stop him? <|endoftext|>
That must have been really embarrassing. Don't worry, though. I'm sure most people have kissed each other at some point in their lives! <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm so happy for you! What field are you in, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool! I'm sure you'll do great, have you done this job before? <|endoftext|>
Eh, I guess it's luck. Maybe she will do better next time. What kind of drawing was it? <|endoftext|>
Did you get to go there on your own or with family?  I've always wanted to go but havent had the chance. <|endoftext|>
That is very scary. What did you do? Did you call the police or just let it go? <|endoftext|>
i would have had to bailed at the last minute to get my parents to let me go <|endoftext|>
Are you going to start the new year? Good luck and I hope you have a great time. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's hard to get a good feel for things like that. I'm sure you'll make a good decision when the time comes. <|endoftext|>
That is a real bummer. I hope you find out who did it and give them an earful! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, do you know if they had insurance at least? How much did it cost to fix? <|endoftext|>
I remember that too, how old was she when she passed away?  Was she a cute puppy? <|endoftext|>
I love surprises like that. And a new laptop is a pretty big deal. I have one and I love it. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of you! I lent my sister money a few times but I felt bad about it. <|endoftext|>
I hope so. It's always nice to get money back, even if it is from someone you don't trust. <|endoftext|>
That is disgusting. I don't understand why people are so lazy and don't take the time to clean up after themselves. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. I am glad you were there to protect them. Hopefully that man will learn his lesson. <|endoftext|>
I hope it's not too bad. My family moved a lot as a kid and I hated it. <|endoftext|>
I know, the anticipation must be killing you! I hope everything is going to be okay! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's disappointing. What was the job, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
I'll keep my fingers crossed that it works out for you, it sounds like you really want it! <|endoftext|>
Oh gross!  I hope you were able to get it cleaned up.  I know it's gross to think about. <|endoftext|>
I hope they had insurance at least. I know how bad it can be to lose a pet. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's exciting, then? Do you have a job lined up already? And, if so, where are you moving? ;-) <|endoftext|>
They will tell you that once they get you in the air you will know where you are going. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Maybe you can get a refund? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you can treat them to lunch or something to make it up to them. It's not like you did it on purpose. <|endoftext|>
Dogs can be so sentimental. It's amazing how they can remember so clearly. <|endoftext|>
She was a husky dog, I don't know what to do without her now :(. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. You must be very proud of yourself. Will you be staying at the new job for a long time? <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I bet you can't wait to start working and making some moolahyyyy <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about it? Think you're gonna get a good grade? Think positive? <|endoftext|>
Well good luck, I'm sure you'll do great! :D Just don't forget to breathe :D <|endoftext|>
Was your friend expecting you to pay him back? And how did he react to the fact that you borrowed his car? <|endoftext|>
That doesn't sound like a very good outcome. Hopefully you can work it out without too much drama. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear that you're happy with your current job. It's nice to work somewhere you like. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great job. You must be very talented. Do you enjoy it? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! You must be very proud of yourself. I'm sure you deserved it. <|endoftext|>
What is the job, and how soon do you have to get picked up? Good luck, I know the anticipation must be killing you. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that does sound like hard work.  Hope it goes well for you.  Statistics can be tough! <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary. :(  I hope you made some new friends at the new place! <|endoftext|>
Take it one day at a time and I'm sure it will be okay. :) Don't worry! <|endoftext|>
Did you buy anything else? Sometimes it's hard to find the right brand for what you're looking for. <|endoftext|>
I don't think I will ever try it again, that experience was enough of a shock for me! <|endoftext|>
I like to stay at home when it rains. I hate being out in the rain. It makes me feel claustrophobic. <|endoftext|>
Haha, I hope so, or at least the sun is going to shine again. It has been forever since the sun has shined <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I know how you feel, I had a dog that passed away recently too. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I had a dog that got ran over like 2 years ago. It was the worst day of my life, I thought I was going to die. <|endoftext|>
Where are you that you are ready? I'm in Florida so I'm pretty familiar with them. <|endoftext|>
Roll Tide!  (South-Alabama here, too).  I grew up in Tuscaloosa, but moved to New Orleans a few years ago.  Have you ever been? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty nice of her! I hope you get better, and I hope it is soon. <|endoftext|>
I hope you guys have a great life! Sending you love and healing vibes. <|endoftext|>
That's annoying. It's like they think you have all the ingredients and you need them! <|endoftext|>
I totally understand how you feel. I have celiac myself and it can be debilitating to deal with all of that. I really hope that you feel better as soon as possible. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! That's crazy. Did they taste okay, or were they disgusting? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you guys were able to work it out and save the order! I hate when they do that and it doesn't end up being corrected. <|endoftext|>
That's so cute! I have a 13 year old boy and a 14 year old girl. The amaze me almost everyday. <|endoftext|>
Well, I think you should keep it to yourself for now. If it's still bothering you, then I would consider seeing a counselor. <|endoftext|>
That sounds delicious! I wish my wife would do that for me. I bet that makes you feel great. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so delicious. I am so glad that you are able to reconnect with her. <|endoftext|>
Divorce is messing with my family and I would not wish that on my worst enemy. <|endoftext|>
You can always complain to her about it! Maybe she doesn't realize she's doing it. <|endoftext|>
Why would you want to keep that between your brother and his partner?  Seems like it would be a bad idea for everyone involved. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear that he can let you down occasionally. I'm glad you guys have the trust in each other. <|endoftext|>
That's nice of you. It's important to be supportive. Is there anyone you can talk to about it? <|endoftext|>
Very nice of you to be so generous. I wish I had a friend like you. <|endoftext|>
You and me both. Maybe one day! What kind of car did he get you? <|endoftext|>
I don't think I've ever seen one of those. I'll have to look into them. <|endoftext|>
That is a long time to be waiting for something to come. Hopefully you will get it soon. <|endoftext|>
I never win anything, so I never buy lottery tickets. But I do enjoy the thrill of it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That must be so frustrating!  Have you tried switching the diapers? <|endoftext|>
Oh good! I'm glad you had something to help you. That must have been very stressful! <|endoftext|>
What did you order? I can't think of anything I would buy for my kid unless I knew it was on the website. <|endoftext|>
I bet! Have fun and be safe! :) Safe travels. :) I am sure you will enjoy it. <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! Where are you going to go on the crusise? <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing!  I'm sure it will be a great time and you will have lots of fun! <|endoftext|>
Do you live with your dad still? If so, I'm sure he knows you were just trying to help out. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope he's okay! I know how hard it is to lose a pet. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you feel that way. Maybe you could talk to your pastor about it? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I'm glad you had a good time and your prayers worked! <|endoftext|>
That happens to me sometimes, too. Don't feel bad. Just make sure you don't do it too often! <|endoftext|>
That actually sounds really good right now.  I'm going to have to try that. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's so sweet! How old is he? Did he have a great time? <|endoftext|>
I bet that made you feel really good. Opening your presents is one of the best times of the year! <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's cute!  So, are you going to take her up to the real games? <|endoftext|>
I bet that was fun, maybe you can get them into it when they are a little older <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. MS is a tough disease to deal with. I can't imagine how hard that must have been. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I hope they didn't take anything to personal from you. They're just trying to do what they think is best. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope that she gets better! That's so nice of you to worry about her like that. <|endoftext|>
That's usually what happens when you eat too much sugar. I would get to the doctor asap! <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome. I would love to have a cat. I'm allergic to them though. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. I have a cat too, but I'm allergic to them. It's a shame because I love them. <|endoftext|>
How did it go? Did you get the job?    xD  xd <|endoftext|>
I am sure you knocked that test out of the park, or else it wouldn't have happened. <|endoftext|>
That sounds fun!  Did you have a boat or jet skis or something to do with water? <|endoftext|>
Phew! I'm glad to hear it. Sometimes our minds can get worked up about little things. <|endoftext|>
That's a good friend right there. Did he buy you a lot of alcohol to replace it? <|endoftext|>
That is nasty, did you get rid of the carpet or the vomit? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you guys have a good time there? Did you all do any tricks? <|endoftext|>
I wish I could do that! My daughter is only 3. I hope to get her on a rollercoaster soon. <|endoftext|>
Dad's are the best.  What do you do for work if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I hope he gets his money back and you can continue your friendship. <|endoftext|>
Ouch, I hate going to the doctor, always feel like they are going to tell you something stupid. <|endoftext|>
Meeting new doctors is never a good thing.  I hope you find a good doctor. <|endoftext|>
School can be such a great time. I look forward to it each day.  Do you get a lot of free time? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should get a bicycle. Or a dog. :D  I have 3 bunnies and they are always chewing on my stuff to make sure I don't disturb them. <|endoftext|>
That sucks. How did it make you feel to be apart from them for so long? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that would have been nice. Maybe you could have taken an uber or something. <|endoftext|>
That is a long time to be waiting at a store. Did you get your stuff done? <|endoftext|>
That's odd. I've never had that happen at a store. Only at a supermarket. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. How are you feeling about it? Are you sad? <|endoftext|>
I understand. It is hard to see people you care about be affected by tragic events. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! Where have you all been so far? (And where) <|endoftext|>
I am sure it will be amazing.  I have a feeling you will have a great time. <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome! How long has it been since you have seen them again?.  I am sure it makes you feel good to see them again as well. <|endoftext|>
Yes that is true. It is much harder to meet new people now. Everyone is so stuck in their lives. <|endoftext|>
Well that's disappointing. I'm sorry to hear that. I always hate when people pull something like that out of their own pocket. <|endoftext|>
I do that a lot. I feel so bad about it, but I just can't help it. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. Maybe you should talk to her and let her know that you are really disappointed by it. <|endoftext|>
That's awful. Did you do anything about it? I'd be mad if someone was treating me that way, even if I didn't know who it was. <|endoftext|>
Hope you don't end up having to call the police or law enforcement to help in the future. <|endoftext|>
I hate when other people do that. I would never take someone's job. That is just not right. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope it wasn't too traumatic for you. <|endoftext|>
I understand that completely, I used to live 800 miles away from my family. It does get easier as you get older! <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear! Did they have a good first day? Did they get any cool gifts? <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow! That is a long drive. At least you were able to get some things done. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's a drag. I hope it went well at least. What was the test for? <|endoftext|>
I bet it was! I'm so glad that it all turned out fine though. I bet you were relieved! <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to make it work. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's so sad. I'm glad you and your husband tried to work it out. <|endoftext|>
Aww, it's nice that you have those memories. I don't have any children, but I do have nieces and nephews that I play with. <|endoftext|>
I agree, those days will never come back! But at least you have the memories to look back on! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What kind of fishing are you going to do? Fly fishing? <|endoftext|>
I have never had any luck with those. I do love bluegatted trout though. <|endoftext|>
I love Dominos. We don't have any here in town. I'm jealous. <|endoftext|>
I love a good craft beer session.  Unfortunately, I don't live in the US. <|endoftext|>
It can be a little nerve wracking.  Did you end up having a good visit? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! It's the worst when you don't have time to clean everything before it's time! <|endoftext|>
What are you hoping for?  Maybe its time to start planning a surprise birthday party for yourself? <|endoftext|>
What kind of camera do you want? I'm thinking about upgrading my phone too. I've had mine for so long and it's starting to feel old. <|endoftext|>
That is so annoying.  I don't have a dog, but I would be so mad if that was happening to me. <|endoftext|>
Take your shoe and crush it into the back of the car! That's what I always do. <|endoftext|>
You sound prepared for sure! I love camping. Are you going to be in a national park? <|endoftext|>
Well I wish you the best of luck, and a future congratulations on killing it! <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I hope you were able to find out who it was and what they wanted. <|endoftext|>
Dang. I guess I need to get a new printer then. I've got a bad one. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope it stops soon. Do you have a back up plan in case it does? <|endoftext|>
Do you have any animals to help mask the pool boy? They are really good at detecting if there is a predator around. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens. You think it might have been spoiled or something? <|endoftext|>
That is terrible.  I hope you can find some comfort in knowing that your pet probably didn't feel any pain and that you will be able to laugh about it in the future. <|endoftext|>
That is always a good idea to make yourself feel better before an interview. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
Well as long as it makes you feel good, it doesn't matter what you spend it on! <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet! What is your favorite kind of cookie? I like the snickerdoodle. <|endoftext|>
Ha! Those were the good old days. I bet she was a great cookie maker. <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's so sweet. I bet you were so happy to see all of those memories. <|endoftext|>
That is so precious! I'm glad you were able to take time out of your day to be with her. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome.  My youngest is about to start school. I am going to have to start doing that too. <|endoftext|>
They grow up so fast!  Mine are teenagers now and it's like they grow up right before your eyes. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you get more than one? I hope you didn't have to drive back to get more. <|endoftext|>
I'm more of a Honda guy myself, but I don't blame you for loving that brand. It's been around for a long time. It was founded in 1926! <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! That is great news. Do you like the new position? <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's awesome! I hope you get a nice bonus for it too! :) <|endoftext|>
That is so exciting! I hope you get the good news of getting the promotion. <|endoftext|>
Well at least you can relax knowing you did everything you could. It will be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
How long have you been there?  Are you a nurse?  I used to work in a pediatricians office. <|endoftext|>
That is so terrible! I would be furious if that happened to my pets! <|endoftext|>
I understand where you're coming from. It's like people think they are more important than other people. <|endoftext|>
Oh, so you're a soccer fan? I don't really watch it. Why do you like it so much? <|endoftext|>
What is a national team? I don't know much about sports. But I'm happy for you! <|endoftext|>
We get that a lot here. The kids are getting up in the middle of the night now. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you could invite some of your friends over to ease the loneliness a bit. <|endoftext|>
They sure do! My daughter is turning 2 and I already feel like she's growing up so quickly. <|endoftext|>
That is gross!  I am sorry you had to go through that.  It is hard to get that smell out of the house too! <|endoftext|>
That is crazy! I hope you took a picture of the frog and sent it to your friends. <|endoftext|>
That is outrageous! Those people need to be locked up for the crime they committed! <|endoftext|>
Shelters need to do better. She was such a sweetheart. I hope she is in a better place now. <|endoftext|>
I didn't know you could donate time like that. That's very kind of you. <|endoftext|>
I agree. I would have loved to see them in jail. I hope you had a good time! <|endoftext|>
What does he look like? You might be able to find out if he is any good. <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting! I hope it's a good team and not one of those bad ones. <|endoftext|>
Yes! I'm sure that was a relief for you. Mine aren't old enough to go yet so I don't have to worry about that yet. <|endoftext|>
That's a great point! My mom is like that too. It's so nice to have someone so reliable in your life. <|endoftext|>
4 and 5. They don't listen and waste crumbs when they aren't even eating anything. I don't understand it. <|endoftext|>
That sucks!  Maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests? <|endoftext|>
Nothing wrong with that. Relax and enjoy yourself for the weekend. Maybe catch up on some guilty pleasures. <|endoftext|>
That's so scary! I hope nothing happened to them. Were you able to find them? <|endoftext|>
What did you do? Did you call the police or something? I'm so sorry you had to experience that. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! I love kittens, but it's even more painful when they are young. I hope you are okay. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that is horrifying. At least you tried to save her. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, I guess she has an interest in the medium. What kind of games does she like to play? <|endoftext|>
Things are more complex than ever. It's good that she was successful. Maybe she should pursue a career in teaching. <|endoftext|>
That is not good, have you tried calling them and telling them about it? or is there no way to get them back? <|endoftext|>
I hear you! I wish I could go back and forth time too! I hope everything works out for you! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am glad that your mom was there to help you. <|endoftext|>
It's good you had someone to help you. You don't know what you have until it's gone. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Hope you're doing better now. quiet is good to have some time to yourself. <|endoftext|>
Commotion is always good. I'm sure you'll do great where ever you end up. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did your mom punish you? I hope she didn't make you feel bad. <|endoftext|>
I would be so upset too! I hate when people do that and don't pay for it! <|endoftext|>
What movie?  I hope it wasn't a horror movie.  Those give me chills. <|endoftext|>
Dang! I always wanted to go there when I was a kid, but my parents wouldn't let me go. <|endoftext|>
That is horrible!  I would be furious too!  What did you tell your boss about it? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, I have dealt with something like that before and it is no fun. <|endoftext|>
Yea, tell me about it.  I've been stuck at work for 5 years now and really need a change of pace. <|endoftext|>
That is adorable, just don't let her know that you don't like the ponies. <|endoftext|>
Date can be scary. I hope it turns out well for you. What are you worried about? <|endoftext|>
Don't worry too much about it. I am sure you will make a good impression. <|endoftext|>
Ew, that sounds so gross! I hope you took it back to get a refund! <|endoftext|>
Enjoy the apple while you have it. I know it's bad, but sometimes you just have to have it good. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like an amazing experience, but I would be so scared of that happening to me. I love hiking. <|endoftext|>
oh no. next time try to talk to them before they do it. it's better to do that <|endoftext|>
What kind of dog is he? I love dogs! I am getting a new one soon as well. <|endoftext|>
I have always wanted one of those! They are so smart! I'm glad you love him so much. <|endoftext|>
Don't feel too bad.  There's a lot of people who don't take food into consideration. <|endoftext|>
Oh hahaha.   I think we've all gone through that.  At least now you have a new excuse to buy more! <|endoftext|>
I would have jumped too. I am terrified of snakes. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Would you like to talk about it? I'm here if you need someone to talk to. <|endoftext|>
That won't be too bad, I'm sure. Parks are usually pretty safe places. <|endoftext|>
How much did you get? It's always nice to get money in the mail, even if it's just a little extra money! <|endoftext|>
That's really great! I'm glad you got a nice bonus and I hope this year goes even better for you. <|endoftext|>
That sucks! I'm sorry that happened to you. You should find a movie that is more family oriented. <|endoftext|>
That's understandable, alone time is great but it gets to your head, I know it's hard. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I love taking pictures. I'm glad you were able to share it with your friends and family. <|endoftext|>
I didn't know they had butterflies! I need to go to the zoo! <|endoftext|>
Oh gross! Did you throw the diaper away? I would have!   Recently I had to clean up my dog's vomit. It was so gross! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I don't think I would have been able to hold back my own puke if that happened to me. <|endoftext|>
Did you throw the cat out? I am so allergic to cats that would break my heart. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling!  Mine is a couch potato but once he gets up, he wants to cuddle up. <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I'm sure you'll get the job, you seem like you're a hard worker. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do fine! I always feel so prepared for it that I never worry about it. <|endoftext|>
Oh god, I hate flying. I always seem to get the plane that ends up having some issue. <|endoftext|>
It's nice that you were able to trust her. I hope you guys drove safely! <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that's terrible. Trust me, I've done something like that before and I feel really bad too. Hopefully he didn't get too close to you guys. <|endoftext|>
Dang! A few minutes? Maybe I should start going to the gym more often. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That's scary.  Did you have any sort of alarm system? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I hope you can at least replace what was lost. I know it stinks to lose your stuff, but at least you can replace it now. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's always hard to say goodbye to our pets. <|endoftext|>
I can't imagine what you must have felt. 17 years is a long time to have a pet. <|endoftext|>
Oh gosh. That must have been embarrassing. Did you ask him if he was ok? <|endoftext|>
Did he do a good job? I would be proud of him if he could do something like that. <|endoftext|>
I am so proud of you!  That had to be a burden lifted for sure! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear that you were able to squeeze in a few more hours and make sure you're well compensated for your hard work. I'm sure your boss is very appreciative of all of your efforts. <|endoftext|>
What song is it? I can't stand my sister doing that either, even if we're brothers. <|endoftext|>
Hahaha, well, as long as she doesn't do it in front of your house! That would be the worst. <|endoftext|>
Will you be ok? I hope everything works out for you, I know how hard it is to lose someone you love. <|endoftext|>
I am going diving! I have never done it and I can't wait to swim! <|endoftext|>
I hope they were playing basketball and not one of those games where you had to defend yourself. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she'll forgive you eventually. It's hard to keep something like that from someone. <|endoftext|>
Internationals? I don't think I know anyone who is international. What does he study? <|endoftext|>
Dang! He must have been wanting to be on the road more than just practicing! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll make the right choice, you seem like a very motivated and determined person. <|endoftext|>
Oh nursing is a great career. I have a friend who is in nursing school. I'm sure you could do it. <|endoftext|>
That is very sweet of you. I hope your husband appreciates you being nice to him during this time of the year. <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have so much faith in him. I'm sure he appreciates it. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, did you reschedule or are you able to make other plans? <|endoftext|>
I'm so glad to hear it! I know how hard it is to get kids to go to school in the summer! <|endoftext|>
Well I hope that he is able to work on the relationship. If not, it may be time to move on. <|endoftext|>
I hope it's nothing serious. I would just take it easy on yourself until you get home. <|endoftext|>
That is a tough situation. I hope that you can improve your financial situation in the future. <|endoftext|>
That's a good tip! I always leave a little tip at the tip table. It goes a long way for me to leave more money in the table. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  How are you holding up?  Do you need anyone to talk to? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe he needs to take some time to relax and have some alone time. <|endoftext|>
Uh oh!  I hope they don't get in trouble!  What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
Ah, that is a bummer. Hopefully after you drop them off you can have a little "me" day to relax! <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am sure you miss her. Did she live a happy and fulfilled life? <|endoftext|>
That is a very good and healthy way to think. I am glad you have someone like that in your life. <|endoftext|>
I am sure it does. Just remember her and honor her the best that you can. <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I have felt that way with my pets over the years. It is so hard to let them go. <|endoftext|>
What do you think they are going to do if they don't tell you what they know? <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness!  I would have been so scared!  Did everything turn out okay? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine it was, but I'm glad to hear that she is happy and healthy! <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! I have never played that game, but I see it is quite popular. How did you do? <|endoftext|>
I hope it works out for you, I know how that goes, I have my fingers crossed for you. <|endoftext|>
That is adorable! You must have been so happy for her. How old is she? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible.  I hope it starts to look better for you.  Flowers are so sweet. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you didn't feel too bad about it. It happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  Hopefully you didn't have to go anywhere you had to go that day. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did they react by laughing, or did they react in a different way? I've been there before, so I know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you didn't get hurt. It happens to the best of us. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! You must be so proud of her! What is she getting a degree in? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she will turn out fine. :) Children can be a handful! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. :( I'm so sorry you had to go through that, and I hope that you're able to cope with your illness. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I am so sorry to hear that. MS is no joke. How has it been treating it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, it must be tough for you right now. How old is she? <|endoftext|>
What happened? Did she break up with you? I hope it wasn't a bad breakup. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, not a good thing at all. Hopefully she doesn't drive like a drunk driver! <|endoftext|>
That's a relief! I would have been so embarrassed if that was me! <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about it?  Think you'll do well?  I hope you do well so you can celebrate being done with school! <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I hope you do well. study hard and get a good night's rest. <|endoftext|>
Dang, do you feel nostalgic about high school? It's weird how that can make you feel that way. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, it's fun to look back on happy memories. Do you still keep in touch with these friends? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. 33 is still very young though, so you have plenty of time to make memories with him. <|endoftext|>
That's terrifying! I'm so sorry that happened to you. Maybe the next time you go to the doctor, they can help you out with the morality questions. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. How is she doing now? Is she still with the doctor? <|endoftext|>
Hopefully it wasn't too traumatic for her. I'm sure she'll want you to be there when she needs you most. <|endoftext|>
Nothing like a good home-cooked meal to make up for a long day of work. Glad you enjoyed! <|endoftext|>
I love a good steak and avocado, sounds like you had a great meal. <|endoftext|>
Don't worry too much. I'm sure you did fine. It's normal to feel that way. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure that you will find people to trust at work soon. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  I know how hard it is to quit soda.  How long have you been trying? <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling. You want to give in but there's not much you can do. <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I'm sure you did great. Waiting to hear back is the worst. <|endoftext|>
I am sure it will be here before you know it. Just don't worry about it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I would be mad too! That happened to me before and I almost lost them. <|endoftext|>
Dang, all those toys must have been worth a pretty penny. Luckily for me my parents never made me do that. <|endoftext|>
Shepherds pie is the best.  What time was it that you had to stay up so late? <|endoftext|>
That would be great. I'm glad you got a chance to relieve some stress. <|endoftext|>
That must have been shocking. Did you confront him about it, or were you able to move on? <|endoftext|>
Dang.  Maybe it's time to find a new job.  Sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's not good at all. Did you say anything to him, or do you have to just watch from afar? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I'm glad nothing bad happened. Maybe you should keep an eye out for strange things in the future. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so sweet. How old are your children now?   I don't have any kids of my own, but I love watching my nieces and nephews grow up. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you just have to shake it out of your mind and take a deep breath. <|endoftext|>
It happens to the best of us. Did you make it up to her? or is she not alive anymore? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you were able to visit and I hope you guys had a great visit! <|endoftext|>
Oh man! I have had that happen before. It is no fun. Did you get to keep some of it? <|endoftext|>
That's good. Have fun and be safe. I haven't played since I was a little kid. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh! I would be so scared! Did you enjoy it at least? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you were able to overcome your fear! It must be a thrilling experience. <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet.  I did the same with my grandma's dog.  What kind of dog was it? <|endoftext|>
9 is a hard age to learn, but it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you okay? It happens to the best of us, it's embarrassing but you'll be able to laugh about it soon enough! <|endoftext|>
Well you should probably tell your friend and let him know so he can make it up to you. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! Did you love it as much as you remembered or was it just nostalgic? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. At least you have some good memories of her to remember her by. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's amazing! What was it for? Something you've been doing to improve the neighborhood? <|endoftext|>
Well, that's all you could do I guess. I'm glad you got it all done. Maybe next year will be better. <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome! BBQ is my favorite. What kind of meat do you usually do? <|endoftext|>
You should throw some hoops or a disc and try to get the other team to throw them back over the net! <|endoftext|>
I hope you guys can still catch up and have fun! It's raining where I am, but I haven't gone yet. <|endoftext|>
Aw, don't feel bad. Everyone has a sweet tooth sometimes! What kind of candy did you snack on? <|endoftext|>
I hear you.  I have a sweet tooth myself.  Keep up the good work! <|endoftext|>
I would be too!  That is a great friend right there, I am sure.  Did he give you a reason why he didn't give it back? <|endoftext|>
I hope it does too! I would be so excited if that were the case. Good luck! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a good time? Did you see any cool tricks? <|endoftext|>
That's great. Tell her to keep it up. Maybe she'll be looking for a good job like hers someday. <|endoftext|>
That is upsetting. People on their phones drive like drunk drivers. I would be so mad. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, that must have been really embarrassing. How did your daughter take it? <|endoftext|>
That was so nice of her! You're lucky to have such a caring sister. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you had a good time. You deserve to feel better! Sending you love and healing! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate flying long distances. I always seem to get the plane that ends up having some issue. <|endoftext|>
I would be too! Did she end up telling you why she wasn't able to take it? <|endoftext|>
Date cancellations are the worst!  Did you reschedule?  Or did you cancel your plans? <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I am glad you two were able to work it out and not have to change anything. <|endoftext|>
That sounds lovely! I am really happy that you were able to return to your home and I am sure that made you feel really good. <|endoftext|>
That is adorable. I love dogs. I don't have any myself. But I want to get one soon. Maybe a cat. <|endoftext|>
What do you think about skate parks? I've always wanted to go to a skatepark but have never been. <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea.  I'm sure you'll save a lot of money that way. <|endoftext|>
Dang, did it go well? I've been trying to get over my fear of dogs. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Is she just throwing up or is she sick?  I would take her to the vet right away! <|endoftext|>
I hope she is okay. That can be very scary for kids when they are sick. <|endoftext|>
That sounds much better than what I was thinking.  I hope she feels better soon and I hope you feel better too. <|endoftext|>
How exciting! Are you going to be a bridemaid/catfish? <|endoftext|>
That's incredible! I hope you guys have a great flight! Safe travels! <|endoftext|>
Awww!  I love kittens!  What's his or her name?  Is it a boy or a girl? <|endoftext|>
I want one so bad too. They are so sweet and fun to have around. I am thinking of getting one next year. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did everything end up okay? I hate driving in storms. Too many things can go wrong. <|endoftext|>
That is no fun, but at least you are able to help out when she needs it. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad he was so helpful and helpful to you. It's always nice to have friends like that at work. <|endoftext|>
That's usually how it goes, but sometimes you just have to step up and do a few push ups. <|endoftext|>
I hope you get it!  It sounds like you really want it.  Did you talk to them about it? <|endoftext|>
Well I wish you the very best of luck, and a future congratulations on your new job! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. What charity do you give your money to? I might have to check that out! <|endoftext|>
That is great! I love animals and the idea of no-kill shelters. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun! How long were you guys on the trip for? Did you go on any vacations together? <|endoftext|>
West Coast is nice this time of year. Did you take her to the beach? <|endoftext|>
I love florida! Orlando is my favorite place in the world. I have some family in Tallahassee. <|endoftext|>
I love Alabamia. I have some family in Tuscaloosa. <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting! Is he nervous about it? It's so nice to see them grow up and learn. <|endoftext|>
That buses can be scary, but I'm glad everything ended up okay. :) I bet you guys had a great time. <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about it? Think you're going to do well? Think happy thoughts! <|endoftext|>
That's pretty awesome.  I bet you'll do great!  What are you going to school for? <|endoftext|>
How long did you have to wait for the interview? and what was the job for? <|endoftext|>
That's smart, it's better to be prepared than under, that's what my dad taught me! <|endoftext|>
What movie was it?  Did it make you feel nostalgic?  That can be a good thing sometimes. <|endoftext|>
How old are your kids now? Do they have any hobbies they like to share with you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Did you file for unemployment while you were looking for a new job? <|endoftext|>
Hey that's a good idea. Maybe go for a walk or something. I hope you feel better. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks. Did she say why she left you alone? Did you ask her to come back? <|endoftext|>
Awh, I am sure she had a wonderful life. Must've been a really good dog. <|endoftext|>
developing is so hard, sometimes i think people just dont care enough to try and make things work <|endoftext|>
That's me right now too. I'm just so tired and feel like I'm going to die. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's too bad, but maybe they'll learn to appreciate the old toys once they're older. <|endoftext|>
I know right!? They have so much to offer, but at the same time I wish they were still here. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that can be for the family. <|endoftext|>
Don't worry about him.  I am sure with his attitude and attitude, he will be fine. <|endoftext|>
Dang, what do you think happened to make them go in price? Mistakes were made. <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to go about it.  Don't get too down on yourself.  You can always try again in the future. <|endoftext|>
Dogs can be so destructive. I would take him to the vet right away! <|endoftext|>
I hope he stays with the family.  Check with the vet to see if he has any worries. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! Language is a tough one to learn, and it's even harder to learn as a native speaker. <|endoftext|>
I hear you! Life is SO busy, never enough hours in the day. I hope you can make it to Vegas sometime! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's pretty awesome. You must be pretty good to be able to do that. <|endoftext|>
Take it from me, you'll get it. I believe in you. Just don't give up. <|endoftext|>
I am so jealous!  Have fun and don't forget to wear sunscreen!  Dig in your bare feet! <|endoftext|>
That's great! I went to Estes Park this summer and it was really beautiful! <|endoftext|>
Sun and a cold can't do much when it's over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! That must have been stressful. How did it all turn out? <|endoftext|>
Dang! Well, at least you got to go on vacation? That's better than nothing. <|endoftext|>
That's a nice gift! Apples are one of my favorite fruits. What's your favorite kind of apple? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can make it up to your friend somehow. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. That kind of thing always stinks when you can't really talk to your boss about it. What was the issue, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
I love tacos! What did you guys get? I'm eating some carnitas right now! <|endoftext|>
That's great! Did you have to wait a long time to get it? I've been thinking about trying to get a raise myself. <|endoftext|>
I hope you have a great rest of your night! I'm going to bed soon, but I have a lot of work to do. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Maybe you can offer to buy her a new one when it is time to buy one? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. I really hope it all works out for you. <|endoftext|>
You are probably right. I will pray for you. Remember, God is always there even when no one else is. <|endoftext|>
I love going through old photo albums and remembering all the fun times I had with my cousins. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I had a sister to do that with. <|endoftext|>
No problem! I hope you are able to get the laptop or find a laptop that makes you happy! <|endoftext|>
Dang, that stinks. Maybe you can buy a new one before the year is over! <|endoftext|>
I love driving to work on the weekend.  Such a relaxing drive.  Did you do anything fun with your extra time? <|endoftext|>
That's the best way to look at it. Plus the extra money will help you out in the long run. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! I am so happy for you. Did you do anything fun with your extra time? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure you will do great, it's always nerve-racking the first day of work. <|endoftext|>
That sounds fun! I hope you learn a lot and are able to use your skills there. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's exciting! You must be a great parent! How old is he? <|endoftext|>
That's a relief! If he's anything like my brother, he'd be over the moon if I was like that. <|endoftext|>
I hope you do get the job, you sound like you would be a good fit for it. <|endoftext|>
That's great, I hope you do well. Just stay confident, what is the job? <|endoftext|>
Good for you! I bet you were ecstatic. :) What's the job title, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck, and a future congratulations on your upcoming engagement! <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that! I hope it wasn't too traumatic for everyone. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice. It's nice to know there are still good people in this world. <|endoftext|>
Video interviews can be nerve wrecking.  Did you get the job? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you knocked that interview out of the park - sweatshirt or not. <|endoftext|>
You're welcome, and I hope you have a great rest of your night! cherish your family! <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a cure for your pain. <|endoftext|>
I hope you feel better soon. I know how it is to not be able to afford things. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Congratulations! I'm sure he's a natural, talented player. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is indeed a big change. I bet he is having a lot of fun. <|endoftext|>
Hahaha, kids are so cute when they are learning new things. I bet you were so proud of her when she finally figured it out! <|endoftext|>
Maybe she was just having a bad day. I'm sure it made you feel a little better. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, tell her congratulations from me. That's a good thing to be proud of. <|endoftext|>
Dang, those are some long hours. How do you feel about them now that you've worked them all? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! haha. Well maybe it will be something that you can look forward to in the future! <|endoftext|>
Thanks, but I think you should always help yourself before you can help someone you feel needed. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Have you gone to the doctor about it yet? I hope it's nothing serious! <|endoftext|>
Well, if you are feeling suicidal, I would suggest you see a counselor <|endoftext|>
herpes? I have never heard of such a thing. Can you explain it to me what it is? <|endoftext|>
Whoa, that's a miracle. What did you do with the snake oil? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it was nothing serious. My cat is my baby and I would be scared too. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! My aunt had the same thing and it turned out to be benign! <|endoftext|>
How did you end up getting it fixed? That would scare me too, I'm terrified of driving! <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope it wasn't too scary for you. Do you guys live in a big house? <|endoftext|>
I understand. There are other ways to communicate. I hope you find your soulmate. <|endoftext|>
If I had that much money, I'd do something cool with it. Maybe go on a plane for the first time. <|endoftext|>
Me too, I like to be prepared.  What is something you are ready for right now? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that happens to me all the time too. It's hard to stay disciplined sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god! Bull sharks are one of my worst fears! How is she doing now? <|endoftext|>
That is absolutely devastating. I can't imagine what you're going through. I'll pray for her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate it when that happens. Are you going to ask her about it? <|endoftext|>
Forgetting is part of human nature. I'm sure she'll forgive you eventually. <|endoftext|>
Ohhh, is your friend a Britain? If so, then what were they saying? <|endoftext|>
What does that have to do with taking your phone away? Does he not have a phone of his own? <|endoftext|>
That must have been really nostalgic.  Did you play with them for a while? <|endoftext|>
Yes, life is much more simple when we are children. I don't think there is anything wrong with that at all. <|endoftext|>
Ahh that's too bad! Did you get to see any cool things while you were there? <|endoftext|>
I hope you feel better soon! Chicago is a great city, I would love to go one day. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's nice to go back and see your friends, even if you don't see them that often. <|endoftext|>
How was it? I have always wanted to go to Italy. Did you like it? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am sure she would have wanted you to remember her though. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, Rita was a babysitter when I was little and she would do that all the time. I loved it. <|endoftext|>
Are you going to be a slutty pumpkin farmer? I've always wanted to do that. <|endoftext|>
I've never been to an amusement park, and I really want to go! I hope you have a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Did you get a promotion at your old job or are you leaving because the new company doesn't offer the same benefits of the old company? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find something better soon. <|endoftext|>
What was the lie? I hope it wasn't a big lie.   (I know you probably feel really bad about it now, but please tell me it was just a one time thing. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you have to live with regrets.  Accept it as part of your past life and move on. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! You must be very proud of yourself and happy now you can spend your money on things you want. <|endoftext|>
I would have been too.  Was it a good job?  Did you like it? <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been awful. Were you hurt? <|endoftext|>
I would have been terrified! What a crazy thing to happen in front of police. I'm glad they apprehended them. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of them! Was it a surprise for all of you or did you have to make your own? <|endoftext|>
I would have been elated if they got me something I wanted too. What kind of shoe was it? <|endoftext|>
How did it go? Did you get the job? :) I had one recently too and I felt like I really nailed it. <|endoftext|>
I miss the old days when we used to call each other by the phone and not use the computer. <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary! I hope it didn't affect you too much. I know there are a lot of people who don't have their power <|endoftext|>
That is pretty scary. I hope everyone is okay? Did you hear any commission? <|endoftext|>
Is it a scratch off or a powerball? What's the first thing you'll do if you win? <|endoftext|>
Well, that was a very kind and thoughtful gesture on their part. I'm sure they really appreciated it. <|endoftext|>
Help you move? Moving is one of the most frustrating things in life! I at least hope you don't have to move again any time soon. <|endoftext|>
That's very nice of you. A lot of people would have just stolen the money. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. You must be frustrated. I hope your luck changes up soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh well, you can keep your head up. Maybe the next loss will be a winning one. <|endoftext|>
I have never played it but I have heard of it.  LOTR is a video game right? <|endoftext|>
Would you trade it for real though? Wouldn't it be better to live in fantasy world for a while? <|endoftext|>
Yes, it is very sad. I don't know what to do to make it better for Russia. <|endoftext|>
I agree that they seem to not care about the country at all.  They seem to only care about themselves. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. Did he die of old age? What was wrong? <|endoftext|>
That is a long time.  I am sorry to hear that.  What will you do now? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that sucks.  Did you find out if you got the job or not? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I would have been so upset! Were you able to find something else quickly? <|endoftext|>
That sucks! Did you have it backed up at least? And what was the project for, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it was! At least you were able to save some money. Sometimes you just have to forget things. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I don't really have a favorite team, so I can't say that I know much about it. <|endoftext|>
It was the worst. The other team had no idea what was going on and just let it happen. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's the worst. It's like the worst time of the day. I hope you feel better! <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hate when that happens.  I hope you can get it fixed. <|endoftext|>
How exciting! What kind of tricks did he do?    (And how old are you and what did you guys think of the show? <|endoftext|>
I will never forget that day. I will always have fond memories of you and your friend. <|endoftext|>
Good luck. I hope you do well. Are you applying to any new jobs? <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about the idea?  Are you ready for it or are you waiting for a response? <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's awesome. I bet you're feeling pretty good about it. Did you study a lot for it? <|endoftext|>
Good for you!  Having a few beers can really make you feel refreshed! <|endoftext|>
Moms are the best.  What did she bring you?  I hope it wasn't something you were picky about. <|endoftext|>
I wish my mom was still alive so I could have a good relationship with her.  At least you have something good to remember her by. <|endoftext|>
That is hard. How far away did you move?    (North or South?  I left my parents house when I was 18 to go to college, and it was about a 4 hour drive each way...So I know how you are feeling.  How long have you been away? <|endoftext|>
I understand that, I'm a bit lonely myself right now as I don't have anyone to talk to. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's very expensive. I'm sorry to hear you guys didn't have enough money. <|endoftext|>
I hate when people do that. I always try to help as much as I can because I know how much it sucks to not be able to help people in need. <|endoftext|>
Must have felt really good to sit back and feel everything settle down for a change, huh? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like the best birthday ever! I wish I had a big family like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that must have been hard on you. :(  How did you cope with it? <|endoftext|>
I'm so glad to hear he's got a good job now. It must be nice to be able to work together. <|endoftext|>
Wow, lucky you.  I couldn't do that if I had a car.  Did you like it? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I could be as helpful as you. I don't think I would last much longer without some help! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I bet that brought back a lot of memories. Did you get to say goodbye? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will be able to visit and talk to her again. Just take it one day at a time. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's terrible. Did you have any sort of camera that could have seen what happened? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I'm sorry to hear that! Definitely take some time to grieve. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations to her! That is so awesome! How long did it take her to write? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well good for her! I'm sure she put a lot of work into it. <|endoftext|>
What was it? Was it something you asked for, or was it an unexpected gift? <|endoftext|>
That's great! Hawai' is a great state. I went there a couple years ago and really enjoyed my time. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I love cats, but I'm allergic to them so we can't have any. What breed is it? <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck with that little princess! I'm sure she'll be a great addition to the family. <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that but atleast you have your pets with you, hope everything goes well <|endoftext|>
I am sure she learned a lot from you and her hard work. You should take her out to dinner or something to show her your appreciation. <|endoftext|>
Dogs are so much fun. What kind of dog do you have? What are you going to do there? <|endoftext|>
That is so sweet. I am glad you are able to find the positive in that situation and not focus on the negative. <|endoftext|>
Oh hey, it's alright. I make that mistake all the time too. We all make mistakes sometimes. <|endoftext|>
It's all good. Everyone makes mistakes like that. I'm sure he's forgiven you. <|endoftext|>
Good for you! I'm sure it's a lot of work to do but it'll be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
It's great that you were able to overcome your fear! I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That's really cool. What kind of things did you find in there? Were they from before you were born, or after? <|endoftext|>
Are you going to visit them this weekend? I hope it brings back good memories and not feel sad thinking about them! <|endoftext|>
Shopping is my favorite thing to do.  I am glad you got your car fixed. <|endoftext|>
What a bummer! Hopefully you can make it up to them next time you see them. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I know how hard it is to try to fight something like that. <|endoftext|>
You are a good friend though. I wish i had more friends like you in the world. <|endoftext|>
Oh, where are you going? Is it a long drive? Are you going to hang out? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're enjoying them. I hope you have a great rest of your night! <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. Did they steal a lot from you or was it just the person stealing the money? <|endoftext|>
i dont get it either. i hope they get caught one day and they go to jail. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I wish I could go back to high school just for a day. <|endoftext|>
It sure was. I wish I could go back and do some things over again, but I am happy with where I am in life. <|endoftext|>
That's sad. Did she pass away, or is she just not able to communicate with you anymore? <|endoftext|>
I hope you have a great time! And remember, it's not all about how nice the person is. Some people are just jerks. But I'm sure you know that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's such an awful thing to happen. Did you have to call a locksmith? <|endoftext|>
I lost my car keys once too, I know how you feel, I was so upset. <|endoftext|>
That's sucks, you should've gave him a taste of your own medicine hahaha. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear that he's moving up the ladder. I'm sure he'll land a good job when he gets older. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Hopefully, she doesn't ask you again. <|endoftext|>
Don't worry about it. Everybody screws up. At least you've got a good story to tell people. <|endoftext|>
That's very true. I give quite a bit to people. I think it's because I have so much faith in people. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that is a good friend right there. I bet that was a nice surprise. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's awesome! What kind of race? And how do you feel now? <|endoftext|>
It sure does, that is a great attitude to have though. You should be proud of yourself <|endoftext|>
That was so nice of you to do. Did they have a surprise for you as well? <|endoftext|>
That is so mean. I would be so mad at the person if that happened to me. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling!  How did you feel looking through them?  I hope you were happy to look back on them. <|endoftext|>
I know right. The quality of life was so much better back then than it is now. <|endoftext|>
That is too bad.  I think it is wonderful that you were able to overcome your fear. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been traumatic. <|endoftext|>
Haha!  I can understand that.  I'm terrified of rollercoasters!  You're braver than me! <|endoftext|>
I get that. I don't like going places where I have to make a lot of eye contact. <|endoftext|>
That must be hard on you two, but I'm sure you make it work. How long have you two been together? <|endoftext|>
That's a good idea. I'm trying to figure out how to get my husband to do that for me. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that's too bad. What makes you so unsure about it? I bet you could come up with something else. <|endoftext|>
I can relate, I get red face when ever I have to make a presentation. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I know the feeling! Are you moving for work, or for a different job? <|endoftext|>
That's great!  I hope you two have a great time together and that you catch up with each other. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness. That is so sad. Did you try to save the poor dog? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is so sad to hear. I hope your boss was understanding and didn't make you feel bad. <|endoftext|>
How come you were so nervous about it? Tatoos aren't scary, unless you have to cover them up. <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear! I'm glad you didn't have to go through all that pain. <|endoftext|>
That's really great to hear! I hope you two have a great life. marriage is tough but when you love each other it's work the effort. <|endoftext|>
That was so nice of him! Little surprises like that really bring a person along. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! Did you have a special occasion or just feel good about everything? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! Did you get a raise too? :)  I hope it comes with some extra money. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I use it all the time.  Especially when I'm cooking or cleaning.  It puts me in a good mood and makes me want to cook! <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear about your loss. I'm sure he would have wanted you to be happy. <|endoftext|>
Aww stuffed animals are so cute and fun to snuggle with. I'm glad that you snuggled with him! <|endoftext|>
It's nice to have someone care about you, even if you don't know you care about them. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope you're hanging in there. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you can find some comfort in his memory. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god! I would have been so embarrassed! How did you end up dealing with it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I would be mad too. You should have called the cable company and complained! <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I know that must be very difficult for you. Do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this? <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear you and your family are getting along. It's always hard to lose someone that close to you. <|endoftext|>
Sleeping in is the best!  What shows are you going to binge on? <|endoftext|>
I've never seen it. I might have to check it out. I do like a good comedy. <|endoftext|>
I drop out of school all the time.  I just don't have the grades to keep me afloat <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Maybe you need to look for a new position in a different company. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope you weren't hurt!  Did you get hurt at all? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been pretty embarrassing. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope he gets better soon! That was nice of you though, I'm sure he appreciated it. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so good. I want to be able to do that too someday. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That must have been so nerve-wracking!  How did you end up doing? <|endoftext|>
Did this happen at the beginning of a movie?  I've never really understood why movie theater is so introverted and keep to themselves the whole time. <|endoftext|>
What is your meeting about? Do you think you can knock it out of the park? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well best of luck to you then. I hope it goes well. :) I am sure you will present a stellar product <|endoftext|>
Oh no, did you ask him why he was doing that.  Did he say anything? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I would be a little upset too. Well, I hope she is faithful to you! <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. It's hard to be in that situation and I'm not sure how to help you. <|endoftext|>
Territorials can be fun though. They can teach you how to fight other cats sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Well done, you studied for it. Do you know what you want to study for next semester? <|endoftext|>
What are you planning to treat yourself? I hope you did well.    "Treat yourself" is a wonderful thing to celebrate. <|endoftext|>
Aww!  I would have been upset too.  What happened to him/her? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Poor little thing!  I hope he/she feels better soon. <|endoftext|>
That must be a very nostalgic place to visit. Do you get to visit often? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I hope you at least get to enjoy them next time they come visit! <|endoftext|>
That is so nice that you are able to do that. I wish my mom did that! <|endoftext|>
Eleven? Wow! That's impressive! I bet you were proud of her :-) <|endoftext|>
That's good.  It's nice to have someone you can count on.  What was the secret? <|endoftext|>
I have a close friend like that too. We get along really well and we joke about getting married all the time! <|endoftext|>
Oh, that must have been so stressful! How did he do by the end of the day? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is a great accomplishment! I am sure he will have a great time at college. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry for your loss. I lost my father last year. It is a terrible thing to go through. <|endoftext|>
I can't imagine going through something like that. I'm glad you have your family now. <|endoftext|>
That is heartwarming! I am sure he felt the same way when he left right? <|endoftext|>
I have a friend who recently graduated from there and have landed a job in a fortune 500.  I wish him all the best. <|endoftext|>
I love vacations! I'm glad you had a good time. What beach did you go to? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I needed a break from the stress of life. I felt so relaxed and happy. <|endoftext|>
What are you going to do with your free time?    Hoping he is going to be home soon and you can do something fun and relaxing. <|endoftext|>
I hope he does! My husband used to make a mean lasagna when we were younger. <|endoftext|>
Ooh, that's awesome that he's going back. What are you guys going to do? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's amazing. You don't see much of that anymore. So many people get married later. <|endoftext|>
I understand. It is like time goes by so fast. How old is he now? <|endoftext|>
Soon he will be leaving the nest, and you'll have a whole new world! <|endoftext|>
That is great news. I bet it feels good to feel like you have accomplished something. <|endoftext|>
Hard work tends to pay off. I have a good feeling that you will do just fine. <|endoftext|>
What did you do to make sure he didn't do it again? Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
Wow. I can't believe it. That must have been infuriating. I don't blame her. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I worry about my family too! What was it that she was worried about? <|endoftext|>
eh, next time you meet her make sure you do it again. It's worth the wait. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! Did you end up making it work at all? <|endoftext|>
It's ok. I'm sure everyone there had a blast even if you did a little goofing. <|endoftext|>
I kissed my girlfriend while we were waiting for her to come home from work.  I don't think I would do that if it was my friend though. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been very difficult for you to go through. <|endoftext|>
I would have been terrified!  What did you do?  Did you call the police or something? <|endoftext|>
I hope not. Maybe they should have left a note so that you know not to do it again. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! You have some great people in your life. Did you have a great time? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I could go back to like that age. I was having a blast then. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I think we all say things we don't mean when we upset ourselves. If you apologize and make it up to him, I'm sure he'll forgive you. <|endoftext|>
Regrets are part of life and everyone makes mistakes. I'm sure if you apologize to her she'll forgive you. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness! I would have been so scared. Did you find out what it was? <|endoftext|>
What a relief! I bet that gave you a fright when you realized what it was. <|endoftext|>
Dang, I wish I had that kind of will power to help out. I always end up spending it on food or alcohol! <|endoftext|>
Where do you live? I'm in the South and we have a lot of homeless people here. <|endoftext|>
I do not have any children. But I hope that it will be like that for me someday. <|endoftext|>
That is so lucky! I have a son and I would love to have a daughter. I'm glad you feel so lucky. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes it is difficult to remain true to oneself. <|endoftext|>
I agree with that. There are so many people who are not better than you and that makes me sad. <|endoftext|>
OH no! Did you give it a try and let it drive for a little bit? <|endoftext|>
I wouldn't either. People on their phones drive like drunk drivers. It's really dangerous. <|endoftext|>
That's great! What kind of group are you in? Are you trying to lose weight? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you have people to turn to for support. It's great to have a strong support system to help you through hard times. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I bet you were.  Was it hard to take?  And how did you do once you took the test? <|endoftext|>
Heck yeah! I glad you passed. You will be flying out of that place in no time. <|endoftext|>
Omg I love Christmas cards, especially the old ones. Did you find any that meant a lot to you? <|endoftext|>
Not at all!  I am the same way.  I have kept things for years because I am so sentimentally attached to them.  You are lucky to have such thoughtful friends! <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear about your loss. I'm sure your brother is enjoying looking through it now. <|endoftext|>
Right, some people just have it way worse than others. I'm glad you see it in a positive light. <|endoftext|>
Did you trip over a cord, or were you trying to get into the dressing room? <|endoftext|>
Well, that's okay. It could have been a lot worse. Did you get hurt? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, is it a big secret or not that big of a deal? I wouldn't feel guilty if it were me. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that is sad. Well, I hope things work out for the best for her and her husband. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's too bad. Are you not a fan of the orchestra? <|endoftext|>
Did the other persons face look like he was having fun though? That's what I'm talking about. <|endoftext|>
Dang! I'm trying to learn now too! Congrats! You must be proud. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like it was a lot of fun! I'm glad she had a safe trip! <|endoftext|>
I remember when my kids were that young. It's so cool to see them grow up. <|endoftext|>
Well that's great. I'm sure she will enjoy that you are so excited for her. <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. Do you have the messy part of being a homeowner? <|endoftext|>
That's what my mom did when I was growing up, to make me feel better. I hope everything works out for you, though. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear about all of this.  It must be very hard for you. <|endoftext|>
It's always good to have a brotherly figure in your life. I'm glad you appreciate him so much! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear!  I have a couple of friends who have gone through the same thing. <|endoftext|>
I wish it was that way. I get so jealous when other people have happy relationships. :( <|endoftext|>
Wow, you must be so proud of him! I am sure it will all pay off. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, it can be tough to find inspiration and motivation sometimes, so that is awesome. <|endoftext|>
I hope you don't either. I like going out to eat. What are you going to eat? <|endoftext|>
Your boss sounds like a nice guy. You should take him out for dinner to celebrate. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope it wasn't too hard for you. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. I lost my mom last year in a car crash. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's awesome that your grandma was able to travel so much. I hope I can do the same when I get older. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that, at least she is in a better place now. I know how hard it is to lose a pet, they become a part of the family. <|endoftext|>
Enjoy it.  What are your favorite games?  Mine are COD MWII and Fortnite <|endoftext|>
Well that sounds like a good time. I am sure you are going to have a great time. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice. Sorry to hear about your father, but at least she's still with you. <|endoftext|>
Thank you for your kind words. I am still not over it, I am only 29. <|endoftext|>
A clam? What's that? I'm sorry, I don't know what that means. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I used to live like that too when I was younger. Did you ever confront them about it or did they just move on? <|endoftext|>
Dang, how long has your friend been over for? That's awesome that you have a friend that far away though <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. He must be really talented. Did you know he does it as a hobby or as a job? <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, that's so sad. Was it hurt at all? Cats have such a short lifespan, it's hard to imagine them going through that. <|endoftext|>
That is so awesome.  It is so heartwarming to hear stories like that. <|endoftext|>
What kind of bird is it? Did you manage to get it back to its original spot? <|endoftext|>
I hope it didn't fall on your head! That would be my nightmare come true. <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling, I'm still waiting to find out if I made it or not. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that is some really bad luck, but I am glad that you at least got it out of the way! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Mistakes happen. Are you going to apologies to her? If you do, you should make it up to her. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty bad. You should remind her every time so that you won't feel so bad. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did you end up having to go home and change?  That must have been so embarrassing! <|endoftext|>
Maybe, but I don't think I would like it if I wore a wedding dress and not one of those <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that.  I hope you don't have them anymore.  Did you have a traumatic one? <|endoftext|>
That is pretty scary. I am glad you got out of there unharmed though. <|endoftext|>
It's not just about stealing, it's stealing if you do it because you can't afford to buy food. I hope you learned your lesson, though. <|endoftext|>
Did you call your bank and report it? I'm sure they have some sort of refund policy. <|endoftext|>
I have never tried to do any kind of meditation.  How did it work out for you? <|endoftext|>
That's good, do you think you will be getting in trouble if you don't follow the rules? <|endoftext|>
Where are you going? Are you going to a new place or away from family? Holidays are always so much fun! <|endoftext|>
That is so exciting! I bet the kids would love that. I hope you get to go. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's exciting! When are you expecting to find out your acceptance? <|endoftext|>
Law school... Wow. That takes a lot of discipline. I hope it works out for you. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun! What's your favorite cookery to make so far? I love chocolate chip! <|endoftext|>
I'm also a vegetarian, but I do like a good steak every once in a while. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness!  That must have been amazing to see!  Did anyone record it? <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hope it didn't hurt to much. That would have sucked to clean up. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is huge!  I bet he is growing up so fast.  How are you feeling about it? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I'm sure it was tough, but it sounds like it was good for everyone involved. <|endoftext|>
That is good, you can't have that kind of faith in a relationship. I love mine too, we've been together for over 10 years now. <|endoftext|>
What a nice person you are! I'm sure she will appreciate it. Maybe you can make her a birthday cake too! <|endoftext|>
Ohh, that's disgusting. I would've cleaned it off with a shovel. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you didn't have to go to work with that! On the bright side you can use that as a motivation to lose more weight. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Have you called him/her to ask for a break on the rent? <|endoftext|>
That is great. It is good to see that people are starting to care about the well being of others. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Glad you were able to make use of your skills to get it fixed. <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I'm glad you got it sorted out! A new car is a new car :) <|endoftext|>
Dang, you must have been excited. Are you going to go to her class again? <|endoftext|>
What will you get her?  I can't wait to see what she gets her next! <|endoftext|>
Why did you do it?  were you just trying to be mean to them or stealing for the thrill of it? <|endoftext|>
What a wonderful surprise that you received! Pokemon cards are so fun! I bet you really enjoyed looking at them. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. How are you coping?    "What's going on"?" is an unfortunate way to say it. <|endoftext|>
Great! You must be very proud of him. I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. <|endoftext|>
It was a lot of fun. We used to play all kinds of games. My favorite was flashlight tag. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. flare can be frightening. I hope he will get better. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of you to do that. Did they have a microchip in them? <|endoftext|>
I would have been so scared! I'm glad they both made it out okay. That could have been really, really bad. <|endoftext|>
What does that mean exactly? Do you not like the taste of pineapple on pizza? <|endoftext|>
That's great! You should be proud of yourself and the hard work you put in. You should feel proud that you worked so hard. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that must have been embarrassing. I hope they weren't too embarassed. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you all still laughed about it! It's the little things that make the heart grow fonder. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that is a lot of milk. How did you get sick? And what caused you to drink that much milk? <|endoftext|>
Dang, well I hope it at least tasted good! I've never tried it. <|endoftext|>
Well, that's not a very nice thing to do. Did you confront your friend about it? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Friends come and go in life, it's up to you to determine if you want to reconcile with them or not. <|endoftext|>
I feel you. That is why I am going to be a stay at home mom. <|endoftext|>
Are they making you feel bad for not being able to do what you wanted to do with your life? <|endoftext|>
I agree with you. I think she is trying to be helpful but at the same time she is annoying. <|endoftext|>
Please do and good luck! I know it's going to hurt a lot but it's probably worth it in the long run. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling, I hate it when that happens.  Do you know what causes it? <|endoftext|>
Dreams can be so bizarre sometimes. I hate when they interrupt your life. <|endoftext|>
Hey that's great! I have been there before and it can be hard to find motivation sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Yeah. She's not the same as she was in the past. It's weird to see her sober. <|endoftext|>
I would be so scared to do that. Were you afraid at all going into it? <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I hope you have many more trips like that in the future. <|endoftext|>
Success is a great goal to have! I'm sure you will! What do you love about life? <|endoftext|>
What is the name of your album? I may have heard of you before, I listen to a lot of music. <|endoftext|>
Me too! I love new ideas and I'm always on the look out for new things to try. <|endoftext|>
Dang! I couldn't agree more. I love the fact that I don't have to wait for the end of the day to find what I want on the internet anymore. <|endoftext|>
Meditating is very therapeutic, I'm glad you like it so much. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes I have trouble focusing on something for too long too. It's a vicious cycle. <|endoftext|>
I understand. loneliness can feel quite debilitating. But, it can also give you the opportunity to discover new hobbies that can be enjoyed by others. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it is good to take a moment to appreciate what you have, even if it is little. <|endoftext|>
That's an interesting feeling. Do you feel like you have a lot to control in your life right now? <|endoftext|>
I know it seems like it always seems to go that way, but I'm sure there are some things that you are just unlucky about. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I am skinny too but feel more comfortable with what I have grown. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! Keep up the good work. Do you have any goals or ambitions in life? <|endoftext|>
Are you excited about it? Camping can be a lot of fun if you're prepared for the weather. <|endoftext|>
As bad as it can get, you have to prepare for the worst. I hope for the best for you. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a surreal experience. I wouldve been scared to go through that myself. <|endoftext|>
I hope it wasn't too much of a hassle, and that you got your stuff back! <|endoftext|>
That is a very good thing that it wasn't a flat tire and that you made it safely to the repair shop. <|endoftext|>
That is great, at least you didn't have to buy a brand new one! My husband had a similar problem, but it wasn't his fault so he got a new one as well. <|endoftext|>
Thank you for being nice to that poor cat. It's very kind of you to help it out. <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. Hopefully you won't have to deal with anything like that again in the future. <|endoftext|>
God is always there for you and always will be. Never stop believing in him! <|endoftext|>
Exactly! You need to enjoy the now and then or you will feel sad and have nothing to look forward to in the future <|endoftext|>
That's awful. What do you do to try to stop that feeling? I have found drinking a bit of water and then holding my breath helps a lot. <|endoftext|>
Do you have insomnia? That's an anxiety disorder characterized by persistent tiredness <|endoftext|>
Ah, I know that feeling. What was it that made you feel that way, exactly? <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. I have social anxiety and it's hard to meet new people. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so relaxing! I need to take a self-restraint soon too. <|endoftext|>
Dang! That's the worst. I hope it wasn't too expensive of a fix! <|endoftext|>
That's the spirit! Food is the gateway to weight lifting. It's all about nutrition! <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing! I wish I could take some of that all for myself. I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|>
I am the same way. I try to research what is a good deal and make sure I am buying from a reputable seller. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that's a good way to put it. They live off of people's money. <|endoftext|>
Dang, how old is she? I feel like that should be reserved for when she becomes a teenager haha <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I hope you didn't get it on camera, I would if I were you! <|endoftext|>
Never heard of them, I'll have to check them out. I like listening to music you can hear while you're exercising. <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean. I feel like I should start a band just to have some friends. <|endoftext|>
Driving is a lot of fun. I love being in control of a large amount of speed. <|endoftext|>
Hope you didn't have to use your credit card to get it fixed! Those things are not fun! <|endoftext|>
That's horrible. Did you report it to the police?  Did they do anything about it? <|endoftext|>
That is a lot of money, I hope you can get it all cleared up. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate it when that happens. Especially when it's something you really wanted. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, how did you realize that? Due to your roommate's lack of respect? <|endoftext|>
Oh geez! Maybe you should go out and have a nice, quiet dinner with just the two of you. That's what I do. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that she gets better soon and that you guys can spend more time together. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. It's those people that take advantage of those in the worst way possible. <|endoftext|>
Well, it's good that you're looking out for your best interests. I'm sure you'll be able to find a good therapist to work with you. <|endoftext|>
How long have you been working on it?  I'm sure you'll do fine if you just prepare really thoroughly. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a promising opportunity for you. Hopefully they will be hiring a lot of people. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope that doesn't happen to you too often. I assume you left it in the trunk? <|endoftext|>
Well, I am one of them. I am a faithful man. I have never cheated on my wife. <|endoftext|>
I remember those days!  Are you a sophmore or a junior?  What are you studying? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine! I hope you do well though. Health care is so important and can be a big part of the lives of many. <|endoftext|>
I hope you didn't get too mad at him for it? He did sound pretty scary. <|endoftext|>
So you just went back to sleep and didn't say anything? I think I've done that before too lol. <|endoftext|>
What did you steal from your house? I hope you didn't get in trouble for it. <|endoftext|>
A computer? That's so cool! What are you going to do with it? <|endoftext|>
That is so exciting! I'm sure everything is going to turn out just fine. Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
It must be such a proud moment for you. I wish you and your baby all the best! <|endoftext|>
It really was. What was your favorite part about it?  For me it was the giving and receiving part. <|endoftext|>
I know right. Its like we are living in the past. A lot of times I wish I could go back to that time. <|endoftext|>
I hope he didn't get into your room! That would be super scary. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. You should find a way to make it up to him somehow. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you call the police? Walmarts have surveillance cameras in their parking lots. <|endoftext|>
Seriously! I am so sorry that happened to you. People can be so cruel. <|endoftext|>
What's your favorite candy? I love sour patch and lolly patch myself. Ordering a bag of those from the store never feels the same. <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh, I love sour candy!  Why did you stop eating it? <|endoftext|>
That is great to hear. What did she get sick with? I hope it is not contagious. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure she will! Kids have amazing ability to remember things that are really important to them. <|endoftext|>
Dang! I wish I had a cool friend like that. Did you do anything cool with it? <|endoftext|>
Wow! That sounds like something that would be fun to see in a sci fi movie. <|endoftext|>
That really sucks.  Where are you guys going?  I can't wait to take my kids when they are older so we can go. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that! Maybe you guys can plan something for when he isn't at work? <|endoftext|>
That is so true! I always try to give back to the community I live in. It makes me feel good. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's been a rough year for me financially, but I think things are looking up for me this year. <|endoftext|>
That's terrifying! I hope you took off as fast as you could! I would've booked it the second I saw it. <|endoftext|>
I am glad you have not seen any. I hope you don't have to see any more in the future. <|endoftext|>
What subject is the test in? I'm sure you'll do fine if you studied. <|endoftext|>
Well at least you are studying, that's more than a lot of people do.  I hope you do well on your test! <|endoftext|>
