oh my gosh that sounds so scary ! how old were they ?
i am sorry to hear that . . it sounds like you had a good life though . . i hope they are doing ok now
wow . that ' s awesome . do you think we got the same grade ?
yes it was scary . my friends told me to say anything because i was so frightened and to not think about it . the time was very sad though .
oh man , i ' m sorry to hear that . that ' s a tough one to get involved with . do you have a girlfriend now ?
oof thats a tough one . but im glad you guys made it through
cool ! what concert ? who ' s playing ? i love going to concerts .
u2 is such a great band , i can ' t wait to go . i love u2 .
oh no that is so sad . . . . i know it is so sad , but i don ' t know how to feel . i hope the parents find some hope and believe in !
i feel really sorry for the kid , i also don ' t feel sad because i have been there myself and done that , i just want them to be saved
how sad ! that is so sweet of you . was he okay ?
oh wow , how did it turn out ? and how did he feel ?
oh wow , how long until you find a full time job ?
when does he find a full time job ? i ' m sorry to hear that .
hey that ' s a first for me . how did you end up doing where you were ?
now that ' s pretty scary ! but you should make sure that you have a waterproof waterproof handgun , and a super rad camaro , for when you get home !
o really ? that is such a big congratulations . i hope its for good reason .
i ' m so happy for you ! it ' s nice that you finally have your parents to visit , are you going to visit them soon ?
that is not nice of him . what did he say ?
that is so awful , is there any way you can bring it up to him about the accident and tell him that you were there ?
i at least at least , that ' s a bit of an bonus hahaha . at least now you can use your own money to buy another one lol
i can ' t help but think you might have gone blind a little hashiqualifications there , man .
why that ' s not a good thing . i am sorry . did you say something ?
oh wow , i would definitely tell her , if she knew you were loyal and honest she wouldn ' t have made a big deal out of it ! there is someone out there for everyone !
how what do you want to tell me ? have you taught him to speak ?
you hit the salary bump really easily , too . i would suggest selling the house . it will be so different
awww , why don ' t you ever call them ?
that ' s so sad to hear . have you tried looking up local facebook groups ?
i would say that people who are unruly get irked because they don ' t want to be consequences for their actions . some people just think they have it all figured out .
i ' m sorry you have to deal with that . i hope that you get the chance to sit on the game and try to teach him that he shouldn ' t do that
oh , wow ! i can ' t believe that you found one in your hair . what did you do ?
how did it go ? what happened ? ? did you two discuss it ?
oh i ' m sorry to hear that ! i ' m glad it went well for you though !
oh i bet ! what was the most exotic moment in life for you ?
that is a great feeling . i remember that feeling too . but , not for me . i waited so long for my second child . i hated it .
very interesting . that ' s a strange word to use , actually . have you been in that situation ?
what oh my goodness , i ' ve never heard of this , i guess i just need to start doing more research on this . i have never been in a situation where payment of a lot of money has come through and come out like , this . it is so reassuring . i guess i need to be more optimistic and less hope that things will work out .
what happened ? what happened ? ! i can ' t even begin to imagine .
oh wow , that ' s awful ! my family is the most important thing to me ! but still it ' s good to hear that you can remember and remember good times .
lol . maybe you should try listening to some books and see how your outlook is
wow , that is amazing ! i have always felt that way as well
what a wonderful birthday you had ! happy early birthday ! what did you end up doing you in the end ?
oh my , that sounds pretty awesome ! i bet you were really excited to see that .
you must be lonely , are you talking about the girls or the boyfriend ?
you should not make it a game of social islands , it is not a fun way to live
hahahaha thats cool , that is good stuff
oh my gosh , i had no idea that was how they worked out ! that ' s so cool . so many people just share the same names now , so that ' s what kids are now .
what does that mean ? sounds interesting . what did you decide to eat ?
i think you need a less stressful day though ! it ' s a lot of fun if you ' re just getting a little bit of groceries to get the feel of it !
omg , it sounds so wonderful ! how long ago was this ? were you able to visit him ?
i think you ' re awesome for being so fortunate to visit a child again ! i ' m sure it was an amazing moment in your life .
tell me about it , i believe in that as well .
my mom went easy on him . we ' ve always been really close and we ' ve always been very close . she knew we would have problems growing up , but she knew our backs were against our backs . it ' s so much easier than you ' d think .
what happened ? don ' t feel ashamed . if you treat everyone the way they treat you then you won ' t have to worry about them anymore .
oh yeah - i remember that in 6th grade . i felt the same way as you , until i actually worked it out with a teacher . if i wanted to be an outcast , i would have had to work to get them fired or let go . it was a tough classroom .
i am sorry you feel so nostalgic about that .
wow , that ' s a big accomplishment ! what does it take to become a part of the group ?
absolutely ! i ' m absolutely passionate about what you ' re saying . i ' m not saying everything is impossible , but it wouldn ' t be good if it was . but , i can see why you ' d want to be ready for the next opportunity . you sound like you are ready for it . and i know it sounds dumb like i know everything , but if i had a few extra bucks to spare for that , i ' d certainly want to be ready !
my lifestyle choices have changed quite a bit over the years , and i want to try and stay away from that so that i don ' t have to live like an idiot . i definitely miss having food and clothes . .
what are you going to do about it ? how much ?
awww , that is really cute , how cute .
wow you must be so excited ! you ' ll be fine though
congratulations on your achievement ! so happy for you . i know what it ' s like to be on the road and achievement does come a long way .
those are very impressive . did you do the marathon as a kid ? i did one when i was still in elementary school . i still can ' t remember why i never did it then .
oh what an interesting story ! what did you tell him ?
ohh that sounds exciting ! does she now where you ? are you excited for her ?
me too . bullying is horrible . did you like your copy of the test article by anthony green ?
i agree . i feel like the media lately has tried to elevate and destroy the bullying ads on the side of school by making it seem like it ' s the girls fault and not the teachers .
you must be heartbroken , did she find out who did it ?
that is really heartbreaking . do you think your mother is still alive ?
how did you and your kids go ? how did you handle it ?
that sounds great ! it ' s always good to visit a place you grew up in and see your family !
oh how exciting for you ! are you gonna share it with your dad ?
that is so cool ! does he know where he ' s going to buy a new car ?
i do enjoy organize my house , but i like to work from home so i have a lot of space to do it .
my house is so huge that i just go through and recheck everything . my sister likes to throw out my old stuff so i need to do that for her .
yes , i do too . i don ' t understand why people don ' t go on about it when it ' s not necessary .
i do agree , email is much better in the long run . do you use gmail ?
oh , that ' s a sad situation . i ' m really sorry to hear that . did you guys resolved it ?
i ' m sorry about that . what was the reason why ?
wow , how happy for you ! congratulations . that must have been a real burden on you .
congratulations ! you must have been excited , but also excited to start your own adventures ! that sounds like a wonderful adventure !
oh , i know . i see that all the time in the books !
for sure ! i don ' t give in to homesick people at all . unless you have the potential to do something great and make a lot of money , nothing in any of that , you ' re going to do it .
why do you feel bad for what he did ? are you okay ?
oh wow . . i hope you are careful in the future ! if you need to go on a date , just tell your husband not to say anything about it .
what a guy ! what did you do when he called him ugly ?
what a sweet story . . . hopefully she was able to forgive you .
how do you feel about it ? if it is something you really care about .
yes , health can be taken care of , but it is hard to see and see .
it ' s so nice to look back at photos . i feel the same way every time i look at my son ' s pictures .
oh man ! i know what you mean . they ' re adults now , but it can feel the same as when they were kids , and it brings back good memories . they are ! i still find myself holding back a little bit on the time they ' re having , but practically they are adults now .
that is wonderful , i am sure that was a moment of confidence in yourself that you must feel cherished !
you can do it ! you ' ve got this ! take a long and hard pair of undies and put them in one piece ! or you can keep it as a show off !
oh , that sounds very complicated , why ? is it because you both work hard ?
oh wow , that ' s interesting . but congratulations to you both ! i hope things go well for you both .
how did that turn out ? did you talk to him later ?
did you go out and meet her ? ? is she famous ?
i am not familiar with at all with those - can you tell me a little bit about them ?
where are you staying at miramar beach ? are you staying with friends ?
didn ' t know you were turned down so sorry to hear that .
wow , how disappointing ! it ' s good you gave it a shot though , and it sounds like you really did want to go !
what ? ! what happened ? what was the situation ? !
what a strange situation haha . did you call the police ?
yeah , you did tell me about it . what happened ?
oh my god that sounds terrible ! why did she get tangry ?
did ? what did happen ? don ' t worry we all do it though . it ' s part of life 4 : u
why did they have a bottle of fireball ? you must have been pretty drunk ! !
no . what happened ? i am lost out on a great concert .
that sucks ! what concert did you end up going to ?
what couch was it ? maybe i can guess who ! tell me !
what ? i ' m not understanding , i can ' t understand how .
that is really cool . did he give you all of your favorites ?
that is very nice , how long have you been married ?
what subject did you answer ? ? : ) hows it go ?
i think i would probably have gotten it then too . that ' s cool
that never happened . how did it make you feel ? did you not want to tell me ?
what a stroke of luck ! you probably saved yourself a lot of lives . .
wow , how did your friend react ? did your friend understand when he kissed you ?
wow that sounds so far away ! i don ' t think i would know where to go with my relationship .
oh no ! that must have been so frustrating . did you get a new one yet ?
how many oh how many planes crashes have you had ? ?
does your friend know you ' re trying to get ahead of it ? if not , you should tell her .
oh wow . sounds like she really is growing up with him .
haha that ' s a cute image though . did she make you a wish to go back with her ?
oh my gosh , what did you do in that moment ?
do i know your baysong ? that sounds great . where are you going ?
wow , that sounds like a nice and serene escape from the east . where are you going ?
thats awesome . i hope she does really well this summer .
sounds like she ' s going to be doing great . you are a great parent .
thats so annoying , did you confront them ? on the bright side the owner of the store may view you as the wrong person ?
oh man that is annoying . did you ask the cashier to take the carts back ?
it must ' ve been an amazing day ! where did this come from ?
congratulations to you on the baby and your hard work . is this your first ?
that ' s pretty interesting . how long have you been reading the book ?
yes , that sounds interesting ! i ' ve never been into the craft but i do love the way you nail these types of things . do you know where you work as a voiceover actor ?
yeah it makes you feel like the person you are is good with and helping you too isn ' t even bad in the end .
yeah , that ' s true . you hit the nail on the head there . this is true , a lot of people don ' t have much choice but to be like this anyway . if you can ' t offer anything to the basic necessities , you can ' t make them . that ' s why i was thankful for the move in the first place .
you really had such an amazing time going through that ! what an amazing experience .
how that is an awesome movie . did you enjoy it ?
you must be so excited ! was this a surprise surprise to her ?
oh , i hope your mother ' s day is still going strong and that you get to hear about it next year . how old is she ?
i don ' t know . i will be visiting her for a check up .
i don ' t remember feedback . i was written off pretty easily .
well , they did give me feedback that i should work harder next time . but that was quite a let down .
congratulations . that is exciting . what a special time in your life . what are you going to do with the baby ?
my niece got pregnant about 5 months ago but i didn ' t hear anything about her pregnancy until she turned 6 weeks old . she was a woman when i was 6 years old .
i tried to find a movie , but it was late and i had to be brave to watch it on the worst provider available .
netflix . i watched some cartoons on there . im not sure what to do now
oh wow i ' ve heard that before . i ' ll have to check it out .
oh wow ! you are quite brave . i would have been so annoyed . but i am happy for you .
wow ! what a relief . congratulations ! i hope you enjoy your little winning and that you can use it on something better when in doubt .
good job . traffic is the worst . i hope that you are doing well well today .
it ' s frustrating when people do that . what did you do ?
oh no . where you too young to know how to move ?
was the grudge any good ? i ' ve never been able to watch the film as an adult .
she sounds like a hard worker . how did she get honors ?
that is great , how long have you been friends for ?
aww , that ' s nice . what color did it turn out to be ?
i hope it ' s nothing serious ! but i think you will be fine ! maybe it ' s your timely older style of tripping !
oh that ' s so cute ! is it a boy or girl ?
i would be so excited too ! good job ! so what were you planning on doing with the puppy ?
your parents are such good parents . i hope you are doing better now that you have them there .
how are you happy about your parent ' s bought you groceries ?
how well for you and your family , thats great . it is important to encourage and encourage everyone to follow the hype .
congratulations . i know it takes some good work to learn how to read english
ok now you are just jealous of him right ? that is very immature of you . you should be happy for him not only but also for you ! i would be jealous too !
you know , there ' s also a lot of money in the middle too , it ' s just hard to justify a place for one thing or another
how interesting . what were you thinking ? are you going to school for studying or teaching ?
how good for you . how big of a success do you think you will be in that field ?
nothing , i can ' t really . i feel really bad , since i am not swimming . i just want to see if anyone has ever had heard of it .
i don ' t think i ' m able to speak or write because it keeps deleting me . i already complained to them , need to go to the police .
did you have any other choice ? where you happy with the money ?
what happened ? was your best friend telling you to stay with him ?
congratulations ! ! ! i hope you have a fun time with them !
toys r us was closed ? did you guys have lots of toys ?
oh toys r us is closed now ? my husband likes toys myself , they have great value for his money .
i bet that was nice looking back on the past . what old stuff did you see ?
oh wow , i ' m very behind on facebook myself , as well ! it is really a wonderful tool for sharing who are you with and sharing how you had been .
haha i ' m in the 90 ' s - and i am actually a millenial ! it ' s a shame how facebook went off the deep end . i kept using it to forward to my friends who were around me as if they weren ' t awkward millennials and who used it to pursue what i did . what a simpler eharmony personality .
you ' re not a good person then . bullies should be removed from the school
i tried to stay away from dumb terms like post secondary but they are too easy for me . i had to pick my words better since they were dumb . i feel bad now for speaking dumb . in a way i feel better now .
when does this movie come out ? where can i find the movie ?
me impossible . i haven ' t seen it yet . . but once maybe i will . so how are they doing it ?
did you try to change your parents ' s ways ? maybe you aren ' t the only one .
well you can buy a pizza . may i say come on .
because the people who clean up after themselves are clearly in very poor need of respect and mind control
okay , you are getting kind of dark . can you kindly tell me what it is ?
wow . . i ' m sorry to hear that . i lost a friend last year to cancer . what happened ? !
i ' m so sorry to hear that . what an tragic story . it ' s hard to be apart from family .
oh no , what a beautiful and cute name ! i ' m glad she is in a better place .
oh that ' s a cute name . what are you the kiddo of that ?
oh that sounds very exciting ! i hope you taught your husband full time . how long does he work ?
well amazing . its nice . what type of car did you want ?
you must have been very grateful for your parents , you must feel grateful for them !
oh yea i have ! and it ' s always a good idea , like the one you described . do you know where you 5 years from now ?
oh yes i love surprise parties . parties with lots of food and gifts !
oh no , that must ' ve been very inconvenient . how did it shut down , do you know ?
oh really ? i ' m sorry to hear that ! were you ok at all ?
wow . . i think you must be pretty smart . what happened ?
wow ! that ' s amazing ! ! and you studied hard too ? ?
i do not , what kind is your pet ? ? and ?
oh yes that ' s me too ! i hate being up all night and having to turn off the alarm !
congratulations to him ! what an accomplishment ! are directly behind him in the company of society , your son !
you must be very proud of him , but you must be very much disappointed in his performance .
oh my , how could you do that to yourself ? i ' m sorry you went through that .
oh no , i ' m so sorry that happened to you . are you doing better now ?
that ' s really impressive . what kind of business is it ?
oh wow ! that sounds amazing ! i ' m a huge chairuats fan , but i hope i can follow his path as well as you do . how do his beans hold up to his legendary illy ?
haha . . . you seem like a really nice person you are , mom . how long ago did you packarding your mom ?
hey , you ' re fine . everyone makes mistakes when they open up their gifts . that ' s how we learn !
i love that ! there is always some stuff on that shows where you can throw it in a box and it stays for a couple days . i do that a lot .
like a dream ? yeah , i think that happens to me all the time ! what a weird feeling . what is it about it that makes you feel 90s feel so nostalgic ?
i hear that all the time ! have you ever been able to talk about it again ?
what happened to your cat ? i am sorry to hear that .
oh no ! i am so sorry ! that is so terrible !
oh man , thats sad , sorry to hear that , please tell me it doesnt bother you anymore . tldr had a dog for 5 years and it dosen ' t know how to walk and cry right now
not exactly dying but definitely not dying . i haven ' t been feeling that good since she had to pass away 2 years ago .
i think you , i , on the other hand , know this story .
i ' m sorry you were so afraid and scared to eat something that was not cooked very well . was it the really really big bad version of the oyster ?
oh my god , how did you do that ? that is too good to be true .
it is such a bizarre but funny time period . how did you find out the later ?
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . why did he break up ?
oh i ' m sorry to hear that . i know its hard to leave a partner . i think you would have to make all his decisions for the moment .
oh wow , that ' s a tough one . well i wish you the best of luck ! long distance is an amazing idea . i hope it goes well !
when that does sound like a lot of work . i had a long distance dog as a kid , and it was hard . so long as you guys have a safe home , i think long distance will be nice for you . but just give it a few years . i was long distance and it was hard but filthout until i made it a little bit less hahaha . i was able to sell my website and get a bunch of new fb friends to sign up to facebook and facetime
have you found out what her style of personality she is yet ?
oh my ! ! that ' s sad ! what is the reason for the change ?
i believe you will find someone soon enough . when is her birthday ?
good for you . maybe i am a bit jealous , but i am glad you are confident about your first date !
that ' s cool . well my best birthday was when i invited my best friend to watch the avengers infinity war movie . he really did humbled me !
my best birthday was when i cooked my friend & i on the couch eating eating delicious chicken broccoli and dip my toes into a smoothie . it was a treat .
i wish i can help you . so you can help someone else
what happened ? was it an argument over a new policy against another company ?
oh really ? that ' s terrible . what happened ? do you think you have anywhere safe you can stay sled by ?
that would be scary . do you know what happened to them ?
yes , i do not . do you like the feeling of being nimble ?
oh lord . how can you afford that ? ! i am already talking to my husband about it .
how so where do you live ? i could imagine that you would be extremely grateful to her !
you actually , you seem like a awesome mom . i do not have a mom like that , but i really am lucky to have one .
how i i guess it has happened . i am never vegan and never will be . so when i ordered pizza tonight i didn so hopes and vibes for some new pizza in the mail tomorrow . i can ' t wait
i thought i was pretty sure i had done everything i needed to and came back to the fail point . oh well , maybe i can get better tomorrow
oh that ' s cool ! i hope you get it !
not yet i dont think i ' m really good at it
what ? ! ! that is a horrible thing to hear ! are you scared that you can ' t have another person ?
oh man , i am so sorry you are going through this . maybe its time to bring it up to her .
i ' m working on becoming a student . i know i can do it and my husband is still very young .
i ' m a freelancer , but i make more than enough to keep me going . i do feel a little under appreciated , but even that might be overtaken by the the payign of having a little busyness in the job market .
what is your major ? it is definitely important to make a good plan to pass the time .
no you ' ll be a true survival type and will always need a source of food , health and emon , you got this !
what movies do you watch so often ? i sometimes enjoy some like don ' t sleep with me alone
my daughter is about to turn 3 and i think we might finally watch one of these around christmas time . it is a lot of fun to watch and see them during the day ,
ok , well that ' s cool . i love alex authority films . i was learning how to play with my kid growing up .
hmm . . i really like scary movies that are funny . i like evil dead . i ' m looking forward to it now .
we all make mistakes when we see the world , we have to make them right .
im not sure what place you live but im sure its ok if you keep up with the news
whoa awesome . congratulations ! you are definitely doing the right thing . it ' s paying off
nice ! you must have a really strong net worth , i bet you will do great !
oh that ' s fun . what do you like to do for a love ?
what did he treat you to ? it sounds like you have a great relationship .
yea i do , it helps keep you motivated ! ? how old are you ? sorry if you ' re old
oh that ' s a very complicated statement to speak in full person
i am so sorry . what happened ? did you try to work it out ?
just be confident in your abilities and make your dreams come true . you know , that way your wife won ' t be disappointed .
in about 2 weeks . . . how long , though ?
they provided pictures of the menudo nexus in the game market , when you use the app for it . it ' s very exciting to read about it now .
that ' s very nice . is she in a good place ?
aw that ' s nice . i actually did the same for my dad . . . he spent most of the time going to the bank for me
im so sorry to hear that . . . . i know how that feels . im sure you fact he was very sad for a long time .
i ' m so sorry to hear about your loss . i hope that you have a plan to live with him by the end of the year .
what car did he get ? hope you get it soon .
you should probably get a new one if you are allergic to one of those
what did you meet her for ? if you don ' t mind me asking ?
my first girlfriend was pretty special . she made me very happy , so i ' m happy for her . and you ?
how do you feel about yourself ? you sound so happy , so many people hate their parents . . .
yes , we are very close , it was a huge experience .

i ' m happy for you ! are you still in college ?
wow , congratulations ! you are an inspiration to many ! i am too . . too much work and too much stress
was it for an injury ? how did it go ? how did it go out ?
haha ! that is a great surprise , but i am sure everything is probably going to be hard to finacial
i feel i dont know enough about horse house to know how it feels
i feel that , i ' m going to be alone until the youngest kids go back to school
you must be so excited ! but are you confident ? it must be really hard to win , but you must practice .
wow , congratulations ! that will be exciting ! ! ! i am sure you will win
what is his age ? did you find anything that can help him ?
gosh , how did your wife get them in that condition ? does she keep them for a special occasion ?

very interesting . well , hopefully you ' ll never lose that two arms and a wife as long as you ' re well homeschooled- it was no heart breaking@ broke with either of you .
your son is a lucky guy ! what did you do when he took it ?
that ' s amazing , most students don ' t have loans until their parents pay them back ! sounds like he ' s lucky he took it .
hey you should do it ! it ' s for the best if you don ' t fear trust me !
oh no . are you kidding me . have you heard of shame ?
i do . it is a new stage in which you have to summer to go and play . there are so many options !
first off i was actually just on the advice of my coopers the other day and lost my job due to a health getting out of hand ! lol . this was a big loss for me . i lost my job due to a health issue but it was replaced by a great paying job .
sorry to hear that . what is the wrong order ? is it an error in preordered coffee ?
i love a mozz mozz mozz , like the spanish version of it .
that is amazing , but , was it for the school , or his graduation ?
congratulations to him ! and what a great news to hear ! i bet you must be proud !
that ' s awful . were you able to fix it ?
yesh , it happens to the best of us . pizza isn ' t the only thing that make you feel vulnerable .
you have to go to the manager , and give it to them right away !
why do they always get my order wrong ? i have never had any mcdonald ' s have it wrong .
ok then , why do you think you lost them ? !
did you give him your money back ? i am pretty sure you should give him more money back
oh no ! are you okay ? just try to not to rush it out .
oh wow ! that must have been a sight to wake up to !
what what exactly do you say about it ? sounds familiar to him ?
these words break my heart . do you feel like they are helpful to improve your skill set ?
what was the reaction ? ! ? ! ? congratulations ! how old is the baby ?
oh my gosh i love that you got that on the back of an envelope ! that is a great surprise . lol
what ! ? that ' s too bad . what was the reason ?
are you serious ? he will learn eventually . i hope he did ok , best of luck with it !
oh i thought you said without prayer without telling you where you live . . . lol ? how do you think , did you do okay ?
sounds more difficult you had to go through prayer than cancer though . . lol . sounds pretty impressive though
oh wow that ' s really cool ! where was he at exactly ?
wow , blind people can pretty much play any instrument . does he still have the same slight of honor as you do about being a blind man , as you used to be able to feel .
that is unfortunate . what kind of car ? what is the cost to fix ?
oh no ! that ' s awful ! what a pain in the rear ! hopefully you have a fix for it> mitskin > !
oh wow ! that is amazing ! your son will be an awesome man .
how wonderful ! wow , that ' s a huge amount of work ! you must be excited . you must be a brilliant owner . congratulations !
how come ? are they not afraid to give advice ? do they really know anything about what they are doing ?
i heard he was 92 years old when he did that .
30 years that is a long time to prison . are they going to turn in your friend ?
oh no ! he seems quite the thief . . but why not this beautiful mask he has on ? i hope you will help him after all this .
how exciting ! he must be so excited ! are you a big player ?
congratulations to him ! how old is he ? used to he be young ?

where exactly ? you must ' ve been on something big recently , congratulations !
i used to be a simple man myself , until i got pregnant
i remember when we were told what was going to happen in my house we all said we were going to get bit and everything ended up just staying away from the house for a few days .
i don ' t blame you , that must have been scary ! i don ' t have a basement but i have a tree outside my window
that ' s too bad . i really wish i had a good mom like your mom !

oh dear . . i hope he learned his lesson and will be less afraid once he is asleep .

it ' s ok , i ' m sure no one else would care !
what is it exactly ? i never understand what you are talking about
that is funny , maybe there is a way you can pay her back ?

that is so annoying ! that is very annoying . i am sorry
i ' m sorry , that is a very big dog . did you call the landlord ?

i ' m sorry that your son is not going well now . was there any reward for it ?
this sounds like you really do care about him , that ' s great .

oh that ' s sad ! why didn ' t you wash it to the last part ?
yeah , it ' s hard to really go back and look at all the big changes that are made . what did you end up doing ?
exactly ! if kids can ' t afford what they ' re paying for it ' s too late .
oh , that ' s wonderful ! are you still poor ?
oh no ! poor baby ! how did it turn out ?

oh no , i ' m so sorry ! you have to give yourself a little time to prepare and take your mind off it . just relax and maybe try again later ?
yeah , that ' s a good idea . but it ' s hard seeing how he can still keep his attention while i can do nothing about it the next day .
yeah i guess i just need to be more aware of it and let it go .
awww , that ' s sad . what are you going to do ?
awwww , that ' s so cute . i like that you give him something to read instead of just watch .
it ' s not stealing if i earn it . i just felt so ashamed for it .
yes i agree . i felt bad for doing it because i thought they were the unneeded person at the time .
that ' s awful ! did you search for him ? did you find him ? even if you didn ' t find him , you may have to put up a lot of posters to help you find him .
i hope you find it , that is truly sad . have you gotten your dog back yet ?
that ' s exciting , what did she do there ? i know exactly what you are talking about .
what a lovely gift for your niece . why is she so far away ?

oh my god . . . how horrifying ! are you going to tell the cops ?
whos hoodlums ? i can ' t say i know much about bat sitting , but i ' m sure they ' ve probably had plenty of time to think about it . .
i ' m sorry to hear that . there ' s still a chance for you to find another job .
that ' s disappointing . i ' m sure you ' ll get something eventually , but it ' s still a little nerve racking getting the job .
haha , how did that happen ? did anyone see it ?
i can just picture this ! did you cry ? i feel bad for laughing .
that is no good , what is the purpose of that , you ' re the owner of that hair ?
she ' s just a cat . no big deal . it ' s cat sane .
cool , where are you going ? im sure you will have lots of fun !
i wish i could go there , but i am on a cruise
that must have been embarrassing . did they find out ? i think you should tell them at least
oh no ! what happened ? is it serious ? ! and i am so sorry , i know you must be really frustrated right now . do you have any advice ?
that is really awesome ! ! congrats ! what was the prize ?
wow congratulations ! that ' s awesome ! what kind of prize did you win ?

you did pick up your own mail ? that is good . was it a big package ?
oh no , that ' s so sad . what happened ?

oh wow , i ' ve seen my old friend in more than 20 years ! what do you call that friend ?
oh really ? how did it seem to happen ? i dont know about that haha
that is so strange , but interesting that children can be dangerous at that age .
ah , that ' s too bad ! maybe you can be a freelancer ?
oh that ' s unfortunate . i ' ve never done anything like that before . i hope everything will be fine .
do you think your aunt will be okay ? i hope not .
oh man , that ' s a big worry ! do you think she will come that far and so will your son ?
you can always start working , i know how you feel though . you can also try giving away your student loans ?
oh my goodness ! i am sorry to hear that ! maybe if you have some money and some self determination , you can be rich !
i agree . one thing i did find more annoying is that people bitch and moan about how they are getting what they want . . . when it really isn ' t them .
any reason why ? was it sudden ? and how long have you been out of contact with your family ?
wow ! have you considered looking in craigslist ?
its never too late you can ' t complain about that . dont be sorry . just make sure you look out for yourself !

wow ! are you still one of those kids ? how many years has it been you have ?
oh well good for you . i wish everyone was as nice as you are !
i do believe that if you focus on one person ' s personal life that you will find that they are the one person that deserves to be called a police officer and a grandpa .
you must be a great friend ! maybe give him a quilt to help him find his way back into the pontoon .
aww , that ' s so sweet . there ' s always next time ! just keep your head up and do what makes you happy : )
oh no ! poor doggy ! did you tell your dog ' s owner to be careful ?
how did the dog get mad at the man ? did the police take the dog ?

oh my lord , how did it go ? i am sure it was tough but it did get easier as you got older .
what happened ? did you have him back up with you ?
that ' s great news . what did you feed him ?
yes when i was little . i went to a nice school and every day after school we would go to the kids houses . i would go out in the park with a friend and get coffee . we would go school and come home to an almost empty house
yeah , when i was visiting my parents , my mother was visiting home from school . it was amazing to see my grandmother react to my visits ! i had such a great time .

i hope you will get it . have you done something that make you nervous ?
yes , i am not sure what that means . are you the confused part and curious part ?
no i haven ' t , how is that difficult ? have you had any problems ?
oh yeah when i was young they used to come down hard on me and act like saying excuse me , excuse me , excuse me .
oh , no that sounds annoying ! i ' m sure there are a lot of people who can tell it too . some of my daughter ' s go through the same issue .
what is your occupation now ? why did you have to help ?
i ' m so sorry to hear that . does she have much support right now ?

not yet , but we thought about it . they want to try and save net income
no , they don ' t . i don ' t ski either . do you skateboard too ?
oh no ! how late was the work you were at ?
no one else will remember that ? why did you forget to put them on ?
oh , did you try to help him out ? i ' m sure the owner was proud .
i agree ! so , did you ask for a second job ?

yes it does . it truly does . age really does play a huge factor in life ' s aling . it ' s just amazing how one little unique age can affect the entire life experience .

exciting ! i ' m sure you ' ll have fun watching your new place be flooded with people , even if it is just a small one- you ' ll probably also get some more fun hobbies that way !
that ' s terrible . what are you going to do ?
oh my goodness , i ' m so sorry that happened . i would be furious . that ' s not good .
are you certain you won ' t be a domestically ill ?
you deserve it . i wish i had food like that .

i bet you are so proud of yourself . you have no idea how difficult it is to create a good one . how did you afford it ?
wow how long ago was that ? did you see him again ?
i ' m sure that was a pretty special moment in your life . how did it make you feel seeing him ?
that must be very nice to have your family nearby ! how long have you been married ?
that ' s a good point . i feel like it ' s pretty normal to focus on yourself most of the time . i wonder if we ' re so lucky to have family in our lives ?
have you got a pet ? what kind ? i have a dog and i love them
oh i do ! my dog just gave me a little love too . my other one was actually named chris , but she passed away a couple years ago . do you have most of your pets have you ?
when will you start ? is it a college ? i don ' t know what that is .
yea , it really does feel like the end of summer this year .
as i say i am not judgemental i am able to fit every single day on my own . i have not once been either
i think you have to lower your guilt and badhistory at least . unless you have some sort of mental problem that gives you anxiety over it .
oh my lord , what are you planning to study ? the weekendof- thank heavens you already prepared .
that is such a difficult stage in life . i am sure you will do great .
wow , congratulations to him ! i hope he really likes driving that car !

what did you buy ? and why have you been saving up so long if you are fully healthy and everything is just going great ? wouldn ' t it be great if we all can do the same ?
those they are fun to drive they are very dependable and they last a long time
how oh my , was this the first time in your life that this happened to you ?
oh my , did you call the police ? i would be really mad
how soon do they go away ? how many years ? ?
30 is still such a sweet age to go by , be happy thinking about it
oh that ' s awesome . what happened ? and what makes you feel better about yourself ?
good for you . i hope you feel better after you have worked out . are you going to the gym ?
what kind of restaurant was it ? i like working around the eat all area
oh ! i hope you didn ' t feel too bored ! that sounds good , i would have gone to the back door !
oh , i ' ve never tried thai food . i ' m guessing it should be very good .
okay so where does it go so far that it can be said that you can try everything ?
oh man ! why did he scared you ? what happened ?
that is so scary ! did you ask him why he scared you ?
do feel more ashamed than you already do . . . i ' m a little embarrassed about that . did you tell him what happened ?
yeah definitely . do you know if you can still do the boat boat training thing .
he did die in a tragic way , but he lived a great life .
yea i know it ' s hard to imagine what he went through . i hope he makes it through .
that is true . . . . . but it seems like they are always drawn to the 4rd image in the world , it would make a lot of sense to work to combat it
oh my congrats ! i am sure that is a lot to take apart your life . has she moved a lot ?
oh wow , that must have been a great visit . i bet that was so much fun .
you sound really lucky , what happened to your mate ? !

oh wow , that sounds like a lot of work . you must be really smart to be able to do that . how often do you do that ?
that is so cool . i had a kid too . mine started yesterday .

oh wow , i bet you were pretty excited ! did you find it
congratulations ! i ' m glad you found it ! what type of cat is it ?
that ' s really cool . is her dad around now ?
i sometimes admire people who reach out to others in need and stay away from regrets . i get tired of people being stuck in a bad situation and running from it , but i can appreciate the hard work she ' s put in to her self , and how kind and supportive she is !
oh yeah ? what show ? i ' m used to watching it alone now
oh cool . i ' ve never used hulu live before . it ' s always been so cheap to pay for it , has it been a long time since you have gotten it ?
did the cat have a good life ? how did the cat die ?
oh wow , how sad ! i ' m sure the animal control guys have a good story for you though .

i good luck to you all ! are you going to army or whatever it is you ' re doing at that time ?
why do you hate people being mean to animals ? __unk__ what makes them so difficult to treat ? probably the same reason why they call other people mean too .

oh , that ' s sounds like a wonderful time . i hope that you have a wonderful christmas weekend .
i remember christmas as a kid too ! i ' m glad we got to live in the moment and relax when we were younger .

that ' s smart . it ' s important to be prepared
we ' ve always been very prepared to a certain point in life . we did actually lose power in the middle of a hurricane , but it ' s good we at least had some coverage .
wow ! that ' s quite the reunion . is this sometime soon ?
wow , how interesting . i ' ve never use facebook , but i would imagine it is an easy social media experience

you are right that you must make sure the house is clean and everything is set up in order . but don ' t forget to appreciate the time you have until they arrive as they are always a little bit nervous before their arrival and that they have to be on their screens all the time before they go .

that is terrible . i had quite the hard time reading these talking heads stories about a test and how they treat hoopla over the words . what happened ?
do you know what is one of the three questions for the test ?
that ' s sounds like a wonderful memory . . did you get a chance to talk about it ?
not silly at all ! just because you found them doesn ' t mean it should be saved !
that ' s great that your brother got to keep it . that ' s a very important trait to have .
yours is probably at a different point now , right ? just remember to be very careful when you buy stuff like that . : )
did you tell that guy no longer enter the store ? how did you feel about that at least ?
oh man , i ' m so sorry that happened . it could have been worse .

it sounds like you have a good brother . is he going to be ok ?
my brother and i sold a house two years ago and had to sell it for a house . it was stressful and he really tried his best to help me , but it was really difficult .
o how nice of you to help her and give her a treeheartache ! you are so lucky to have her !
i don ' t understand how much that kind of relationship can be left behind . you guys seem to be really close , so i can ' t imagine how difficult that can be for you guys .
