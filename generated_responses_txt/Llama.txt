That's really scary. Were you in a vehicle?
That's good. I hope you got the sense to say sorry, but also don't feel bad about yourself.
Well, I am not sure. I do not know you
I'm glad I'm okay. That's just the worst!
That sucks, I am sorry to hear that.
That sounds great. It's always good to have someone to talk to.
Oh, that's awesome. What kind of music did you like?
That is awesome! I bet you were so excited!
Oh no, that is terrible.  How did she die?
That is so sad.  How is she doing now?
That's good, how did it happen?
What were you singing?
That's great news! I hope it's not a long time before you both have a steady income again.
What was it?
That is so sad. Were you able to get the police?
I know how you feel.
That is awesome! What are you going to do?
That's too bad.  How long have you been here?
That's a terrible thing to do. I would have been furious!
That's so rude. Do you know who got caught?
That's crazy. I'm sure you were disappointed.
I know, it's so frustrating.
That is very nice of you! I have been in a situation like that.
That is very kind of you, but you should have told her.
Oh that's awesome. I am jealous!
I'm glad we agree on something!
I understand, I live in a different country as well, it can be hard sometimes.
That sounds like fun! What did you end up doing?
I am so sorry that happened to you.  That is so not what I would expect from a parent.
That is so true! It's like, they are so young and they just don't understand the world yet!
I am with you. I hate bugs.
That's great. What was the conversation like?
That's good to hear.  I bet she's doing well.  You must miss her.
I bet you felt so happy!
That is very true, I am sure that feeling is very special.
I have, and I just got my taxes done.  It was a bit stressful, but it was worth it.
I've been there. I was in the military and I was in a bad place. I was in a bad place. But then I got out and I was able to get my life back on track.
that must have been tough
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope she recovers from it.
That is a good way to live
That sounds so peaceful.  Is that something you can experience in your life?
I am sure you were happy
Oh wow, that is so cool! I'm glad you had a good time!
That's really sad. I can't imagine having to live with all those girls.
I bet.  Are you going to your sister or mom?
I agree, and it is a nice feeling when you have a child that you can be proud of.
I had a baby boy and a baby girl. I always loved having them co-sleep.
I love that place. Did you go there?
Wow, I am impressed.  What was you doing on Sunday?
I have been in a similar situation once, it was so heartbreaking. I am glad you are thankful for your family.
I love this type of thing.  It's a great way to connect with kids.
I hope so!  I can only imagine how tough it must be for them.
I'm sure she was very understanding. I'm sure she was very patient.
I am so sorry to hear that. It's not cool to treat someone that way.
That is so sad. What happened to her?
I am so sorry to hear that.  Did you have a close relationship?
That's awesome! I've been working for a company that has a very different culture.
I am inspired by the fact that there is someone who actually cares. It's a great feeling.
I don't have the same issues as some people, but I'm sure it's very hard for others.
I bet she's getting to be a big girl.
That's not too bad. What do you do when you do go out?
I bet!  What was your time?
That was a great choice!  Did you have fun?
That sounds like a pretty cool experience!
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
Wow, she sounds like a bad person.
I agree. It's a horrible thing to witness.
I am sorry to hear that.  Is it a physical reaction?
I am sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is never easy.
Oh, I see. That is very nice of you.
That sounds like so much fun! Did you get to go on any of the rides?
That sounds so fun.  I live in the East and I've never been to Disneyland.
I am sure it was nice to reconnect with him.
I love cars. What kind?
I do, but I don't have a house.
I love labels and bins. I have a whole section in my kitchen dedicated to cleaning supplies and snacks.
I know what you mean. I have been doing that for years.
I think it would be great to have a universal way of communicating.
That's terrible. Why did it happen?
That's scary.  I'm glad you were able to resolve the issue.
That's a lot of change. But it's a great opportunity to make new friends.
I am so jealous! I love travel!
That's a common thing I see.  What do you mean?
You're right. Sometimes it's hard to see, but in the end, it's a good thing. You can't really regret the good things, though.
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope he has forgiven you.
That's a good thing you did.
Oh man. That's horrible. I would be so mad. Did you tell your mom about it?
That is a very nice thing to do, it's always nice to have someone's apology, it shows you care about them and not just a person.
I'm glad you are trying to take care of your health. I'm trying to do the same.
That's very true. I see a lot of people who do have one and they're very sad.
I can relate! My kids are grown now and I look at old photos and it makes me think about how far they've come.
I'm not sure, but I'm not sure I want to be a parent again.
I bet that was a fun experience for you.  Did you do it yourself or was it done by another person?
I feel you.  I've never been able to replicate a day that I was happy with.
I can understand that. Do you feel like you are in a good financial situation?
What is your part time job?
What happened?
Oh no, did you like him?
That sounds wonderful! I am jealous!
That sounds so beautiful. I've never been there. How many days do you plan to stay there?
Oh no! Was anything else going on?
Oh my god. That is so rude. I am so mad!
Wow, what happened?
That sounds really scary! Did you ever see him again?
Oh no what happened?
Wow, that's a pretty lame excuse! I would be very angry too.
Oh no! What happened?
I am sorry to hear that.  Did you end up getting in trouble?
Oh no, what happened?
That's a bummer. I'm sorry you didn't get to see it.
I bet it was a friend of yours?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.  Did he survive?
Oh wow! That is amazing! I love that he would surprise you like that!
That is so sweet of you! I bet he was glad you were so kind to him.
I am glad to hear that! You must feel pretty good about it.
Oh I think so, I'm not sure.
How did that happen?
That is crazy, I bet you were scared.
That is so rude! I would be so angry!
Oh, that is awful. I am so sorry. I bet you are still hurt.
That sounds awful! Did you call a repairman?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I was so frustrated and left my house!
That is not good.  What did you do?
That's not very nice of you.  I hope she finds someone who is a better fit for her.
I would be so shocked!
That is the worst! I bet she was shocked
That sounds great! What are you going to do while you are there?
Oh, I love the Gulf. I have always wanted to visit there.
That's awesome! How old is she?
Oh yeah, I remember that. I was so happy to be able to buy the things I wanted and not have to save up for them.
Oh wow. That's a pet peeve of mine too. I don't know why people don't clean up after themselves.
That's great, are you a regular at the store?
That is awesome!  Did you have any kids?
That is awesome! What are you waiting for?
That sounds really nice.
I have no idea what that is.  I'm not sure I understand it.
That is a good point, I think that is one of the things that I like about a leader that you can trust to know how to surround themselves with good people.
I completely agree with you.  It's so hard to find someone who will actually take risks and be honest with you.  It's like they want to get away with it!
I love baby belugas!
What a great movie. I have seen it several times.
That's great! What did you get?
That's great! You must be a very thoughtful person.
I think it was the guy who was supposed to pick up my car. He forgot.
Yeah, they did, they said I was too aggressive. I'm so upset!
I agree, we should learn from our mistakes.
I'm sure they will.  Is she pregnant with a boy or girl?
That is so sweet! I would have been so surprised if I had found out!
yea i was watching the show "black-ish"
I have heard of that series. I didn't watch it.
You're kidding, right?
Well, I'm glad you were prepared! It's good that you were confident in your case.
oh wow thats amazing, what were you doing?
I know, it's so annoying when it's bad.  I always hate when it's bad.
I am sorry to hear that.
I am sorry to hear that, but it is nothing to be scared of, there are people who can help you.
Oh yeah. I hate when that happens. I know it's not fair, but you can't help but feel like you have to see them.
That's awesome!  I've been struggling to get into college, but I feel like my best friend is really on track.  I'm sure she's got a good teacher.
That is so cool. I am glad you have a good friend.
I have never seen that happen before.
I'm sure it's not the problem.  You'll figure it out.
Oh really? What kind of puppy?
That is awesome!  What did you make?
That's very nice of them!  I'm sure it was a big help to you.
Well, I'm sure that's true.  I wish you all the best.
That's great, I'm always looking for ways to be more independent.
I'm sure you will be. Marriage is a great thing.
I'm sorry, that sounds very stressful
That's very smart of him.
I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future.
That's good.  What kind of doctor are you going to be?
I know right.  That would make me so sick.
What did you complain about?
That was very kind of her.
Oh wow, that's great! What city?
That is quite a lot of animals
That was such a sad time.  It was a time of great change.
What era are you talking about?
That's awesome. I can't believe it's been so long since my kids were born.
I understand, I think I will try to go back to Facebook as well, I don't have any friends there anymore
I am 30.  I was a kid in the 80s.  I had a pretty cool ride in my childhood.  A 1969 Camarosa.
I know right? I've had my share of bullies in school.
I did, but it wasn't easy. I got in trouble for being mean to my friend's kids.
I'm happy for you. How did it turn out?
I know, it's a terrible movie.
What do you do?
That's true. I'm always running around saving money for something, and sometimes I forget to save it.
That's a good question.  It's like they think they're going to have to clean up after their children one day.
I'm a peanut butter and jelly kind of guy.  I like my life simple and quiet.
That's awful. What happened?
Oh no, that is terrible. Did she hurt?
Oh my, that is very sweet.
I'm sorry to hear that. How did you heal?
That's really tough. What did you do?
What a wonderful person!  I'm glad you were able to get a ride.  Was it a new car or was it just a car that someone was willing to give you?
I'm glad people are kind, but sometimes people are not.
I have.  I think I did it for my 30th birthday.  It was a really nice surprise.
That's awesome! What a good year to do it.
I hate when that happens. I hope it was just for a short time.
That's nice. I don't have any lighters.
I bet you did well
Wow! That is a great score. What did you get it on?
Yes, I have a dog. I've always wanted a cat.
I have a cat too. I hate when they get out of their cage.
That is so awesome. I am sure he will do great things.
Oh wow. What's that?
That's so sad. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Did you stay in touch with your daughter?
Oh no, that's so sad. Did you see them?
That's really cool. What kind of business?
That's really cool, it's like you have to have a passion and a work ethic to do something like that.
That's terrible. I would be very upset with you.
That's pretty sweet, I'm sure she didn't think you were a jerk. I've got a cousin who is like that.
That's nice, I love that kind of gift, especially if you had to go to a good price
Well, I don't think I do, I don't know how people listen to radio anymore.
Yeah I know how you feel, I had a very close friend die of cancer last year and it was very hard to deal with.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I lost my cat about 4 years ago and it was so hard.
That is terrible. I hope he is ok.
It's always hard when we lose our pets.
Yeah, it sucks. I've been sick for weeks.
I would have been so grossed out.  Do you have any idea what caused it?
I am not a fan of shellfish either. I have had sushi with them before, but I have never had shellfish before.
Oh wow! That's crazy! I bet it was a funny one!
That is great. What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. It's not easy breaking up with someone, especially if you've been together for a long time.
That is a tough decision. Do you have any experience in the military?
I can understand that. It's a scary thought, but it's a good one to think about.
I'm not a fan of chameleons.
I'm sorry to hear that.  How did you find out?
What are you hoping for?
That's great. What's your name?
I hope you get to see her soon.
I'm not sure, but I do have a great one this year.
Oh wow!  That's a nice surprise!  What did you do with the tequila?
I'm not sure what you're asking.
That sounds terrible. I hope you guys can get over it soon.
That is really scary. Did you go outside to see what it was?
Oh no! I hope they are okay! I am so sorry to hear that.
Oh yes! I do! I love it!
I've never tried it before but I've heard it's good for you. What is it?
That's really nice of her, she sounds like a really good person.
I wish I had someone to love.
I am not sure, I am just feeling down.
I did not fail but I did not study much. I am going to study for my next exam.
That is amazing, I am sure she is very proud of you!
I do. I love my mom. She's the best.
I'm sorry to hear that.  I've been there.  It's always tough.
I'm sorry to hear that. How long will she be away?
I am trying to help my family with their financial troubles. It is hard to do but it is necessary.
I am very much paid well.
That's great. What are your plans after graduation?
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by passion in life. I'm not sure I want to be passionate about something
I know the feeling. I used to be scared of the dark too but now I just love it.
That is a good thing. I am glad you have that.
I'm a huge fan of the Hunger Games series.
I love the movie "The Conjuring"
I don't have any issues with that. I have no problem with him being president.
I am so tired of the liberal politicians and their policies.  I am glad they are not in charge.
Wow, that's exciting. You must be very proud.
That is cool. What field of engineering is it?
That is so great! I wish I could be that happy.
That's very sweet of him. What is his name?
I do, I love looking at old pictures of my family.
What a lovely story. I like to hear about my own mousters when they tell me stories.
That is awful.  Did you tell him about it?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?
I think you meant "How long?"
It was about a conversation I had with a friend.
That's very kind of her. I bet it was very expensive to get her to do that.
I agree.  I don't know what I would do without good people in my life.
That's terrible. Did he survive?
How did you make it through this tough time?
That's really bad, you should be happy for him.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it doesn't affect your self-esteem too much.
I love that!  Are you going to take her out on a date?
I do!  I have a sweetie and I love her so much.  I'm so happy!
That's great to hear. I'm a bit jealous
I am, I'm so close to my family
Oh no! That's terrible. You should have asked first.
I am sorry, I am not sure what you are referring to.
What happened?  Did you get a scolding?
That's a good idea.  It would be a good idea to be prepared in case of an emergency.
That is awesome! Congratulations!
I would love to move there. I am thinking about it too. I love the West Coast.
Oh no. Is she okay?
ohh man i'm sorry
That's true. Having the whole house to yourself can be a bit lonely.
Oh wow, how long are you going to be gone?
Oh wow! I bet you are so excited!
That is awesome. I love playing games.
I bet he does! Do you have a strategy for him to do that?
That's great, but maybe she should get them for you?
oh thats nice
That's nice. How long have you been apart?
I would have been so embarrassed!
That sounds like a real hassle! Did you have to do anything crazy to get there?
I can't believe that either.
I have, it was my first time in a long time.
That is sad. I am sorry.
Oh no.  I am so sorry to hear that.
That's good. Have you been applying for a long time?
I think Steve Jobs was a genius!
That sucks. Have you tried talking to them?
That's amazing! You must be very happy.
What did you say?
What did you do?
Well, maybe he'll be a good politician one day.
Did he get a girlfriend?
Wow, I have heard of her. She's a celebrity.
I have nothing to tell.
I think it was 10 years old.
I've had the same problem.  It's always a hassle to get it right.
I'm a coffee fan.
That is amazing, I am so happy for him.  Did he graduate with honors?
Oh, that's great!  I am sure that will make your life easier!
Oh no! I bet that was a mess! Did you clean it up?
Oh no, did they cancel your order?
I don't get why. They're supposed to be on top of their game.
I agree.  Have you called them?
Oh, I know how that is, I love eating her cookies too much.
That is so unfair.  I would have been mad too.  I would have given them a lot of money.
Oh no! How long have you been there?
I know right! I hate the smell!
A recipe for the best chicken and rice?
I don't understand what you mean.  How do you cook?
That is great! I love when that happens!
That's great! I'm happy for you.
I know right? What did he do?
That is so bad, I would have told him the same thing!
What test was that?
That's awesome! I bet you were so happy!
What was he playing?
That is so sad. How old is he?
Oh no! I hope you were able to fix it.
That's not good. I hope you get there soon.
Oh wow!  I bet you are so proud!
That is crazy!  I am sure it was a lot of fun but also very stressful!
You must be hearing some weird noises.
Oh wow, that's crazy. Is it really him?
That is awful. What did he do?
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. How long will you be staying there?
That is amazing, I hope he has a good career!
I think he's going to do great things!
I am glad you are ready for the baby.
Oh really? What's making you happy?
Oh no! Did you run away?
I love Batman.  What were the diamonds for?
I really believe that He is always with us and we should be grateful for what we have
Did he do something for you?
Oh man that would be embarrassing.
That is good to hear. I am glad that you are able to laugh about it.
I love YouTube too! I can watch the videos of all the music videos and listen to them.
What is Pac?
Oh no, that's terrible.  I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh no, I hope they were able to clean it up and get it back on the market.
I agree, it's hard to appreciate what you have when others have so much less.
That's good to hear.
I am sorry to hear that. Are you sure you did not do something wrong?
That is a very hard thing to admit to. I'm glad you are praying for forgiveness.
Wow! What did he do after that?
Oh wow, I bet you were scared.
Oh no! Did you confront her about it?
I am happy for you.
That's amazing. I bet he is very proud of himself.
That's really smart of her.
That's not a lot of time for work
That's really interesting! Do you think she was lying to you or not?
Oh wow, that's so terrible! Did she have the nerve to tell him?
I would have been furious.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is everything okay now?
I'm glad you didn't want to. That's not a good situation.
What happened?
I am glad you had that option. I would have been so anxious about not having anyone there.
I know right. I was thinking of getting a tattoo but then I read about it and I'm so not sure.
That is so sad.  I have heard that he was a nice guy.
I think the original was a lot better. I'm happy to hear that they're making one.
Oh, that's so true, I had to adapt to life too.
What does it do?
That's terrible. What are you going to do?
Oh yeah, it's no fun to be around people who do that.
That's awful, I am so sorry. What did you do?
You must have been very afraid of him.
That's awesome!  What subject did you study?
That's great! How long did it take you to finish?
I can't wait to go back to school!
I'm glad you have a home.  I've been struggling to find a place to call my own.
You did well! 9 months is a long time to go through a tough time.
That's very thoughtful of you.  I bet she appreciated it.
That sounds interesting, what was happening?
I am a fan of music too. I have my own music collection.
Oh, I know what you mean. I think you're right.
That's awesome! I bet you can't wait to play it!
It's a really good game, but it's not new this year. I'm not sure it's worth it.
Oh wow, congratulations! What position is it?
That's great!  What position is it?
Oh wow, that is quite a move.  I wish you the best of luck in your search.
Wow, that is so disappointing.  How long have you been trying to get your license?
I am sure you will be fine, it's just a little thing.
I know right?
I'm glad you're happy. I'm sure the rest of your life is good as well.
That's great news! What kind of University did you go to?
That's great.  You must be proud!
I think you're right. What did you do?
I'm sorry, what happened?
That is good news.  I hope he does get it and you get the job too.
I am so scared of them. I have been carrying a gun for years.
That sounds really scary.  Was there someone there with you?
Oh no! I'm glad you made it out.
That's great! Congratulations!
I'm so happy for you! What did you get?
No, I haven't. I don't think I would be very brave enough.
Oh wow, that must have been very upsetting. Did you find out why?
I haven't but I have been in a few.
That's a terrible thing to do. Did you end up getting in trouble?
I haven't. Is it good?
That's cool.  What kind of game is it?
I have. I love it.
Well, that's too bad! I don't get it, but I love their burgers.
I have. They are so scary!
That sounds terrifying!
oh yeah! i love roller coasters!
That sounds very interesting. I'm always looking for new projects.
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you were able to have a good conversation with him.
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I can't imagine doing something like that.
That's awesome! Where are you going?
I've never been, but I've heard it's a beautiful country. I wish you a wonderful trip.
That is great news!  That is a good thing to see.  You must be really happy for her!
That's great! What job?
That is a shame. I am sorry.
I'm glad she did! I'm sure it was very fun to have a puppy in the house!
That's awesome. I love dogs.
That is very nice of you. I hope you won her heart.
Wow, that's good to hear! What happened?
I bet you were. Did she apologize?
You must be very happy!
Did you do anything fun this week?
That's a tough life. I'm sure you're very good at it though.
Oh no, did you have to find another way to go?
I can imagine, it's a pretty scary situation.
That would have been a good idea.
Oh my goodness, that must have been very traumatic.
That is a good point. I have been thinking the same thing.
Oh no! Did you get wet?
I bet that was exciting!  Did you go somewhere fun?
That's sweet! I would have loved to be there.
That is nice.
That's not a good thing to do.  How did it work out?
Why didn't he care?
I'm sure you missed her, but it's good you have some other activities to keep yourself occupied.
That sounds like a pretty lazy way to spend your time.
I am sorry to hear that, I know how that feels.
I am sorry to hear that. Is it a problem with the area?
That is awesome.  What did she get you?
What kind of laptop is it?
I've never been on a Slingshot. What did you do on it?
What happened?
That is terrible.  How did you react?
That is unfortunate. I'm sorry to hear that.
I would be mad. Did you scold him?
That must be so frustrating. Are you in a new apartment?
I am so happy for you! What are you doing now?
That's great! What did you accomplish?
Oh wow, I bet that was a wild night.  Did you try to make it up to her?
Oh wow, I am sorry to hear that.
Oh wow.  What did you do?
Oh man, I think you need to get a helmet and a bike before you try to ride one!
That's terrible. I hope you are doing okay.
That's great. I'm glad he lived a good life.
That is no fun at all! I hope your dog didn't chew up anything important.
What happened?
I'm sure she'll forgive you!  What did you do?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Oh that sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a good time?
I know what you mean. I feel the same way about my wife.
It is, but I love my home.
I know right? I have been in nature so much lately. I am getting a little crazy from it.
What was their name?
That is a good point.  I was really impressed by the way the first lady handled the situation.
That's too bad. I don't get why people are afraid of tornadoes.
Oh, I understand, I grew up in a basement.  That's the worst.
What did she mean by that?
That is a common thing to do, I am sure you have done it before.
I have to agree, it's about people, not things.
That sounds like a very exciting time! I have never made an overseas move.
What did you like about it?
I hope you like it.
That is great!  I would be happy to get an iPhone.  What kind did you get?
That's nice. What is it?
That's so sweet. I'm sure you appreciate him.
That's good, how old is he?
I understand, I also have bad vision.
i have astigmatism too.  i see good in the day but not at night.
I know. I was in there and it was like everyone was in a panic.
That's terrible. I would be so angry.
I know, I'm sleep deprived too.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope you get some rest soon.
I know, it's awful.
That's a great way to spend time with family.
I do, but I don't get to see them as often as I would like.  I have a few close friends who are also parents of kids and they all get to have summers off.
That's great. How are they doing?
Oh that is so sad. I am so sorry to hear that.
That's great, how did you pay them?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you.
That is impressive! Did you pass the bar?
Oh that is great to hear!  I hope it was a great experience for you.
Oh wow, I've never had that happen before. Did you have to pay for your baby's ticket?
Oh man! You're going to have a blast!
That is awful.  What did you do?
I bet! Are you guys in a long distance relationship?
I know how you feel. I was scared too.
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you are not too traumatized by it.
Oh cool. I've never done that before. I've always just left them to grow wild.
Did they grow any mushrooms?
That's great! I hope you enjoy them!
I hear you.  I'm a bit tired of driving on the highway because there are so many cars.
I hate that. I always get frustrated when people do that.
Oh, that's cool. I'm not very good at video games, so I don't really play.
I met my friend through our families.
I bet you do. I'm glad to hear that.
What do you mean?
I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a good experience?
That's a good thing. How long have you been apart?
That is amazing! I bet you are so happy!
That is true, I used to be like that.
That is so awful.
Oh, that is terrible!  Why does she do that?  Is she not trained?
I agree. He must be a great partner.
Oh? Who is that?
You mean like when someone breaks into your house?
That is hilarious. What kind of dog?
That is great! What is the best part?
That's so nice! I love that too, but I have to go to work too.
That is true. Some people just don't want to interact with others.
I would be shocked! Did they invite you?
Did you have fun?
Why is that?
Oh no!  That's awful.  What did she say?
Oh that is a great place to visit. I have never been there.
I have a lot, but if I had to pick one I would say my favorite thing is my dog.
Oh wow. Congrats! What college did you graduate from?
I bet you feel really good about it.
I don't like the smell either.  How did he get so bad?
What happened?
oh no!  did you scold him?
What toys are you talking about?
Wow, did she get a large order?
That sounds like a great time!  I love queso!
oh wow thats amazing!
That's awesome! What school did they go to?
What is it that makes him impressive?
Wow. What a guy! I wish I had the talent to manage.
Oh that's so great! I bet you were so happy!
Oh, that's really nice of him.
That is unfortunate, did you try to tell a funny story?
Did you read it yourself?
I know the feeling!  I've been in a similar situation.  I hope you have fun in Germany and don't miss her too much.
I love to go to the dog park and play with my dogs.
I love it! What kind of flowers?
You mean the one you are referring to?
That's terrible. Are you at least able to communicate with her about it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a pet?
Oh no, did he get upset?
I'm sorry to hear that. What's happening?
Oh, that's so cute. I love that kind of pictures.
That's so cool. I'm glad that you are able to live far away from each other.
Oh my goodness, I am so sorry to hear that.  It must have been a tough day.
I am happy to be a part of your life.
That is the way to go. It is hard to lose faith, but it is worth it in the end.
That's great! I'm glad you found a job that you like.
I would be angry too.  What did you say?
I bet she is, I think my 9 year old is the same.
That's great! You must be confident in your cooking skills.
oh thats awesome, how long have you been working at it?
That is great!  Did you have to work hard to get it?
Oh yes, did you have a great time?
I'm so glad you have friends. I am very lucky to have a few.
That's awesome!  I'm glad you guys have been able to do that.
I'm sure your son felt bad about it. Did you give him a good talking to?
That's so true!
I can understand that. I feel the same way. I had to work hard to get where I am now.
I feel you.  I know a lot of people in my community have to deal with that.  It can be so frustrating.
That's awesome, good for you.
Well that is good news! I hope you get the job you want!
That sounds like a fun memory. I hope you have some of those back.
That is good. I hope it was your parents.
That's a fair point. I think I see the same thing.
I know what you mean.  I used to be that way but now I see the point.  I love my clothes, but I also love learning.
I can imagine. Did you give him a name?
Well, that's a good name. I'm glad he is happy with you.
Yeah, it's hard.  They're all at different stages of their lives and the stress is just crazy!
That's great that you have that inside of you.
Did she have to go through a lot of interviews?
Oh wow! You must be very happy about that!
Oh that's terrible.  I hope he's okay.
That's good. Do you think you'll be able to get him back on track?
That is a terrible thing to do. You should have asked her first.
Oh yeah, what happened?
I don't like when that happens.
Oh no, that's terrible. What did they do?
That's awesome! What do you want to do on the cruise?
That's the worst! I get seasick too!
That is so nice of you to say.  Do you have a crush on her?
That is terrible.  I am so sorry.
That was quite a surprise. What happened next?
That sounds fun, I bet you had a good time.
I am sorry to hear that.  Is she okay?
How old was he?
That's awesome!  How long has your nephew been living with you?
Wow. What do you do with him?
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it something important?
That's a pretty pricey thing, how much is it?
What award was it for?
That is great! I bet you feel very proud of yourself!
I'm going to be able to pay more and have more time to pursue my hobbies. I'm excited for it!
Yeah, I don't know how you're going to get there but I hope it works out for you.
I totally agree. I was nervous too!
I have, but I don't think it's as common as it used to be. I am excited about the interview you had!
That can be very frustrating, I hate it when parents are not good parents.
That is disgusting! I am so sorry you had to deal with that.
I know the feeling. I've been there a few times.
That's nice!
That's sad, but I know you will always be there for her.
That sounds like fun! I love shopping.
Oh great! What are you going to do?
That is a great plan.  I am sure you will have a great time.
Oh my goodness! I hate when that happens. How long did you have to find her?
That is awful. Did you have to use some kind of soap to try and get her clean?
Well that's nice. Sometimes you just need a little bit of relaxation.
What do you mean?
That's terrible. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Oh nice! What kind of lab?
That's great! What are you doing to show your faithfulness?
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you're alright.
That's good to hear. What happened?
Wow, that's a very interesting statement.
What for?
That is a pretty good thing to say.
I hope you have a great time.
I'm glad you are happy.
What did they do wrong?
Oh no, that's a bummer. Did you get a good deal on the other one?
I hope they do too. What kind of complaint did you file?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's nice. You have to go through it sometimes.
How did that happen?
i am sure he did.
You're right, she's gone for a couple of weeks.
That's true, it's hard to have real company when you are so busy.
What is your favorite take out?
Why is that?
That sounds amazing. I love living in a place where I can spend all my free time doing what I want.
That's a pretty good thing.  How many people do you live with?
Oh that is amazing.  I would be shocked too!
What happened?
Oh wow, that's a great time to be happy!
Oh wow, that's cool!
What happened to your mom?
I'm happy to be able to help.
That's so exciting! I bet you were happy.
That's good. Do you have a girl in your life?
That's a good attitude to have, how long you've been married?
That is a long time to wait for someone to fall in love with you.
That's great. I'm sure it's a pretty cool truck.
I agree, I need to work harder to buy my truck.
That's great! What are you doing today?
What are you referring to?
That's great that you're taking care of her.
That is a nice feeling. Did you have a good rest?
What are you going to do about that?
Did you have to give thanks for something that you didn't have to?
Wow! What a wonderful daughter you have. I am sure she is a talented singer!
What kind of girl is she?
That is a tough spot to be in.  Have you thought about talking to a counselor about it?
What's that?
I'm sure you will find a good one.
That is a good time to be in that field.
That is a sad situation. You can try to make friends here.
I bet. What are you feeling unsure of?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you didn't feel too bad.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did it happen recently?
That's bad. Did you feel bad afterwards?
That's so frustrating. Do you think you can lose weight?
That is great! I am so happy for him!
Oh, that's great. I'm sure he's very proud of you too!
Oh no! I hate it when they bark at you! Did you try to yell at her?
I understand.  I have to deal with car noises too.  We are on the second floor too.
Oh, that's bad! I'd be really upset too. I would have to ask my mom if she has seen it.
That is hard, I am sure you did well though.
oh wow that's awesome! I bet you are so excited to see them!
Oh that's so sweet! I bet you're excited!
That is nice of you.  Did you get her back before you left?
That is a tough spot.  Have you thought about joining a club or group to meet new people?
I know the feeling. I hate waking up to noise.
Oh no. That's terrible. Do you have a smoke detector?
Oh no! I'm so sorry, did you feel really bad?
That's the best part, it's all about the suspense!
That is awful.  Do you feel like she has no idea what you are going through?
I feel you.  I have a daughter and she is 12.  We play games together when she is home.
I agree with that.  I try to keep things in perspective and not get too caught up in the bad things
I can relate. I had to learn to walk.
i agree. you have to take responsibility
I've been in that place recently.
That is so sad.  It is so hard to lose someone you love.
I know what you mean.  It's hard to be in a situation like that and not know how to react.  I feel for you.  It's hard to know what to do.
Oh no! What's going on?
That is a tough decision. I would have to say that I would take the move.
That's a good attitude to have. I'm sure you'll have a good day!
Oh wow, that's really nice. I bet they appreciate it
I feel you. I'm lonely too. I've been married for 5 years now, and I'm still just as lonely as the day I got married.
I'm not sure if I can relate to that. I am more of a introvert.
That's great. You must be happy to see her.
Yeah, I know what you mean.  She was always on time too, so I'm glad she's coming back.  She's been gone for a while.
What are you going to do on vacation?
That sounds like a lot of fun! Are you an avid floater?
That's really rude. Did you find a better caterer?
That's an interesting thing. Did you have a problem with the catering service?
What happened?
That is so rude of her.  I would be angry.  I would tell her I am not a good customer.  I would also tell my husband about it.
oh, i was good, i did not have any problems.
Me? I'm not sure. I'm a robot.
yea it was good
I am glad!  What did you do today?
I know, I would be embarrassed too.
I am sorry to hear that.  Did you ask them to clean up?
That's good to hear. Did you get the job?
Did they start on time?
I know what you mean. I'm from a big city and I moved to the country to be closer to family. I'm missing my friends a lot.
I understand, I'm not very good at meeting people either.
That is good that you were thinking of her. Did you say anything to her about it?
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I wish you the best of luck!
Oh no, what happened?
That's not good.
That's not good. What did you do?
I'm sure the owner didn't see you either.  Did you feel embarrassed?
Wow, what was your first apartment?
I feel you. I was in college and we went on a road trip.
That is so scary.  I hope you were able to get to a place where you could relax.
That sounds terrible. I hope your friend is able to resolve it.
That's good. What did you do to prepare?
That is great.  Do you think you will be offered the job?
That is so funny! I love seeing how people can pretend to be something they're not.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That is bad.  What happened?
Oh no, have you tried ordering lighter items?
That's good. Did you study hard?
That is a great test. I am glad to hear that it is alright.
Did you have a lot of fun?
Oh that sounds like fun!
That's really cool. I wish my parents could do that.
That's good to hear.
That's great. I like to think that I'm stronger when things are tough and easier.
That's a great way to look at it.  I like that.
Oh no, how do you feel?
Oh no!  I'm sorry to hear that.  How long have you been job hunting?
That's true. I am jealous of my coworker.
That is understandable. But, I don't think he deserves it.
That's not good.  How old is he?
That's a good idea. It's hard to keep kids entertained.
That is so true. I would never steal.
I agree.  What do you think you would do if you were in a similar situation?
Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did you ever find him?
That is terrible. I hope you were able to find out what happened to her.
Oh wow! I bet you're going to have a lot of fun!
I can imagine.  Do you have kids?
Oh no! What happened?
I'm a nurse.  I've been doing this for 20 years.
I'm proud of her. She has been working very hard and it's paying off.
That is amazing! I bet you are very proud of her.
That's good to think about, especially when you're not as fortunate as others.
Oh no! Did he give you some advice?
Oh no! Did anyone get hurt?
Wow!  That's so kind of them!  I bet you felt a little bad for having to dispose of it.
Well, that's great. I'm sure you're very proud of him.
That's an interesting personality you have. Do you have a favorite singer?
I know how you feel. I'm a little young to be thinking about the past, but I can only imagine how great it must have been.
I love the old days.
That is terrible. Are you scared?
That's terrible! Did you report it to the police?
That's terrible.  Did you report it?
Did you get any new information?
I would have been sad too. I've been there before.
That's good! I hope you get a good job soon.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh no! I would have been so embarrassed!
I would have to get a snip of her hair to clean it out.
That sounds so cute. I can't help but smile when that happens.
That's great! Where are you going?
Oh wow.  Are you guys going to be able to get to Somalia?
Wow, that is a terrible thing to do. I hope they didn't get upset.
That's a tough one.  I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  I hope you find some relief.
What was the prize?
Did you win?
I'm sorry you have to put up with him.
I agree, people often don't ask how you are doing.
Oh wow! I hope it was a good package.
That's a bummer.  Do you still want to wait?
That is awful.  Did you get mad at them?
Oh, really? Why?
Oh that's great. Have you seen them a lot since?
That's kind of like what happened with me and my ex.
Oh my goodness that is crazy! Did the dog not have a leash?
Oh, that's too young!
That sucks, you should be proud of yourself though, you did a good job.
That's great!  I hope you do well!
Oh no! I would be worried too! Do you have a good relationship with her?
That's good that you have a nephew. I hope everything goes well for him.
I can understand that.  I've been there myself.
I know right? It's like it always works out for us.
I am sorry. I hope things get better for you.
Oh no. What happened?
I am sorry to hear that. I would not want to live in that area either.
I know the feeling! I'm sure you'll be fine though!
That is good to hear.  I hope they are good people.
I feel like I have a lot of potential
That's so sweet. What did she do?
That is very nice of her.
That is awesome, what a cool kid!
Oh man! That sounds like a lot of fun!
Oh wow, that's interesting. I have never heard of that.
That is a good point.  We all have bad days.  We just have to be kind to each other.
That's very sweet of you.  What are you doing to help him?
Oh I see. That's okay. Maybe you can try to have a friendly conversation with him.
That is terrible!  I bet you were so mad at that guy.
That's good to hear.  That was a good dog, I bet the smaller one is safe now.
That sounds like a lot of work! I bet he was very happy when he was finally done.
I've been through that, it's hard, but you'll get through it!
That is a terrible thing to do to your dog. Did you end up going to the vet?
That's good to hear.  I hope he's feeling better now.
I do, but they are rare.  It is nice to have those moments when you are feeling good about yourself and the world.
I was in the middle of a project and I was so grateful for that.
What kind of job was it?
That is so exciting! I hope you get the job!
I have.  I had to do that once and it was a real pain.
What happened?
Yeah, all the time!  I just love how cute they are.
I see! What a fun little hobby!
Oh really? I'm sure you did a good job!
What a nice thing to do.
That's great!  It's not easy to pass twice.  What are you going to do about it?
That's good that you were able to pass.  Do you feel more confident now?
That sounds terrifying!
I would be shocked too! Did you report it to the authorities?
I don't have any kids.  I'm a retired nurse, so I don't have to worry about them.
That is so awesome! I bet she was so stoked!
That is horrible. I can only imagine how embarrassing that must have been.
That's terrible. How did it affect you?
Wow, that is annoying. Did you try to wait for another cashier?
I know what you mean. I was at the store the other day and the cashier was having a bad day.
That is so nice! Did you name her?
That is true! I feel the same way.
I agree.  The world has changed so much since then.
I agree. I had to worry about school and bills, now I can enjoy life.
That's awesome! I love science fairs.
Oh, wow! I am not sure if I could figure that out.
That is so sad!  Have you tried any tricks or things to make it easier?
I was co sleeping. I think he was crying because he was hungry.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you have any fun activities?
Oh wow, that's great! I bet you had a lot of fun!
I have a 16 year old son, he is small but he is growing up fast.
Yeah, I can imagine that. I know how that feels.
Oh no, what happened?
Oh no! I'm sorry. I hope they get it together soon!
I bet!  Is he going to college in the states?
That is great! What are you going to do?
What is wrong with him?
I do, but they are grown now.  I had a girl and a boy.  I miss them.
Oh wow! That sounds fun! What did you find?
Oh, I hate those things. They're so annoying. I used to have a bunch of them, but they're not as fun as they used to be.
That's great! What a great daughter!
Yeah that's a tough spot to be in.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get her out and get her to the vet?
What happened?
That's great!  I'm sorry you had to go through that.
That is great to hear. I hope you have a good relationship with her.
That was nice of you. Did it like you?
That's interesting. What kind of cat is it?
That's not fun, did you get lost for a long time?
Oh no, that's horrible. Did you get them?
Did she ever say no?
I know the feeling.
How old is she?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I bet you were happy she was able to get away.
That's a bad habit to have. You should pay them off as soon as you can.
Oh yeah? Why is that?
That's a long time to wait. What's going on?
Oh wow! I love keto. I've been doing it for 2 years now. I think it's really good for you.
That's a good way to start.
Oh, congratulations! How are you feeling?
Oh wow. That must have been scary.
Oh that is so exciting. What did you do?
Oh no! What happened?
That's great! Did you study hard to get back in?
What did you study?
I bet you must feel great!
I agree. It's hard to stay motivated, but once you have it, it's easy.
I hate skim too, I just love regular milk.
Oh yeah, I hate whole milk, it's so sickening. 2% is a good start though, I hope you enjoy it!
That's great!  What did you enjoy?
Why are you satisfied?
I bet, I hate driving in the rain.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Oh no. Are you okay?
That is very discouraging. I have been there too.
Wow that's a long time, why did you have to drive so long?
Oh wow! I am glad that you got to see the beautiful ocean!
That's nice. What did he get you?
That's nice. I'm sure he was happy.
Oh no! Did you get in trouble?
Oh wow, that's a pretty awkward situation. Was she okay?
What was in the cave?
I am happy for you! That is an amazing experience!
I'm so happy for you! I hope you have a wonderful baby.
That's a lot of stress. Did you guys get everything set up before you left?
Wow, I'm glad it was just something else.
That is amazing! Congratulations on your baby boy!
I'm so sorry to hear that.  Do you still have her?
That is so sweet. I wish I had a pet.
Oh no. Was it a romantic date?
Oh no.  That's a bummer.  You should have told her.
That's great. I hope he has a good time and gets where he wants to go.
That's a good point! I think it's a good point to help, but I also know that parents can't do that all the time.
Oh that sounds like a lot of fun!  How many did you play with?
That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog did you have?
Did you have a good reason for that?
I can understand that, you can't take one with you on a trip!
That's awesome. It sounds like you are very happy with life right now.
Oh I agree! I have been doing some research on it and I believe it is a matter of the digestive system.
I am sure you were very happy to have the dress.
Oh no! Are you going to tell her?
I love retro games too!
I agree. I used to play that all the time when I was a kid.
Why did you hear it?
Oh wow! What were you doing?
That is wonderful!  I bet she is thrilled.  What is she artistic about?
That's good.  Do you think you can learn from her?
what does that mean?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! You must have been so scared for the kitten's life.
I'm glad you cared for it yourself. I bet she's a wonderful cat!
That's impressive!  I bet she got to see a lot of new things.
That's awesome! I am so happy for you!
Oh no! I hate storms like that. Did it hit your area?
I am glad it passed, that is a good thing.
That's great! I'm happy for him as well!
Wow! That's so nice!
Oh that's awesome! What kind are you looking for?
I think Toyota is a great brand.
What kind of fix up?
That's a lot of time. Are you going to be okay?
That's a bummer.  Why don't they ship to Canada?
Oh yeah, I've had that happen before. It's like they don't care about the customer.
Oh no! That is crazy! What did she do to get you to do that?
I am so sorry to hear that. What happened?
Wow that's a long time. How did you keep yourself occupied?
Oh no. That's terrible. How much did you have to save up?
Oh no, did you end up moving?
That is a little rude, but I can see why she might be moving in.
Oh no, that's terrible. What did she do?
I'm glad you had that experience.
You must be so proud of her.
That's good! Are you excited about the baby?
That sucks. Are you still going to go out of town?
That's unfortunate. I hope you were able to get a day off.
That is a very sad situation.
Oh no! What happened?
Oh, what did she want to do?
Did she have a job?
That is a great feeling, I wish you all the best!
Yeah, that's a great attitude to have. What do you do?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you do it to impress someone or something else?
Oh that's bad, what happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's a little embarrassing.  Did you find a way to get cleaned up before the meeting?
That is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.
That is so sad. You should have told her about it.
I understand. What happened?
I am so sorry.  I know how you feel.  I lost my mom a few years ago.
You must be happy.
I am happy for you!
That's great. I hope you are both doing well.
That is understandable. I would feel the same way.
That must be a terrible feeling to have.
That is a good thing.
I don't know if I agree with that.  I think men are more detail oriented.
I bet you're happy about that
That's a pretty bad decision. What did she do?
I'm so sorry to hear that.  How are you doing?
I understand. What do you mean?
That is no good.  Did you get him in trouble?
What happened?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
What was it?
I can't imagine the pressure you must feel.
I have not played that game, but it sounds interesting!
I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?
oh yeah what happened?
Oh no!  I would have been so embarrassed.
Oh that sounds like a pretty embarrassing thing to wear! I bet you felt like a total nerd.
That's awesome! I love visiting with my grandpa!
Oh, that sounds fun! I bet you will have a great time!
I can't stand gas station food.  I'm always looking for something better to eat.
That's not good, you should just leave the bathroom alone.
I had a good day, I went to the gym and ate a healthy meal.
That's good to hear. What happened?
Oh, I think I know what you might be asking about. I live in Colorado and I don't know much about climate.
Oh no! What were you doing?
What were you wearing?
I can understand that. I am glad to hear that.
That's good. Is she your girlfriend?
I'm sure you'll do well!
That's unfortunate, is it something you will be able to take again?
I have never been to a zoo. What kind of sloths?
They have zoos?
I would be so angry!
I'm not sure, but I think you should try to figure out who is behind it.
What happened?
That is awesome! Where are you building it?
I can understand that.
That's great! Kids can be expensive to be on.
What kind of races do you watch?
Oh that's cool! I bet you love the rush of adrenaline you get from racing
I know what you mean, I am glad for myself too
That's great!  I am sure it was a lot of hard work.  How did you feel about it?
What kind of car?
Nice.  Did you like it?
That's awesome!  What kind of watch is it?
I have been wanting a new g-shock watch!
That is great. How long did you take to get there?
That is great! I am sure you will find something soon.
That is so exciting, I hope you get a great grade.
That's a little annoying. Did you ask him for an extension?
That is terrible.  You should have a talk with them and let them know how you feel.
Oh, what did they do?
That's really sad. I'm so sorry.
Oh no, that's terrible.  Are you able to go back to work now?
I hate when that happens. What kind of food was it?
What made you not want to eat anymore?
I bet.  What did you do while you were there?
I am close to my grandparents
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. How old are they now?
That's awesome. I'm sure you had a great time.
That's not good. Did you lose anything?
I was fine, thanks for asking. I was just really worried.
I am sure it was not that bad.
Oh no, that's too bad.  How are you feeling about it?
That's awesome!  I've never seen anything like that before.  Did they do it for free?
I did once when I was 10, but I never did anything like that again.
I am sorry to hear that.  Did you have a favorite person?
Why was it so bad?
Oh no, that must have been very frustrating.
I think that is one thing. It is when he spends a lot of time with you and it feels like he is trying to control you
That's so frustrating!
I am sure you will do great! What is the test about?
How did you do?
I love the beach. Have you been to the Gulf Shores?
I have not but I want to!
Oh wow, that is so sweet! I love surprises like that.
Oh wow! I bet that was a nice surprise. Did you have a good time?
I think I do. I know what you mean. I have had it happen to me before.
I have never heard of that before.
Oh no. Did you have a good time though?
Oh no. That is terrible. I am sorry.
That's interesting. What are you going to do?
Why? What are you going to do?
That can be a very frustrating situation.  I would have a talk with your parents.
I don't think you should tell them how you feel.
That is great news!  What have you been doing?
I wish you all the best!
That's horrible. I'm sorry that happened to you.
I know what you mean.  I can get frustrated when I feel like I am being treated unfairly.
That's a good decision, loyalty is important.
That is really nice of them.
That is so sweet of her! How old is she?
Oh, that's really sad. I'm sure she has other family members who care about her, though.
Oh no!  That must have been scary.  I hope you and your family are okay.
I am glad you are safe.  I feel the same.  We had a tornado in our area last week.
Oh, that's nice.  I have a few plants in my garden and I do have to do a lot to keep them happy.  It's a big responsibility.
Oh, what is it?
Wow, that's great, what is her birthday?
That sounds like a lot of fun!  I'm sure it will be a great time!
That is good.
That is no good. I hope he didn't think you were a flake.
I would have said the truth and been honest with him.
Oh no!  Did you have a doctor check out anything?
Did you get sick?
That's awful! Did you call the police?
Oh my goodness! I know how that feels, I have the same thing.
I can see why you would feel guilty.  Was it a really expensive TV?
I would say you can keep it.  You should be happy with your purchase and enjoy it.
That is pretty frustrating.  What does she want to eat?
I love going to the local diner. It's a tradition for us.
That sounds really nice. I've never had one like that before.
That is nice.  I have been doing the same.  Do you have any plans for the future?
That's great! You must be relieved.
I can imagine how that would be perceived by the people.
That is amazing, I am happy for you.
Yeah, I am glad to hear that.
I'm glad you have good friends.  Is there something specific that you're looking for in a friend?
I know what you mean.  It's hard to watch someone else go through the same things you are going through.
I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds like a nightmare.
That's crazy! Did you end up leaving?
I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  Is there anything you can do to help manage it?
I know. I'm so scared.
How long have you been separated for?
I can relate to that. What's making you feel that way?
Oh no! What kind of smell?
Oh no! That's terrible. Did you try to clean it up?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Oh no! What happened?
I can understand the frustration.
I think it's just normal to want to be heard, even if you don't mean to. It's hard to talk to someone in a noisy environment.
Yeah they can get a bit loud.
That's understandable.  What's the problem?
I bet.  I would be so nervous about it.  I hope you get the best possible outcome.
That's terrible. You're so lucky to have such a good surgeon.
I was in an accident 5 years ago. I had a spinal cord injury.  I lost a leg. I had surgery 2 times and had to have a lot of surgeries on the other leg. I have chronic pain.  I was in a lot of pain.  I lost my job and I was in a lot of debt. I was lucky to have a good insurance company cover some of the surgeries.  I'm still in pain.  I'm just lucky I've been able to get some of the surgeries covered.
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope he is found guilty.  I'm not sure how that happened, but I'm sure it was a mistake.
I've never heard that. Do you think it will be a hot summer?
That's awesome! I'm always busy, so it's good you are making the most of your time!
I know how you feel. I've never been good at it.
You'll get there, I'm sure it'll take some time
That's cool. I don't watch them either.
Oh wow, you must be a fan!
I'm a movie buff, I think it's always a good idea to consider how adults will react to the content.
I know, I'm 33 and I'm still trying to understand it.
Oh yeah? What kind of job is it?
That's sad. Did you miss their food?
That's great! I love working in a place where you know your coworkers.
I would have been a little worried, but I think I would have been okay
I agree. People are so good.
Did they catch the person doing it?
That sounds like a wild ride.  What type of vehicle were you in?
Oh no! Did you get hurt?
Oh no! That must have been uncomfortable.
I am sure you are.
That's awesome.  You should be proud.  What company is it?
That is not good. Are you sure that is not a bad thing?
I am in the Navy, and I have been there for 5 years.
I'm afraid I would be nervous talking to someone and I would probably make a mistake.
That is awesome! I bet you were happy about that!
What happened?  I don't see how you can have a laptop that needs a new hard drive.
I bet that was exciting news.
That's a nice gift.  It's always good to have a gift card to help with the bill.
Oh, I know what you mean. I'm pretty much the same way.
Oh no, I hope he was able to get some!
That's funny.  I love how some people still do that.
That is so sweet!  How old is he now?
I have that problem too. I always forget to put the list down.
That sucks, did he have to go without?
That is so nice of you. I bet you are glad he didn't want to go with you.
That sounds like a good time. What's your favorite?
That's really nice of her.  Did you have a good reason?
That's a good thing that she is cool about it.
That's great! I hope you got the outcome you wanted.
That must have been so embarrassing.
That's sad. What happened?
Oh, I'm sorry.  Do you have any plans for the weekend?
That is great! I'm sure you are very happy about it!
I'm sure you're not bored.
It is always a great feeling to have a baby.
I can imagine. I have a daughter and I never had a son, so I know how that is.
I am sorry, what happened?
Oh no! Did you turn it off?
Oh that is a bit of a bummer. I hope you have a good time getting them ready for school.
That's great! What do you mean by that?
Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?
That's so funny! Did you get in trouble?
Oh no, what happened?
That is terrible.  Did you get a good grade?
It is always good to hear a positive message from someone in a position of power.
I know what you mean. It's always hard to figure out how people are able to get the positions they do.
I would be worried too. Do you have a plan for how you will save money?
I'm so excited, how old is the baby?
Oh no, that's bad.  Are you sure you'll get good grades?
Ahh! How are you feeling?
That is amazing!  Congratulations!
I'm glad to hear that. What are you going to do next?
That sounds like fun!
I am sure it is. You must be very proud.
That is a harsh truth.  What was the reason behind?
Oh no. I'm sorry. What did you do?
That's great. I'm glad you have a routine that works for you.
I love breakfast! I eat pancakes.
It's a good goal to have. I want to get in shape.
I do the same.  I can't believe people don't listen to their body.
That's awful. Did you have flood insurance?
Oh no, that's terrible!
Oh no! I bet he was scared! Did you help him get home?
I'm sorry, what happened?
Did you get to see her?
That's so sweet.  What was the book?
I am sorry to hear that. What are you looking for?
I think you should. It's very convenient.
I'm so happy for you! I have a new baby boy on the way!
What do you need the buggy for?
I feel you, I have a baby too.
Wow, that's a lot of money saved up. I bet you feel lucky.
That is pretty weird.  How did she feel about it?
Oh, you're a tough parent, huh?
I am sure you were very upset, but you are right to be understanding.
Oh, I'm sorry, that's not a good thing to do.
That's exciting! Was it expensive?
I would be too. Did she get hurt?
What kind of practice did you do?
That is awesome! What sport do you play?
That's great! What games did you play?
I remember those games, they were so good.
What was so scary about it?
I know the feeling.  I hate going on roller coasters.
Oh wow! That's exciting! What kind of car are you thinking of getting?
What is it?
Oh wow, I am sure it was a bit of a shock.
That's awesome!  I love movies like that.  It's great that you have a good memory of it.
That's good, you should be happy, life is good
Oh no, why is that?
Oh my, I hope you were not too disgusted!
Oh no! That is terrible! Why did you demand a refund?
That's awesome! What kind of bike is it?
That is awesome!  I love bikes.  I have one too.  I am so jealous of you.  I bet it's a lot of fun!
Oh that's awesome! I'm glad to hear that you're on the path to that. What are you planning on doing with the money?
That's great! I've been thinking of buying a house for a while now. How big is your house?
I feel you. I'm the only one that pays bills.
I understand.  Do you have any fun plans?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better soon!
I'm sorry to hear that.  Is she healthy?
Oh no, I hope you can get paid.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think there was a mistake?
That's awesome! I bet that was a fun trip.
That is so sweet.
Oh wow, what was the surprise?
I think that sounds like a great plan.
That's terrible. What did you do?
I see you are a very wise person.
That is terrible.  I would have been very upset if I had been in his shoes.  How did it turn out?
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That's really awful.
That is so bad.
I agree. I always study hard to get good grades.
That is really scary.  Were you able to run?
That sounds like a wild ride!
That's awesome. I love baseball cards.
I bet it was a lot of fun.
I bet you were! What kind of job were you looking for?
I love to do that. What kind of work are you doing?
That is awesome!  I have never seen it before.  Have you been to a performance?
I'm not familiar with it. What is it about?
I love going to the beach.  What was it like?
I love the ocean. I'm glad you have a great appreciation for it.
I bet.  How did you cheat?
That's not good.
That's a nice gesture. What kind of dance?
It is hard to find time to do things.  I hope you can do something soon.
That is so sad.  I am sorry to hear that.
I am sorry to hear that.  How did you feel?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that.
That sounds like fun. What did you do?
I love the ocean, it's so peaceful.
I loved the movie!  What made you so happy?
That's great.  He's a great writer.  I've been wanting to see his show on Broadway.
Oh really? Was it a nice visit?
What happened?
Oh no! That sounds scary. Was it a big one?
I am glad you were able to escape.
That's great! What's your relationship like?
I am glad you care about her
What happened?
What happened?
That sounds scary. Did you run to the neighbor's house?
I am sure you were.
That's interesting. I don't know how they do it, but I can't do that.
Oh no! That is really sad. What happened?
Oh wow. I love the feeling of having a clean house.
Oh wow, I bet that was a good surprise.
Wow, that is quite gross. I would be grossed out too.
I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
I agree,  it is nice to have people that care about you.
What's 5?
That's nice, did you have a good time together?
That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?
That's terrible. Why did they do that?
Oh no, what happened?
Oh no! That must have been so gross. What did you do?
That's a bummer. Were you scared?
Oh no, are you in a financial bind?
That is great, I hope you do well too
Oh great, what country are you going to?
What kind of car did you get?
Oh wow, thats a first! I bet it was pretty fun!
I would have felt the same way. What did you do?
I'm sorry to hear that. You should tell her the truth.
I would have been very upset. Why did you do it?
Why did you avoid your friends?
Oh, what a sweet thing to say!
Did you feel that way?
That must have been stressful.
That's good to hear. What was the meeting about?
That is a very interesting field.
That is terrible.  I am so sorry to hear that.  What did you do?
I'm so sorry. I hope you can find some comfort.
I am, I want to know what they did
That's so sad, do you still have your dog?
I bet you were excited to run!
Oh no!  I bet he was mortified
I am sure it did. I have never seen such a thing.
I can dance, but not as well as some people I've seen.
That is a scary thing to find. What did you do?
Oh no, did you run away?
That is a good plan.
Oh wow, that's sad.  What did you do?
Did you have to throw it away?
That sounds really bad. I hope you're okay!
I'm sorry.  I hope you were able to get through it.
Why do you say that?
That is terrible. I am so sorry.
That's so sad. It's great you are not feeling overwhelmed.
I am so sorry. I am glad you are aware of the fake news.
I agree! I don't get why it's so sensationalized.
How old is she?
That's so sweet of you!  I bet your kids love the treats!  What are you giving her?
Oh no! How did that happen?
That is so sad.  I bet that is really hard to go through.  But I'm sure you'll get through it.
I've never been to aldi's, but I have heard they are pretty cheap.
That sounds great.  I am a fan of buying my own things and not having to pay for shipping.
I'm sure they will do great this year!
That's good to hear. What sport are you playing?
I am sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's good to hear.  I'm sure it's not true.
That's a pretty strong feeling. Did you have a close relationship?
Oh wow, that's great! What are you looking to buy?
I am happy for you. I always seem to have trouble taking on double shifts.
I am a big fan of Hamilton! I have seen it on Broadway!
That sounds amazing, have you seen it?
Wow! That's amazing! Did you have to get her a harness?
I am sorry to hear that.  Did she break her ankle?
That's a good thing to have those memories of the past.
Well that's awesome! Did you win?
That's great! What are you training for?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I've been a vegan for years, and I think it's really healthy for you.  I've never used steroids, and I have never felt better.
That's good! How old is he?
That is so sad.  I am sorry.  What did he do?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you can get over them?
I bet you were!  Did you meet them well?
That's awesome, how did you do it?
That's great! What made you jealous?
That is very exciting. I have a big house with lots of room for the kids to run and play.
Wow, did you have to talk to them about it?
Oh no!  Did he do anything wrong?
I love nature too. I feel happy when I am outside in nature too.
I like to garden too, but I'm not as good at it as you are.
Did you see it live?
Oh, what was it?
That sounds like fun! Are you a good skater?
What did you do?
I bet it does.  What a nasty thing to do.
I'm not sure what you mean.
I am. Yes, I have two kids.
I've never been one of those people.  What are you talking about?
I've had anxiety for years too. I feel like I've gotten used to it, but I still have episodes from time to time.
Oh my goodness! I'm so glad you are feeling better!
I know how you feel! I have had a few flights before.
What did you find out?
That's nice, you must feel a little envious.
That is great to hear.  What is your goal?
Wow, how did that work out?
I am glad you grew out of it.
What happened?
That sounds so exciting! What's the baby's name?
That's awful. I would be upset too.
That sounds like a great plan, and I'm sure he will do it once he gets it in his head.
I bet you were, you must have been feeling great about yourself.
That is great! You must have put in a lot of work.
That is so awesome!  What college is she attending?
That's great.  I'm glad you are happy for her.
That's horrible. Did they do something to you?
That is good to hear.  I am glad you are willing to take responsibility for your actions.
That is great.  I hope you have a good time!
That's nice.
Oh wow. That's great. Did you get the score you were looking for?
That's good. I am also competitive, but I am not as focused as you.
Oh, that's awesome! What are you going to do?
That's sad.  I hope she does okay.
That is terrible. Have you tried anything so far?
Oh wow. What is the purpose of that?
I know, I have lost so many. It's really hard.
Oh man, I'm so sorry.  That must be so difficult.  What kind of animals were they?
I'm sorry to hear that.
That is a very good friend, I hope he gets back on his feet soon.
That's a lot of weight loss. I hope you can get back on track.
What happened?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
That's a good thing to be able to do.
I would be very upset.  Did you try to get a refund?
oh no, are you guys doing anything to prevent them from getting away with it?
Oh that is great. What did you do?
That sounds like a great time. Where was the beach?
I know what you mean! Sometimes it can be lonely, but I'm sure you're not alone.
That is very exciting.
I would be terrified!  What was its name?
That is a good thing to do.
I hope you have a good time!
I know, I hate the summer. I am so ready for it to be over.
Oh no!  I bet that's annoying.  Maybe you can talk to him about it?
That sounds like a good idea!
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.
That is terrible. I hope they get help soon.
I agree.  There are a lot of people out there who don't appreciate the people in their lives.
That's true. I think we're all lucky in the sense that we get to live in this amazing world.
Oh wow!  I can imagine.  That must be very scary.  I hope everything goes well and you enjoy the new place!
Wow, I love Alaska, but I understand that the winters can be so cold and dark!
That sounds like a lot of fun!
Yeah, it's been a great time to be living in America.
I agree, prosperity is a great thing.
That is very sad, is she in a relationship with someone?
I'm sorry to hear that. What is she doing that you think she needs help with?
That's so exciting!  I'm so glad you are both happy and healthy!
That sounds like a lot of fun.  I bet you have some great memories.
Oh wow, that's a unique memory. What did you do with it?
I love horror movies. I'm sure it was scary.
Did you have a good time?
That's awesome!  I'm so happy for her!
I bet it is.  Are you going to support her?
That sounds so nice, are you happy for him?
Did they have to pay for it?
I'm glad for you! What did you major in?
Oh, that's cool! Do you work with the environment?
That is terrible, you should really be ashamed.
You will have to be brave.
What are you guys doing for the first time?
That's great, are they going to be together?
That's nice. Do you still keep in touch with them?
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's awesome! I love watching horror movies.
That's cool. What kind of video?
That is nice.  I always thought that was a nice thing for the man to do.
That sounds like a fun place to stay. I bet it is very cozy and warm.
That's terrible. I'm sorry. I have a dog too.
That's really nice. How did you meet her?
I agree. I was shocked when he won.
I agree with you. I am concerned about the direction of our country.
I'm sorry to hear that! Did you get it fixed?
That is very frustrating, I hope you get the healing you need.
I'm glad you got to visit. Did you enjoy it?
I've been to Alabama, it's a beautiful place. What was your trip for?
That is terrible.  I hope you guys can work it out.  What was the project?
I'm so with you.  I've been there a few times.
I'm sorry to hear that.  They can be pretty nasty.
I can understand that. It can be hard when you don't have a lot of control over things.
That's a good idea.  It's always better to be prepared.
Oh, I hope you are not too scared!
That sounds fun!  Did you get to ride the horses?
Oh wow! I don't even know what to say.
That is awesome! I am glad you were able to do that.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're okay.
That sounds scary. Did you do it?
Oh, I would have been very scared!
I bet you are excited, I love going to the beach.
That's fair, you have to do what you have to do!
That's exciting, what are you moving to?
That's a pretty interesting place. What are some things you like about it?
I'm sorry you feel that way. I don't know how that is possible.
I'm happy for you!  It's been a tough year for me.
I am sure it was an intruder!
That is not good at all. I hope you are okay now.
That is a bummer. Did you talk to them about it?
That is a pretty harsh way to put it.  What are you talking about?
That is awful. What happened?
That's good! You're still a good presenter.
That is so nice. What did you buy?
That is a great community to live in.  What city are you in?
I like hot, steamy summers! I think you should pack light and wear sunscreen.
That is scary! What did you do to stop the wasp?
What is it going to be?
Oh no, that must have been frustrating for you to deal with.
That's so nice of them. I bet you felt bad.
I can relate. I have a lot of fond memories of my childhood.
I know what you mean!
That's awesome, I hope that you continue to do what you love.
That's great, you must be very happy to work for them.
That is awful! I would be very upset.
That sounds like a lot of fun. I hope you find a good girlfriend soon.
What did he do?
That's crazy! I bet you're really happy for her!
That's a good one.  She's lucky to have a friend like you!
I am sure you did.
That's good, you must be very confident in your abilities now.
That is good news!  Are you planning on going back there?
Wow, you're quite ambitious. What's your plan?
That sounds terrifying. What did you do?
That sounds very frustrating.  It is very hard to find things in a wheelchair.
That's awesome.  Did she come visit?
I have, but I did it for work, so it was worth it.
That's horrible! I hope you at least learned something from it.
That's terrible, what happened?
Well, I'd probably be glad! I hate getting honked at.
I agree. I have never been in an accident.
That is awesome!
I was accepted to a college I had never been to before. It was a big deal for me.
Oh no! Did you hear any thunder?
I hope the storms go away quickly.
I agree. He was a great person.
I agree, I've never been able to get over my depression, but I've been working on it.
Oh wow! I bet he was impressed.
Did you get a raise?
Oh, that sounds fun! What amusement park?
I do!  My favorite is Universal Studios.  The thrill rides are so much fun!
That is awesome! I wish I had a savings account.
Oh that's good!  I've been trying to get my finances in order for a while now, and it's great to hear that you're on the right track!
That's great. Did you have a lot of guests?
I have had those kids. They are the best.
Oh no! That's terrible! Did you get it?
That's horrible. I am sorry. What was your dog's name?
I'm a big fan of TV shows.
I know what you mean. I've seen so many sad movies that I have to cry, but I still enjoy them.
That sounds like a lot of fun!  I've been to Busch Gardens a couple times.  What do you think you're going to do?
I did, but I didn't go to the one in Tampa.  I went to the one in Williamsburg.  It was pretty cool.
I agree. Kids are so simple.
Oh man. How did you react?
What's not even a little?
That is so nice of them!
That is great. I hope they both get better.
That's terrible!  How did you catch it?
Why? What happened?
Oh that sounds fun! Did you end up dancing?
That's great! What kind of people are they?
That's great, what's it going to be like?
I am sure it is special.
Did you cheer her on?
That's great! What were they doing?
I have been feeling down about my finances.
I'm so proud of you and your son!
That's good! I bet you were happy to have help!
That is awesome!  What job are you interviewing for?
I am glad I could help, but I have to say that I think you are right. I am sure you will be fine.
Oh no! Did you eat it?
That's good!  Did you have to throw it out?
That's really cool. What kind of store is it?
I love that store! I have a lot of friends who go there.
I love seeing my mom too.  She's so sweet.
That must have been tough.  What did you do to help him get started?
That's great!  Did you join?
I think it's a great perspective to have.  I've always wanted to live in Alaska!
That is great. I hope you are feeling better now.
I am so glad that you have people in your life who care about you. I am sure that you will get through this.
I agree, I was just thinking the other day about a friend who had a huge fight with his wife and how he just kept blaming her for everything.
I'm glad to hear that. I'm not sure about the change but I hope for it.
That's a lot of time. I'm sure you will be okay.
That's so cool.  I'm sure he's a great person.  I hope he finds someone soon!
That happens to me all the time.  What did you do?
I agree. People are just so selfish sometimes.
That's really sad. What happened?
That's so sad.
I know the feeling. I'm really looking forward to a better job.
It's okay to have a tough time in life, I'm sure you'll find the right path.
I bet! I have a sister who is 20, and she's starting college next month.
That's great. You have to be patient.
That's so cool! I love company trips. What are you planning?
I love summer, but the heat can be unbearable in my area.
Yeah, I've never done it. I'm afraid.
That's awesome! What's your favorite prayer?
You're right. I'm not really good at taking chances.
I'm sorry to hear that. I know it can be hard to give up meat.
I can relate.  I used to be a meat and dairy fanatic, but I've been trying to cut back a bit for health reasons.  I've found some really good recipes on Pinterest that make it feel like I'm eating healthy food.
Wow, that sounds so stressful.  I hope you can get through it without too much pain.
That's really great of you.  What did you do?
Did you have to do anything to help?
That's nice. What's the most important thing to her?
Yeah, we live right next to each other.
I have never seen one of those! They are really rare!
That's a pretty cool car.  I don't see any racing stripes on mine.
That sucks. Did you find a way to get it out of him?
That's terrible! I hope she doesn't do that again.
That's so nice of her. What did she make?
What a nice gesture. I love when people do nice things for you.
I love a good steak.
What happened?
You have to be patient and not give up!
That is awesome! What did he make?
That sounds delicious!  What did you eat?
I am happy for you.  I have a friend who got a promotion too.
That's great, how old are you now?
I bet she is a smart girl!
I have two boys, and a daughter.  They are the best thing that has ever happened to me!
That's great.  You must be excited to go.
That sounds like a great trip!
I hope you had a good time!
That sounds amazing, did you have any fun activities?
That must have been quite fun.
Oh, what a great day!  What park?
I do, and I would love to visit the one in my city's park!
I understand, I'm sure you can entertain yourself.
That's amazing! What do you do to keep everyone entertained?
I'm so glad you learned that!  Where did you move to?
I'm glad to hear you are feeling good again.
That's not cool.  I'm sorry.  You should ask him if you can get a car.  It's a long way to the car dealership.
That is good to hear. Do you have a lot of money to spend on your car?
That's great!  I'm sure you're happy to have less driving duties.  You can use that time to do other things.
Yes, one of them is a boy.
That's cool. Did you see what happened?
It must have been a long time since you last talked to her.
That's a good perspective to have.
Yes, I'm able to visit them often.  I have a lot of family.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to visit often anymore though.
Oh no! That sounds awful. Did she get too drunk and do something nasty?
That's great! I'm glad you're committed to your wife.
Oh wow, that's great. What play did you go see?
That's great. What made you go?
I know what you mean. It's like you're not there with them.
I'm glad I could suggest something.
That sounds delicious! What's the recipe?
That's great!  You must be confident in your abilities to make it.  What did you make?
I hope so, I am happy for you
I agree, I am sure that you will be able to get that raise if you work hard.
I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!
That's great. I'm sure you'll do great.
Oh no!  That sounds like a lot of fun!  Did it scare you?
I think I can, it's like that feeling you get when you're not sure what to do next.
Oh yeah! I am really excited for the college football season!
I love the Packers! I don't know much about Alabama.
That is awesome!  I've never seen anyone do that before!
That's so true, I see a lot of bad stuff on the news. But I'm glad you got to see it.
That's nice of your friend!
Oh, that's too bad.  Did you get it fixed?
Oh wow! You must be really smart! What was your grade?
That's awesome! What was it about?
I am so sorry to hear that.  I am sure you are feeling pretty down.  I am sorry about that.
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope they are okay.
That is very exciting! Do you have any plans for the baby?
I am sure they will. I had a similar experience.
That is scary! I hope you were prepared.
That's great.  I've always been a little nervous about emergencies.  Did you have any kids?
Oh no! Did you get caught?
I agree, you should have known better.
I hope they get better soon!
Oh nice. He sounds like a little scally wabbit.
That's great!  Did you have to work hard for it?
That's good to hear! What did you get?
Oh man that sounds like a terrible movie.
That's really funny. I hate when movies are on too long.
I bet you felt pretty nervous!
That is great news!  I am so happy for you.
Oh no!  Did you ever get to see what kind of dog it was?
That's terrible.  Is she sick?
That's terrible. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Oh, that's sad. Did you get a good laugh?
Oh wow! That is so exciting.  I am sure you are so proud of him!
That is so sweet! What kind of food does he like?
That's a long date. I'm glad you guys had a good time though.
Oh, that's nice, I love zoos.  What were you and your friends doing?
That must have been so sad.  I'm so sorry.  I know how much you loved your pet.
I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you're being positive.
Oh I know that feeling! I did the same thing with my first job.  I worked for 2 weeks before I got my first job.
It was such a long time ago.
Oh, that is pretty cool.  How long have you been riding it?
I bet it was.  Did you go to work?
Oh no. I hope you're okay.
That's a bummer.  How did it end?
Oh no! Did you feel embarrassed?
Oh that's nice. Did you guys have fun?
That's so true, time just goes by so fast.
That's so sweet! I bet you have some great memories of him.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh no!  Well you are lucky to have such a nice friend.  I bet you felt a little bad though, but it's good you had a friend to hang out with.
That's the worst thing you can do
That's nice. What did you do?
I'm sorry for your loss. I know how that feels.
I'm so sorry to hear about your sister. I hope she is in a better place.
That's good to hear. What job do you have?
I agree with you.  I was in a bad place a few years ago, but I felt a sense of hope and peace when I was in that place.
Did you do something good?
That sounds like a very interesting job.
I have lost my phone before too. I hope you found it!
How long did it take?
That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you have a big party?
What happened?
That's really sad. What have you done to try to stay in touch?
Oh wow! That is awesome! I'm sure you'll have a blast!
I hate that. What show was it?
That was a funny show. I love it.
That is the best feeling.
I'm glad you have the time to do so.
I'm glad you're taking some time to relax and recharge. I'm sure you'll have a great trip!
I understand that.  I am not good at flying either.  I always get so nervous!
Oh no.  Was it a surprise?
That's sad. I'm sorry to hear that.
I am so glad to hear that. What chores did you do?
I am sorry to hear that. It's hard to see your yard get overgrown.
I bet, what happened?
That's great to hear! It can be hard for people to be away from each other, but if you have a strong relationship, it can be really good.
i am sure you are proud of him
That's weird.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  But honestly, it's not your fault.  You can't control what others do.  It's your husband's responsibility to be respectful of you.
Oh, that sounds so scary. Did you have to call the police?
That's awesome. Is she a musician?
Did she get an A?
I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been really scary for you.
That is very mature of you, I am sure your friend appreciated it
That's terrible. Have you talked to him about it?
I know how you feel.  I've worked nights and it's hard.
What a great feeling!
Oh yeah, I know what you mean.  I'm trying to save up for a car, and a vacation, and a house.  It's a lot to keep track of.
I know what you mean.  I try to avoid them as much as possible.  I'd rather watch a nice romantic comedy.
I hate that show!
That is frustrating. I hope you will get it!
That's a good thing though, it's always good to have a little uncertainty in life.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're okay.
I'm sure they will be ready soon. What are they in school for?
That's awesome! I hope she does well!
I totally understand. I'm 30 and I have so many good memories from when I was younger.
I'm so sorry. Did you call the police?
That is good. I hope you are safe.
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope you can find some closure.
How did it end?
That's awesome. What kind of job was it?
That's awful.  Was it a new friend or someone you know?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That sounds like fun! Did you enjoy it?
Did you go to the beach recently?
That's terrible.  How did you react?
That's not cool.  What did he say?
That was a great show.  I've seen it a few times.  What did you think of it?
I love that guy! He's amazing!
I'm sorry to hear that. That's awful.
I feel you. I was in the middle of a conversation with my girlfriend and I had to take a cab. I think I was getting a bit sick.
Oh no!  Are you nervous?
I am not sure what you are talking about.
That's awful.  What did you do?
That is pretty hard to hear.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Was she in labor long?
I am glad that the situation turned out well for everyone.
I have never been to a concert before. How did it go?
Oh my goodness, that's so sweet!  That's the kind of moment you'll always remember.  What did you name the baby?
That is very nice of him. I hope you are happy with him.
That is so nice.  I wish I had a good leader like that.  I am so tired of the way people treat their employees.
That sounds like a fun time.  I used to do the same thing with glow sticks.
That's a nice way to spend the evening.
I know the feeling.  I go to bed super early and wake up super early.  It's like my body is trying to tell me that it's time to get up.
I know that feeling. I always feel more alert after 4 hours.
Oh that is exciting.  What are you looking to buy?
Oh wow! I bet it was very exciting.
Oh no. What happened?
Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.  That must be so hard for her.
What kind of work do you do?
Oh, that's so unfair. What's your problem?
That is so sweet!  Is she a good artist?
Did you like it?
That's nice of you.  Did they do well?
Oh wow! That must have been fun!
Oh that's great, good luck!
That's good. I don't know what I would do if I had to leave my current job.
That sounds exciting. What kind of photos?
That is really nice.  I love looking at old photos.  Do you have any of those photos?
What did he do?
That's not good, what did he do?
I bet you are! I hope you do well.
What kind of job is it?
I think you might have been mistaken.
That's okay, it happens
You must have been very upset.
Why did you get married?
I'm sorry, I hope you're okay.
I agree with you there. We are important to who we are with.
What kind of job were you interviewing for?
Oh, that's interesting. Is he or she doing a good job?
Oh no!  What happened?
Oh my goodness, that's so gross! I wouldn't have been able to look at myself if it had been that close. Did you have to call a plumber?
Oh no! Did it get worse?
I bet it was a scary experience! I'm glad you overcame it!
That's a bummer. Did you find it easy to replace?
That is true. You would have to be very good at it to feel confident.
Oh no, did you tell her?
What happened?
What made you marry her?
oh no that is not good.
I bet she was so upset to have done that. Did you report her?
That's good.  I'm sure she'll understand.
That's great! I hope everything goes smoothly!
I bet.  That sounds like a lot of work.  Do you have a contractor?
Oh really? What kind of car did you buy?
That's awesome! I love mustang cars.
Oh no! That's terrible! Did you get hurt?
Oh no! What happened?
What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. I think the best thing you can do is try to stay positive.
Oh cool! Do you know the words?
Well, you must be feeling confident.
That's a great goal. I hope she does well.
That's awesome!
That's not good. I hope she had a good trip.
That sounds like a lot of time. I bet you miss him a lot.
That is so sad.  Did you have a big dog?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.
That is great!  I bet you are going to make it a great time.
I bet.  I am sure you will be together again soon.  How long have you been apart?
Oh no, what movie?
Oh, I have heard of those.  Are you on your computer?
That's awesome!  Are you going to a nice location?
I've never been on a cruise! I'd be excited too!
That's great! I bet you have a lot of fun plans for her!
Oh, that sounds nice. Did you have a good experience?
That sounds like a good plan. What are you having?
I bet you will have a good time. What are you and your guests eating?
Oh no, what was it?
Oh yeah, that movie is pretty scary.
That's so sweet. I bet you were emotional when you saw them.
Wow, that's awesome! What book are you reading?
Oh no! Did you get out of there?
That's pretty cool. Did you see any?
What is going on?
I am glad you found someone you like.
How did he do it?
What is the brand?
That is normal.  I am sure you will do great!
You should be nervous.
That is a lot of responsibility. I bet it was a lot of fun to leave them with someone else.
That is good, did they do something wrong?
That is nice, I hope you have a good time together.
I used to play a lot of them. It's great that you're keeping busy.
That is too bad. You must be feeling a little lonely.
What is it?
That's a bad feeling, I'm sure you will get there though.
How would you know?
What did you do?
That's great. What was going on?
I hate when people say movies are boring, I never do. I loved the movie you're talking about. What did you like about it?
Oh wow, I love sci-fi movies! I bet it's so much fun!
I think you're right.
I am sure they are very happy to be able to share.
I know, that's the worst. What was it?
Nice. You must be a meat lover!
I really like labradors, I have a few of them myself.
I'm sure he's a good boy.
Oh no, I can't imagine that. How old is the dog?
That's sad. Have you been thinking of moving there?
That sounds like a nice place to live.  What city is it in?
That is horrible, what did you do?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have any kids?
Oh no, I hate those people too
I hope you are correct.
I am so excited for you!
I don't know.  I am not a fan of going anywhere.  It is so boring.
Oh no! What happened?
Oh wow. I would have freaked out.
That's so unfair. Did you talk to him about it?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you ever get paid back?
Oh cool! I'm sure it will be worth the effort.
That's the worst, that's when you start to panic and realize how bad things are going to be.
Wow, that's good. What does she do to help you?
Did you guys have a good time?
That sounds like a lot of fun! What was your favorite part?
Oh, I bet you did! Did you feel like you could get away with it?
I understand. I have done that.
I'm sure it did. I hate horror movies.
Oh I'm sorry, is it a scary movie?
I'm not sure if I would want that.
I'm always curious about those things. Do you have a partner?
That's great, that's very thoughtful of her!
Oh wow, you must be so excited!
I agree. I grew up in a very dysfunctional family and I wish I had a good in-law.
What kind of car is it?
I can understand that, it can be really hard to keep your kids on track.
I can understand that. I think that he would have to work hard to not fall into that trap.
Wow! That's a good plan! Did she find out?
That sounds amazing!  I would be so happy to see my family.
That's great.  What makes you happy about her?
That is a wonderful feeling. Where are you?
I'm not sure I agree with that. I think they're pretty harmless.
I know what you mean. I've been to a lot of concerts and sports events, and sometimes the loud noises scare me.
I would feel the same way. Did you have a good reason?
Oh no. Why not?
I'm sure you did. My mom always made sure to stay in touch with me even if she was far away.
That's unfortunate. What was it about the work training?
What movie are you going to see?
I love that movie. I bet you are excited!
Oh wow.  That was a very nice act.  I hope she is okay.
I think they are a type of bag filled with money and good luck.
Oh wow, how did that go?
That's cool! Do you have a favorite one?
That sounds like a nice drive.  Did you have any issues?
That's awesome. Where did you go?
I know what you mean.  I have a truck and sometimes it is hard to find a place to rest.  I was driving home from work the other day and I had to stop at a rest stop to change my gas tank.  It was a bit of a long stop.
What are you driving?
That's great! What are you renovating?
That's good to hear! What's the plan?
Oh no! I hope everything went well for him!
I bet you are, what did he do?
That is great! Do you think you will keep it up?
I really don't know how people can be so active
I think loneliness is a real problem. I feel it when I'm alone.
What happened?
Wow, that's a classic. I love that song!
I think that's normal.  I'm not sure what it is about the 80's.
That is really sad.  Did he get in trouble?
I have been there. I have been on a mission for a week.
I'm glad you were safe.
That sounds scary. I hope you are okay.
I know what you mean. Sometimes I wish I could go back to watching TV on TV.
I don't like when that happens. I always end up going to the movies anyway.
Oh wow, that's awesome! I am sure she is proud of herself.
Oh, that's cool. I'm sure you'll have a great time.
Do you think she'd like to talk to you?
Oh, I understand.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you think you could find someone else?
Yeah that's terrible.  Have you tried bison before?
That sounds good! I think I might have found it.
That sounds awful, did you have to get rid of him?
Oh no, that sounds like a terrible smell. I'm sorry to hear that.
I know the feeling! I've been with a cranky toddler for 2 years now!
I hope so too! I feel you. I have a brother in the military.
That's a pretty embarrassing thing to do.  Did you get caught?
Oh no! That's terrible! Did you try to call the police?
That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that.
That is so cool, I hope you are taking care of yourself while he is away!
That's very scary. I'm glad she's okay now.
That's terrible. I hope she gets better.
I love cats! What kind of issues does your cat cause?
I would be scared if I were you.
That's frustrating. What is the problem?
I hope you do well.
I love the greatest showman.  What movie did you watch?
Well, that's great! I've seen it a few times too.
Oh no! That's horrible! Was it a big deal?
That's too bad.  What happened?
Oh no!  Did you have any plans?
That's good to hear. I hope you can move on from it.
Oh, that's great! I'm glad to hear that you're all set up now!
That sounds great. You must be so excited.
I'm sorry to hear that. I know how that feels.
Oh no!  That is terrible.  I am so sorry to hear that.
I agree with that. I think it is so inhumane.
That is nice, I like to volunteer as well.
Oh really? What happened?
That's pretty cool, I love surprises.
I agree. Cheating is bad
I have, I used to have a girlfriend who was a prostitute.
That's sad. I don't see why they have to be stormy.
I hope so too!
That's a bummer. I know that feeling.
That's a good thing though, you're happy to have a baby.
Yeah, I know what you mean! My mom is always there for me too. We are like two peas in a pod.
That must be really hard. I'm sure you're doing well.
I hate those long trips.
Yeah, we need some of that back home.
oh that sounds like fun, do you have a family vacation planned?
That's great. You must be excited.
That is a good accomplishment.  What class was it?
That is great! What did they do?
What makes them so special?
That's great.  I bet you really enjoy it.  It's nice to have some friends.
I am sure he is doing a great job.  How long has he been working at that place?
Oh wow! That is a great accomplishment!
I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you looking for a new job?
That's great! I hope you get the job you want!
That's awesome! What kind of job is it?
Yes, I've applied to a lot of different ones. I'm hoping to get one soon.
That's not cool.
I bet.  I would be jealous too.
Did you see him with a big smile on his face?
That's awesome!
Did you try to fix it?
I know, right? It's ridiculous that we can't even get a decent cup of coffee at the local convenience store!
That is so sad. Did you have to move by yourself?
That is great! I'm happy you were prepared!
Oh no, that's awful!  Did you catch the guy?
That is a sad situation, but at least he didn't hurt her.
That is terrible. I am sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that.  What's the diagnosis?
Oh, that's nice. How did you like to see them?
That's pretty shocking. I would be shocked if I had my girlfriend.
Oh I bet you are ready. What are you studying for?
I understand, I'm doing the same.
I love looking back on old memories.  What were they drawing?
That's too bad.  What was your favorite drawing?
Wow, that must have been embarrassing. I bet you felt a little bad about it.
Oh wow! Did you get engaged?
That is so scary, did you go to a safe place?
I am glad that you were not in the area.  I have never been near a storm.
Oh! That's awesome! I'm sure she will be your best friend for a long time.
I love basset hounds. They are so cute!
That's fun! What breed is she?
Oh no!  Were you able to get your car back?
That is really frustrating! I would ask to speak with a manager at the car dealership.
That is terrible! I hope you didn't get any damage from it.
That's understandable, you have to work through it, it's not easy.
That's awesome! I am sure you will do great!
I am happy for you.
Oh really? What was it that made you happy?
That sounds like a lot of work to keep up!
That's really nice of them.  Did you need help?
That's really nice of them, I bet you're grateful.
That's amazing! Congratulations!
Oh that is awesome!  Is he older?
Oh wow! Are you excited?
I'm taking my wife to the Grand Canyon.  It's a beautiful place!
That is bad. Did you get in trouble for it?
That is unfortunate.  I hope you are okay
Wow, that's ridiculous.  I would have been so upset.  Did you finally get someone?
That's a pretty good point. I have been trying to get more people in to help, but they're just not coming through.
What was so bad about it?
Oh wow, that is so horrible. I hope you are okay.
I am glad you guys were prepared.  Do you live in a flood zone?
That's good. Did you all make it through okay?
What an amazing gift! I'm so happy for you!
Did you get it from someone you know?
That's nice!  Did they get a nice gift?
Oh no!  I hate when that happens.  What are you on?
thats so exciting! how long until it is here?
That's great! I am sure she will be happy to be with you!
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he finds comfort in the things he used to enjoy.
That is very kind of you.  I know it's hard to deal with kids that are so young, and sometimes it's hard to know what to do.
that is so nice.
I love when people do that. It's a nice surprise.
What kind of test was it?
Oh wow! You must have been very determined! What did you study for?
What is he doing?
Oh cool, that's awesome. What was the subject?
I hope you guys get it!
I think I know what you are talking about. It's not easy either!
I'm sorry to hear that. Did he have a good reason?
Oh, what happened?
What are you doing tomorrow?
Well, it is always a great day to be alive!
That is so sad.  What happened?
I feel you.  I know a lot of people that are struggling.
That's unfortunate. What was the advisory about?
That's good to hear. I'm sure it was a great experience.
I'm sorry to hear that, but maybe you can find someone in your life?
I hope you find what you are looking for.
That is so awesome!
That is a good attitude to have.
That is great, do you play poker regularly?
I bet it was. Did you get what you wanted?
I hate spiders! Do you have any that live in your home?
That sucks. What was it that made you scared?
I know right, I've never played a game in my life but I can play a video game in my sleep
I agree. I have not played any of these games for years.
That's awful. How did they fix it?
I love trying new restaurants.
Wow. What a relief. Is it hard to be away from them for so long?
That is no good.
That's great! He must be a smart kid.
I am sure it is, sometimes we do not see the people we love as often as we want to.
I am sorry to hear that.
That is terrible! I am so sorry to hear that.
That is awesome! What high school did you go to?
That's a long time. I am sorry to hear that.
Oh no!  I hate when that happens.  Did you get to go home?
That's true, but I think you should be able to enjoy a slice of pie or ice cream while driving, as long as you're not too close to other cars.
I hope it doesn't happen! I'm glad you have the pantry full.
I know, that's why I always have a flashlight handy!
Oh wow! I bet that was a big weight off your shoulders.
I bet she is!  What did she do?
I bet he is. What do you mean by that?
I'm glad he's there for you. What are your health issues?
That's really bad. I would never do that.
That is so unfortunate.  I hope you were able to recover your items.
I am sure it is not a big deal to just be afraid of them.
Wow, that's so scary! I hate snakes!
That is so sad. Why did she leave you?
How long have you been going through it?
What movie were you going to see?
I understand that. But it is better to go alone than to go with someone who is not interested.
That is really nice to hear. You must have been married for a long time.
that is good to hear
That's great. I hope so too.
That is good.
That's good! What's changed?
That's great.  You must be very happy.
That is wonderful! How long have you been married?
I am happy for you!
That is awesome!  Are you going to do anything with it?
That is funny, I never win either.
That's awesome. I'm glad you have a good relationship with your family.
I understand. Maybe you should go talk to your friends.
That is so disappointing.  I am sorry you had to go without it.
I think rain is a good thing! I love a good rain shower!
Did you get it?
That's awesome! I'm sure you will do great things!
That's disgusting. I can only imagine how gross that must be.
That's too bad. I hate when that happens.
Wow, that's so bad. I bet you don't get to spend much time together.
I know, I've been there too.
That sounds like a lot of change!
I love Alaska! Do you live there?
I'm sorry.  I can't help but feel that they are just being rude.
That is so annoying! I bet it's frustrating for you.
I am too! I have been waiting for ages!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you still have your old ones?
I can understand that. I've done that before too.
I understand that, but I have no idea what to do with that.
That is so nice of him!
That's great! Marriage is a wonderful thing.
That's disgusting.  Why don't people care about their surroundings?
Why do you do that?
Why are you afraid of it?
That's so funny, I bet it was a little scary.
That's a bummer.  Do you think you'll get the job?
I'm glad you were able to get it!
That sounds like so much fun. Where are you going?
That sounds like a great family vacation! Where are you going?
That is awesome! Are you excited about it?
that's awesome, did you get a good deal?
That's really nice of them, I'm sure they have your best interests at heart.
I used to shop there all the time. I think it was a really great place.
That's great to hear! It's nice to see businesses like that out there.
That is terrible.  Did you tell her?
That's good. Sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you.
I understand. What do you do to get rid of the time?
I understand. Why do you feel anxious?
That's sad, but I hope you can still stay in touch with him.
That's always a little scary. Are you guys in a long distance relationship?
That's great!  What are some of your goals?
I'm not sure I understand.
I agree, it's so sad. I was in a shelter once and saw a puppy in a cage.
I know what you mean. I have been on the receiving end of some awful people.
I can imagine that is a really fun day.
That's so true.
What kind of tv do you have?
That's great! Do you have a big screen?
That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that.
That is really nice of you.  How long have you been doing this?
I agree, but I still don't like the way some people behave.
I completely agree! I hate when people try to compromise and then change their mind.
That must have been tough.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you do anything to make it more bearable?
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's sad when dogs pass away.
Well, that's great to hear. How has he been doing?
Oh wow. That's amazing! What division?
That is so sad. Is there anything you can do to help?
Oh no! What happened?
Oh no! I hope everything turned out okay.
Oh wow, that's quite a thing. I'm glad you were able to help them out.
Did you name her?
I am sorry to hear that, that is very sad.
I have two babies, I know what you mean.  They can be so cranky!  I used to give them Tylenol when they were babies.  I know it doesn't help but it seems to help a little.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope he gets better soon!
That's a good point. I'm sure you will be fine.
I feel you.  I have a baby and they are always squirming and trying to get out of the bed.
Oh wow, I would love to do that.
I love Italy too!  It's my favorite country to visit.
I love to travel too.  I have never been abroad.  I wish you had gone.
Oh that's nice of your friend!
How did that taste?
You are right.  I hate it when that happens.
Oh no! Did you get hurt?
Oh no! I've always been afraid of the dark.
I can understand that. I'm always worried about something.
That's a very nice thing to do.
That is very true.  I love animals and I always wanted to be a dog.
Oh no! That is awful. Were you able to get a flashlight?
I hope that you didn't have to wait for long for candles to arrive.
Wow.  That is a terrible thing to happen.  Did she make it up to you?
I can relate. I was mad about the same thing.
I hate when that happens.  It's like my stomach just knows when something is off.  I hope you got the milk in the fridge quickly!
I'm sorry to hear that, but at least you had a good reason!
Yeah that sounds nice.  I like the sound of rain, it always puts me in a good mood.
I love it too!  It's just so soothing!
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. That must be terrifying.
I am sorry.
That sounds like a fun time, did you win or lose?
Oh wow!  That's crazy!  I bet people were shocked.  What did you do after that?
I have heard that! I am in the process of buying a house in NOLA and I am so ready to move in.
I've heard of that. I love a good party!
I know the feeling. What happened?
Oh no, that's terrible! I am so sorry. What did you do?
What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Is there anything I can do to help?
That is a very good thing. She must have been a great host.
That sounds like a nightmare. Did you go inside?
That sounds exciting! What kind of presentation is it?
That's great! What kind of numbers are you looking at?
Yeah, I've been there before. I was in high school.
That is so disappointing, why did she not show?
That is amazing!  I am so happy for you.
Oh wow! That's great. It's nice to have people that are there for you.
Oh no! I'm sorry you had to do that!
What are they?
Oh wow! I bet they're so excited!
That is a good thing! You can get a head start on the day.
I know! I was at the mall last weekend and I was so overwhelmed.
What happened?
How did you drop it?
That is awesome!  I bet you felt pretty proud of yourself.
I'm sure you are not alone.  I hate crowded places.  But, I think I would be a little more comfortable if I was in the same situation.  It is hard to be happy and relaxed when you are surrounded by people.
That's good, I'm sure that's what you need.
That's true, but how long do you stay in store?
Oh my gosh, what a creepy thing to see!
Oh my goodness, that's terrible! What happened?
Oh no! I hate when that happens! Did it make you uncomfortable?
Oh, that sounds like a bad idea!  I can't imagine eating something from a box blindfolded!
That is no fun, you should tell him you are excited to see what he will get, and maybe he will surprise you!
What do you mean by that?
I'm glad you did too. He's probably going to be a great friend.
Oh that's great! I have never been to a music festival, but I am sure you guys did well!
Oh no!  That sounds awful.  Was it a party with friends or was it a solo trip?
What were you doing?
I have been there.  It is a stressful situation.  I have a feeling I will do well.
That's really cool. Did you have to study hard to get it?
Oh, I would have been so mad. Did you let her out?
Who is she?
I know what you mean. I used to think I was too old to go back to school.
That is great news!  I am so proud of you.
oh man, that sucks. Did you try to apply again?
Oh man, that's terrible! Did you go to a big college or a smaller one?
Oh no. What did he do?
Oh no.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Is there anything you can do to make it right?
I agree, it's amazing how they've come so far
I have been playing for a while now.
I love roller coasters too, but I hate that they close for the winter.
I love the time of year where you can go back to school.  I can't wait to go back to school too!
That's great! I'm sure you will do great things.
Yeah, I'm a computer science major. I've heard you guys can be pretty good engineers.
That's great to hear. What do you have to be thankful for?
That's nice. What is it?
Wow, I bet you are proud of him
I used to, but I'm too old for that.
That sounds scary, you should get a security system.
That's not good!
That's the worst.  What happened?
That's crazy. Did you get a lot of laughs out of it?
I would tell my friend!
I am sorry that happened. I hope you can find a way to make it right.
That's sad. Do you miss it?
I understand. I'm not very good at socializing either.
I bet!  I had to take a year off after college.  Do you have a plan in place for the first year?
That sounds like a lot of work! Do you think you'll be able to do it?
I'm sure you will do great!
That is too bad, but it's good you are trying.
What did you have for dinner?
I love bowling. Is it a favorite of yours?
i am sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that, what kind of food do you eat?
That sounds fun! Do you play video games?
That's so sweet. I bet it was a great experience for you.
That's terrible, I hate when that happens.  Why do they always argue?
That is good, are they getting spoiled?
I agree. I love storms, but I hate when the power goes out.
That is awful. I am sorry.
That is great news! I hope you have a great college experience.
Oh, I am sure you will.  I'm sure you will.  I am sure you will
That's awesome! What kind of music is it?
Well I am glad you enjoyed them. I don't think I ever enjoyed them.
That's good that he has skills. Did you take a lesson from him?
That's a good thing! You need to be humble!
I bet you are! I hope you are ready for the challenge.
That sounds like a lot of work!
I can imagine.  How did it happen?
I agree, sometimes mistakes are necessary to learn and grow.
It's always great to have friends that you can trust and be there for you.
That is so cool! I've never been to Utah!
Oh wow, that sounds like a pretty cool car.
I have had the same issue, I wish I had someone else.
How much are you looking to spend?
That's terrible. I hate when cars die.
Oh no!  That is horrible.  Did you call the police?
That is really frustrating.  What happened?
What happened to your car?
That's an old car. I wonder how it's holding up.
I can understand that.  How did you handle it?
Oh wow, that sounds really uncomfortable. I can't even imagine that, lol.
Oh no, I'm sorry.  Did you have a dog?
I understand that. I have had to do that a lot.
I bet.  Were you okay?
That is pretty funny, I bet you felt pretty bad about it though.
Why are you worried about it?
That is so sweet! I love when people do things for you like that.
I'm glad you did. I'm sure it was difficult
I am sure it was very difficult. I am glad you did it.
That is great.  Did you find a good deal?
Wow, that is a good find!  What kind of car is it?
I understand, that's bad.
that is good, is it a new thing?
That's terrible.  Have you tried washing your pants?
I know how you feel. It's frustrating when you can't get something out of your clothes.
oh that sucks, that is a lot to lose.
Oh wow, I'm glad you guys were able to recover well.  Did you lose anything?
I agree!
I go to work
How come?
How did you know?
I love roller coasters!  I always get so excited for the thrill of it all.  Did you get on it?
I love high speeds!
That is a nice gesture. I hope you enjoyed it.
That's a good point. I think we all go through that at some point.
oh no! i would have been so scared!
Wow, that's amazing. Did she have any medical issues?
That is horrible.  I would be very upset too.  I have a bad feeling about this company.
That is pretty unusual.  What did you do?
That's good that you have an off day, it can be a good time to relax
That's a pretty rough time for a guy.
Oh wow, what did you do?
Oh no, what was going on?
Oh no, did you do well?
What kind of presentations?
Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry to hear that. I bet you were devastated.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  Did she pass away or is she no longer with you?
That's great! I bet you felt a lot of relief and happiness.
Well that's nice! You're always so optimistic!
I have a multi-tool and a small screwdriver in my purse.  I am always prepared and ready to go
That's a good mindset to have. It's always good to be prepared.
That's exciting!  I hope you do well in it!
I'm sure you'll do great.  I'm sure you'll make a great impression.
I hope it's a good car and not something expensive.
I've heard good things about that car. It sounds like a great ride.
That's great! I bet you're going to have a good time.
I bet you will, you're doing so well!
Oh yeah? I'm not sure I'd be able to relax like that.
I love sausage! What's your favorite type?
I'm glad you are being responsible.
It is nice to have a safety cushion.  I hope you don't have any emergencies either.
I am so happy for you!
I am glad to hear that!  I know how hard it is to get back on track.
That sounds like fun.  Are you excited to see what the cruise will be like?
That sounds like a lot of work, but it sounds like it's worth it. What are you both doing?
How do you feel about her?
That is nice, did you buy it for her?
That's awesome! I'm sure you appreciate her.
That is not good. Are they busy?
What don't you want to do?
That's nice. It's always nice to relax after a long day.
That is good, what was it?
That is terrible.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Was your dog well taken care of?
Oh, what kind of job were they talking about?
That's a good idea. Dogs can be a great companion.
Oh wow, that's quite a mix of breeds.
That's a long time. How do you keep yourself entertained?
That is very brave of you.
Oh, that is really cool. I bet it was a fun surprise!
That is so nice! What book is it?
That is very sad. How did she react to the situation?
That's good to hear. How long have you been apart?
I hate that.
That's crazy!  What did you confront him about?
Oh no! I hope he's feeling better now!
I am sorry to hear that,
I know how you feel.  What do you do to cope with it?
I know what you mean, I hate when time runs out.
I do too, I have a dog too.
Oh that's so sweet.  Do you have any pets?
Did she recover well?
That is not a bad price to pay.
Oh no, what happened?
Why are you devastated?
Oh no! I'm sorry. What happened?
That is a very long time. Did you lose him?
I am sorry to hear that.  I can't relate to that.  Do you have any friends?
I'm sorry you're going through that. It's not easy.
Oh wow, that's awesome! I'm not sure I could afford that!
oh i can imagine! i have a car but it is old and noone can get in it
Why do you feel sad?
Did you buy a car recently?
That's not good. Maybe you should go back and order again.
That's no good! Did you eat it?
Oh my, that's terrible! Did you get in trouble?
Oh well, I hope you didn't get in trouble!
That is very nice of her.
You are welcome. What is it that you are thankful for?
Oh god. Did it sound like a dog?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can get one now?
That was nice of her. What kind of car did she get you?
Oh nice! I've never seen one before.
Oh no, what happened?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you think they are jealous of you?
What kind of pranks?
What kind of pranks?
How did you feel?
Oh, I hate being alone at night!
I bet you are! My family is pretty tight-knit, so I'm sure they will do their best to make it home on time.
That's great! What are they doing?
That's sad to hear. Is there anything you can do to fix the situation?
That's so rude.
Wow. What movie is it?
That was a good movie.  What did you think of it?
You must have had a great time. I love the beach.
That sounds nice. I love a good rain shower
That sounds like a lot of fun. Where are you going?
That is a good time to go.  Have you been to the islands before?
Oh no! That is not good. What kind of candy did you eat?
That's usually the case, I'm sure it's not easy though.
Oh, that's great news!  How did you feel about that?
I know right? It's hard to wait.
What did you do to him?
That's great! What was the contractor for?
I bet you are. What kind of job are you interviewing for?
That's really good, good luck!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have any idea why they do that?
I know how you feel.  I have been there before.  I think the best thing to do is to give them space and let them make their own decisions.  I don't think they listen because they are too busy to care.  I would talk to them if you feel like you can.  I know I can't go to them.
What happened?  I hate bad reviews.
That is really bad. Was it something you were able to prepare for?
I do, my kids are 20, 17, and 13.  I'm not sure how I can be relieved.  I'm just glad they're safe!
Yes, I attend.  I think it's a big deal to most people.  It's just a normal thing for me.
I am so sorry for your loss.
Yeah, that is a great way to go out.  I have been in a similar situation.  It is hard to understand when you have been close to someone.  I hope you are doing well.
Oh no. What happened?
Oh that's so funny!  I bet that was a great surprise!
That's terrible.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you going to talk to her about it?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you apologize?
I have seen some people like that too. I hope he is okay.
Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. I bet he was happy you were there for him.
That is so great!  Where did you go?
I love the summer. We have a lot of fun in the summer.
That sounds so scary.
Oh no! Did you have a panic attack?
Oh no, I'm so sorry. How old was it?
Why is it hard?
I can understand that.  How did he do it?
Oh my gosh that is a lot of trouble.
I know the feeling.  What kind of treats do you like to sneak?
I would feel bad too.
Oh no. I hope you can get it together soon. I'm sure it will.
Wow, that's quite a situation! I hope he finds a good balance!
That's great. What is she doing now?
I bet she is.
Oh that's so nice. What did you do?
That is great.  I am so happy for you!
Oh wow, that's so exciting. What kind of pictures?
That's really cool.  Do you have any special family traditions?
That is not good at all.  I hope you can get it fixed soon.
I am sure it was a great feeling
That is exciting! I would love to move to a new state!
I am glad to hear that, it is always good to have a better paying job.
That's great! What kind of running do you do?
Oh my, I don't do much. I'm a bit of a couch potato. I'm a teacher and I do a lot of reading and studying.
I can imagine. I've had to sleep in the back of my truck.
That's really nice of him. I don't know how much help he really does, but it's good to see him showing you some kindness.
I'm glad to hear that! I hope you all have a great year as well!
Yeah, that's great! You're a lucky lady.
That's true. It's hard to believe it's already almost 4 years old.
That is so awesome! She is just a little baby so I know she is still learning.
That is awful! I hope everyone is safe.
That is bad. I hope they are okay.
That sounds like a great feeling.  How old is your baby?
That must be terrible. What time is it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you can get back on track?
What is it that you are trying to do?
Oh no! What made you think of that?
What kind of job do you have?
That sounds like fun! Did they enjoy it?
That is great.  Where did you go?
That is amazing.  I had a dog for 12 years.
Oh, I bet she is adorable. I love dogs, especially Jack Russels.
That's tough.  Are you really happy there?
That's great, how old is your old house?
Oh wow, that's awesome! What makes you think that?
That is good, you must be a good leader.
Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope you can get some help.
That's a good thing. I hope everything is okay.
That's a sad memory.
I am sure it was very sad.  How old was your dad?
That is an interesting dynamic. I wish I could do that.
I think everyone wishes they had someone else's looks.
Did you tell him?
That is really frustrating. It's like they just don't want to help.
That's so sweet! Did you play with it?
Oh no. That's bad. I hope he was not too upset.
I bet he is!  That is such a big milestone!
That is true, time really does fly!
I agree. Sometimes it seems like you are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
I am so sorry to hear that! Was the concert cancelled?
Oh wow. How did it go?
What did you do about it?
That is crazy! I have never been hit by a car. I am very lucky!
That's great! What happened?
That's a lot of work. I hope you made it through okay.
Oh no!  I bet you are so embarrassed.  I am sorry.
That is weird.  How do you finish a computer repair job?
That's good. I'm glad you did it.
Wow, I have! I was at a restaurant and I was on the table when my drink spilled on me. I was in a rush to get to the bathroom and I didn't have time to rush.
Oh my goodness!  I would be so mortified!  Did you say anything to the employee?
Oh yeah? I love heavy metal!
That's so sad. I hope you guys are doing better now.
Yes, I can attest to that.
That's a bummer, but at least you guys got to spend time together.
That is terrible! I hope he is okay!
That is terrible. I am so sorry for your loss.
That's awesome. I love the new star wars movies!
Oh that sounds like fun.
Oh really? What happened then?
Wow. That sounds fun!
I know what you mean. It's hard to find good places to drink.
That is a nice memory to have.  What happened to him?
I bet you do. I had a really good relationship with my grandparents.
I know, I have had those situations before.
That is always good to have a relationship where you can have time for each other
I know, it's crazy!
I'm afraid of heights too! I have been to many amusement parks that have had very tall roller coasters.
That sounds fun. What are you doing there?
What happened?
Oh no.  Are you okay?
I am sorry to hear that.  Was it a relationship or just friends?
What made you so scared?
That's too bad, I hope she has a great birthday.
That's terrible, I hate when people sleep too loudly.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it someone in your life that you are angry at?
What a great find!  Did you end up playing it?
That is awesome! I wish I could have played for free, it would be so much fun!
What a fun thing to do!
That is great!  I am so happy for you.  How are you feeling?
I'm happy for you! Where are you going?
I think I do too!  It's so much fun!
Wow! How long did she leave for?
Oh no. What happened?
That is amazing. I wish I could study like that.
Oh wow, I bet it was so satisfying to have that confidence!
That is so sad.  Did she go to school?
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's great! Where are you living now?
Oh wow, that sounds like a great place to hang out!
That is awesome, I hope you get the job.
That is awesome, I hope you get the job!
That's crazy! I bet you were so impressed!
What happened?
That's a bummer.  I bet you were disappointed.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.
I agree!  It's always scary to wait that long for something to happen
Aww that is so sweet!  I hope you get what you want!
That is a great accomplishment! How old is she?
That's great, what kind of accomplishment?
I like being alone, but I can't stand being alone for too long.  It's hard to be alone!
Why do you need it?
Oh no! I hope it was just a little bit. Did you clean it up?
What did she do?
Oh that's great. How old is he?
I would be so happy!
That's so awesome! I bet you were so happy.
That is a good memory.
Did you enjoy it?
That is a lot of time to be apart.  How do you keep in touch?
What is she a child?
How many people are in your family?
Oh no. What happened?
I remember that.  He was right, but he also didn't have to say it to me.  I can only imagine how scary that must have been.  I hope he's doing okay
That's outrageous. I've been there.
That is pretty cool. I wish I had a friend who could do that.
That's great, are you excited?
I'm glad you're so happy.
That's awesome! I've never done that before. What kind of trip did you take?
That's great that you got to see your family!
I am sorry. That must have been bad.
That's a nice gesture. Did she have a good time?
That's so exciting!  I am sure you are going to be an amazing mom!
what do you mean?
That sounds fun!  I love tubing!
Did you have a fun time?
That is hilarious.  Did it make you laugh?
That is so sad.  What a terrible way to go.
That's a lot of shame.  Why did she do that?
What did she want to see?
Awwww... that's horrible. What did you do?
Oh no!  That must have been so upsetting.  Did you call the police?
That is so exciting!  I am so happy for you!  I know you are going to be a great mom!
Wow, what is it?
Did you get close to the friend?
Wow, what did he do?
That sounds fun.  What did you end up doing?
That's great! Did you play guitar?
That's an interesting point.  I have never thought about it.  I'm not sure if I'm scared of it or just not aware of it.
Oh no! That must have been so scary!
You are so lucky. What is your new home?
That's great! You must be happy.
That is awful. I am sorry. Did you have a good night?
Oh my gosh that sounds scary. What did you do?
That is so cool. I think it would be very exciting to be asked to speak at a church.
That's awesome! I bet he was nervous. Did he have to prepare it for a special occasion?
I know what you mean. I'm a bit of a repeat offender myself.
I know what you mean.
That sounds like a great time! I love pizza.
What's going to be fun?
I can imagine! I graduated a few years ago.
That's good. Is it where you're moving to?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
I'm sorry, you're probably right, but it's frustrating when you feel like you'd be a good fit.
I know what you mean. It's like a dark cloud just hanging over the whole place.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have to go there for work?
I'm sorry to hear that! How did it turn out?
Oh no, what happened?
Did you move recently?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope things work out for you.
That's awesome! I hope you get to enjoy your money!
I'm glad you're getting paid back.
I'm sorry.  What happened?
I know what you mean.  I did that with my ex.  I just think about the good times we had and how good she was for me.
What did he major in?
I know what you mean, I have a big baby in college.
What was the thing you did?
That is true. What did you yell back?
What do you mean?
I understand. I wish I had friends like that.
How much are you looking forward to it?
That's pretty cool.  I've never been in a pool before.
Oh that is so sweet of you.  What's wrong with her?
You're very nice!  What kind of care?
I am too! How did you get there?
That's nice. I wish I had more people like that in my life.
Did they do it for a special occasion?
I am happy for you. What are they?
That's bad. Did you have to get the tree cut down?
That sounds so scary. Did you feel safe at all?
Oh wow, that is amazing! What kind of dog is she?
I am glad you are thankful to her.
Oh no, why?
That is nice. How old is she?
That must be really frustrating.
That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.
I hate when that happens
That's good. Did you have to wait long to get your money back?
What happened?
I love roller coasters! They are so much fun!
That's horrible. What did they say to you?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you give him another chance?
I understand.  Do you have a job?
How long have you been waiting?
Oh no.  Why did you feel jealous?
I understand. It's okay.
What was the movie?
I know, what was the challenge?
Why was he dying?
What happened?
I'm sorry. Why did she leave?
why do you think she would?
Oh, how fun! What did you do?
That is a good thing, I don't like thunderstorms.
Oh that sucks. What did they say to you?
What do you mean?
That's great! I love when that happens too!
I know right?  That must be a nice thing to do.
What did you do?
Oh, I'm glad you had a good time!
Why are you mean?
That's a good point.  I am a little uneasy about it.
I understand how you feel. My parents are always on my case.
You can start by saying something like "I've been thinking about how nice it is to meet new people and I'm looking to make new friends."
oh no! did you get it replaced?
Well, don't worry about it. You'll get paid soon.
I understand your frustration. I think she's just trying to get out of the house.
Oh wow. What is the reason?
How so?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you feeling overwhelmed?
That is awesome!  What is your dream job?
I'm happy for you.  What kind of job?
I know what you mean, I'm a dentist.  It's always the same for me!
I know what you mean. I have been through that.
I am glad to hear that. What was his dream job?
I think it's the luck that matters.
I think I would be a good match for Kanye.
Oh wow. That's crazy!
That's great. Did you have to do anything to get it right?
Oh, really? That's a good score! I'm sure you can afford it.
I love those cars.
I would have been so scared and angry! Did you call a pest control?
Oh no, what happened?
Oh wow, that's so nice of her!  I love the Scottish cheese, I've never tried it but I want to.  Did you like it?
I love the cheddar cheese from the store! I can't find it anywhere.
I think it is from New York. I'm not sure.
That sounds like a nice place to live.  I hope you find one.
That's really sad. Do you ever think about him?
That's really cool.
Oh no, are you going to have to cancel?
That's terrible! Why are you stuck inside?
That sounds like a nice time! Did you get to do anything you wanted?
What did you do to unwind?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
Oh? That's nice. I hate when it gets too hot outside.
I agree. I think we need to come together more.
I agree.  We've got a lot to work out.
I am so sorry to hear that. What did you do to honor him?
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.
What did you do?
That's nice, I bet you were happy to see her.
Are you excited about it?
I do, they are pretty talented.
Oh, that's good! I hope they do deliver.
That's very frustrating, I hope you get your new apartment soon!
Oh, I'm sorry. What are they in?
Why did they go back to school?
That was smart. What happened?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
That's awesome. They should be very happy.
That's crazy! I bet you were so happy!
Oh well, maybe you should try to get a lottery ticket next time.
That is great news.  How much is the bonus?
Oh wow, did it happen recently?
Oh wow! How did he like his new house?
Well that is really nice of him.
That is terrible, I hate it when that happens.  You might have to go to a different place.
I like that idea. I can imagine how difficult it would be to have everyone having the same thing.
Oh no, that sounds terrible. What are they doing that you want to sue them about?
I'm glad, how can you be?
I do that too. I really enjoy it because it gives me time to relax.
Why does he fight with you?
Oh no!  Why can't you?
How has your diet been going?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can get off the b.
Oh no, that must have been so scary.  Did you have to go to a shelter?
I'm sorry, they are so awful.
Oh that's so sweet of him!
Did you like the new one?
I love decorating! I enjoy it a lot.
That is a shame.
What's her name?
That's great!  I'm glad you have that.  What are you guys doing together?
I hate when the weather is bad, especially when it rains.
Oh, that's so sad. How old is she now?
What did he get?
Aww that's so cool!  What did he do?
I am sure he will take good care of them.
That's a good point.
I'm sure she didn't. I would be shocked if she didn't.
That's terrible. What did you do?
Oh my goodness. What was it?
Did you see it moving?
That sounds wonderful! I love that type of time. What movie did you watch?
I love relaxing times.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he was comfortable.
I'm sorry to hear that. How did he die?
That's a pretty good friend you are. I would have felt the same way.
That sounds pretty tough. Did she end up getting a job?
That sounds like a challenging one. I am sure you are doing all you can.
Oh no! Are you taking them for something else?
I am so sorry to hear that.  Are you in the same department as her?
I'm sorry.
oh that is so sad, i'm sorry to hear that, how old was the cat?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that!
That's awesome! Did you buy a ticket?
How did that happen?
That is great to hear! It sounds like you have a good financial situation.
Oh no! What happened?
That's terrible. I hope you weren't hurt.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you tell her she was drunk?
That is a good thing he was trying to help her. You are lucky to have such a kind person in your life.
Did you find anything in the mail?
That's awful! Did you call the police?
Oh no, do you have a job in town?
I like that. We do have a camera, but it's a point-and-shoot. I'd like to use it more often.
Oh that sounds good, what was the food like?
That's nice. I bet she enjoyed it.
What is the exam on?
That's great! You must be very confident.
I love hockey.  Did you watch a specific team?
That's too bad.
Oh no, that is scary!
Oh my goodness! I am so sorry. Was he okay?
That is terrible. I am so sorry to hear that.
I am sorry to hear that.
What do you do when you hear the creaks?
Oh, sounds like you have some spooky noises in the house.
That is so exciting! I bet you were happy for him!
That's exciting.  What is his hometown?
That is awesome! I am so proud of you!
How many did you eat?
I can imagine, but you are getting stronger every day.
That's a little creepy, what kind of car is it?
I am glad you are safe.
I've heard that show is good!  What's his name?
I haven't seen that show!
That sounds like a lot of fun!
That's great. You must be exhausted.
Oh no, how long have you lived in Texas?
That's great. You must be excited. I bet you are.
Did you like it?
Oh, that's great. Do you have a lot of kids?
Did you have to go to the doctor?
That's so annoying!  I'm sorry you had to wait so long.  Did they keep you waiting too long?
Oh, that's so cute! I love cat food.
Oh my, I'm so happy for you!
Oh no, that's scary! Did you answer?
I would be too!
Did you have an abortion?
That's really cool. How did it happen?
I love dressing up for Halloween! It's such a fun time of year.
I love that!  What did you wear?
That's terrible! I'm so sorry to hear that.
I hope that was not a fire.
That's terrible. I bet you are glad you made it out alive.
How did you get sorted out?
That sounds fun. Did she like it?
That's great! What is her subject?
Oh yea? I haven't seen that one. What did you think of it?
That's not good. How long did you have to watch?
I love that! I am sure it was a fun time.
That is nice. I am not really into that sort of thing. I think I will stick to my video games.
I understand, it can be tough when people move away from you.
I love that idea!
That's great. What did he say?
Oh no, what did you do?
Oh wow, that's so cool! I bet she is so proud.
That's a pretty sweet car. How long have you had her?
Oh wow, where are you going?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
That's great! What are you going to do?
That sounds fun! I bet you will have a great time.
That's great. How long have you been playing?
That is so awful. I would be very upset with them.
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That is sad. I am sorry to hear that. I hope you had a good time.
I am sorry to hear that.
That is awesome, are you going to buy a house?
Oh that is interesting. I hope you enjoy it.
That's awesome!  I bet you were proud of him.  I don't have a husband, but I do love to hear about other people's husbands!
That is a great accomplishment!  Did you win a million dollars?
Oh, what happened?
Oh no, I hope you were able to handle it well.
That's very mature of you.
I would have been so upset!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, do you have any other kids?
That is really scary, I hope you were okay!
That is so bad.  I hate when I get scuffed up like that.
I'm glad to hear that. What kind of savings do you have?
That's great. I'm glad you're working hard.
Oh my gosh, that sounds scary!  I'm so glad you were okay!
What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a close friend or family member that you can talk to about your feelings?
What are you talking about?
I know it's hard, but it's a good thing. They will be happy and healthy.
I understand. I have a similar situation with my sister.
I'm glad you scored well, what subject did you score high in?
Why were you tired?
That's great. How long was it?
I love the Mississippi coast.  Is that your first time there?
I'm sorry to hear that, but sometimes it's necessary to lie to protect yourself.
What did she say?
That's awesome!  What did you do?
I've been to Florida only once. It's a beautiful place, but I know it's always the same for people.
Oh wow, that's awesome!
That's a lot of money.
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you can reconnect with your friend.
It's never too late to start something new, I think.
Wow that's terrible.  I hope you are okay!
That is too bad.  I bet it was a tough situation to get out of.
That's good that you were able to let them watch him.
That's very nice of you. How old is your dog?
I'm glad to hear that! Life is full of ups and downs, but it sounds like you're having a good time.
That is very nice. What is your name?
That's awesome! What kind of gift?
That's great! Who did it?
I am sorry, that is horrible!  I hope you were able to fix it.
I think you mean you scolded her and then told her it was okay.
That is so sad! What happened?
Nice, you must miss him
I have. I love it. It's so entertaining.
That's really interesting! I have never seen anything like it before.
I am so sad to hear that.  Did they really close down?
I know what you mean.  It's funny how things can bring up such good memories.
I am sorry to hear that.  Are you going to make it up to her?
Oh no, that is so stressful!  I have a toddler as well.  I hope you get it all taken care of soon.  It is hard when you have to do everything yourself.
I'm glad you have a healthy relationship.
I don't think anyone should ever hurt another person.
I know, I feel like they are so much more connected to their phones than us.
What do you do for fun?
What is your husband's name?
That's great. What kind of restaurant do you think you will go to?
I know, I love Christmas. It's so magical.
That would be great.  I'm looking forward to hearing more about it.
That's terrible! Is it going to be bad?
That is a bad one. I don't like it when it is raining and it is so heavy.
That sounds exciting! I've been wanting to play that game.
That's so cool. I've never played it. How long have you played?
Oh congratulations! What a wonderful thing to happen!
I bet.  Did you expect it?
Oh wow, I have never done that before, but I love it. Is it for storage?
That is a good point. I feel the same way.
That is awful. I am so sorry. I hope you can get through this.
That's good, you can always go back home.
That is such an accomplishment! I bet you are so proud.
That's good! Diapers can be expensive.
I'm sure she is! I love dogs!
I love a girl that is fun. I'm a bit jealous of you.
I am sure you will get a good job
That is a lot of money.  I hope you do well.  I am jealous.
That is sad, why did you want it?
I know, but I just want to make sure I'm the best person I can be.
I love the movie.  What did you like about it?
That's awesome! What movie?
Oh no! What happened?
That's sad. I hope you will stay in touch with your friend.
That's unfortunate.  Have you talked to her before she leaves?
What is going on?
I hope that does not happen.
That is not good. What is wrong with the country?
I know, it's hard to see people being so mean to each other.
I am sorry. I know you miss them.
I am sorry to hear that. I know how hard it can be.
Did he get a dentist?
Oh wow, that is very nice of you.
That's really sad. I'm sorry.
That's good.  I'm sure it was a good experience.
I hate that too, I live in a storm-prone area and it's always a problem.
I agree, what is it?
I would be super excited! How did you find it?
I know what you mean. I have that feeling sometimes.
I hope it was not too scary to see.
I hope you have a good night.
Oh no! I hope you do well.
I bet.  Are you studying for a test or exam?
That is exciting. I bet you are nervous about it.
i know what you mean. i have to be nervous before giving a speech.
Oh that's nice.  What did you sell?
What happened?
Oh, that's great! Faith is very important in any relationship.
I agree, but it can be hard to say no, especially when you are in love.
Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that. How did that happen?
Oh no, I hate it when that happens.
I don't understand why they can't just tell you the truth.
That's awesome! I bet it will be a great experience for you.
I'm glad you had a good experience!
You must have some great memories of your dad.  Do you still go fishing with him?
I have a 5 month old, but I am expecting a girl!
Oh no! Did you get in trouble?
Oh, that's unfortunate. What happened?
What a great story! I'm glad you learned from it.
I would agree, it's a good thing to know the limits of your car's power.
I love football! What school do you go to?
I'm a big fan of the football team.
Oh no! What did you do?
That was a mess! Did they clean it up?
Oh wow!  I am sure it was a very special day!
Oh yeah, that's great!  What did he do?
That is a great story! It's so nice to see that people still have those kind of qualities.
That is so cool, you must have a very good friend to have.
That's awful! I'm sorry. How did you feel when you got up?
I'm sorry to hear that, are you able to go to work now?
What kind of car do you have?
That's a big step. I hope you find the right home.
Oh no. That is terrible. Did you take a picture?
Oh no, that's terrible. What did they do?
That sounds like a lot of fun!  I love trekking!
That is awesome! I am glad you felt that way.
That's amazing! Did you enjoy the show?
I understand that, but I'm not sure I would want to listen to live music, it's so unpredictable.
That is awesome! What is your name?
I think you may be right.
That is terrible.  What did you do about it?
Oh that's terrible, I'm so sorry to hear that.
That's great! You must be happy to be free from debt!
What do you mean?
Oh good. What did you do?
I can relate. I have a very good attitude towards most things.
That's great! What school are you going to be attending?
That is so right! You are very lucky to have that opportunity!
That is really cool.  I wish I could be that lucky.
That's crazy. I've been in a lot of them.
Oh no. How long did it take you to get it out?
Oh that is crazy! What kind of ball was it?
That's awesome! What kind of car is it?
That's so true, I really hope he understands too.
That's great! You must be happy with your new car.
I am glad you are happy.  I have a car and I don't want it to start.
I love throwback music! What kind of music did you listen to?
What kind of music do you like?
Well, I hope he does well.
I hope they find the answers quickly.
That's great.  I'm sure you will be happy.
That sounds amazing!  I love nature, I would love to have a place like that.  What's the name of the place?
oh no, were you mad?
What was it that you did?
That sounds fun.  Are you going to invite anyone else?
I'm so happy for you. I know it is hard to talk to everyone but it is worth it.
Oh wow! What kind of record?
I'm glad you're consistent!  You're going to do great!
That sounds like a great plan. What's on your agenda?
I hope you keep up with it. It can be hard to do it.
That is awesome. I bet he is proud of himself.
That's really cool.  He's probably getting more experience than you are.
That's not a good idea.
I bet you felt pretty good about yourself
That's a tough situation.  Did you do anything to stop it?
I love classical music, but I am terrible at it.
That sounds scary. What kind of noises?
Oh wow, that's crazy. Did you call the plumber?
That's great! Where are they living?
That's great!  I hope they are excited to meet him.
I'm sure it was fun.
That's sad. How did it happen?
Wow, that's great. What job did you get?
I agree. But it's hard to get over it.
That's spooky. What did you do?
Wow! I didn't expect that.
Oh really? What kind of sweets did you eat?
I am sorry to hear that. You should go to the doctor and tell him that you feel like you are getting obese.
Wow, I bet you're jealous!
That is a good car. Do you have a car like that?
Oh, that's a good point. I have heard that you can be very nervous when selling items online.
That's unfortunate.  I hope you have a great time while you are alone.
That sounds wonderful!  I hope it's quiet and peaceful.
That sounds so annoying! I hate it when my place is quiet, too.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that.
That is so infuriating. I hope you can get it back.
That's great! I'm glad you have those things.
I know what you mean. Sometimes I think people take their friends for granted.
Oh wow! I bet it was fun to do.
I'm sure you will, your kindness is so admirable.
I bet you were! I love Scotland!
That's so nice. It was a long time ago. I remember when my father had to use a phone book to look up someone's number.
That's great!  I love spending time with my family as well.
I know right? Sometimes it's hard to see that when things are bad. But it's true.
Oh my goodness! I'm so happy for you! I have a dog too, but I lost her last year. I know how much you love your dog, so I'm sure you're very happy!
I have a cat. I have a dog too.
That's a great time to be nervous. I'm sure you'll do great.
i love summer too but i hate school
I know that feeling.  I hate it when people judge others.  It makes you feel so bad.
That's a good thing, it's a good feeling.
I bet you will.  You're so organized.  What are you studying?
I hope you do well!
That's really cool!  What kind of car?
That sounds like a nice car!
What kind of car are you looking for?
Oh yeah, they are.
Oh no! Were you okay?
That is the worst!  I am so sorry that happened to you.  What happened?
Oh, I'm so sorry.  I know how that feels.  What did you do to celebrate?
That's true, I've been there too.
I'm glad you feel better.
Oh yeah! That's always a good feeling.
That's really nice.  I love shopping for food.  I enjoy it.
That sounds delicious!  I'm a big fan of Asian food.
What is the name of the plant?
I love when stores do that!  It's such a treat to try new things and be able to see the freshness of the food.
Oh no!  What happened?
Oh no, I hope you are okay!
That's cool. I bet he's a great guy though.
Oh yeah? I bet you are right.
I have never heard of him. What is he?
I agree. It is a shame.
I agree. It is a big problem.
That's sad, but it's good that you have the opportunity to see her now.
That is awesome! I love visiting places that remind me of the past.
That's a good story.  I think it's a pretty good story.  I bet you felt pretty good about yourself for that.
I bet. I bet it was fun
That's a bit of a shock.  I always thought it was the same teacher.
That's a good point. I remember when I was in middle school, and I was still in high school.
I bet you were so relieved to have that done.  I never thought about it but I should have done that.
I am ready to start my new job.
that's awesome! what words did he learn?
That's amazing! I would love to learn one of those.
That's really unfortunate. I can't imagine what it must be like. I hope everything is okay now.
I can only imagine what will happen.
Oh no. Did you find a cat?
I think it's a cat and not a dog.
That's really cool. What did she do to keep herself busy?
That's great.  How old is she?
I am a big fan of TV.  I am glad you enjoy it.
I love HGTV!  They have so many fun shows.  They are always so funny!
That's awful. What happened?
That is so terrible! What was the animal?
I would be devastated.  What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Oh no! Was it a surprise?
Did you get something?
That is exciting. What are they for?
That's a little off from what I understand. What are you referring to?
What kind of animals?
I agree, there are people who are mean and hurt others.
I'm sure those are great memories for you. Do you still enjoy those times?
I agree, I think it's nice to remember the past.
I know, I mean, I'm happy for them, but it seems like they are spending a lot of money.
I can imagine.  That is not a good habit to have.  Is it a habit you are trying to break?
Wow, that's exciting! Where are you moving to?
I love Texas!
Oh no! I hope you were prepared for it. Did you get a safe place?
That's great.  I'm glad to hear that.  How did it go?
That's great! How old are they?
That's great to hear! I am so glad you have such a wonderful family!
That's terrible. Is it going to be okay this time?
Oh no!  I hope she is okay.  Do you have any kids?
I am so sorry to hear that.
That's sad to hear. I hope you found the time to reconnect with her.
That is a good thing to have, in case of emergency.
That is good to hear.  How was your vacation?
Oh, are you going on vacation?
Oh I understand, I hate being rushed too
That's nice, I'm glad you're happy with your relationship.
That is a great feeling.
That's awesome! What kind of music do you usually listen to?
What did you do?
Wow, did you pass?
What are you waiting on?
That is so awesome! I hope you get to attend next year!
i hope he does well
That's great! What country is he from?
That sounds like a lot of fun.  Are you a professional skydiver or are you just a beginner?
I am in the south.  I've never done it.  I am afraid of heights.
I'm sorry that's not something you can control.
I love that. I was a scout too.
Oh no! I hate that when that happens. Are you planning on buying it?
That is a bummer, how long have you been looking for a place like that?
I am sorry to hear that.  Was it a good horse?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have any plans for the future?
I bet you feel like a good host!
That's cool! I am glad you have someone to be with!
how did you feel about it?
That's great, it's always good to have a new home.
That's awesome! I'm sure you're looking forward to it!
That is a good idea.  Are you taking the course yourself?
That is great! I hope she has a good time.
Yeah, I can relate.  I love coming home to a clean house.  It makes me feel better.
I would be too! Do you have to go to the salon?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a stylist?
That sucks.  Was it a bad meal?  I hope you can get back out there soon.
That sounds terrible. Have you given up on eating out?
Oh no! That must have been scary!
Oh no!  Are you okay?  Did you get in trouble?
That is a long time. How long was she away?
Oh no, how long has it been?
Oh no! I bet you felt like you were going to be alone for the rest of your life. I'm sorry to hear that.
That's a great friend. I'm sorry you have to deal with it.
That sucks.  Did you end up finding a place to live?
I am from South Africa, so I went to the south of San Francisco.
Oh, I bet that was a relief! I bet you were happy to be going to the coast.
What kind of trip were you making?
That is so sad. I hope she is feeling better now.
Well I hope it is nothing serious!
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm a high school student too and I have no idea what I want to do in life so I'm also really looking forward to it.
thats nice of them
She's going to be fine.
That sounds scary. I hope she gets the help she needs.
I hate losing too. What's your favorite sport?
I hate when that happens!
Why is it a wonderful day?
That's amazing!  What kind of cruise?  I hope you get to go to the Bahamas!
Oh no.  Did you know who the family was?
I know, I would be upset too.
That's terrible! I am so sorry you have to go through that. How is your dog doing?
Oh really? What happened?
Oh no, did she leave with anyone?
Wow, that's great to hear! What's going on?
Oh that's so nice of them. Did you find a place that was good for you?
That is so good to hear. What have they done for you?
That's nice. Where are they?
That's great!  Are you expecting any special events?
I know what you mean. I hate seeing them in my house
That is true. I'm glad you are safe.
That sounds like a nice surprise!  Did you enjoy it?
That's crazy! What was going on?
I can relate to that.
That's disturbing. What are you doing?
That is so annoying.  Did you get mad at her?
Oh my god! Did you see her vomit?
Oh wow!  Did you get it out?
Did you come back to the place after the refund?
Oh no!  That's a bummer!  Did you get mad at him?
That is horrible. I would be so mad.
I'm glad you're happy for yourself.  What happened?
Wow, that is nice of him.
What a terrible time to lose a pet. I'm sorry.
That is so sweet. Did you have a pet?
I do. She's 3 years old now and is getting older. She's very smart and is always happy to see me.
Oh I agree, I'm so glad I could.
I have had that happen.  Do you have a secret to making things better?
Oh that's a bit scary. Did he get it on himself?
That is so cool, did he finish it?
That's amazing!  That is a very good teacher.  I'm sure he is going to do well!
That's awesome! I love running, how long do you run for?
Oh, that's good! Do you have a specific goal in mind?
That sounds exciting! I'm sure you'll have a blast!
You're welcome! I hope you find what you're looking for.
That sounds so cool. I have never been there. What was it like?
I have had that before. It is terrifying.
I am sorry to hear that, but it is a great place to work out, and you will get better with time.
Oh that's so cool! I love listening to music while I work out.
Yes, I was in one once, but it was a minor one.
Oh wow. I can't imagine how scary that must have been.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that.
I know the feeling. I am so tired of those fees.
That's not good, what happened?
I don't think that's something to be so quick to discuss, if you haven't then I don't think you should.
That is very sad and hard to understand. I am so sorry you are going through this.
Oh yes! I have 2. I love them!
Oh, that is disgusting!  I bet you are so tired!
I love chocolate. Do you have a favorite type?
That's sad. Did you find it?
Oh no! I'm sure they were surprised! Did you get in trouble?
Oh wow, I would have been very embarrassed.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you taking out a second mortgage on your house?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that!
Wow! That's really cool. I love making things with my family and friends!
That sounds really interesting. I love looking at old family photos.
Oh no! What happened?
That's great! I bet it was a lot easier than you expected.
I'm glad we didn't bail.  What happened?
That's sad.  Did you have to cancel?
That is terrible. I am sorry that happened to you.
That's cool, did he have a band?
That sounds like a wild time.
What kind of strange situations?
That's a terrible thing to happen.  What happened to the man?
Wow. That sounds like a really bad habit.
What is he doing?
That's really nice. I've been getting a cut for years too.
That sounds like a really hard cut to get used to, but it sounds like you're making progress now.
Oh no. What happened?
I think you might be referring to the latest iPhone release. I think you might be mistaken.
That is a lot of money.
That's disgusting. Did you find anything else?
That is so exciting! I hope you did well.
That's great! What did you study for?
I am sure you did good!
Oh no, what happened?
That's great! How old is she?
Why?
I'm so jealous. I love Christmas.
That sounds great. What is your favorite time of year?
What did you win?
That's really really bad. Did you try to play again?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you ever get used to it?
I love stairs, I always find myself running up them when I need to get to a place quickly
That is exciting! I hope everything goes well for you.
I think you should be proud of yourself no matter what.
Wow! That sounds like a big deal. Are you nervous?
Oh no, are you worried about the exam?
I hate cats. How do you take care of them?
That is so annoying! What kind of dog is it?
That's great, I'm so happy for you!
What classes do you have left to take?
I think it is fun but also very bad.
Oh wow, I bet it was a shock!
That's understandable. I wish I could travel a bit.
That's so sad.  Did you have a good reason for doing it?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Why did you meet her?
I would be happy to help you with that.
Oh man! I love the ring!
What are you doing?
Oh no! That's scary. What did you do next?
What happened?
That is nice of her.
What happened?
Oh no! Was he a friend or a stranger?
Oh that is awful. Did you find out who he is?
I'm not sure I agree with that.  I've always been the one to try to change everything at once.
That's a good way to stay awake.
I bet you feel great. How long has it been since you stopped?
I don't know what you are talking about.
That sounds like a nice time.
I bet it was, I love fireworks.
That's no fun. Do you think you should talk to your neighbors about it?
That's okay. You're not alone.
That's horrible!  You should have told them!
Yeah, I heard that before.  I think it's a good idea to check your bank's website to see if they have a cardholder service.  It's usually free and will allow you to get a new card in a few days.
That's pretty awesome, I've always wanted to build an arcade.
I'm sure it does. I had a great time making that machine with my friend.
I hope that wasnt too painful. I have a toothache.
That's not good. Hopefully it's not something worse.
That's awesome. I've always wanted to do that.
Oh man!  I would be so mad!  That's so unfair!
That's terrible. I hope you guys can get her back to the car without any problems.
That's a good way to spend time together.
Oh that's awful. Did you have to clean it up?
I'm not sure I understand what you are saying. Do you mean you were scared of the furry animals?
That sounds like a lot of fun. I bet you felt pretty good after working out.
What are you doing?
I can relate. How many things are there?
I'm sorry, I didn't understand what you said.
That's awesome! I've been trying to win that for years!
Oh wow! That's great! Are you going anywhere specific?
What kind of play was it?
Oh wow, that sounds interesting!
How old is she?
That's a beautiful name. I bet she's a lovely girl.
That sounds like fun! I am a huge fan of their music.
What kind of trouble did you get in trouble for?
Oh boy, that sounds exciting! How old is he?
I think my dog is a German Shepherd! My dog is a Shih Tzu. I don't know what kind of work it takes to care for it.
That's quite an embarrassing story. Did Christy find it?
I can understand that.  You seem like a very angry person.
That's pretty gross. I would have been so grossed out!
Oh no! I'm sorry! I bet you were mad!
That sounds creepy. Did you see anything?
I can imagine! It sounds like you're in a scary place. I hope you find something to scare you!
That's a bummer. Did you still go through with it?
What did you get?
I bet it was a stinky smell, did you investigate further?
Oh my goodness! I hate seeing those things. I'm glad you didn't have to deal with it.
oh no!  that is bad.  you are going to be okay?
That is terrible. I am so sorry.
I love a good speech.  What is it about?
I agree, it was a pretty intense battle.
That is pretty rude.  Did you tell them that you would have to wait?
Wow, I'm sorry. Was the bank very busy?
What grade are you in?
I am sure you did fine!
Wow! I bet you were really happy to see it!
What did you guys do in your childhood?
Oh that's great! I love baseball!
Oh that is so cool! I love baseball, especially the Rockies. What was your favorite part of the game?
Oh no, I hope it wasn't something gross.
Oh my goodness, that sounds like a nightmare. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Oh no, did he get in trouble for it?
I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do to your car?
Oh wow!  That is amazing.  I bought a new car and it was a little rough at first but now it is smooth sailing!
what kind of car?
I am sure you did great! Did you get a good score?
That is awesome!  What program is it?
That is awesome! I am sure you did great!
Oh really?  What did you do?
I would be so upset! What did you do?
That's good to hear.  What was it?
Yes, I've met some people who are just so kind.
That is pretty cool. I bet you all had a great time.
What happened?
Thats awesome! What kind of dance is it?
I can relate, it's hard to get time off sometimes
That sounds exhausting! I'm glad you get to take a break!
What clubs are you participating in?
That's awesome! What kind of internship are you thinking of?
That's so boring, I bet it's not fun.
I hate the dump. I hate the company.
What did you guys order?
That's disgusting!  I don't eat bread.  I don't even eat it at all.
that's nice of her
That is amazing. What type of cancer?
I am sure he will be okay
Well that is good that she is sober.
That's too bad. Are you the only one in the household?
That sucks. Are you working on a new project?
I love playing old school video games too. The music is always so good.
I am happy for you.
That is awesome! I love craft beer! What town do you live in?
That's awesome!  I love trying new beers and breweries.  What kind of beers do you like?
I'm sorry, is she married?
What a nice guy you are.  I love your attitude.
I am so sorry to hear that.  He was an amazing chef and an even better person.
I love that story. What is the story about?
Did you know they had planned it?
That's awesome. What was the surprise?
oh that's so sweet! how many fawns did you give them?
I love helping the wildlife too, especially the animals that are injured.
Oh wow! How are you feeling about that?
That's cool. Did you ever go there?
That's a good thing! I bet you'll have a great time in your new place!
That's cool.  I'm glad you were able to find someone that you really like.  Are you going to see him again?
Yeah that's a bummer. You should tell them it's not fair.
I can understand that. I'm lucky to be a freelancer.
Oh, that is so frustrating.  I would have been so mad.
Oh that's not good.  I would have been so upset.  You're right, though.  It's weird.
That's great! What kind of jobs did he get?
Why do you think he is wanting to go into logistics?
That is awesome! What are you doing today?
Oh I can relate, I've been feeling a bit down lately.
Oh that is a bummer. Did you get the job?
That is a lot of work! I'm glad it all worked out in the end.
That is very exciting! Where are you both going?
Well that is quite a trip, you must be very jealous!
That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can get better.
That's great. What are you guys doing?
What happened?
That's annoying. Did you call them to ask about the answer?
Oh wow!  What were you trying to get them to do?
Oh no! I hope everything went well.
That's a tough situation. I'm glad she's getting back soon.
I am sure you did fine!
What did he/she do?
Oh wow, that's a little disappointing.  I'm sure he'll appreciate it.
That is terrible, what is he going to do?
That is really hard to hear.  I hope she is having a good time.  I know it is tough for you, but I am sure she will be back soon.
That's great.  How long have you been together?
Oh no! I hate bugs too! I would have screamed!
That's crazy! What did he do?
I do too. They are disgusting.
That's true, but you know what they say... "you are never too old for a rainy day"
I can understand that, I hate spiders too.
Yeah, I think so.
Oh wow that sounds like so much fun!  I have never done that before.  Are you scared?
Oh yeah? What do you mean by "extreme stuff"?
What did you do?
Oh no! What was it?
What happened to your hip?
I know how you feel! I've been to the hospital a few times and had some scary moments too. I hope you get through it!
That's great. I love when friends can help you out like that.
What is she doing for you?
I agree, especially when you are in a situation where you need to be able to be discreet.
Oh no! Did you yell at them?
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how hard it is to lose a pet.
That is so sad.  What kind of cancer?
Oh no! That is so sad. Are you going on vacation?
That is a great way to spend time. Did you go with them?
Well, I can imagine that would be a good change. Are you excited about the move?
Yeah, but I like to do that sometimes when I'm home.
That's great!  You must be excited!
You need to get a new job
I totally agree.
I hate bugs!
That's awesome! I bet you're feeling pretty confident about it.
Oh wow, I'm sure it was a lot of fun.
I am sorry to hear that. You must have felt very down.
I'm sure it will get better! I'm sure you're doing just fine!
That sounds amazing! Where are you going?
What kind of trip?
Oh wow! That sounds so nice. What did you do?
Oh no! I am so sorry.  Are you alone?
That is so disappointing. I hate when that happens.
I hope so!  What are you going to be called?
Oh my!  Did it embarrass you?
What happened?
Oh, that is so annoying.
That's a little scary. I don't like crowded places either.
Oh no! How long was it since you saw him?
What happened?
I know. I had to get him dressed in his new school clothes.
That's great.  I love to hear about new places!
What happened?
How did it turn out?
That is so annoying.
That's interesting. What do you mean?
Oh wow, that's great! Did you have a big celebration?
That's amazing, I love how people can put their faith into practice in such a positive way.
oh no, is she okay?
Oh my goodness, that's awful! How old is she?
I love trying new foods. Where did you go?
That's terrible. Did you get the food from a restaurant?
That can be awkward, but it's also a great chance to learn about people's beliefs.
I feel you.  I would never lie to someone I trust.
That is so awesome.  I bet he felt good about himself.
Why did you feel that way?
I'm sorry to hear that, what happened to him?
I'm sorry.  Are you going through a tough time?
That's a bummer. Hopefully, he'll be able to come visit you soon.
I'm sure he's happy for you.
Oh my god. I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you are okay.
That must have been very hard. I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
That's great! What happened to her?
i would be too, it is so sad
I am sorry to hear that, but I am sure that you will be able to do it again, you are a very determined person.
Yes, it's all too easy, but I'm glad you're taking steps to help yourself.
I have never done it. What is it like?
That sounds like a great experience. What did you do?
I bet that is amazing! I have a TV in my room that is quite old.
Why?
That sounds like a horror show!
That's so scary.  I bet you were so relieved when he came into the room and saw you.
Well, you can't let that stop you. Just go in there and do your best.
I bet you do. What position?
I'm sure it was nice to think about. What were they like?
That's great that you told him.  How did he react?
That is a good idea! I've never heard of anyone sending a message through facebook.
Oh wow! That must have been a fun surprise!
Oh, I bet he is adorable! I love animals.
Oh no, that's terrible. I'm sure you were disappointed.
That's good.  You will get a great deal on it.
Did you feel guilty about eating them?
What did you do?
That's terrible, I hope he feels better soon.
Oh that is nice.  I hope he feels better.
That is cool. I've never been into dancing.
I know, I feel the same.
That's awesome! I love watching sports, especially golf!
I'm a huge fan of football, I love watching it!
Oh no.  I am so sorry to hear that.  How did she react?
That is a great attitude to have.
Oh wow, that's gross! What was it?
Oh my goodness! I would have been so mad! Did you get any punishment?
I agree!  I hate animal abuse.  I always want to help animals when I can.
I agree. They are so ignorant and stupid.
Oh no. What did it sound like?
That's a pretty good thing to have to deal with. I'm sure it was just a raccoon!
That's good to hear. I hope so too.
That's nice of you.  Did you tell him how much you were able to help him?
That is so exciting! What did you do?
That's amazing!  What kind of food?
I have seen a drone flying over me. I was scared.
I can only imagine what it must be like!
yeah i know what you mean, sometimes you just want to be able to keep your secrets to yourself
Oh no, that's sad. Did you tell her that you didn't hear anything?
I'm sorry to hear that. I've lost a few pets over the years.
That's weird. Did they find anything?
Did the doctor say what it was?
That is so hard for them. I bet you are worried!
Oh wow, that's disgusting. Did you call the police?
Oh wow! I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh yeah, I have never heard of that before.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that!
That's great! I hope you do well on it!
I bet that's a lot of work. I'm glad you are doing well.
Did you get on it?
I can imagine, I've never been to a high place like that.
That must have been a bummer!
I know what you mean. I had the same problem last weekend.
I've lost a few pets and I can relate. Losing a pet is always hard.
That's terrible.  What happened to Louie?
Oh no! What was the trip like?
What happened?
That's terrible!  I hope you have a wonderful time with her!
That's awesome.  What school is she in?
That's a bummer. You could have still done things you wanted to do.
Oh yeah, what time was that?
That sounds scary. Did you have a good time?
I hate accidents, they are so stressful.
Wow, how expensive is it?
I don't know how much it costs, but I know it's expensive.
Oh, well, at least you're not ashamed to admit it!
That is true, I am on a diet too.
What happened?
Oh no, that's terrible! Have you got a good insurance plan?
That's a bummer. How did it end up?
Oh no! I'm so sorry. I hope he is okay.
That's terrible. I hope you're okay.
That's a bit rough. I understand. It's tough to break up with someone, especially if you have a lot of memories together.
I agree, people are so nice these days.
I agree.  I always try to be kind to those who are struggling.
Wow, that's great. How did he do?
What branch is he in?
That is so sad. I would be so mad if I had to go to a restaurant and hate it.
That is a bummer.  What did you do?
What happened?
That sounds like a very embarrassing moment. Did you wash your hands?
I love scary movies! I get that way sometimes too.
Oh wow, did you get in trouble?
That's annoying. How long have you had the dog?
It does get annoying! I am jealous of your house. Is it expensive to live there?
That sounds good. Did you feel guilty?
That is wonderful. You look like a happy person.
That sounds like a great feeling!
That's great. It is always good to save money.
I hope it does too! I love teaching kids!
That's awesome. I'm sure you'll do great.
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
That's really sad, are you still friends?
I'm sorry. How did you get a new one?
Why are they not happy?
Oh that's great! What is she doing?
That is amazing! She must be really good at her job.
I bet you were so happy for her.
I bet you are proud of yourself!
I can imagine. I am sure he will do great.
That's really tough. I'm sorry. I think he feels the same way about you.
I know, it's hard when you are the one who has to deal with it.  I think it will take a while to get used to it, but I know you will.
That is great! What is he going to do?
I can relate, I remember it like it was yesterday!
That's so cool. I love playing games too!
Wow, that's tough! What are you doing to stay on top of it?
That's awesome! You must be so proud of yourself!
That is so nice of him.
That is nice, I am a gamer myself, but I only play after my kids are asleep.
I love coffee. I always buy the filters. I don't like to be lazy.
I know what you mean.  I had a rough morning too.  I don't know how people do it.  I have a hard time waking up in the morning.
Oh, what happened?
I love bearded dragons! I have a 3 year old one named Lola
That's good to hear. It's always a good thing when you have a job that you can handle.
That's good to hear! You're lucky to have a job and a home!
That's great to hear.  I hate being lonely.
Did you have to do anything to get there?
That is so gross.  I have had a cold before and I know how it feels.  I would have been so annoyed that I would have wanted to get a cup of water and drink it right away.
I'm sorry you had to deal with that.  Is it going to happen again?
That is terrible! I would have been so upset.
That's the worst, I'm lactose intolerant too.
Well, that is quite an interesting story.  How did it end up?
That's really scary. I'm sure you'll do great. I'm sure you will be a great dad.
I'm sure you'll be fine. It's not easy being a parent.
Oh wow! That sounds like a fun time! Did you see a cat that was old?
That's good! I would be worried about having pets that don't get angry.
That's good. What do you plan to do?
I am sure you will do great!
It is hard to let go of people.
I understand that. I really hope you guys are doing well.
I agree.  They should always be safe.
Oh my goodness, I would have been so scared!
That is quite scary.  How did you get there?
I am not sure if he did or not. I don't have the ability to see inside his house.
That is scary! Are you looking for a new home?
Oh no, I would be too. I hope you don't see it again!
That's pretty amazing, I can't draw to save my life either, but I'm sure she's talented!
That sounds like a lot of fun. What is your favorite character?
That is nice to have a true friend like that.
Yeah, it's nice to have someone who believes in you, you know?
Oh no, that's terrible. I hope you get it treated well!
I am so sorry.  I can't imagine.
Oh no! I hope there was no one hurt.
I would have been as scared as you.
How did it turn out?
Oh I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have any surgeries planned?
I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope you are okay
I am sure you will be fine.
I loved playing old video games too. What was your favorite game to play?
I'm a big fan of it. I played it on my old N64.
Oh really? What was the job?
That sucks. What happened?
What is it?
I am sorry, but, it is good that you got to be the one to discover it.
I love going to the movies.  Do you enjoy the movies?
Oh, what happened?
Oh my.  That's not very nice of him.  What are you going to do?
I know, that is crazy!
Did you watch his show?
That's probably true. I hope they don't get too worked up.
Oh wow, I bet it was a surprise!
I'm glad you're not too embarrassed about it.
Oh no, why is she doing that?
I know how you feel.  It is very hard to deal with a betrayal like that.
That is so wonderful of you.  I can only imagine how difficult it must be to be in that situation.
What kind of station wagon is it?
That's awesome! I hope he continues to do well.
That's good. You can't beat a 90.
Oh my goodness!  That is so amazing!  How does he do it?
What is philosophy?
Oh wow, that's amazing! What kind of hot dogs do you eat?
I am a man of the people. I will be there for you.
That's nice of him. I bet you appreciated that a lot.
I'm glad to hear that. What happened?
That is nice, did you get to see the old pictures?
That's sad. I'm sorry. What happened to her?
Oh no. Did you catch her?
Oh no! I bet she was very upset about that.
Well that's awesome! I think you should give him a nice gift!
I am shocked that the Clay Institute hasn't found the million dollar prize yet, I would be shocked too.
Oh, that's terrible.  I hope they don't make you feel bad about it.
I am sure he has his reasons.  I have been there before.
I'm so sorry to hear that.  Is there anything you can do to help?
That's sad, how long have you been together?
Oh no! I am so sorry! I know how that feels.
That is very sad.  What happened?
That sounds so good! I love pie!
That sounds delicious!  What was the apple type?
That's awesome! You look great!
That is a great pair of shoes.  What made you feel on top of the world?
That sounds like a lot of fun!  Did you have a good time?
That's so nice. What were you doing?
That's crazy! I bet you were a little scared.
I would be terrified!  I don't like being near fire.
That's cool. What makes you worried?
I agree. I have met some very strict people in those countries.
That's terrible! Did they even notice?
I feel the same way, I just don't like to be paranoid.
I do too.  Do you have a job?
Oh no!  That's awful!  I hope you can get it fixed and get back on track!
Well, that's a tough thing to do. What did you do to take your mind off of it?
Nice! Do you play games with friends?
That sucks.  Have you tried to get in to therapy or something?
Wow, that's great to hear! It's good to feel good, even if it's just for a little while.
I don't know what to say, that's a pretty funny thing to be worried about. I'm glad you have a plan in place.
That's a good point. I have a few friends that think they are so smart because they are a little bit older than us.
I bet you are. It's not every day that someone gets to interview for a job.
I understand.  It's tough.  What are you looking for in a job?
Oh no, that is a terrible thing to do.
I'm not sure I agree.  But I do agree that dust is bad for you.
I bet she is doing well.
I bet you did.  You must be very proud of yourself.
I hope so as well!  I'm a little nervous about it too.  I haven't lived in an apartment in a long time.
Oh wow, I would have to do the same thing. I would be so tired of them!
That is quite a scary thought.  I would be terrified.  How did it all work out?
Wow, that's amazing! I wish I had kids.
I do sometimes. I just feel like it's too hard to let go of the past.
That's the point of life, right? To keep things simple.
That's the only thing that I wish I could do. I wish I could relive my childhood.
I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's nice! I'm sure he was happy to do it.
That is very kind of them.
I remember when I was a kid playing with my brother
That is so sad.
I love that. Is it a favorite book?
I love historical novels. I like reading a lot. I have a lot of books.
Oh no!  That's terrible.  What happened?
Wow.  I've heard that area is very pretty, but I'm sure the new developments are a bit of a eyesore.  I'm sure the people who live there are happy about it though.
Why are you moving back there?
That's interesting, where did you grow up?
I love animals, I have a cat at home.
Oh wow, that sounds nice. I hope you two have a great time together!
Wow, that is so cool! Did you have fun?
That's hilarious!  I am sure that was a fun experience.  Did you get a good laugh out of it?
i understand that, i hate seeing people in need, it makes me want to help
That's great! How many charities do you visit?
Wow! What did you do with it?
I'm sure you were! How much did you win?
I bet you will. What's going on?
Oh wow!  That sounds like a lot of fun.  Did you have a great time?
Wow, that's a great attitude to have!  I know you'll find someone soon!  You're one of the most caring people I've met.
Oh no!  Are you going to get them cleaned?
That's great that you felt bad. What happened?
That's great. What prize?
That is the right thing to do.  I would have felt bad if I had won the competition.
Oh wow, that sounds good. I am not a big sausage eater, but I do love sausage.
That's good, did you get a good deal?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay.
That's awful.  I hope they are okay.
That's really cool. Are you going back to school?
Oh that's really sad. I've never been there, but I've heard it's beautiful.
That's awesome! What college did they attend?
I'm so glad that you have a good attitude towards college.
oh really? are you ready?
That is not a good dog.
Oh wow, that sounds so scary!  Did you catch him?
That is awesome.  What type of camping does she do?
oh yeah, that is great.  She must be pretty organized.
I hope you do!
Oh yeah?
Did they do well?
That is so amazing. I am not very good at skydiving, but I would love to.
That's great. What kind of treatment were you getting?
What's the purpose of the walker?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! That must be frustrating.
I know what you mean. I am always looking over my shoulder!
That is exciting! What is the item?
Are you a comic book collector?
Wow, how did you react?
Oh, I bet. Did you get it?
I know right? I am so amazed by it all
Oh yeah, I know what you mean. I feel like my phone is a super outdated computer.
Oh wow! Did you feel guilty?
Oh wow, that sounds like a very delicious meal! What did you eat?
I hope you do!
That is okay. What is going on?
That is a good horror movie.
Oh yeah? What happened?
Oh wow! I've never been to a place like that. Where are you?
I would love to have that. I think I would be really confused as to what to do.
It's like my grandma used to say "Clean your hands and clean your food".  You can't let your hands touch food and then eat it.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What are you eating?
That is the worst. I can't stand it when I see it.
What kind of bin?
I agree.  That is so rude.  I have a habit of cutting in traffic without signaling it.
I don't either. I hate when people are rude to each other.
That is so sad, how did you feel?
I agree. People are so mean.
Oh, that's not a good idea.
You are right. It has good reviews but I would be worried about the food.
That sounds amazing.  I'm not really into Indian food, but I do like Indian restaurants.
That is great!  It is always nice to find food that you enjoy!
That's awesome. Have you been practicing for a long time?
I love horses, I bet you have one?
I can see why you would be annoyed. Is it that loud or is it just that he is talking?
That's so annoying. Are you going to call the police?
I agree! What are they doing?
Oh wow. I would be so frustrated!
Oh I know what you mean.  I was in a similar place recently.
Are you going to see her?
What show?
What an amazing coincidence! What apartment?
That is so exciting!  What are you moving into?
I do.  It is nice but I am a student.  I have to live in my parents home.  I am so frustrated.
Oh my god! How long did you have to wait for it to die?
What happened?
That's great! You should be fine.
I feel you, I get the same feeling when I'm driving and I put music on.
Wow! That's great! Did you buy anything?
That's awesome, I love getting new things!
I love getting my groceries delivered. It's so convenient!
I totally understand.  I hate grocery shopping too!
I have seen that movie, it is very depressing.
Oh, really? What happened?
Wow!  He is so cute!  I love my little boy too.  He is 3.  He can count to ten now.  It is so cute.
That's good.  I'm glad you were there to see him achieve his goal.
Oh that sounds nice. Did you do anything fun?
Oh no, I'm so sorry! That sounds like a painful experience.
Why did he do that?
That's no good. Do you know what's going on?
That's weird. What kind of animal?
Oh no! That must have been very scary!
I have never traveled outside of the country, but I wish I had.
Did you travel to all of these places?
Oh wow, did you hire someone to clean?
I agree. It's always a new experience.
I always feel like that with a certain joke or meme.
Why did you do that?
Oh wow. I'm sure that was very frustrating.
Oh no! I hope it's not too bad.
oh no!  how bad was the damage?
That is so sad.
That's sad. Do you have a family?
That is good to hear! How is your health now?
That's really tough. I hope it was worth it.
That's awesome! Where are you moving to?
Oh that's so exciting. I hope they have fun.
I agree, I don't like it either.
That is so funny!  I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that.  It's such a bad idea.
That is a very good thing to have.
Why do you think that?
That sucks! What kind of cards did you get?
That's awesome!  Did you get any cards?
I'm sure he'll be fine, he's not too far away.
That's terrible! I hate to see animals get hurt.
That's a good attitude to have. I like to be prepared for the worst and have a backup plan.
I've been there. I would say go for it.
Wow!  That is exciting!  Are you a big fan of the fair?
Oh man, I would love to win one.  You must be really excited about it.
That is awful.  I hope you can stay safe.
What's changed?
Oh wow! I love stargazing! What did you see?
I know how you feel, I think that's what makes it so great.
What did you do for the birthday?
Oh wow. I didn't know you guys are divorced. I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that go?
That's a bummer.  I bet you felt like you were going to be the only left footed person in the room.
Why would you do that?
That is a tough job. I am sure you will do great.
Why is that?
Oh no, I'm sure you will be fine. You will do great.
That is so frustrating. Did you call Starbucks?
That is good. What did you do?
I'm sure that was very satisfying.
I bet you did! What did you do?
That's not good. Were you scared?
That's terrible. I hope you get some help soon.
I'm sorry to hear that, what did you do?
I know right?  What did they do?
That's a little scary. Did you help him?
I am sorry to hear that.  Is it a injury or some kind of sickness?
I can only imagine. What kind of gym is that?
That's amazing, I love to see people lift heavy.
Why did you go?
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a lot of cats?
I'm sorry to hear that!  What happened?
I was so scared when I saw a spider in my house.
That's so gross! I would have been grossed out too!
I'm sorry to hear that. It's pretty frustrating when things go wrong.
Oh my goodness! Did you have a cat?
How did you lose her?
I understand what you mean, it's like when we watch old movies and we can still remember the lines of the characters and the scenes.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch the reference.
Did you see anything?
I don't think that's a good thing. I'm a little worried about you
That's so cool!  I hope it recovers.  I always feel bad when I see something like that.
That's a good thing, they are able to help it
I have a friend coming over soon and I keep checking out the window to see if theyre here yet.
That sounds delicious! I love roasts.
That's awesome! Congratulations!
That is great! I hope you have a great time!
What kind of deadline?
I'm sorry to hear that. I can't imagine working in an environment where you're always being interrupted.
That's a bummer. Are you going to try to get a new roommate?
I understand that. Have you thought about joining a gym?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do to try and cure it?
That is so sad. Is she okay now?
That is a very serious thing.  What kind of animal is it?
Wow that sounds like a great time! Have you ever been on a cruise?
That's so sweet! I bet it was a lot of fun!
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with your roommate.  What was the name?
That's great. What did you cook?
Are you worried about it?
I have been stocking up on food and supplies as well.
That's great, I hope he is happy to be back to work.
That's terrible. Did you find out who it was?
I love mac and cheese! Did you make it yourself?
Oh wow, you are a foodie?
That's great! What brand are you wearing it from?
It could be a great chance, try to make a good impression
Oh no! How long has he been having accidents?
That's funny. I bet the dog is scared of her.
That's great.  You deserve it.  I'm sure you're very proud of yourself.
Well I am sure you will do great!
That sounds like a lot of fun.  Are you going with anyone?
That's great!  I hope you're going to a good destination!
Oh that sounds really nice.
I love YouTube! How old is your kitty?
Oh that is so sweet!  I love toys from my childhood.  Did she get it at a garage sale?
Wow, that's cool! Is she a singer?
I am so happy for you! Congratulations!
You are lucky.
What will you do if he loses his job?
I hope he doesn't get cut!
Oh no.  I'm so sorry.  How did that happen?
I am sorry. What happened?
I bet she was thrilled when she won.
How old is she?
Oh wow, did you get hurt?
I bet you were excited.  It's always a good feeling to have all your papers in order.
I would be so annoyed. Did you try to catch it?
That must have been so annoying!
Oh no! I can't imagine being in that situation!
I would be very annoyed.
oh thats good, did you practice for a long time?
That sounds like a great plan.  Are you looking forward to it?
That is awful! How did you clean it up?
That sounds like a terrible thing to have to deal with.
Oh no!  That's gross!  What did you do?
I've been there.
That's awesome, what kind was it?
Why was it terrible?
That is awful. I've had that happen before too.
Wow, that is a long way to go, and it is difficult to travel that far. I hope you did not get lost.
Why did it happen?
That's a bummer, but I'm sure you'll find something else you enjoy!
Did you have any good dreams?
What's wrong?
Oh that's great. Did you guys have a good time?
What do you mean?
oh no, i hope you were safe
That's a bad thing to do. Did you get your money back?
That's terrible. Did he get in trouble?
That's good! What happened?
Oh no! Did you have to take a break?
Oh yeah, I was in a class recently and a teacher had a huge explosion in his classroom.
That is disgusting.  Is it safe to have her around again?
I hope so, what happened?
Oh no!  Did you find it?
Did you do something bad?
That's nice, do you like chocolates?
I'm sorry. That's a sad situation.
That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh yeah. I've been thinking about that.
What do you mean by that?
Well, I do, but she's not very good at making me feel special.  I've been thinking of leaving her for a new one.
That is awesome. I have been trying to buy a house for years. What kind of house is it?
I'm so glad you have a peaceful life. I'm so happy for you.
That is not good. It seems like she has been taking it for a while now.
That's really sad.  What happened?
That's okay. I've done things like that.
I'm sorry to hear that, are you going to get in trouble?
That sounds like fun. I wish I could ride the roller coaster with my kids.
Well, I've always been a bit hesitant too.  I just know I'll like it once I get on.
What happened to him?
I did not die, but I had a heart attack and almost died. I am still recovering.
That's a good point. We all have those times where we want to focus on things that matter.
I understand. It is a lot to have to worry about.
That's so sweet. I'm glad you have such great memories.
Oh that is so sweet. I bet it was fun.
I do not, but I like to watch some videos on there sometimes.
I like watching action movies.
Oh no!  That sounds terrible.  Did you go to the store?
Oh man! I love cake! Did you have a good time?
That sounds like fun.  What type of steak was it?
That is terrible! What happened?
That is cool. What was your favorite thing to do?
Why is that?
I bet that's a tough spot. I hope you are doing okay.
I'm sure it will be good again.
That's terrible. Did you have to move out of your house?
That's horrible.  What's going on in your city?
Oh no! I'm so sorry! What happened?
Oh, that sounds pretty bad.  Did you get them on purpose?
That's my favorite thing to do in my free time!  What kind of games are you into?
Oh, yeah, I've heard about that.  Are you planning on playing it?
I know, I'm not one of those friends.  I don't have the time or energy to do it either.  I just work hard and take care of myself.
I get that a lot. I think I'm just jealous of the fact that my brother is older.
I've been good. What subjects did you take?
Oh, you're right, it's always a good time to start new projects.
I hope your day was as good as you think it was!
Oh wow, that's great news! Congratulations!
Oh no, that's terrible. I hate bees.
I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
I do! I played a lot of those on my old Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo.
I have, and it's so good. I love it.
I'm doing okay, but I think life is always good.
That's great!  I hope you both have a great day.
That was nasty. Did you give it to her?
That is so rude. Why did you do that?
That's terrible. Did you go anyway?
Oh no! Did you have a reason for that?
Oh no, that's not good. What did you do?
I love when that happens.
Oh no. Did you find out what happened?
I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
That sounds creepy! I would have been terrified!
Oh wow! That's a scary situation!
What was the job?
That's good to hear. What happened?
That's a bummer. I bet they are going to be mad.
Why did they hide it?
I love bungie jumping.  Was it scary?
I think I would too.  It is a very scary thing to do.
I agree, that is the most important lesson they will learn.
I understand, it's hard to go through that
I do. I've played a lot of games that take hours to complete.
What games?
I am sorry to hear that.  How do you feel about it?
That's a funny thing.  I'm glad you are happy.  How long have you been together?
Oh that sounds like a lot of fun!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you have any close friends during that time?
What is ice juice?
I understand, but what company?
That's so exciting! What did you think of her?
What's her name?
I am sure he will return it.
That is good to hear. I hope you will get your cat back.
How did that go?
I can see that.  It is a pretty scary thing.
Oh no, what happened?
Why did you go to work like that?
Oh my gosh, that is so awful! What did you do?
That's good! I'm glad you did
Oh no!  I'm sure you will do fine.  I know how that is.
That is very nice of you.
That is a long time.  Are you happy?
That's great. What kind of job is it?
I'm glad to hear that. I've never done it, but I have heard it is a lot of fun.
That's unfortunate. Did they cancel the flight?
That's good! I hope you were able to get home okay.
Oh man, I bet you felt bad afterwards!
That sounds really relaxing. What time was it?
I love going on vacation with my family.
I love nostalgia. What did you do?
That's really sad. Was it a car accident?
That must have been really tough. I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh wow!  That sounds like a pretty special day.  I bet it was a lot of fun!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm a bit of a shy person myself.
That is wonderful.  What are you both doing together?
I am happy for you both.  It is a great feeling when you are happy.
Oh no! Did you lose it at a store?
That's pretty cool, how did it turn out?
That's great. It's so nice to be able to help out those in need.
What was the fun?
I am so happy for you!  I think it is always nice to have a stable life.
I hope you're happy
I love that!
That's so bad.  Did you have to replace it?
That sucks, I hope you find something that works well for you.
That is so sad. I really hope you can afford it.
Oh no! I am so sorry! I hope you are okay.
Why did it hurt you?
That is true. I can imagine that.
I can relate. I've been on a few times too.
That is really hard to do, I know.
I am sorry to hear that, I know how that feels.
I love dogs!  What kind of dog was she?
That sounds like fun! What do you like to do on the lake?
I would love to have a pontoon boat, but I don't think I can afford one.
Oh, that's so unfair. I bet she feels bad about it.
That is very admirable.  I am sure it is not easy.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find ways to make more money.
That's great! What kind of project was it?
I can imagine. Did you end up learning it?
what is next?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been to the hospital recently?
That is a good feeling to have.  Are you in a good state of health?
Oh no, I hope you didn't feel guilty about it.
That's terrible! I hope you're able to get back on track.
I hope you do well!
What are you studying?
I am sorry to hear that. You should have called or texted to tell them about it.
I'm glad you learned from it!
I'm glad you have a great support system. What are your health problems?
I am sure they do! You must feel very proud!
Oh my goodness, that's so sad. I'm sorry. Did you find a good replacement?
What happened to her?
I would have been the same way.  I would have wanted to know more about the car first.
That's true, I'm always looking for a car that will last.
That is very nice of him. How long have you been married?
That is a nice story.  I have met a few roomates in college that I am close with.
That's hilarious.  Did you get in trouble?
That is great!  I bet that was a fun experience!
Wow, that sounds exciting.  What are you going to do there?
I've never been to one.  I'm interested in it, but I don't think I could go.  I don't have a lot of time.  What kind of things do they have there?
That's really cool. I bet you feel safe with it.
Did you find out who he was?
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  Are you looking for a replacement?
I totally get it, being a single parent is hard and it's amazing you've learned to be content!
What did you do to get ready for it?
Oh wow, congratulations on acing the job interview!  What job did you get?
That's really sad to hear.
I'm glad you are out of it too. I'm sure you are doing well.
I've never been skydiving. I bet it's a really scary experience!
I'm glad you made it through!  You must have been very strong.
Oh, that's cool!  I love Robin Williams.
I have been there. It is nice to have those memories.
What color sox were you wearing?
How did you feel about it?
That's great, I've been doing that for years.
That sounds like a lot of fun, are you nervous?
That is pretty funny. I bet you felt so embarrassed.
I don't know what you mean.
I hope you do well!
That is a good thing. You should be happy.
That's great! I'm glad you have a good place to start.
I agree.  It's always good to look back on good times.
That's awesome. What kind of track is it?
Oh man, you must be a pretty speedy guy.
Oh I don't blame you!
Oh that sounds like a lot of milk!
I understand. I would do the same thing.
I have never done any weightlifting.
I am sure you were.
oh no! that sounds terrible!
I am sorry to hear that, I hope you can get it together.
That must have been creepy.
That sounds like a rough situation.
That's bad, you should have stopped when you were hungry.
Why not?
oh wow, that's a lot of money for a piece of cake.
That's terrible. What did you think it was supposed to be?
I'm sure you will, you must be very dedicated to your training!
That sounds like a great workout routine!
I have seen the movie. It is a horror movie.
I think I'm not ready for that yet
I can understand that. Do you have any fun plans?
Sounds like a fun place to visit!
Oh wow! What was the dare?
I would be terrified. What was it like?
I do too, what kind of things do you like to do?
That is really nice.
Did you do a lot of exercise?
What kind of chest workout?
That's awful. I would be so mad at them.
Oh wow.  I'm not sure how to react.  Was he angry?
Oh no! I hope you're feeling better now.
Oh no.  Are you okay now?
Oh that is too bad. I hope things worked out for you.
I am sorry to hear that.  Have you started dating again?
That's okay. I'm here to listen.
What happened?
Oh no! Was it a human?
Did she pass away recently?
I know the feeling. I can't eat anything.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I know it's not easy.  But I'm sure you'll get there eventually.
I love watching those documentaries about the history of the US, it's so fascinating!
I'm sure it is. It's always exciting to think about the possibilities.
Wow, that's a lot of puppies!
What kind of dogs?
That is funny. I have never done that.
What did you do?
I used to do that all the time.  It is not that bad.  It is good for you.
What did you eat?
Oh no!  Are you sure they didn't come back and say you left it?
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that.
That is no good.  I would be mad if I forgot to pay for something.  I hope you can make it up to them.
Oh no! Did you steal from someone you know?
I would have loved to see it!
That sounds pretty stunning.  I bet she was very happy with her appearance.
Did you have a toothache?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you got it covered somehow.
That's great. I don't really have one.
How?
I know right. I love watching them do that.
What are you tired of?
Wow! Did he survive?
That is so sad. Did you have him a lot?
That's great! You must have been very spoiled as a kid.
That's true, I was in high school when my first car was a 1985 Pontiac Firebird.
Oh really? What memories did it bring back of?
What's bittersweet about it?
That's great to hear! What grades did you get?
That is good. Do you have any plans to get back to school?
What happened?
What did you do to the pole?
That's awesome! I love going to the gym!
I can relate to that. It's amazing how much we can accomplish in our lifetime.
That's annoying. Did you find out what it was?
Oh no, what happened?
That's awesome! What weight were you lifting?
What do you try your hardest at?
What did you do after?
I'm glad to hear that.  How many minutes a day?
Oh no. That is not good.
What's going on with him?
Wow that's awesome.  I hope you both do well!
That's great! It's always nice to feel like you can accomplish something.
Oh no, that must have been upsetting. What did they do?
That's so cool! What is your child's name?
You have to be proud of yourself for making it through!
I love going out to eat with friends!  How long have you been doing that?
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you are recovering well.
That is a good thing to feel.  It's nice to feel vulnerable and not be too confident.
I love going to the gym too.  I like to get a little sweaty and feel good about myself.
I am consistent too but I am not sure if it is healthy to be so.
I am sure they will appreciate that.
I don't really have any, I'm just a dude.
I'm so sorry. That's terrible.
You are right. I would be happy to have a dog.
That's awful! I'm sorry to hear that. Did you find out who it was?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope they learn from their mistakes.
That is so sad. I am sorry to hear that.
That is so sad.
That sounds fun! I'm sure they got along well.
That sounds like a pretty good day!
I am sorry to hear that.  How was it?
Did you have a baby?
I agree, summer is the best. I have a vacation coming up and I'm so ready for it.
That is a good thing. You will be fine.
That's awesome! I'm sure you're happy to see her. How long has it been?
I am sure it was.  What did you do?
Oh, that sounds really nice! What kind of dress?
That sounds fun!
What did you do to train?
What kind of workout did you do today?
I am glad that you have a job opportunity. What is the job opportunity?
Oh, what is it?
Did you do well?
I agree. But I think you made a mistake.
That's awful. Did you have to go to the hospital?
That is so nice.  Did you have a hammock?
That's great. What did he say?
That's great.  Did you guys get to talk about old times?
Wow that sounds great! Where are you going?
That is great!  Do you have any favorite shows?
That's so creepy! I hate when that happens too.
I don't like those dreams either. I would be very anxious.
That's pretty cool. Do you know how much it cost?
That is so true. It is a huge pain to pay rent on a house.
Oh no, did you have a reason for that?
That sounds like a pretty boring day.
That is awesome!  Did you catch up on each other's lives?
I am sure it did!  I have moved a few times myself, but that one was tough.
Oh no, that's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh no, did they have a long line?
I'm glad to hear that. What have you been through?
I am happy for you!
I agree.  I hate when people are lazy.  What are some common reasons for that?
It can be so hard to deal with.
That is the worst. I hate when that happens. Did you tell them to leave you alone?
That's really scary, what do you think they want?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
Oh, you're going to do great!  How are you feeling?
Oh no. Are they scary?
I'm sorry you have to go through that.
That is great, you must have been really exhausted!
I am sure you do. It is really important to take care of yourself, especially if you want to have any children.
I'm glad you are doing well. I'm a little jealous because my baby is still so small!
That's a good thing, it is hard to see your child born and to see them suffer.
Oh wow! That is quite a feat. I bet you are so proud of yourself.
That's good. You should be proud of yourself.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends?
I wish you the best of luck with that.
I know the feeling! I had to take 5 classes at the same time last semester and it was a nightmare. I'm sure you'll do well!
That can be a lot of stress.  I hope you are able to juggle it all.
That's great! I'm glad to hear that you're thinking about her. What do you think you could do to keep her?
I do. I'm going to be seeing him on Saturday.
Are you talking about the mosquitoes?
I have had to deal with them before.  They can be quite annoying.
Oh, that's great!  You must be very proud.  Are you going to college?
That's good to hear.  I hope they realize you too.
Oh that is so nice.  You must be so happy to be with them.  I am jealous.
I agree. I live in the Midwest and I am not used to long drives.
Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  What are you going to do?
Oh no! Are you okay?
I can understand that. I have had similar issues with my mom. I feel like I have to be more patient and understanding with her.
I can only imagine how difficult that must be. I hope you are able to improve your relationship.
That's not good.  What are you going to do to get her to get along?
That is so cool. What breed are you?
That is so awesome! What did you do there?
Oh my, how long ago was it?
What did you do to try and figure it out?
That is so sad. I have a dog that is 15 years old.
Did she leave?
I hope so too.  I am always looking forward to the future.
Oh no! I bet you felt awful. I hate when that happens.
Oh no! I hope you are okay.
That's terrible. I'm sorry.
I agree.  I like to think of it that way.
That's great! Are you going to tour?
Did you get to see a movie?
Oh wow! I've never been there. I'd love to go there too! I bet it's so beautiful!
Oh wow! I bet that was a unique experience!
I agree, we have to take it from here.
I agree, I'm hoping to find a good friend
That must have been terrifying. Did you see any strange things?
That's good! I'm glad you had a positive experience.
Oh no! That's terrible! Did you get it?
Wow that sounds nasty. Did you get him some meds?
What a lovely memory.  I'm sorry for your loss.
That is really nice. What kind of school supplies did she give?
That is so kind of you. I do not do that.
Did you have a big family Thanksgiving?
I know, I'm so excited too.
That is terrible.  I am so sorry to hear that.  Is there a family member or friend that will be taking care of her?
That is so sad. I feel for her.
That's a good way to approach things.
Oh no, did you get any rest?
That is so scary! I hope you are alright.
That is so sweet.  Are you trying to help him out with something specific?
i bet that is very stressful for you.
Wow, that's interesting. What did you do during your visit?
That's pretty cool. Do you want to be like her?
Did you tell him to stop?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.
Did everyone laugh at you?
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sure you felt better after it was over.
That is so cool! What are you going to do with your winnings?
That's a pretty mean prank. I hope he doesn't get in trouble.
I am sure they have a great time.
I can understand that, but are you sure you wouldn't be able to take them?
Oh wow! Where did you go?
That sounds like a lot of fun. What a great experience!
That's awesome! What's the theme?
That's awesome.  I'm sure you will celebrate it with a party.
I'm sure you're going to have a great time.
That is sad, I hope she gets the help she needs.
Oh no, that's terrible.  What did you do to protect your house?
That's good. I'm glad that you didn't lose power for too long.
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh that's so good.  I don't eat meat either.  Do you have a favorite type of meat?
Aww, that's so nice! I'm trying to go vegetarian as well, but I don't know if I'll be able to stick to it.
Oh wow!  What happened?
How did you feel when you had to do that?
Oh really? That's great. How does that work?
That's great. I am sure you will do well.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happens?
that's bad, is it a serious illness?
Wow! Congrats! What did you do to deserve it?
I am so happy for you. How have you been doing lately?
oh no. what happened?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What are you doing to try and make things better?
Oh no! How long have you been there?
I know how you feel, I have the same problem. I usually go to bars or meet up with friends.
What did you fail in?
Oh no, that's frustrating. Did you fail the class?
Oh that's so annoying. I don't know how to get it out of my head.
I'm sorry, what do you mean?
That sounds like so much fun. I remember getting a 10-er pack of pens. I used them all up.
Oh that is so sweet!  How old were you when that started?
I hope so! What is the price on your house?
That is a good feeling. I hope you get a lot of money for it.
That is disappointing.  What did you do to help her?
I am sorry.  Are you sure you haven't seen her?
Oh no! Did she get in trouble?
Oh my goodness. I would have been so upset.
I am so sorry to hear that. Did they take your car?
Did you get to see what it was?
Oh, that's sad.  What were some of those memories?
I know how you feel, it was so long ago. I hope you have a great time with your grandkids.
I'm sure they were delicious!
Oh no! I hope you get some food soon!
Oh no, I'm so sorry. That is a terrible loss. I can imagine how you feel.
That's good to hear. Did you have any idea it could happen?
Oh wow that is nice.  Did she enjoy it?
Oh that is nice of you! Did you do something nice?
I'm sorry to hear that. But it's not always easy to find a new job. You are going to be fine.
That is true. You will get it when the time is right.
That is a bummer.  Did you ask him for it back?
I know what you mean.  I have a few different guitars and they are all rares.  I have to keep them in the basement.
Oh no! I'm sorry. That's not very considerate of them.
What are they?
I agree. I used to be like that when I was young
Yeah that sounds great. I love the simple things in life.
Oh, that's so embarrassing! Did you try to cover it up or just laugh it off?
I would be shocked.
That is so sad. Did you try to get him to like you again?
Oh, that's so sweet.  I bet he loves your company!
That's nice of him. What did he leave you?
Oh wow!  I love antiques.  I have a few!
Did you let him use it?
Oh wow! That is very nice of him. How did you take care of it?
What happened?
That's a little gross.
I don't have any pets, but I do have a garden that I tend to. I love watching the birds and squirrels in it.
That's great, I've always wanted to help wildlife, but I'm afraid of it.
Oh wow, that is so sweet! What kind of puppy is it?
Oh wow. I'm not sure if I would want a chihuahua.
That's terrible. I would be so angry and hurt.
That's nice to hear, I'm glad to hear that you're learning and moving forward.
That's so good of you.  I hope your husband quit smoking.
That's too bad. What was the cause of the headache?
I am sorry to hear that.  How did it all work out?
I am sure she will understand.
I'm glad you found that. I used to have a lot of old cd's.
I haven't played either one. I love games like that, they are so much fun.
That sucks. What kind of job?
That's the worst part.  I hope you get the job.
I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope you will get through this tough time.
That's good to hear. It's always good to have a plan and a plan is what's going to work best for you.
That is a pretty big boat, I hope you enjoy it!
That is a lot of money.  I would be shocked if you could afford it.  Did you buy it yourself?
Oh, that's cool.  What kind of fishing do you like to do?
That sounds like fun.  What are you guys going to do?
I understand.  How long have you loaned money to friends?
That's awesome! I'm sure she's happy about it.
Oh no! I am so sorry. Did you find him?
That is terrible. I am so sorry.
I bet you feel great doing that.
I agree. I'm a little scared sometimes but I do enjoy it.
Oh no!  I hope she didn't feel left out!
Oh, I'm sure they do. I always think that when my kids get older they'll be more upset.
That's terrible. Did you ask him what happened?
I'm sorry, but you shouldn't feel bad about it. It's just your job.
That is always fun.  Did you run into anyone?
That's no good.  You should have checked the labels.  I would have been upset if I had found that.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you get better.
I'm sorry, what kind of remedies?
Wow that's awesome! I have a son too, and I am so jealous of his car!
I hope he had a good time.
Oh wow that's scary! Did they leave any evidence?
That is a pretty good thing, I bet you feel better knowing you have nothing of value in your car.
That is very nice of you.  Did you know her well?
Yeah, it can be tough when you see people around you that have been through pain.
That is great!  Is he having a good time?
Oh man that sounds so bad.
Oh wow, that's great. I hope you have a good time.
That's good. I'm glad to hear that.
That must have been a good memory for you.
that's pretty cool, I bet he was excited to be in first grade.  I was in 6th grade and my sister was in 10th.
I am sorry to hear that. I have heard she was a great singer.
I know what you mean. I'm a little jealous of people who are still alive, but at the same time I'm happy that they're still with us.
That sounds delicious.  I love red beans and rice.
That sounds like a lot of time.  I can't imagine having to wait that long for a meal.
Oh no. What happened?
That's terrible. Is it a child or an adult?
That is awesome. I bet you are proud.
That is good. I hope everything goes well.
Do you have everything you need?
Well that's great. I hope you do well.
Oh, that's terrible.  It's hard to deal with that, especially at such a young age.  Is there anyone she can talk to about it?
I'm sorry you are going through that. I hope she feels better soon.
I would be upset if I were in your shoes.
Did you get in trouble?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope your dog is now better.
That is good to hear.  Was she sick?
I am sure it is a lot of fun to have a kitten around!
That is so nice. Do you have a cat name?
That is great, it is always good to feel confident.
That's great. I have been playing the violin for 5 years and I love it.
That sounds really scary. Did you tell anyone about it?
What's the pride?
That is very bad. What was he going to do to make it work?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things turned out okay for you.
That's always a good thing to hear. Did you tell him you didn't want to do that?
That is so awful!  How do you feel about that?
Wow. That's a bummer. Was it a gas or electric crock pot?
Did you go to a restaurant?
That is good.  How did it go?
That is great.  You must be a great parent.
I am very happy for you. What happened?
Did you throw them away?
That's horrible. Did you find out what happened?
I bet you will do great!  You have the potential to be a star.
That's understandable. I know how that is.
Oh no!  That's terrible.  Were you okay after the hospital?
That must have been a bit scary. Did you have to go to the hospital?
I bet you were! Did you enjoy it?
That's awesome! I bet that you won the bet!
Oh wow! I bet you are excited to go!
That is good. I am sure she will appreciate it.
Oh my god, that is so scary! I can imagine how you felt
That's terrible.  I would have been so upset if I was in that situation.  How did you deal with it?
I bet you did.  She would want you to have it.  It's a sentimental thing
I know what you mean! Sometimes you just can't let go of something or someone.
That's amazing! I am so impressed.
Yeah, I know that feeling. I was like that with my son.
Oh no! That's terrible. What happened?
I am sorry. I bet you felt bad.
That's so sad. Did you have a good relationship?
What are you feeling miserable about?
That is awesome! You must have been so happy!
Oh really? What do you like to do?
That is sad to hear. Did they have any shows or activities?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.
Wow, that's awesome. What's the contest about?
I can understand that. But I am not sure I would be interested in that stuff
I am too! How long do you have to move?
That's exciting, what state are you moving to?
Yeah, that's creepy.  What did you do?
Yeah that sounds pretty weird. What did you do?
That's great.  I hope you take it!
I'm sure you'll do a great job.
I bet that did sting a bit. Did you ask her why she won?
I've been to Gatlinburg a few times. I had a great time there.
That's quite a feat, is he a professional?
That is awesome, what was it?
That sounds like a lot of work! I bet it's not easy.
I can understand that. I'm moving to a new city soon.
Oh no, that is terrible. Did you have any damage?
That is so terrible, how much did it cost?
Oh wow, what a great memory. How old is she now?
I think you might be thinking of a box of chocolates!
That's good of you.
That's good to hear. It sounds like you are a good person to have in your life.
Oh no, that's terrible. How did she look?
That is so unacceptable. Why did he do that?
That sounds exciting! I hope it is good news.
I know, it can be frustrating, but at least you have a reason to wait.
Oh no, what was the job?
What job is it?
Oh no, that must have been awful!
What was the thing they were doing?
I am excited for you! I have been waiting for the same thing for years!
Well, you should ask your parents. They can help you out.
How terrible. Did you have it on a waterproof cover?
That is no good. What happened?
Are you sure that it was her?
Yes, I am sorry to hear that. She was a Great Pyrenees.
Oh wow, congratulations! What type of job is it?
That's awesome! What kind of job is it?
Oh, that's a bummer. Are you sure you're prepared?
That's great. What's the test?
That's a bummer. What happened?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are okay.
That's good.  What is your job?
That's cool. I don't know much about public relations.
That is awesome, what did you do to get there?
Oh that's great! I hope it goes well!
I'm not sure I'd be interested in that.
That can be sad. What city are you in now?
I am sure it will. You will be fine.
That's so awesome. I know how hard it can be to find the right brand for us.
I agree, but sometimes you need to try something new to see what works best for you
That's the best way to spend a rainy day.
What is it dry?
That is so sad. I am so sorry.
That is terrible. Did they get put down?
Oh, that's so great. I hope you all get through it safely.
Oh really?  What do you mean?
That's very kind of her, I hope you feel better soon.
That is a good thing.  What does she do for you?
I can understand that.  If you are in a restaurant, I would always be cautious about eating there.
That sounds awful! I hope you get better soon.
Oh wow, that's weird. Did you get them all the same color?
oh no!  that's terrible.  did you have to order more syrup?
That's so cool! I love how you keep your childhood things.
I bet.  What did you do?
That's great.  How many pancakes did she make?
That is nice.  What is your name?
Did you find someone else?
I'm sure you are very grateful for her!
That is so sweet. I would be so happy if my brother kept it a secret.
That's good!  What's the secret?
That's really nice of you. I'm sure she appreciates it.
I am happy to hear that!
I would feel the same way.  Do you think you will ever be able to afford one?
I've never heard of that. Is it an old car?
Oh, I'm sure it will be worth it! I've always wanted a mobile home.
That's pretty good.  I love scratch offs.
Oh my gosh, that is crazy!
That is good.
That is nice of you. Did he like it?
Oh, that sounds like fun! What's the surprise?
That sounds so exciting!  I hope you have a great time!
I hope you have a great time.
That's nice of your dad.
Oh no!  I hope he's okay.  I've had to take my kids to the hospital for that before.
That can be tough. Did you feel like you missed out on something?
That is awesome! I have been praying a lot lately. I can't wait to go on vacation in a few weeks!
Oh, no! What kind?
I love those!  Do you have a favorite type of cookie?
Oh wow!  That is a lot of fun!  What did you do?
I bet that was a great time.
That's so sweet of the coach. You must be a good teacher!
That's awesome! You must be a pretty good player.
That's not good, I hope you're not too scared.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope everything is okay.
I am sorry to hear that.
That is very disturbing.  Is she getting the treatment she needs?
That sounds like a very relaxing time. Is your cat a pretty cat?
That's nice. What kind of cat is it?
That must have been stressful. Did you get the job?
Why?
Oh yea? Did you have fun?
That is great, I love to get away from the stress.
Oh no, that's terrible.  How did that go?
Oh wow, that is disgusting.
Oh, that sounds fun. What happened?
What kind of ride is it?
That's really kind of him.  I'm sure you appreciate it.
What kind of disability?
Oh, did you have a good experience?
You're going to do fine! You are very smart.
That is a big accomplishment!  How are they doing?
I am sure you are not bored
Oh no, that's terrible. Did you get to see your family?
That sucks.  I can imagine.  I hope you have fun out there.  Do you have a family member you have to pick up?
Oh, I hate waiting in line!
I love that! I have to get one of those to make lunch.
Oh no. What was it like?
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. Is it something specific?
That sounds really cool.  What are they doing?
I'm glad you're excited, I'm not.
That's always great to see your old friends again. I hope you guys had fun.
That's sad. How many people are you talking about?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  It's always hard when we have to say goodbye to someone that we've been friends with for a long time.
That's really disappointing.  What did she say she spent?
What did she lie about?
Oh no! What did she do?
I see. I have to agree, they are not nice people.
I don't blame her. I wouldn't be like that either.
That is unfortunate, it is great that you got to spend time with her though.
I understand. Do you have to drive long distances?
That's great! I hope the girls have a good year.
Oh, that's awesome. I bet you were happy.
Wow, that must have been quite a wait. Was it good news?
That's good to hear. Did you get the answer you were looking for?
That is very sad. I am sorry for your loss.
That's a good point. It's hard to have a relationship when the other person isn't on the same page.
You must have some great memories
I'm glad you have a great life now.
Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! What kind of fish do you like to catch?
I love stink bait! I'm so jealous of you!
I've never played dominoes. What are you playing for?
Oh? What happened?
What made you nervous?
I know, it can be a bit stressful.
That is good. I hope you get it!
I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  I bought a new camera last year and it's been a great experience!
That is terrible! I hate when dogs do that.
What did you do to make a mess?
That sounds like a great weekend! I hope you have a good time.
That's really cool. I like that.
Oh that's scary.  Did you call the police?
Oh, that is annoying, did it take long to get back up and running?
That's a good idea.  I'm not sure about the seal on our doors.
What is happening?
Oh no! I bet you were so disappointed! Did you try it?
That's a great way to handle it.
I bet you felt a lot better about it! I have been there before.
I know what you mean.  It's hard to feel good about money when it's just sitting there.
That's nice. Do you still get cookies from her?
I love oatmeal cookies too. I have a grandma who makes them for me all the time.
That's awesome.  I bet it was fun to look back on that.  What was she like?
That's awesome, I'm happy for you!
I bet she's a great player!
I love the way kids can learn so much at a young age.
I have never heard of it. I am sorry to hear that.
That's awesome!  Are you a big fan of the brand?
That's awesome! Congratulations.  What was your position?
That's great!  What will you be doing as the manager?
That sounds exciting. What kind of promotion are you looking for?
That's good. Sometimes you can't control things.
That's pretty cool.  What kind of work do you do?
That is terrible. I am so angry.
That's a good point. I didn't think about the animals.
Aww that's nice. I bet you were happy!
Wow that sounds like fun! I bet it was a great experience for you.
Oh, I remember that! I was at school for a few years and it was like that too.
That's a nice way to look at it.  I'm sure you'll be back in touch with them soon.  How old are they?
I know what you mean!  My kids are both 19 now.  It's crazy how fast they grow up!
That sounds really gross! I hate cleaning stuff like that.
That is a pretty weird thing to see.  Did you try to get closer to it?
That is horrible. I would not be able to do such a thing.
I agree with you. I have seen some of the animals that are being raised at the farm, and they are not treated well.  I think it should be illegal to treat animals like that.
I agree. I've been volunteering at an animal shelter for a few years now.
That is a very harsh view.
Oh, that's great! I bet he will do well!
That's great! I hope you guys have a lot of fun!
That's great. I have two myself.
That's awesome! I love watching law and order too!
I don't know. I don't know anyone over 80.
Oh no!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you going to go on vacation?
I feel you. I hate days like this.
Oh no! How did you react?
I bet it was. I would have been mad too.
Oh no, I'm so sorry. I hope you found comfort in knowing that the kitten was safe with you.
That is terrible.  I am sorry to hear that.  I hope she was a good kid.
Did you help her?
That's good.  She is lucky to have a good parent.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that!
That's a good thing to do.  Do you have a lot of receipts?
That is nice of her. Did you have a lot of debts to pay off?
I'm glad to hear that.  I hope she is happy.  I feel for you
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, well, I guess that's what you get when you grow up in a big city.
Oh my, that is hilarious. I bet you both were so embarrassed.
That's awful.  How did she react?
Oh, I'm sorry. What movie was it?
What happened?
That's awful.  Did you talk to him about it?
I hate it when people like that.
I hear you. I'm so tired of it.
I know the feeling! What are you gonna do?
I bet you are excited!
Oh yeah? What's wrong with it?
That is gross!
That's the problem with apples.
That must have been scary. What did you do?
That's terrible! Was she scared?
That's great! I have a few dogs myself.
I love dogs!  What a sweet boy!  Is he a rescue?
That's not cool. Did you eat it at lunch?
That is terrible.  I hope she finds it.
Oh no! That's terrifying!
I'm sorry to hear that, do you have a good day now?
Oh no!  What's making you afraid?
That's awesome! What kind of job do you have?
That's great to hear. What kind of job do you do?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan for the movie?
That sounds terrible.  What do you miss the most?
That's great. I love taking pictures of butterflies.
I bet you were very happy to see it.
That's so gross! Did your dog die?
Oh no! What happened?
I know right? Cats can be the worst.
I guess it's not fun at night
That's awesome! I hope you get it!
that is to be expected
Oh my, that's scary! What happened?
Why was that?
I'm sorry.  I hope he didn't get too upset.
I'm sorry, what happened?
Oh my god, that's awful.  Are you ok?
That's terrible. You should report it to the police.
Oh no. I am sorry to hear that.
That is so sad. I am sorry to hear that.
That's great! I love karaoke.
That's a pretty good way to get a feel for the crowd.
Well that is great. It takes a lot of work to do that.
I bet you were. I don't work long hours.
That's annoying. What song is it?
What is it?
what is going on?
I am going on a cruise!
That's pretty bad. What happened?
What happened?
Oh no! Did you give him a car insurance card?
That's very nice of him, he should have asked you if he could practice driving
I am sure you will find the right one for you. What are you thinking of majoring in?
What's your passion?
I love Christmas!
That's good to hear.  I'm sure you'll be able to help him out.  You're a good person.
That's a bummer. I hate when that happens.
That's good. What did you do?
I am glad to hear that you are looking to work on your relationship.
That is good.
I know how that is. I have to be careful with my money too.
I do the same thing.  I like to keep my money tight
I'm sorry.  I bet that makes you upset.
I am sorry to hear that.  Have you talked to him about it?
Oh, that's no good. I hope you can get them done!
Oh, I see.  I'm not sure I could do that.  I'm pretty lazy.  I have to be at work by 5:00.  I have to get all of my work done by 5:00.  I have to get all of my work done by 5:00.
What happened to her?
That's interesting. I've never thought about it that way before.
I know it does!  I am glad to hear that it is.
That is sad. Do you have any plans for them?
I'm sure they're just trying to get more money out of you.
That is very scary. I am sorry.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  That sounds like a scary time.
That is really cool. What game is it?
What is devotion?
oh wow, i would have been mad
That's not cute at all. What did you do about it?
I hope you are alright
I'm sure you were thirsty
I'm sure it was not a good time.  Did you get a little embarrassed?
Oh no, did you get in trouble?
I am happy for her. I am sure she is going to do great things.
That's so good to hear! I hope she feels better soon!
That is not good.  I am sorry to hear that.  Is it the only one?
That is really bad.  I have a friend who has MS.  He has a lot of trouble walking and has gotten very sick.
Oh no! How old is she?
I am sorry to hear that.  Is it someone you care about?
Did she drive it safely?
That's good. She's a good driver, right?
What test are you taking?
Wow, you must be ready for the test.
I love that. What song was it?
That's great. What made you feel nostalgic?
That is terrible.  Did you have any family members left?
That is terrible, I'm sorry to hear that, but I hope you find peace.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she's okay.
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope she is okay now.
That sounds great. Did you have a nice dinner?
Oh yea? What is it?
That's a good attitude to have.
That can be tough. Do you think you will ever trust someone again?
I am glad you are trying.  I know it is hard but you will get there.  I started quitting drinking soda and it is easier than you think.
That is a very honest admission. What do you do when you give in?
I hope you got it.  What is the job?
Oh no, I hope it doesn't take too long.
Oh no! I hope you can find them all!
That's a bummer. It's hard to explain to kids.
I bet you felt good about it, you deserve it!
Oh that is bad.  What is going on?
That's so sad. Did you try to talk to them?
Oh, that's so cool. What happened?
oh man that must have been very scary.
Oh, I see, did he seem to have any issues with it?
That sounds so special. What were you holding?
I agree.  I was in a good mood the other day.
That is no good.  I bet she was surprised.  How do you feel about it now?
I am sure she is happy to see you
Oh wow! I bet that was fun.
That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of games do you play?
I love skydiving! It was so exhilarating!
That's a good attitude to have.
Oh wow, I bet it was a sad day for you.
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you will be fine.
Oh no! Did you hurt yourself?
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's nice. I bet it brought back a lot of good memories for you.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh wow, congratulations! What is the award for?
That is great.  I am sure it was hard work.  Did you get a nice reward?
That sounds like a lot of fun. What do you usually do at the park?
Did you ever play sports in school?
I love rain, it is so relaxing
That's so nice of you. Do you feel guilty?
I am sure you will be fine. I have had the same problem and it is hard to resist.
Oh no! That's so sad. I'm sure you'll be able to find it.
Wow, I bet that was exciting!
Oh no! Did she do okay?
That is really nice of her. I bet you are proud of her.
That is so terrible, I am sorry to hear that.
Oh, that's terrible. They should be ashamed.
That's nice! How did she know?
That's great to hear, what happened?
Oh my gosh, did you get hurt?
That is not good. What did she do?
That's no fun. What happened?
What did you do?
That's great. I wish I could go back to my childhood home.
That's great! What kind of dog is it?
Oh yeah, that is a great idea!
I feel you.  I'm a little scared to even drive on rough pavement.
I am sure she is very sweet. I am sure she will be great with your dog.
That is terrible!  I would be so mad!  Did you call the plumber?
That's awful. I hope she feels better soon.
That sounds like a great idea. I am so sorry you got sick.
That is awesome! I am so happy for her!
I can't wait to go on vacation.  Are you going anywhere?
Oh wow. That's so sweet. What kind of kitten?
I can't wait to see what you do!
That is a pretty scary thing to think about, I hope you are safe!
That's a bummer. I guess you'll just have to keep your car in the garage.
That's nice of him. I wish I had a co-worker who could help me out.
Did you watch him compete?
What did you do?
That's good. What kind of work are you doing?
That is great. What is the charity you are supporting?
That is great! I hope they have a great day!
That's really sweet of you. Where did you go?
That sounds like a great trip. Did you take any photos?
Oh, that's so nice. What do you do at home?
I am a Floridian, so I can relate to that. It's nice to go home and hang out with family and friends.
Oh wow. I am sure it was a wonderful experience for you.
That is so exciting.
That's great. Do you feel confident about it?
That's awesome. I'm glad you feel confident about it. What's the test about?
That's awesome! What kind of job is it?
I'm glad to hear that. What kind of questions?
That is nice. What movie was it?
I think I understand what you are saying.
That is terrible. What are you going to do now?
Oh no, how did it happen?
Oh no! I am sorry. That must have been very stressful.
What happened to her?
I am sorry, it is frustrating.
That is a good point.  What do you do when that happens?
That's so sweet! Do they like the candies or toys?
That is nice!  Do you ever get to see your grandma?
That's terrible. I bet it was hard on you to see him like that.
I can't even imagine. What kind of discoveries?
That is a bummer.  What are you going to do?
Oh, I hope you don't lose too much.
What did you do?
Yeah, I'm sure he's fine. He's a good looking dog.
That is awesome. What language is it?
I understand. I have the same problem.
Wow, that's a lot of skill. What kind of board did you use?
Oh yeah? What kind of practice?
Oh, I love the beach! What kind of beach are you going to?
That's great. I hope you have a good time.
That sounds like fun!
That's terrible. Did they get it back?
Wow, that's bad.
That's a nice gift!  It's great that you have a partner in crime.
Oh really? What happened?
That sounds nice.  What happened?
What did you talk about?
What did you do to deserve it?
I have never been to Vegas, but I have been to New Orleans.
That's too bad. I hope you guys can find something that works out.
I hope that doesn't happen.
I agree, being proud of ourselves is good, but taking help is good too.
Wow! What kind of dolls did you have?
That's cool! What are they dressed up as?
That's always a bummer.  Are you in need of a laptop or a repair?
Oh no, I hope she's okay.
That sucks. Did you feel bad?
That's great! I'm glad you enjoyed it. What was it for?
Oh wow! I'm glad you were productive!
That's great! I hope you have fun.
That sounds awesome. I love graphic design.
I bet that's exciting!
That is funny!
That is good, it is always good to have a good resume.
That's great. Are you sure you'll get the job?
I bet that was exciting.  Are you applying?
That's good. I bet you are confident in your abilities.
Wow, I would have been mortified.  Did you clean it up?
That was cool! I love when that happens.
What was the job?
How awkward and stressful?
Well I'm glad. I had a bad day myself.
That's terrible!  I hope you get the treatment you need.  I've been diagnosed with that as well and it's really tough.  How are you taking care of yourself?
Oh no, that is terrible. I hope you can get back soon.
Oh wow! That's amazing! How did he do?
That's so awesome. Did you watch them play?
Oh, I'm sorry that happened to you.  I bet you were so surprised.  Did you laugh at her?
Did she say it was a school play?
Why are you proud?
That was cool, I had a Sega Dreamcast too, but I didn't play as much as I wanted to.
That's awesome! I just got a new xbox console, so I can play some old games!
Well, I'm here to help, so I'm ready to do whatever I can to help you through it.
That is frustrating. What are you going to do about it?
I'm not sure. I don't know if you are looking for help or not.
What kind of concoction?
I am not sure if I believe it.
That is not good! I hope everything turned out well.
That's good to hear! What was it?
That sounds so scary! Were you able to get help?
I bet that was scary!  How did it feel?
That's a good point. I'm not sure I agree.
I bet you are so bummed out about that.
Why is that?
That's so common. I buy the same food for the same reason.
Oh my goodness. That is scary. Did she survive?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope she is doing better now.
That's too bad. I'm sure she will forgive you.
Did you feel bad?
That is interesting. I am not sure I understand why someone would do that.
Oh no, what happened?
I'm sure they did! I'm sure you have a lot of memories there too!
I am sure it was nice to look back.
That is cool! Where are you from?
Oh, that's great, I've never been.  I wish I could go, I love Chicago too.
That's cool! Did you have a good time?
That sounds amazing! Where was the first place you went?
That is so awesome! I bet she would be so proud of you!
What was your name?
I love Halloween! What are you planning to do?
That sounds like a lot of fun.  I have never been to that place.  Have you ever been?
Did they treat you well?
That's terrible. What did you do?
Oh, that's bad. What was it about?
What did you confess?
That's great! What did you do?
I'm glad you have a job!
That's terrible. Did you have insurance?
What were they running from?
That's awesome! I'm sure you were excited!
That's great!  What kind of shoes are they?
I hope you get the job.
That's nice to hear. You're lucky to find someone like that.
Oh my, that is a bummer. Did you call a power company?
Oh no! I hope you are okay!
That's a pretty good chance of winning!
That's great to hear!
That's really nice of them.
That's awesome!  I'm glad you were able to do that.  Beer is a great way to relax.
Did you win?
That is a bummer! What happened?
I have never played that game.
Yeah that can be a problem.  Are you feeling overwhelmed with the world?
I am too.  It is so infuriating.
That's really unfortunate.
I am sorry to hear that. I know it is very sad.
What happened?
Well, what happened?
I am sorry to hear that.  Did you speak to her about it?
Oh no! I hope you were able to recover your work.
That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I can't imagine having to do that.
Oh no, what happened?
I agree.
I hope you feel better soon
What did it look like?
That was cool. What kind of show was it?
That sounds like a good time. I bet you were amazed.
I'm sure you will do great. I've had some interviews before and they're always a lot of fun.
Why is that?
That's great! I hope you get the job you're looking for!
I'm not a big drinker.
That is so nice of her.
That's really nice. How old is she?
That can be a tough adjustment, especially if they were close. What made you move?
That is sad. How long have you been away?
I am sorry to hear that.
That is very kind of her.  I would be very grateful if someone like that showed kindness to me.
What did you do?
That is great! Did you have a big family gathering?
That's nice, I bet it was a big part of your life. Did you miss him?
That's good to hear. Did you have kids?
That is so nice of them.
That's good to hear, you must have been really busy.
I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope she is at peace.
What happened to her?
That's really rude! I hate when that happens!
That's terrible. Did you have to throw out your house?
Wow that's awesome!  Is she from the same city?
That's great. What happened?
That is so nice!  What was the surprise?
That's awesome. Where is it?
What kind of cat?
That's great! Congratulations!
Oh, that's terrible.  I am sorry.  Are they being cared for by someone?
That's great!  It is good that you have a sister to help.
That sounds like fun, how did it go?
Oh no! What kind of dog is he?
Oh no, what happened?
That's awesome, I bet you got him a really good ice cream!
That's so exciting!  Are you taking any classes that you've always wanted to take?
That's great. What are you doing?
That's so cool! I love finding old family items.
That is good, what happened?
That's great! I hope they fixed it for you quickly and for good!
What do you mean?
That must be really tough for him. Is he getting help?
That is so sad.  You need to be honest with him.  I don't think it's healthy to be dishonest with someone.
Oh that's great! I'm glad you have friends who can do that for you.
I'm glad you are happy.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you report it to the authorities?
I can relate.  I don't know how they can do it.
I'm sure she was. How long have you two been together?
I loved college! It was so much fun.
That is a bummer.  How old is she?
I am sure you will, and I hope you have a great time!
I've been there.  It's not the end of the world.  You can always call a locksmith to get them made.
Yeah, I lost my keys once too.  I was so stressed out that I was on the verge of losing it all.
Oh no!  Was it a surprise?
That is the worst, I hate it when that happens
I would be a little suspicious about my supervisor as well.
Wow, what happened?
Ahhh, I know what you mean. What was the exception?
I am not sure if I would do that, I'm not sure I would get caught.
I am so happy for you!
Oh that's great. What did you win?
That's a pretty fun surprise. Did you like it?
Wow! That's so cool!
That is cool. I love looking back on the old photos from my childhood.
I know what you mean.  I have a lot of fond memories of that time period.
That's so cool you were brave enough to do that.
That's really rough. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
I am sure he wouldn't have expected you to be afraid of it.
That's awful.  Did you go to the bathroom?
That can be tough, but I'm sure you're okay with it.
I understand, sometimes it can be hard to let go of the people that are important to us.
What kind of job is it?
Why are you anxious?
That is a big change.  Do you have any plans to meet new people?
That's nice.  What city is he going back to?
Did you see what happened to the dog?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're okay
What kind of tattoo did you get?
That's great!  What kind of blood?
That's good to hear. What have you guys been doing together?
That's really sweet of him. Did you enjoy it?
Oh yeah? What happened?
That's great.  What a surprise!
I know exactly what you mean.  I love that feeling.  Music is my favorite thing to listen to.
That is sad. Do you have a favorite song?
That is a good way to cope with sadness.  I do not have a stuffed rabbit.  I am an adult and do not have a pet.
That's really nice of him.  I'm glad he is so considerate.  What a nice guy.
oh my god! how did he do?
What happened?
I would be so mad!
Did he yell at you?
That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened?
That sounds like a great time. What shows are you going to watch?
I have never seen that show. Is it good?
Oh no. What was the reason?
That is a tough spot to be in.  Have you considered looking at some of the job markets in other states?
Oh man, that's a bummer! I'm sure they were shocked.
That's terrible. Did you hurt yourself?
I hope he feels better soon! I'm sorry you have to do that for him.
That sounds like a good idea.
Oh, that sounds like a disaster. Did you have to redo it?
That must have been very difficult for you.  I hope you are able to get through this.
That's great. What is the meeting about?
That sounds exciting! Do you think you'll get the job?
Oh no! What did you do?
That's a good thing. If they're not together, then why would you want to be with them?
I know how that is, it's hard to be around people who just want to make you feel bad.
I bet you two get along really well. It's good that you have a good friendship.
Oh wow! That's awesome!
That's nice. What are you going to do?
How did you find him?
I am sorry to hear that.  What did you do?
That's very kind of you. How old are they?
What are they doing?
I love baking.  What's her favorite recipe?
That's a great kid. What's her name?
That's good.  I'm glad you have a good relationship with your mother.
I feel the same way!
Wow! I'm sure it was a great experience!
Oh that's awesome! What field of engineering is he studying?
That is very sad.  Do you have any children?
I am sorry to hear that. It must have been very hard for you to deal with that.
That's so sweet.  What was he studying?
I am so happy for him. It's always great when someone achieves their dreams!
That sounds really relaxing! What did you do?
I am happy for you. You deserve it!
That is great news!  You must be excited!
That sounds great!  I bet he'll be excited.  What kind of meal are you planning?
That's great.  I hope you both have a good time.
That's great.  I have been married for 20 years and I still try to keep things fun.
I bet.  I hope you are able to make more memories with him in the future.
Yeah, it's amazing how fast time goes. It seems like just yesterday you were a little kid.
That is very impressive. You must be very confident and experienced.
What do you do?
Wow that is horrible. I would be very angry. Did you tell him?
That sounds like a crazy mom!  I can imagine she was mad.
That must have been stressful. Is she doing well?
That's awful, how did that happen?
That's too bad.  Did you forget something?
I bet!  You're going to have a good time!
I would be very embarrassed. I hope you can forgive him!
It is hard when you are in love with someone, and they are not with you.
Oh my god, what did you do?
That's a good thing you did. It is always better to be safe than sorry.
That is nice.  I hope you had fun!
That's a great attitude to have, especially with all the things that are coming your way as you get older.
That's so sad. I hope you guys can work through it.
That's true. I'm a bit more silent.
Oh no! What did you do?
That's great!  I'm glad it was your shadow and not something worse.
That is so sad.  How did it affect you?
I can understand that. I know some people who live on the streets.
That is awesome, congratulations!
I am happy for you! How old are they?
I'm sorry to hear that, you had to make a choice to stay true to yourself, I would've done the same
I agree, but it's hard to make that happen. People are hard to change, and it's hard to get them to believe.
That must have been quite intimidating.  How did you feel when you got it?
Oh no! Are you safe?
That's awesome! I've always wanted to join a weight loss group. I'm not sure if I'm up for it but I think it could be a great way to get motivated!
I'm glad they are there for you.
I would be too. I have never been so nervous in my life.
I am happy for you. I am going to study for my last exam.
That's great. What kind of cards did you find?
I think it's a little silly, but it's a good point.
I bet. I have a lot of old stuff that I never had time to sort through.
Oh yea? What is it?
That must have been scary! I bet you were worried about falling.
That is hilarious! I hope you weren't hurt!
Oh no, what is it?
I don't understand why people are so afraid of the law.
I know what you mean! I'm so sorry to hear that. Did they give you a part?
Oh, I hope you get another one that you like.
That's great, it's always fun to teach a kid to drive.
That sounds like a fun drive.  I bet you guys had a good time.
I bet it'll be a lot easier than you think!
That's so great.  I hope she has a good time!
That's no fun at all! I hope you guys have fun.
Ahh, you are a very optimistic person! I like that!
I would be very happy to have a brother who is honest and reliable.
That's great! I'm glad he's a good brother.
That's great to hear! I am so happy for you guys!
You are right! I am glad you are happy.
That's awesome! I've always been in awe of people who are able to do that.
That's wonderful! I'm sure you are very proud of her.
That sounds like fun, did you learn anything new today?
That sounds like a good plan. I hope you can do it and get it done.
that must have been so upsetting
I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have any plans for funerals?
I am happy for you. I am sure it was a nice surprise.
That is terrible. I am so sorry.
That's awesome! Are you excited about it?
That's awesome! Halo is a great game. What are you planning to do with it?
That's so sweet.  I am sure she will always be with you.
I am sorry for your loss. I think it is always hard to lose someone you love.
Oh wow! That's awesome. What are you planning on doing?
I'm sorry that is such an issue. Is there a way to prevent it?
Wow! That is amazing. You must have had some good time.
Oh cool, what kind of voice is he?
That is so sad. Did you take it in?
That's great, how old is he now?
Oh no! I hope everything turned out okay!
Oh no, I hope it didn't cause any damage.
I know the feeling. What made it so unnerving?
I love online classes, they are so convenient!
I am sure she will forgive you, you are a good man.
Oh no. That's so embarrassing. It's just one day.
I am sure it was a good moment though.
Oh that's a funny story. I have never worn a dress, so I'm not sure I can relate.
I have had some too. I have always been a little scared of the dark, but my dreams are pretty normal.
Oh no, did you get a good look at what was staring at you?
Oh I know that feeling.  It's not good.
I am sure you are not afraid of being charged.
That sounds amazing! I've never been to a retreat like that. Did you learn anything new?
What is that?
That's great! What are you looking forward to?
I'm a big Harry Potter fan. I haven't been to Universal in a while.
I bet you are excited!
I'm sure you will get in, law school is tough.
That sounds like a lot of fun.  Are you a big cook?
Well, Chinese is actually my favorite. I've never had a good Chinese dish, but I'm curious to try.
That's amazing. What school was it at?
That's awesome! What kind of ledge?
I am sure he is a precious little one.  I hope he is doing okay.
That's great. How long have you been together?
That is very nice of her.
Oh, I'm sure you will! I know it's hard, but you will get there!
Oh no! Did you get it out?
What happened?
That's awful.  How long have you been renting?
That is a good thing to see.  What is he doing?
That's good. I hate when that happens.
Oh, that's good to hear. It's always good to have a backup plan.
That is very nice of her.
That's exciting! What is it?
Oh no, I'm sorry. I can't imagine being in a similar situation.
That's awesome. I love collecting cards too.
I am so sorry to hear that. How did it happen?
Did he have to go through a lot of surgeries?
That's great. What were you doing?
What do you mean?
oh that's good.  I have a cat named Luna, I miss her
Oh no! Did they get lost?
I'm sorry?
That's awesome! What subject is it in?
That's not fun at all. Did you get a new pair?
I bet!  What happened?
Oh no, did you feel sick afterwards?
That's awesome, I'm so glad you were able to do it.
That's terrible. Did you talk to her about it?
What happened?
How long have you worked with them?
I'm sorry to hear that, are you feeling insecure?
I agree, they are not the most pleasant thing to deal with.
What happened to you?
oh, that's weird.
Oh no!  Is everything okay?
I am sorry to hear that. Did you try to get back on track?
That's a good point.  I think that's what is missing in today's world, self-improvement.
It's a very exciting experience!
That is great. What happened?
I'm sure you will.  You must be doing something right.
That's great! What kind of music is it?
That's good to hear. What are you excited about?
I know a lot of things, but I am not sure about most of them.
I like meditating too. It helps me relax and think clearly.
I am too.
I totally get that. Sometimes I just need to sit and stare at myself in the mirror and enjoy the silence.
That's a good attitude to have.  What is it that you're worthy of?
Well, I think it's good to let things go sometimes, but it's also good to have control. It's like having a balance.
I know the feeling. It's a good feeling to have a positive outlook on life.
That's great. It's always nice to feel comfortable in your own skin.
That's great. How old are you?
Oh cool. How long will you be gone?
I hope not too. I am afraid of hurricanes too.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're okay.
Wow that's bad. Did you get the insurance money?
oh no! were you able to fix it?
What kind of thing dropped?
That sounds like a real pain in the neck. Did you have to get it out?
What happened?
I think that is a great idea. Do you have a lot of time to dedicate to it?
That's a very good point, how did you find yourself in that position?
Oh no! What do you do to take a break?
What's going on?
I remember that too.  I was always the "new kid" and never had friends.
Oh no, that's awful. I'm sorry. I hope you can work on that soon.
That sounds like a great way to feel more self-reliant. I hope you didn't feel too uncomfortable with it.
Oh, that's a little too close to home for me. I have to get a new bathtub.
That is awesome.  I can't lift very much so I just eat to make sure I can lift.
That sounds like a lot of garlic.
I agree, I just don't like being sold something for a price that I didn't know I was paying.
That's not true.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh no! I hope your daughter is a good sport about it.
Oh no! That's terrible!
I love that band, they are so unique and fun to listen to
I am sure they are good
Well, I hope you get it soon!
I know right! What kind of car?
Oh no!  That is so terrible!  Have you contacted the bank?
That's horrible. I hope everything is okay.
I can see why you would be.  I hate those sales people.
That is bad. What did you do?
Oh no! How long have you been married?
I'm sorry. That can be really hard.
I know about that. They're not just doing the right thing, they're doing it for a false sense of security. People need to be aware of it.
I agree, people are getting more and more gullible.
Oh no! What is the topic?
I love HR, it's a very important part of any organization.
Oh no! That is terrible. Are you sure no one found it?
I'm not sure I agree. What could possibly stop it from happening?
Oh, how long do you have left?
I am so jealous of your situation!  I am not sure how you are able to do this!
Oh man, that must have been terrifying. What was he saying?
Oh wow, that is scary, what were you doing?
Oh no! I'm so sorry. Did you get caught?
That's nice. I've never been to school.
That's amazing!  Are you excited?
That's great. How long did it take?
I agree! I love the holiday season.
I feel the same way. I think that there's always something to worry about.
I am sure it was weird. I am a bit jealous of you.
Did you have a good time after?
Wow, that's really bad. I hope they catch the person!
That is so nice of them. I hate when they don't leave a note.
What candy is it?
Thats a nasty thing to eat.
That is great!  Do you have her on some medication?
