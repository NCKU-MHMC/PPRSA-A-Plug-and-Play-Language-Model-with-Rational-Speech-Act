Oh, that sounds awful! What happened?
I'm glad you came out of it with a better understanding of their situation.
Oh no. What happened?
I was shaken up, but atleast I am not dead yet.
sorry to hear that.
Its hard to break relationships. I did that with my wife. Just give it some time.
What concert?
What concert did you go too?
Oh my god. That's so sad. What was the article about?
So sad to hear this. I hope everything works out for the best for her.
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that! Is he alright now?
Aw that sucks. Is he okay?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that but I hope he'll find something soon.
That is a big relief.  I know how hard it can be to lose a job.
Wow that sounds terrifying, I hope they caught the guy.
That is scary! I would feel bad if I was you, did he get hurt?
That's cool. Who are you going with?
Woo that's awesome. Do you miss them?
That's terrible. Did he get caught?
That sounds like a real low guy. You should've offered to do something about it instead of being passive aggressive about it.
Oh, wow. In that case I would have just stayed at work.
I would have been disappointed also. What were you going to do?
That is a good friend for sure.
That is very admirable of you.  If you don't mind me asking, who is your friend now?
That sounds like a relaxing environment to be in! How old is your baby?
Awww.  That's so sweet.  I think babies are the happiest of all living beings.
Oh, that is terrible. I've been there. That can be really tough.
Sometimes you just have to accept it and move on.
That would irk me also. She doesn't have to keep it bottled up.
That would be a hard situation to deal with.  I would be so frustrated if someone like that is rewarded or loved more than me!
I hate bugs too
That is good that you have those memories.
That is good that she is doing well. Do you miss her?
That is a great story, what happened then?
That is great that you have memories like that.
Of course! My husband had to get a loan a few years back, and it was really stressful.
Yea it was a situation where I needed an education and job. But I was able to position myself as grateful as I could and work hard to pay them back. It was very humbling.
what happened?
That's so nice that your friend is there for you.  It's good to know your family is there for you.
That is spot on advice.
That's awesome. I am learning that now too. intuition is very helpful
I'm sure it was, well have a good birthday!
Oh wow!  It's always nice when your friends throw parties for you!  What kind of party did you have?
I'm sorry you feel that way.  Do you try to hang out with other girls or do you find yourself being alone a lot?
It really does hurt.  I am so sorry that happened to you.
I bet that was a fun time for you.
I bet those were the same days when they were learning things. How did you keep it all in check?
I have never had that.
That sounds like achy-inducing. I love Chick-fil-A, but I'm not a fan of the Sunday meal. What made you want to chik-fil-a?
I've never heard of an orphanage before, did you go to the orphanage to visit?
Wow, I bet that was a very emotional moment for you
I hope so. It's hard when someone you know has a rough time and someone you don't.
My mom was a real low key enabler. My mom knew that I was struggling because I had issues with trust and was picking a fight about it. She simply told me to let her know I was okay with it. It did wear on her, however.
What did you do?
I am glad you understand your behavior. We all make mistakes, no matter how heinous they may seem to be to others. It isn't right to shame or pity those that have had to live with those consequences.
I am sorry to hear that
Great example! What sort of work do you do?
I am trying really hard to be better, but it's a lot harder when you have a boss who treats you like that
I drive an old cadillac. I feel like it's the Cadillac of cars.
Wow, it's amazing really, all that extra muscle and water weight.
Wow that's huge!  It's amazing how little our kids really know - how do they learn things like that?
Wow that is great, you must be so proud.
Wow.  Did you finish it all?
That sounds like it would be a lot of running!
Oh, man! That's so rough! I'm sorry you feel that way, though! I've been there, and I know it can be hard.
Wow, that's awful! I'm so sorry. That must be difficult.
Yeah it's really bad especially when it's aimed at one group of people.
I would be very angry to if someone was being cruel to me on a playground
I would've been so sad for you.  What did your daughter say?
I bet she is so sad. Did you apologize to her?
Oh how fun!!! Did you take them to the Haunted house?
That sounds like a really great experience. My family lives in Florida, but Disneyland is just a few hours away!
It's nice that you have a good connection to your childhood. Do you call him often?
That's great! Did you guys still spend a lot of time talking about the past?
That sounds like a lot of fun! I have no idea what kind of stuff you're talking about, but that sounds exciting. I love organizing!
I do enjoy organized living, but it's definitely more stressful than it should be. Do you have kids too?
I agree on the oddness part. Do they not read your texts?
Exactly. I have an old friend that sent me an inappropriate text yesterday. I ignored it and tried to be as helpful as possible. But of course they did not.
That sucks. Does she know it was you?
That would be a bit crazy.  How did the conversation end?
Aw, bummer. Maybe you can get your baby some cool toys from your country to play with.
I am happy that you have a good group of friends.
Absolutely! I've seen some really amazing people when they were younger, like Emmett Smith, Donnell, etc. But a lot of people just have no common sense and actually think they're not talented enough or that they're not good enough, that it's okay to be average and have your highs and low
Thanks. It's been rough.  It's hard to not overthink sometimes, and not always be able to fully reflect on your life and where you're going.
That was sweet of you, I am sure she forgave you.
It's hard to admit when your husband asks for help. I know it's easy to say no when your husband asks, but just don't tell his mom when you're busy.
That's annoying!  Did he apologize after that?
It is nice that your neighbor was nice to you.  SHe must have felt really good about himself
I totally get that. I'm working on getting rid of all the dead skin cells in my body as well.
Yes. I do a lot of volunteering at the local pool. It is so nice to be able to help others even when we ourselves don't get much accomplished.
Aww, do they grow up and become independent then?
Yes and I have three, so I totally understand the feeling! I'll probably feel the same way when I see all my old pics
im glad you married someone who knew what he she like. i hope your wedding went well
It seems like you are very confident. I'm sure your wife feels the same way.
I can imagine so. It must be tough to make a living for yourself.
Part time jobs are awesome. I have two part time jobs now and really enjoy them.
Really? Why is that?
That is great. It is nice to meet a loved one after they left a bad mark on their mark.
Oh that's nice, the ocean is beautiful
That sounds really amazing! I am jealous and hope you have a lot of fun!
That's great. Are you going to go?
That is very irritating indeed!
what ended up happening?
Oh man, I wouldn't leave my groceries outside the store! That's what they do to us when we cross our walkways!
No. What happened?
Oh man, that sucks. I hate when people are that inconsiderate.
Why did you look like a fool?
Ha ha that's funny. Well it was a good idea in the moment.
No. What happened?
What happened? It's freezing here and the wind is blowing.
Did you tell them?
I would love that
wow, thats awesome, i love jewelry, i had a wedding ring my mom gave me, and a few others i got randomly too
That sounds so sweet! What a nice surprise!
Oh yeah baby, chicks are a little tricky
Oh that is awesome. I guess you did :)
No, what happened?
You did it as a group. You guys saved the world.
What a flirt! Did you tell your friend?
Oh my goodness! I would have been so mad. Were you able to recover?
I hate that!  Our refrigerator also stops working when we lose power.  It's the worst!
That is a good way of putting it.  Things like that happen from time to time but, they can be fixed with a simple quick charge cable
Sometimes it can be hard to tell if someone is making a pass at you. Did you tell your friend about it?
It sounds like she's handling it maturely
I can imagine it being a very angry moment for both of you.
Haha that sounds like a great moment and moment to yourself!
Oh that's great. Where is the condo located?
That sounds really nice! I have never been on a vacation
Wow, she sounds determined and determined. That is awesome. I'm so proud of you guys, and I'm sure she worked really hard to get this accomplished. Sounds like a bright young lady!
That's so wonderful. You must really love her. I'm sure she'll be able to keep up with your expectations.
I agree! I always look at my carts as my personal personal grocery, and always make sure I'm ready with a cart when I park my car.
That is annoying!  carts are so much work
Wow! That must've been a surprise.
I bet that was so much fun and glad you had the fun!
Flow is wonderful! What do you do for you?
I am familiar with it.  It is interesting because we recently did some of those type of meetings at work.
Leaders are sometimes accused of taking advantage of the people around them.  It's really great that leaders are willing to listen to the concerns of others and do the right thing
leader like you?  no way
Oh wow that must have been so fun! I am glad you had such a great time!
Ha Ha. That's funny. I remember that also because the first time I learned in vitro that your baby is a girl. I had a little girl too and that made me cry lol
Aw, mothers Day has been a wonderful day for me as well! My mother's day wasn't so special but my father's day was, since he passed a few weeks ago.
That sounds amazing!  You sound like a very sentimental person!  What kind of gifts did you get?
I don't know. I'm hoping it was nothing too bad.
They did but I'm not sure what it could be. I'm hoping it's nothing too bad.
They didn't yet, but I'm thinking about ways to make things right. I think I need to go back to school.
That's awesome. I'm sure it'll all be worth it in 9 months!
Wow, that's a long time! I hope they do well and that the baby is healthy and happy!
I'm not sure what you are talking about.
I tried to watch Netflix but it was US only. I tried Now TV but it was only showing videos of people eating.
awesome, I watched the trailer and it looks good. I will have to check it out.
That sounds great!  Did it go to the whole court?
That sounds awesome. I am so happy for you.
yes, traffic always is horrible
Yea, traffic always seems to find a way to aggravate me! I'm glad it's getting better.
Grudge! I used to have that too. Did you overcome it?
I hate the grudge as well, I'm glad someone understands it
That's amazing!  I'm so proud of her!  I'm sure her husband and sister are proud of her!
That's great that she wants to help you do better.
That must have been a frustrating experience.
I hope the problem is easily fixed.
Oh, that's cute!  What kind of puppy did you end up getting?
Congratulations on getting one, they are the best! My girls had puppies, they are over 12 now.
That was really nice of them!  Did you have to move out?
That is a great thing to hear!
How long have you been independent for?
Congrats!  Why did you decide to teach?
That's pretty insane. I wonder what makes him so successful
I can see why you would be jealous.  Do you know how much medical bills are for each year?
Do you have a crystal ball?
That is exciting! What is your specialty?
Tell me what part is and what isn't!
You can report them anonymously, you know?
That's pretty cool of your friend. Did you end up staying with her that night?
That is so nice of your best friend, I bet you are excited and happy about that.
That's great!  Having kids is never a good thing, but having a bunch of pets is great for family fun and also survival.  What kind of animals do you have?
What do you mean? Do you mean toys r us? The company that is responsible for selling and installing the toys in the stores?
90s were a great time to be alive. What shows did you like?
I know right.  It is crazy to look back on the past.
I know what you mean, it's crazy how trends and stuff from that time period fly by, I'm surprised there's still people like me on this planet!
I was just a baby in the 90s. I know that was the hey- years for many people.
I totally agree with you. If I was in their shoes I would probably be the same way.
My step daughter is one. I can tell her no matter how many times I tell her the same thing.
The new one was pretty bad? I didn't notice it was bad.
That's cool. I haven't seen it yet.
How much do they take in?
Have they ever tried asking you for money for specific reasons?
Exactly! That's the worst part. It's not that hard to pick clean up after yourself when you're in charge of things.
Oh man, that would drive me crazy hahahaha
I'm sorry to hear that. How long ago was that?
That is terrible. I'm so sorry to hear about your friend.
That's a nice name!  How old is she?
That is awesome! Roxie is a great name
Wow, I can see why that would be stressful. I'm glad that you found a way to get around without a car.
Wow, that was really generous of them.
That is amazing! I'm happy for you guys
yes! I love birthdays
I have actually! It was in college and my friends planned it for me and I had to work the whole day.
that is not good, are you okay?
I bet candles are expensive.
Oh wow! How did that go?
wow, thats amazing.
Yes I have a cat, turtle, dog, and a few cats.
I have a cat, and a few dogs. Night owls are the most annoying. They literally eat anything and go through anything!
Congratulations! That is so great to hear.  What did he study?
Congrats! I know it must feel great to see your son achieve what he has achieved.
I'm sorry to hear that. How did that make you feel?
I can understand that. It must have been hard, but at least you were able to leave and come back home.
That is so cool! I wish I could manage my business like that!
Wow that is impressive indeed
That's not cool at all. I'm sure you have a good reason for it.
Eh, I think everyone has a little something they put on their neck at some point in their life. I'm sure she will forgive you.
That's awesome! You should be able to tell her exactly how you feel about it and how much you appreciate the gesture!
Oh yeah, I love going back to my childhood. I grew up in the 80s.
Yeah I understand that. I don't go back to the old ways of doing things.
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that
That is so sad.  How is he holding up?
That is sad. I loved my dog. She was my constant companion. How long did you have yours?
That's horrible! I love dogs, I rescue. What kind of dog was it?
ewww that is so gross
I wouldn't try sushi again. It may not be for you...but I wouldn't eat it again either. It is disgusting!
I would totally do that.
That is funny. Did your friend get in trouble?
Sorry to hear that. I know that must make you feel pretty alone.
That is tough.  Do you think it is worth it for him to serve his country?
It is scary, but you can do it!  Don't let it get you down.  You'll meet some cool people in your first year or so
Well it sounds like a fun adventure at least! I'm sure it will be a lot of fun
That is sad but also understanding. I hope she feels the same way.
That is sad but maybe there is a chance
That's great! Is it going well so far?
That's a really good idea! She may have expressed interest but there may be other things going on that are more important!
Mine was yesterday. I was feeling so blessed and blessed that day.
I love tequila, what is your favorite kind?
5 eh? Good - that's my favourite number!
Oh no! How did it all turn out?
that is so scary, i would be terrified
That's awful! I am glad you have someone to talk to about it.
Oh yes! That is the best feeling! Do you do it often?
I do, my husband does that all the time! But I feel so bad for the kids who don't get to have it.
That's really sweet. I'm glad to hear that
That is really sweet of her!
I'm not sure what went wrong. I've always been pretty good at saving money.
I did study hard for it. But I did miss a few notes in there. And no i did not pass. I feel cheated.
She sounds like a great person!
She is so nice I love her so much.
Oh that sucks. I hope that she realizes that and changes her mind!
Where is she originally from?
I work as a caregiver for others. It can be tough.
I do sales work, but the people that I work with are way better paid and more understanding. It can be tough getting used to
Ohhh, you're a student, too? I hope you do great!
I hear you! I hope to have more semesters like that one soon, too. Are you engineering, or something else?
What movies do you watch?
i used to be able to sleep with a hole in my underwear..now i'm terrified of everything
I like animated movies mostly.
I love scary movies. I dont know yet. I like that there arent too many horror movies out now.
Well, the good news is he is changing the way the world is. As he's president he is taking steps to make the world a better place.
I am a diehard liberal but I still find it hard to like the man.
That's awesome! What are you studying?
Awesome! I bet you can't wait to go there. Are you already an engineering major?
It's nice to have someone that treats you well. It makes you happy.
That is great. Relationships can be hit or miss sometimes.
Yeah I try to keep my favorite ones
I do like old family pictures
Oh no!  What did she do?
You must be so scared to even say such a thing. I would tell her if you need to.
An hour and a half
How long do you have to wait to see your child after they are born
That's great. I love my mother too. Why did she go?
That's good, it's nice to have people around us that care about you.
Oh no! I hope your father is doing better!
Oh my God! What caused his health problems? I hope you are able to make it through
Why are you jealous?
I am sure you will. Just stay strong!
That's wonderful. Is it a long distance relationship?
yes I have. She is a person I met through my work (a coworker) and through my own love(not an "adulthood")
That's great to hear, it's good to have a good family.
I am very close to my family. They are very kind to me as well.
Oh wow, you should've let him know before you did that.
Why did you do that?
I am so sorry! I hope you find them!
Oh man that's a good story. Did anyone else see what happened?
Congrats! It is always nice to have that feeling about life.
West Coast is awesome. What part of the USA?
Where did you go?
Oh lol! Well it's positive in a way because at least now you guys know you're healthy!
Yeah it's not always so bad.  But then again not having family around can sometimes make it hard.
I completely understand.  It is hard to not be alone sometimes.  Take this time to enjoy yourself and relax!
Wow! How much of a chance are you saying you have?
That is awesome, what are you going to do to win?
I hear you! My kids eat so much candy it's ridiculous.
That sucks. My daughter just ate a box of sugar free cookies yesterday. I think she was trying to be fussy
That must be very hard on you. Do you think you will enjoy the quiet?
Aw I'm sorry. You must feel lonely.
Oh no! Was it a young seagull?
That sounds awful!
Sorry to hear that. You must be disappointed. Have you tried to talk to your manager?
I haven't, but I have been a bit miffed by it.
Aww, that's sad. Did you find out why?
Im sorry to hear that.
Congratulations! What kind of job is it?
Congratulations, that sounds like your doing a great job.
I'm reconnecting with my baby girl right now. She is almost 6 weeks old. I'm trying to keep her as still as possible. How is your baby doing?
Congrats! You never cheat in this life. You are who you are. You never go back to the old ways unless you start to regret it. I wish you the best in your future relationships.
Hahaha, well that's good that you're happy and healthy!
I know, children are terrible! Do you have any control over him?
That's not cool, did you ask him why he did that?
Is it your turn?
Oh I have heard of her, what does that have to do with my brother being a A list supermodel? Did you say anything to him about it?
Nothing yet, you ok? Hope you have a good day.
I was about to go on maternity leave.  It was the most exciting time of my life!  My partner went into labor so unexpectedly that I didn't know what was going to happen.
That sucks. Have you tried tracking the order?
I like coffee and chocolate shakes, I get them with coffee too. I get the caramel one. But I get so annoyed when the coffee is so expensive.
Oh wow! That's awesome. I bet he is super excited. Congratulations to him!
That's great! What did you graduate in?
Oh no! I hate when that happens.
That's frustrating! Did you end up finding out what had happened to the pizza?
I always ask for extra onions and garlic bread.
McDonald's always gets my order wrong! I said no lettuce! Sometimes I think the management don't even care!
Oh my, maybe your wife should set a timer on the cookies so you don't have to eat them all at once!
Oh, no! Well, maybe she has a secret admirer.
Ugh I am sure it is no good! Do you have a hound dog or a cat?
Eww.  I have had a similar experience with dog poop.  It's awful.  It's so disgusting and it feels like you are walking around with a big, sweaty mess in your hands.  Hope you're doing okay.
I agree. How do you go about following the recipe exactly?
I do the same, but I make my own rice now.
That's awesome, I can't wait for the results!
I bet that was a surprise and a joy for you!
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Will you have to give up?
I would've sat him down and talked to him about it
what was the test
Thats really good.  I have not studied math in school beyond simple addition.
I bet that was cool.  Was he using a saw?
That is actually amazing.  How old is he?
That is not good. How did you manage to get it started?
Well at least you made it on time. Maybe they will have a recall.
That's a huge change!
Wow that is a lot of kids, you must be very proud
Oh no! That's scary! What does that mean?
Oh man that would be sick.
That is terrible. Is there any chance he might be released?
That sucks. Bahamas is a nice place to vacation. I'm sure you are happy to be in prison though.
Wow! What position will he be playing?
Great news! You must be so proud!
3 months?! that's dedication. you're braver than I am for sure
3 months is a long time to save up, I hope you have a nice surprise when he's born!
Oh gosh. Was it after you?
Oh my gosh you probably should have stayed put!
Thats right, He is the reason we got to where we are today!
Thats so sweet.  I wish i could say the same for my mom.  She always says bless you and I am just like him.
Did they call an ambulance?
Oh no! Well that's embarrassing.  I'm sure everyone laughed at you!
What is his name?
I used to love watching old videos on youtube.
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that! Losing a pet is never an easy thing.
That's terrible. Did your dog recover?
Its good to be grateful
Yes, I do not envy people who have less than me.
That is very scary! I hope everything works out. What was it that you did?
I hope you can pay her back too
That must of felt horrible.
Hula hoop physics is something we do not really know much about.
Oh my lord, that's awful! I can't imagine how hard that is for her. I hope she wasn't planning anything too advance.
Oh no! That sounds rough. I hope you two were friends.
He sounds like someone who loves what he's doing. That's awesome that he's able to support his family through hard work.
Wow, so he really did care about you. That's really something to be proud of. Sounds like a great man.
Why did he retire so much? I can't understand that.
what were the lies?
That is so selfish. I would have furious if that was me.
What happened?
She is a keeper though, are you in the US?
I feel you! I don't have to go to school anymore, and I dread the day I have to return.
It really does suck! Why didn't you want to do it? I can relate...
That's cool.  I'm in public school too.  I don't have as much trouble as some of my classmates.
Wow that is impressive.  Is public school more expensive?
I'm so sorry. It's hard to lose someone you care about.
I think they should at least give him a small nod in some way. He is still alive, right?
adapting is hard.  What changed?
That's cool, what color is the bracelet?
That is terrible. I am so sorry.
That would make me angry too
Wow. That's pretty bad. Did they find him?
That sucks.  I've never been punched in the face or anything but i've had my fair share of beatings.
Wow, congrats on that!! You must feel very accomplished
That's fantastic!  You must be very proud!  It sounds like a lot of hard work!
What type of degree do you have in math?
That is a great feeling, I bet it is running great!
Congratulations! Is it in a good neighborhood?
That is terrible! I hope she is better now!
Oh no! That's so awful! I bet you were embarrassed! How is she now?
You must feel nostalgic. What kind of music do you listen to
Thats true.   I used to listen to alot of rock n roll.
What game is it?
Wow, that is really exciting! Which game are you waiting on?
That's great! It can be very hard to get promoted!
You must have impressed them a lot, good job!
You will get there, just keep trying
Have you tried to retake the test?
You will get used to it
I'm with you. It's not safe and it feels a little dangerous. I don't know what I would do without my phone at least.
Where are you now
That changes my life for sure.  University changed my life for the better, it's a pretty big deal.
That is so awesome! I am happy for you. Will you be going back to your home town?
WHAT! How amazing would that have been. I bet you could feel him inside you.
Oh my, that must have been very scary indeed.
He will get it I am sure.
Oh, that's awful. I'm sorry to hear that but I hope that he'll get it.armed.
Oh no. I hope you didn't get too scared. You sound like you were patient and brave.
That's scary! Did you make it out okay?
Wow, congrats! Have you been working for long, if I may ask?
Congratulations! What do you do now?
I have not- do you happen to be in one right now? ;-)
Oh no! Are you ok? I have been in one before. It is terrifying, the other car starts shaking and you know you are in a car wreck.
Yes, I have.It wasn't a fun one though.
i haven't, i always had my father as my backing, i would never fight with him
I have, I loved that game
I have not, I never really got into video games. What was good about it?
No I have never been.
Nope, I haven't been. What do you think about their burgers? I do like mine a lot, but not as much as HFCS or similar.
Yes, I have. It was awful!
Wow that must have been terrifying
Yes, at a very amusement park.
I haven't rode one.  But I've always wanted to!  They sound so fun.  Are they hard to ride?
That is disappointing. Why did you turn him down?
Wow. What did you do then? Did you tell your husband?
Where are you going?
Wow. I have always wanted to go to the moon.
That is great. How is she finding a new job?
She sounds like a keeper. What kind of a job is it?
that is sad
That's awesome. I love puppies! What kind was it?
Oh wow! I love puppies! That is a special occasion then.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds unfortunate, but I'm glad you took the positive route.
That is awesome! I am glad that you were confident.
Oh that sucks! What was the Longhorn steakhouse like?
I'm happy she made it up to you.  It's annoying when someone else makes the decision to make the decision for you.
Me too! Do you have any plans for the weekend?
Oh I know what you mean! It's been a long week already and I feel you on the mom part! I used to have to sleep in during the summer and now I just watch stuff on the computer all day long.
That's terrible. Why did you have to cancel?
Oh no, I can only imagine how that would be. I hate being afraid to go on a trip.
home? You should have went straight home!
That is rough.  Were you close to them?
i can imagine
Rainy days are perfect for beaches.
Nice! It's been raining here and there a few times in the past couple years but nothing like when we got here. It's been a long time since we had a hurricane hit where we live (2002). Glad you got to go though.
That's sounds fun! What did she end up planning?
Wow! That sounds like an amazing time! Was it your birthday?
Why did you steal the shirt?  Did he notice?
Oh well, shirts are expensive.
Why is that?  Did you enjoy the time with her?
I bet you will be better by the end of the week
Aw I'm sorry to hear that. I love animals, and I know how hard it can be to lose them!
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you'll find a new place that will!
What were some of the things she got you?  Did you get anything cool?
She sounds like a great person! I bet you really appreciated it.
That sounds amazing! I would have died if I tried that ride.
I would have cried!
That must of been awkward.
That would be so frustrating. Did you ask to go home?
That is weird.  My cat randomly used to pee on my bed sometimes.  It was a bad time
I know right. I don't even have a dog but i feel you.
That's amazing. Congratulations
Congratulations! It seems like such a long tedious process. What was your major?
Oh my gosh, that is so shocking! How did you react?
Wow, that sounds rough. I hope you guys are better now.
That sounds terrifying!  I've never been able to do a wheelie on a bike.  I always feel like someone is going to get seriously injured or totaled if I do.  I don't know anyone who can do it.
oh my gosh that is scary,  I rode a dirtbike for a bit and i could not do that.  then i learned to ride a street bike
Oh my goodness, that must have been traumatic. What pet did you have at that time?
aww.. thats so sweet of you. I bet your relieved and happy.
Oh no! That's terrible. Did you take him outside?
Oh wow, that is pretty brutal. Glad to hear it didn't damage anything
Sometimes, especially in a situation like this, it's difficult to be direct with your feelings. I think you're doing a great job of distancing yourself from your mom's negativity!
It's normal to be angry or to say some rude things when angry or guilty. I am sure you will make it up to her.
That sounds like a lot of fun. I hope you didn't get too tan.
I'm glad you got to spend some time outdoors. Sounds like you had a wonderful day!
I agree, I just wish people would take more time to enjoy it.
I don't think people really notice what they don't know.
Yea. I get it. It's hard to trust people these days.
Sometimes people have a hard time taking personal time. It's better to just stay angry.
Tornadoes are definitely scary. As a grown man, I've had a fear of them.
Yeah there is a tornado in my area all the time.  I get scared too
That's the worst. I know it's so easy to deal with a tornado, you just have to prepare like crazy. But it's so hard to NOT be afraid and just want it.
Sometimes kids have no real world experience and it's easy to be frustrated. We just have to accept it and move on
I have found that talking to kids rewires the brain. They have so many emotions and you can just feel them going on for forever
Wow where were you going
Wow that's so exciting! where to?
What was it that you had in mind when you made your gift?
I bet it is!   What kind of phone was it and what made you so grateful for it?
What kind of phone is it?
That is so wonderful! I bet he loves you much.
That is an amazing job! I am happy for you!
have you gone to the opticians?
I can relate. I have trouble seeing under the lights. It's no fun.
I know right? I guess they didn't have any time to prepare.
That sounds so frustrating. I can't wait until the grocery store is more organized.
Oh no.  Maybe you can find something else to do until he calms down.
I can imagine, that must've been frustrating for both of you
Me too! They are the best.  Do you get to see them much?
Oh no, that's a tough one! My mom and uncle love working the computers at their jobs. They love to show off their latest projects. Do you get to see your own kids during the summer?
That is great when they are young and learn things. I wish mine were still babies.
I'm sure they'll be fine.  I had a 4 year old son who was just fine when he first started school.
That's really great. It feels good to be financially independent!
That is wonderful!  Congrats!  It can feel relieving when you accomplish a great goal!
Oh wow that sounds like a real test! Did you pass?
That's awesome. What bar exam are you taking?
wow, that must have been a pleasant surprise!!
That's a bummer, but congratulations on the awesome baby.
That's hurtful. How did he react?
Sometimes husbands can be way too serious sometimes, and it can leave their wives feeling like they don't matter since they are the ones being treated better.
Did an accident happen to you?
Driving is never easy for anyone! I'm sorry to hear about your dad. Was it an expensive accident?
How long do you think it will take you to get the plants ready for sale?
thats awesome! is it easy to keep them alive?
That's cool. Do they eat other plants too?
Yeah it's pretty awful. You ever ride the HOV?
That sounds horrible! Are you in a bad part of town?
That sounds like a really cool experience. Did you guys play video games for a long time?
Through an online video game? That is crazy! How did you meet them?
That's a good thing to care for.
Everyone is welcome, even me. It is good to care for others.
Wow. How did it happen?
Wow that's rare. Do you have anything substantial to talk about that you want to keep talking to her?
That is great news. It is always a bonus to have a good husband who is hardworking.
Wow that is awesome!
Oh no I hope you took off asap
That must be so frustrating
why is that exactly
You are lucky to have him!
yes that is very annoying. Did something happen?
Yeah, it is crazy! Especially if they are near other people's belongings.
thats awesome, what is making you so happy?
That sounds wonderful! I love working at home. I can spend hours making food!
That's so great. You are so lucky.
Wow! What did you get them too?
You must have been very surprised! I hope you had fun at the party.
Why is that?
Oh I know what you mean! It's so disheartening when you remember all that stuff. I hope she didn't make you feel bad!
That's cool!  What do you like about it?
That is cool! I like that it is so cheap to live here. Plus I'm not far from my family. That is really cool. What did you do there?
Congrats! That is awesome. I went to college for a few years, but graduated not too long ago. It's a lot of change, I know.
Congrats! That is so exciting. What is your degree in?
I feel you. I have to cover my from that whenever I see it.
Oh no! Was he okay?
Oh my god! Did you ask him why he did that?
Did you get it on camera?
That's great! I love queso, what is it like in person?
Qdoba is awesome. It's like a Mexican version of Disneyland. I hope your mother in law is a queso girl.
That's so cool! I bet you were proud.
That must have made you feel very proud.
That is good.  Has he done anything to surprise you?
Wow. You must be very proud of him!
Three goals in a game? You must be pretty happy, how old is he?
That is so cool, you are his role model!
That's terrible! Did you try to be more discrete about it, or did you just end up giving off a generic punchline punchline?
That's okay, next time try to tell it in a more exciting way like, "This isn't something you hear everyday!". That way you are more likely to remember it and laugh along.
That's pretty cool.  Has she taught you a lot of German?
That's a good idea. Maybe you can invite one of your neighbors to go with you.
Oh, that is so nice. I love flowers, what did you plant?
That is nice. What did he give you?
that's pretty annoying, what do you think you can do about it?
That is too bad, did she get it taken care of?
Oh goodness, that must have been embarrassing.  Were you able to recover?
That is a little scary. I am glad your husband is okay! What happened?
That sounds so sweet
That sounds fun. You must miss the good old days when life was simple.
I am sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear it, I lost both of mine recently.
Thats really impressive, Did you get the job?
I bet it is. Did you get any good news from them?
Oh no, that doesn't seem very nice! scolding is very bad!
Sounds like a tough situation. Hopefully she grows out of it.
That is great.  Do you prepare frequently?
wow sounds good
thats great! paying your bills is the most important thing
Congratulations! What did you get done?
That's so great. I love angels
It is good to have people around you that you can count.
That is harsh, I hope he learned his lesson.
Atleast you tried. That is a good sign
What do you do now?
That's the worst. Everyone has to deal with that.
That's awesome. Did you get the job?
Awesome! What industry do you work in?
Wow that is a wonderful find! I bet you were super happy!
That's a real shame! I'm sure it was a sentimental item for a lot of people.
Yeah, I remember going through all that. Now my kids are off to college and it's all different.
Right now my kid just wears flip-flops all the time. I wish we had a time machine.
Oh that's so kind of you! I am sure he appreciated it!
Poor thing! I'm glad you were able to bring Alphy back to health
Yeah, I can relate. It can be very tough, but as a child you learn to handle it maturely.
Yeah teenagers can really get crazy and make really crazy decisions, but once they get older they realize they need no help from anyone
Wow. Congratulations.You must be so happy
Congratulations. That's awesome.
oof thats a tough move to make.
Ouch!  I hope he feels better!  I'm sorry you're having to deal with that.
Its okay, she'll get over it in a few days. It happens
No give it to her, but give her some chocolate coins instead.
Oh that is horrible! What did you do?
Yeah that's the worst!  I don't understand why people can't just be honest
Wow, that will be really nice! I've never been on a cruise before.
I am sure you will be fine!  It is too hot for winter vacation.
Beauty is something which everyone desires
You are so sweet.
Dogs can absolutely get agressive.  It is terrifying to watch!
Oh my goodness, what sort of dog was it?
That's so sad! I have two cats and they are both expirience cats so I know what it's like to be alone a lot!
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I lost my brother to cancer about 10 years ago.  It gets easier.
wow thats good news, new people is always a good outcome
oh wow that is good news, good for you guys
That's terrible. Did you find it?
Oh I'm so sorry! I have lost things before and I know how it feels. I hope you feel better soon!
Did you receive it?
Well done to you. What sort of award may I ask?
Thank you so much! I agree, I am really excited and anxious to start.
Thank you. I am trying hard to be optimistic.
Sometimes you just have to shake it off! I am sure you did great though.
Oh yeah, I've had plenty! I just don't like the feeling of it and the fact you have to prepare for it!
That's very true. Some parents just don't realize it's not a good idea to punish their children for no reason.
Aw that's awful. I can relate to that. I have a partner who is the same way. I wish I could help her clean but I don't have the energy.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried asking around and finding people that do hear you?
Maybe try and practice in a public place? That could help.
That is sad, maybe you can take her out to ice cream to unwind with.
Teenagers don't know how to have fun, lol.
where are you going?
National parks are always a fun time! I love driving past them in the summer
That's disgusting. I hope she didn't get hurt.
Ewww. I hope she didn't get spooked by the wetness or get hurt.
That sounds wonderful! I am so jealous I do not have a cat
That sounds nice.  Do you feel better now that you're comfie?
Interviews can be nerve wrecking. Were you nervous before the interview?
I hate the person interviewing you, but the person themselves must have been really nervous!
That is good to hear
That's good. It's important to have trust in a relationship.
thank you who are you thanking
thank you what
What did you say for me to thank you?
Thank you for nothing
That is wonderful.
I'm so glad! What's your favorite part of the garden?
Mistakes? What happened?
Wow. You have to go to the place and speak to them.
That's very annoying when the service provider doesn't have it.
Oh no! What happened?
Oh I know what you mean... What happened? Were you shopping at a store where they don't serve meat?
What did you do?
Good.You are a representation of the state of our union.
That is sad. Where did she go?
That is true,  sometimes vacations are needed to get us all through the day.
What's your favorite take out?
I bet it will! What is your favorite cuisine to eat there?
That sounds nice. I wish I had a swimming pool.
That is quite unique. I am happy for you!
That sounds amazing! Where was it at? Was it your whole family?
That is crazy, I would have thought that after a long day, your husband would want to throw you a party.
That is a long time. Do you have any plans for the weekend?
That's really nice. I've been thinking about my mom going back to school.
I'm sorry to hear that. How did you lose her?
I am truly sorry for your loss.  I lost both of mine - my father and my cousin.  It is an awful thing.
Oh wow! I'm guessing you had a giant shock. How are you coping with the shock?
A boy is awesome! Congratulations on the new boy!
That is good, I am glad you still love her like that
I can respect that. It's hard to remain loyal in an environment you're in. It takes a strong person to say that.
thats cool
What kind of truck is it?
Oh yeah? What do you have planned?
Good for you! I am glad that you feel that way.
That's a bummer. I hope she gets better soon.
That sucks. Is she feeling better?
That must be a relief. It is always so disheartening to see something you don't understand and then realize it's God.
Wow, what a beautiful tree you saw! I'm glad that you're thankful for His creation.
Wow, she sings wonderful, I must say. How old is she?
Wow, she is talented! She must have been very proud of herself.
That is okay. Everyone comes through tough times.
Oh, that is a tough situation. I know how hard it is to lose a loved one, and I know how hard it is to lose someone you love! I went through that myself recently, so I know how it feels.
That is always a great feeling.  What job did you apply for?
That's pretty neat. I'm sure you'll land something soon.
That's too bad. Maybe you could facetime or video chat through the phone?
Aww, that's sad. Maybe go out and have fun doing something you both enjoy together?
That's so sad! How old are you currently, and what happened?
Oh no!  That is awful.  I'm sorry you feel bad!
That isn't healthy but okay!
Hey, you can always start again tomorrow!
That's great news!  I bet he is really looking forward to the new job.
I feel sorry for you. I am sure he appreciates you.
Oh no!  That must of been annoying.  Did you try to talk to her?
That must have been really annoying.
Maybe you should have kept it.
Maybe you should go to a store and try to find it?
Wow you must be excited. Who did you see and where is the fun?
That's so exciting! I see you have a lot of growing up ahead of you.
Oh wow! That must've been a pretty crazy and nerve racking time!
It's hard when you have to leave so early. I bet she was so happy!
That's too bad. Maybe they were up too early.
That's annoying. I think some of our neighbors are just getting on our nerves.
That would not be fun, i can imagine how that would have felt!
I would have laughed so hard at that.
I am sorry, why did she leave you alone?
That is boring! I would be bored too!
That is so true.
Wow I bet that is an interesting process of self assimilation. I'm impressed that you managed to do that.
I have heard that about myself before.  It is sometimes difficult to get your footing when you feel like you have been taken over.
That's really deep.
I am so sorry. I recently just had a son and have went through the same thing.
I'm really sorry to hear that. That's one of the most heart wrenching things that can happen in life. I can't imagine what you're going through right now.
why you moving? is it because you hate the weather?
I moved from Florida to Indiana and it wasn't all that bad. You just have to be prepared for the weather.
Wow, that sounds wonderful!  Do you feel like you are on a new journey?
That's great that you have people to do that for you.
I'm sorry to hear that, I know how you feel I'm almost completely single too
You could always try joining some clubs or finding a hobby. Or you could just make some new friends!
Where did she go?
Ah yes, that is a long time to be without her! I hope you guys enjoy your time together!
Sounds great, long vacas are amazing!  Where are you going?
Thats sounds fun! I have never been to the Ozarks before
Did the wedding go well at least?
Wow, that is weird. I am sorry, but maybe it was her who ignored you
Free pizza tastes good
That was very nice of her! You are lucky.
It was okay. I think it was a good day overall.
My name is : Chris. What about you?
It went pretty well. How about yours?
Oh yeah? What made it great, if you don't mind me asking?
I would've wanted the shoe to be able to match too, since they're not supposed to be worn with pride. But that's funny that you had that opportunity to shoehorn in a fun inside joke. But I can totally understand why you'd want to hide it. It's a good story!
That is awkward. But, I'm sure everyone understood your predicament and decided to just have faith that you were wearing the right socks.
How did it go then?
I hope you get it then
That sounds difficult. Do you stay in contact with them?
That sounds hard. I moved around a lot in college.  Are you better now?
wow! that must have been a trip for sure.
wow thats a long move.
What did you fight about?
Wow! Did you call the police? What did they do?
I hope you weren't hurt.
I've been on a few boat accidents.  I'm glad to hear it wasn't an accident and that you returned the favor
Adult lives are boring
Yeah, I understand that. I think a lot of people wish that was not the case, but I guess we all know that it is true and that there will always be new experiences. It will happen to you, though.
I am glad you were not alone! Sounds like a crazy night!
Did you call your friend and ask if they were okay?
Oh, good luck! Are you pretty confident you got the job?
That's awesome. I hope it works out.
Haha oh man that's embarrassing. Were you able to change the picture after?
Haha I have no idea what the heck did you do, but hey it's ok at least your honest mistake was made!
Yeah me too. It's not like they haven't done the right thing so far.
The police here in town don't do much actually. They are too scared to do anything.
Did you study a lot for it?
That is great that you were stress testing your health!  I hope you did fine!!
I'm happy to here that! flood of good memories are the best
I love when I am in the mood for some good old fashioned childhood memories.
That is nice. You must have been so happy and relieved.
It's nice that they were so kind to you. You must have put a lot of credit hours into your education.
That is a great attitude to have. I wish I felt that way.
That's so true. I deal with so many ills, and the good news is I get through them all.
Oh I hate when that happens. It seems like everything always goes our way.
That is terrible, my friend.
I understand.  I think we all get jealous sometimes.
I understand. I am happy that I can look forward to work more. Thank you
Why is he at work?
That's funny though. You gave him a home.
Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.
Stealing from who?
Oh no! I hope you find him!
I hate to hear that, that must've been terrible.
That will be great to see!  What is she going to be studying?
What an exciting time! I am happy for you and your niece
Oh wow, 6 months to 6 months! That is a long time!
A cardiologist.
I am very proud. It took me a year and a half to get here.
It's great when someone turns their life around for once.  My mom is still in nursing school.
oh wow thats always so sad
That is very sad.  I am sorry.  I have been there.
That is awful. I hope everyone is okay.
That was very nice of your neighbor.
What did they do to get so famous?
I think people get fame for what they do, I think if you're truly grateful then all the better
i agree i hate to be by myself all the time
I believe that, back then money was so hard to find. It's almost as if we've forgotten what it's like to be young and free
That's scary!  Did they take anything important?
I hope you had someone come in and check on your toilet.
Wow. That stinks. You should get some security cameras.
Oh no! That is terrible. Did you get a police report?
That's too bad. Maybe you will get another chance?
Sorry to hear that. Did you have any interviews lined up?
Oh no! I hope they are not torn
That's so sad! I hope you weren't too embarrassed.
Ugh. Have you tried pulling her out?
I know what you mean! I have a severe anxiety too but luckily I have a cat that is very sweet!
Cool! Where are you going?
Wow, that's exciting. I've never been to Sulu. I hope you guys have a good time!
Oh man. That's one of those things that can really suck.
Wow that's really gross. Was your friend upset with you?
That is awesome! what was the prize?
Congratulations! How much was it for?
That's annoying. Can you report him?
Yes that is annoying. I can understand that. It is quite rude of them.
oh my goodness that is amazing. what was in it?
Oh no, what was it?
That sounds so sad. Were you okay?
That's really good advice.  Don't worry about what other people think. If they laughed at you, that means they think you're lame!
That is nice. Who was your friend?
wow that sounds like a good time
That is crazy!  How did it get so big?
I've never seen that before!
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you guys reschedule?
It stinks that you had to lay it out like that. Hopefully something better will come up soon.
that is a very stressful situation i am afraid to even mention. but i hope everything turns out well
Well I hope that it works out for you!
Don't we all...
Yes, suffering is part of life. We must always try to improve.
What kind of tasks are they doing?
Sorry to hear that, Why couldn't you move?
Oh no that is horrible! Are you able to find another job?
Oh no! I'm really sorry to hear that. That sounds stressful
That's a good thing. A lot of people cheat and hurt.
I do. I have had lots of bad relationships in my life. I know that it will be better for me in the long run.
Aw that's sweet - sounds like you guys are a very close knit family.
Great friends help us in tough times, thank God she is one!
That is cool. Did you try to do it too?
Wow that is impressive! How old is he?
That's cool man. What did you do?
I totally get you. I have a very strict and unforgiving family. Even though it's hard for me to socialize sometimes, it's good I have people I can trust to be helpful.
I feel you. My baby is teething too. I have a necklace that he wears for luck. It helps.
That's so sad. I hope he feels better soon!
Oh no that's awful!  What did you do?
That's scary! I hope they don't fight anymore!
LOL! Well, at least it sounds like you're making some good progress :) At least you've got a dog! My kids used to always make fun of me for training them.
Oh yes rescue is a hard one, but so rewarding!
Oh no that's terrible. Is he better now?
That's good to hear!  I hate when animals that have an allergic reaction get put up for loans.  What kind of dog do you have?
Sometimes.  I used to love going to water parks.  Lots of kids and animals.
Yeah i once saw a humming bird fly into my window when I tried to kick it with my window
I'm glad to hear it, how long did it take you to prepare?
That would be so exciting! I'm sure you did great!
Yes. It is a very tough process.
I have not had to do that so much in life, but my sister in law had to do it for our 6 year old son. It is really tough.
Uh oh. Kid's will do everything annoying. What about you?
Haha yeah, kids can be annoying sometimes. I guess kids just like to be in the moment.
What are you helping them with?
That is very nice of you. I hope she gets better fast
Did you take it again?
That is good, you must of studied hard for that test!
Oh my god. I hate rats, so that made me want to vomit. I don't even like seafood, but I wouldn't eat there. What was wrong with you?!
Oh wow. I would report it too. rats are gross.
yes some do cheerleading
I don't have any kids but I wish I did! skateboarding sounds like fun.
Oh no! That must have been embarrassing!
Oh no, did they laugh at you?
That stinks, did you get your money?
That is terrible. I hope there are not more like that in the future.
Puppies are so much fun!  What did you get?
It's always awesome when you get a pet or a puppy! What kind of puppy did you get?
I know what you mean. Life gets so busy and fast.
I feel you. I was in a same situation when I first started college.
That's awesome! I never win anything, I'm sorry. But that was a great feeling for sure!
That's amazing! I bet that was a really cool experience for you. I bet you were really proud of your self- creation.
That's awful. I had a baby who slept in her crib too. It can be hard at first but then it's rewarding.
Aw that's so sweet! SHe's a hard worker! How old is he?
That sounds amazing.  I've always wanted to go to a condo beach!
That sounds amazing. I hope I get the chance to go one day.
That is very true and I can relate. It is crazy how quickly time fly's by
Yes, I remember waking up my 5 year old as well. He was a very happy little guy!
Awwwww, I'm sorry.  Why can't you go?
That really sucks. Maybe you should ask him for a pay bump?
That is such a wonderful feeling.  Does he have a college in mind?
Wow! Congratulations to him! I bet he will do great things
I bet that was a relief. How old is your son?
I do not. That's so great you are taking care of him though. It's easy to take care of a sick pet but it's even harder to take care of a parent who isn't healthy.
Did you find anything cool?
Oh I love those things! I got some temporary bubblegum for Christmas!
Congratulations, thats amazing
That's awesome! I'm glad she's following her dreams
Oh no, I would be so mad at the rat
oh god that's horrible, poor baby. hopefully it wasn't a rotted rat?
That's great to hear.  I'm glad that she was okay.  Is everything okay now?
It must have been quite an ordeal. Glad she is better!
Oh no, did it run away?
That's sad, but maybe the cat was hungry and needed some food.
Oh no! That sounds scary! I hate when that happens. Were you able to find a way back home?
That sounds pretty scary! I am glad you made it out safe.
Well that's nice of you to be supportive to your partner.
Ok then, you seem to have done the right thing.
Who was she?
That's really tough on you. Did you call and tell your friend?
I do not blame you one bit. I have had so many vacations, and I know how hard it can be especially when you are working two jobs constantly.
Awww, why is that?
3 months? Wow.. thats a long time to be waiting.
Great for you. How do you like it so far?
Wow that sounds awesome, I have never tried the diet, I just follow the recipes and stick to it.
A boy what?
Hahaha you must feel so surprised! What did the baby look like?
Oh wow. Congratulations.
Oh no, that sounds like a stressful time, but I'm sure there will be cake.
Hey! Congratulations! That's a huge accomplishment! What are you studying?
That is great! I dropped out 5 years ago and have since gotten a 2.0
I'm sorry to hear that. I know how that can feel.  How did you do it?
wow thats amazing!  i wish i could do something like that
Did you have to drink the whole gallon of milk?
I never liked milk growing up either. I tried skim and it was gross to me too.
Whole milk? Why would you do that
That's great!  What made you change your mind?  What made you decide you couldn't bring a family of four?
That does sound like a tough one.
Yeah I hate driving in rain or on busy days.
That sucks. Did you break up with him?
I am sorry, thats tough
That sounds awful! How did you deal with it?
Oh man, did you have any issues getting to the other end of the toll road?
oh thats so nice of him.
Oh man, that is a good way to surprise someone! I would be so shocked if I forgot too.
Really?
Wow! Did she say anything after?
Cave found me too! What is it?
Wow, that must have taken some courage! Did you tell her?
I can imagine! I'm happy for you, and I hope everything goes as planned
Wow that sounds like a really exciting time.  How far in advance did you have to go to find out?
Oh no, that must have been a very anxious time for you.
congratulations, that is great news
That is terrible. Losing a pet is so hard
I am so sorry to hear about your dog.  I know how hard that can be for anyone.  What was her name?
That sounds uncomfortable
Oh wow, thats a strange situation. How did you sit?
That's really great that you're supporting him financially. I remember when my son went to college and barely made enough to pay for his fees.
It is hard for some to put aside what they can and do what they can, that's for sure. But it is so good you have a plan in place to help out.
That sounds so fun.  The neighborhood you live in has a lot of dogs too.  Did you go often?
It is so good to hear someone who has had a pet who has become a hermit.  You are making a good point, there are not many people who have had a pet as a hermit
Why is that?
Oh I am glad you feel better, adventure is always good
That's great man I wish I had your success.
It definitely can impact. I am on a diet myself.
Cool. Did you buy it somewhere else?
Wow, that's disappointing. I would hate for my friend to get such a great dressed-up dress and not you. Maybe you can go next time!
Me too, I love playing retro games from the 90s. What are some of your favorites?
I still have all my old games. My son just picked out the ones he liked and put them in his cart.
That sounds scary, what was it?
Oh my goodness! I bet that was terrifying, and made you think for sure you had seen a ghost.
That is awesome, what kind of art does she like to create?
That's amazing! I wish my parents had natural gifts like that.
Nothing! I'm just excited to get out of the house, have some fun, and relax on the couch.
I think it might have gone wrong at the source!
That is so caring of you!
Aww!  How sweet.  How old was she?
Wow. How far did she travel?
6 months isn't really that bad.
Oh wow that sounds scary! I live near the coast and we have twisters all the time. Was your house okay?
Oh that must've been pretty frightening! Glad you and your family were okay!
That is amazing! I'm happy to hear that! I'm a few years older than him, so I've got some siblings that I've been wanting to get married. Congratulations to him!
thats great
I love car shopping! What kind are you getting?
What makes you want a Toyota in the first place?
Well that's a good thing right? lol. I think you're doing a great job though! You're inspiring me.
I am sure the baby will be fine
Oh no! Can't you just ask him to pick it up at a store?
Yeah it is! I mean, I order from amazon and they give me an additional 10 dollars discount because of the us shipping costs
Where did she take you?
What is a trap?
Wow that's a long time
Oh no that's terrible. What did you do?
What was the lie?
That is terrible! Why was she so stupid?
What made her not like it?
I'm sorry, I guess you learn to love yourself before others
That's great. traveling is the best form of travel.
Congrats for traveling alone. Where did you go?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is he feeling any better?
Oh no. Was your boss upset with you?
Oh, man. I know how that goes.  My husband and I have been together for 10 years.  She still has her ways to take care of me.
Why? You don't have any?
Oh really? Why was she wanting to do it?
Yeah, but she could have done something else instead of being so rash.
That is a very important step in life.
That's a very responsible attitude, good luck!
What didn't come out?
What was the secret?
what was?
Oh no! That is terrible. I hope you didn't sweat too hard while you were sick.
Homeless people stink.
Have you talked to her about it?
Yeah that sounds really bad. Have you told her about it yet?
I am sorry to hear about your loss. Do you have friends and family that you can talk to to try and support you through this difficult time?
sorry to hear that.. i have two dads and have been through a lot
That is really cool! I am happy for your daughter
You should be. That is an artform
I can understand. Lying to a parent can leave you vulnerable.
What had you lied about?
Me too. That's probably the best feeling.
Oh I totally understand. I always worry if I'm not careful I will end up stepping on someone's toe!
That sounds awesome honestly, I wouldn't cheat on mine either.
So, how did it go?
oh no. I am so sorry! Are you alright?
I'm sorry, it's hard to lose a pet.
wow! that must have been frightening
Oh man that sounds terrifying! Was he speeding or was it some other kind of accident?
Sorry?
What was that?
I can imagine, but it will be worth it!
That's a pretty tough exam. I hope you do well.
I am sorry to hear that. hurt is a strong word. what happened?
That really sucks. I hope you feel better.
That must have been embarrassing.
Oh man that is the worst. I hope you didn't get embarassed in front of your boss.
That's so exciting!  When is he coming and for how long?
I love grandpa.
I hate when things from my past happen. I know how you feel. Was it at least a fast food place?
Don't eat it then!
It was okay. I tired but otherwise okay
What was the good news?
What's wrong with the weather?
That's awful! Did they get hurt?
That really sucks. Did they see you?
That is good, do you have a girlfriend?
That's really cool! Trust is so important in a relationship.
Oh no, I hope it's not too bad. Get some rest.
Good luck! I hope you do well on it!
That sounds like a lot of fun! I love animals!
I would love that! I have always wanted an exhuast of a hippo!
That's terrible.  What are they going to do?
I don't know, I don't have any experience with animals. But I would definitely try to get them to say something.
That's good.
Oh cool! I bet that is a lot of work!
yes, but it will be worth it in the end
It sure is! How many kids do you have?
What kind of races do you watch?
Cool. Are you a big fan of watching races?
About what/
Congratulations! That's a good feeling I'm sure.
That is good, did you get a good deal?
Audis are nice cars. What model?
Congratulations! What kind?
That was very kind of her. I'm glad you got a new one.
Congratulations. You should be proud
That is great! What is the job?
How do you think you did?
Ahhh I see. Well I hope you get at least a A at least!
That is terrible.  Do you want to talk about it?
I'm really not sure how that would make you feel. Can you elaborate?
I'm so sorry to hear about your Mom. That must have been hard, but I hope you were there to care for her.
That's terrible. I hope you were able to visit her.
thats gross
Yuck. I hate when I smell or taste anything with odour.
That sounds wonderful! I love coming back to old memories like that!
Yes, I have some great memories of them. I grew up in the city. My grandparents lived near Stillwater, OK.
Oh that must have brought back memories.
That must have been a trip down memory lane. It's always nice to look back.
Oh wow I can't imagine. Did you get to stay in a hotel or stay at the beach?
That's good to here. I was pretty lucky to not lose anything
Oh, no! What happened? Was it a routine check up or something more serious?
Oh no, I hope it went okay!
That's amazing!  Is the tree house big?
I haven't built one before.  I'm not really a builder but I had a friend who had a bunch of trees for her garden.
That's too bad. What happened?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that
Wow!  I wonder how they did it?  It must have been a lot of talking?
Yeah, I know what you mean. Sometimes you just gotta be patient.
Yeah thats awful. I dont see how thats possible if he was just acting nice.
I am sure you will do great! What is it on?
Good luck. I know you have it.
How fun!  How long will you be staying for?
I've never been to the ocean. It seems like so much fun! Why are you going with your wife?
That sounds wonderful!
That's a sweet surprise!
No, I don't think I know what you mean.
I do remember those, did you find it again?
Why were you late getting them?
Oh my, I hope you didn't get hurt.
Who is he seeing?
I'm not sure how to approach this issue, but please tell me what he's going to do to make sure that doesn't happen.
Does she just seem to have a lot of sibling envy?
I think you should just tell them that you feel bad. I mean, you could just buy a puppy, but you know...
That's great. What finally convinced him?
That's wonderful! What does he do?
That's so sad.  Baby's cry for a lot longer when they're nervous than a grown man.
That's really sweet of you. Baby's need some company during this tough time of year.
Good for you. Loyalty is very important in a workplace.
That's a substantial pay raise. Your employer should be proud of you!
That's great! What is it from?
That is great.  My grandmother sent me a card once as a gift too.  I loved it.  Is she still alive?
Wow, that's some real faith you have in your family. Did the house get any damage?
i live in south texas and there arent any tornadoes here either
That sounds so relaxing! I love relaxing moments when you are working on a garden. I'm glad you got some plants to do that!
wow, thats interesting
Sounds like a plan. What's the plan?
Wow that's nice. She sounds like a keeper
Wow that's awesome! I bet she is thrilled
It's okay to admit when you were wrong about something.
Well, you did the right thing. Everyone likes a good headache, so it's a good decision to avoid lying.
That's funny that you say that. I had the same thing with Spanish food for lunch once. You have no idea how bad the food really is until you open it lol
Hahaha, I've been there before!  It is pretty bad when your coworkers give you the silent treatment
That is terrible. I am glad they did though!
I am sure it will be ok.
Hey as long as you're happy... I'm not supposed to know! But yeah that must have been a steal! What brand is it?
Maybe you can sell it on Craigslists.
That would be frustrating. Have you tried talking to her about it?
Exactly! I'd rather go to a restaurant that makes me happy than spend hours going there just to eat. Why can't you pick your own favorites?
That sounds great! Did you just spend some quality time together?
Good for you. Do you have plans for the future?
Congratulations on the successful courses
Wow! Well done! I finish one class every few months so I can relate to your situation. I finish one class and am halfway done. It is hard not to feel cheated when things are as they seem.
That is awesome.  I know the feeling.  It is always nice to be able to have a roof over your head.
That's awesome to hear. I am trying to move to a better place myself.
That's really sweet of them, what did you do to make them scold you?
I hope so too. suffering is never good
O no I hope you made it out okay!
That sounds scary!
I have lupus too. Its horrible.
Oh that's horrible I hope you can get some help soon.
I'm so sorry. How long have you been separated?
I am so sorry to hear that. That is so sad.
That sounds awful!
That is terrible! I hope you got it fixed!
I'm so sorry. That must have been so hard on you.
Oh, no. That can be stressful I know. I am sorry to hear that
Haha.  She may not realize the crazy of it, but sometimes things are just not meant to be!
Haha I guess if you asked nicely you could probably make it up to her?
I guess if you have a few million dollar bank account, you can afford to yell at people who don't have any?
Maybe just putting a little message on the wall would be enough, and maybe some nice flowers or something to say thank you.
Oh no, I hope everything goes well!
Wow, I am so glad you will be seeing him soon, I know he will do a great job.
My leg stopped working fully and I had to have surgery in addition to that to fix it. I am optimistic but it is very worrisome
I feel your pain.. i have two girls that are over 8 and have had issues with them since they were little. The older one is obsessive and the younger one is obsessive with her phone
Wow, that's pretty mild for an August.  It's over 100 here already.
Sounds like a great plan. What's your favorite grass type?
You should try listening to some audiobooks.
You totally do need more life experience, but it is good to have some rough times in life to test your limits.
What movies do you watch?
I love Harry Potter! I was a big fan growing up.
I have seen all those and I love them!
Yeah, the internet sure is a thing of beauty.
That's great. I hope it was a good feeling.
I love Dairy Queen. I'm happy for you.
I love Dairy Queen! Did you guys go there often when you were kids?
Most people I know have jobs now. So many opportunities and things to do. I wonder how work will change in 20 years from now.
It's good to be kind. What kind of things are you doing for others?
That is a great feeling, right? It's good to know that other people are trying to do the right thing for themselves and help out their towns.
Was it raining?
I am glad that you didn't get injured.
lol that's funny.  I've done that
That is terrible.  It happens all the time in the gym.
Congratulations! That is awesome. I am so proud of you.
Sheeeeit that's awesome! I know how much that stinks, but it makes it that much sweeter when it's unexpected.
I have been there, its terrible. You should complain to HR.
Thank you. I just moved to a new city and I have no friends here.
wow that was really nice of them, what bank is it?
That was really nice of them, I am glad you were not charged for it
Congrats! What do you do?
That is a great gift card. What kind of restaurant do you go to?
Well that's great. What restaurant?
Oh no. Maybe he'll appreciate them more than you know
That's funny! I love it when my kids do that. You know your actions have consequences, because consequences will always be the same.
I'm sure he'll appreciate it. You sound like a great parent!
Hahaha, that's funny! I was just telling my mom that the other day, she was like, "Wow, you're so lucky you weren't born with 20 brain tumors."
Aw, that's a cute mistake. Did your son notice?
That's so thoughtful! I hope he makes a good dinner!
Aw, that's cute. Do you always get stuff your self or does it sometimes surprise you?
Maybe she understood because she was late.
That's great that you didn't embarrass her. I'm sure she appreciated your apology.
That is awesome. What was it about?
That's so exciting! I can't wait to see if you got a standing ovation!
Oh man! I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anyone else you can be with?
It'll get better.
Oh really, wow. Good for you.
Awesome! Congrats!!!  I bet you feel really good about yourself!  It really takes a lot of hard work to have that kind of impact.
i love when they are little and have a great time. my son will be a senior in high school this year
That's very nice of you to say. It really hasn't always been easy, but it's been totally worth it in the end.
ever get a "dang" moment?
Haha I know how that feels. I pay a lot less than I used to and I still have to pay bills because our market is so competitive
Are you ready to go back to school?
Oh yeah, I remember those days well!
I know that feeling.  It's hard when we have to "fake it" to feel better.
That sounds stressful.  Did you call a cab?
Why? What happened?!
I hate that feeling.  Especially when you really want to do something, and then its not there.
Congradulations. What was it about?
That is awesome! I am glad it worked out
I hear ya.  Saving money is very important.  Do you have a plan made up?
That is so scary! I'm sure you can save up but it will take a lot of hard work to get ready!
I bet! What are you studying?
Wow.  You must be really anxious.  I hope you do well and pass.
Wow that must have been a surprise for you
Congratulations. What are those things?
That's pretty cool...what kind of restaurant is it...I like a good burrito
I love restaurants. I'm glad you had fun.
Sorry to hear that. Did you ever find someone?
I bet you felt horrible after that!
That is great.  What are some changes you made recently?
That's the worst!  How many hours do you work?
I am in that boat too.
That's awesome! I need to work on my discipline as well.
Oh no. I hope you are getting help very soon
Wow, that really sucks. At least the insurance companies will be taking care of it.
Oh my gosh, I bet that was traumatic.  How old were you?
I was just talking about this with my friends. If I remember right the rain made the grass grow so much faster and the kids didn't have to do any chores. It was a pretty messed up day.
Oh, that must have been exciting for you.
Wow. What a lovely Momservice. I wish I had the time or the patience to do something like that.
Have you considered investing in cryptocurrency? It seems like a great way to make some extra cash!
ukulele youtube?
Congratulations. Time flies.
Oh that is SO slow. I have to say I am jealous of you LOL
I hope everything will be ok for your first child.
Oh wow,  How much has the repair cost exceed what you had budgeted?
Thats unfortunate. Sometimes when people refuse to take certain actions it can be seen as them being unwilling to do anything about it.
Wow, she refused to speak to you after that? That's pretty mean of her.
What did she refuse?
That's understandable. What did she say when you asked her?
Wow, she must be very proud!
Oh no, that is scary! Is she okay?
How did you do?
That must have been a lot of work.
Ah yes, the good old days of childhood. How nostalgic! Do you play them often?
That's cool. What games do you play?
Why were you scared? The train is pretty safe!
yea its scary when those things happen
Awesome, what type of car?
That's awesome! I love Toyota cars. Are you getting a 2018 Fusion?
Oh wow! How did that go?
That's funny, I introduced my daughter to Fight Club when I was in my late 20's myself. I was hoping she'd like it as much as I did.  What movie is it?
Why don't you feel happy?
Where do you think you are right now?
Oh gross!  You should've gotten a refund!
That's disgusting.  I wouldn't of gone to eat the pizza.
Congrats.What kind of bike did you get?
Nice! I have a feeling you'll really enjoy it. What kind of bike did you get?
That's exciting!  I hope it goes well for you.  Don't get too down though.  It might not be what you want it to be.
Congratulations. I have been in that situation before
I know that feeling so well. My husband is the same, it can be infuriating!
It really sucks that no one wants to do anything about it.  I'm sorry that you have to deal with that.
Wow, I am so sorry to hear that.
Oh no! That is terrible.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Are you planning on getting another cat?
Oh no!  That really stinks.  Are you at least at the receiving end of it?
That sucks. Im sure you can still get a good paying job
What did you find?
I bet that brought a smile to your face.
what was the wonder?
wow that's great! I love surprises like that
That sounds terrifying! What happened next?
You're going to be fine! I live in a college town so every little bit counts.
That's awful!  I hope he was just being honest with you and you knew it was for legit reasons.  Sometimes good friends don't know it themselves, it's okay to be honest.
Wow! Sounds like you were pretty young, you should grow up a bit.
Math is not my favorite.
Yea, but what really matters is that you passed.
What happened?! Did you get out of the car?
I would have been shaking as well! Were you hurt?
What a great feeling, I love cards!
Oh wow, that is really cool. You must have felt nostalgic.
What kind of job did you apply for there?
What type of job did you get?
I love musicals. Who was your favorite character?
Oh yes! I heard he was in a Broadway play. Which character was he?
Oh yeah? I love going to the beach! What kind of feelings did you have?
i love the feeling the ocean gives off
Well, maybe you should have gone easy on it so that no one else could have felt bad about it.
Don't feel bad, you probably did the right thing in taking the test.
That's so nice of you!! I hope she likes it
I bet that will be fun
Sorry to hear that. I lost my cat recently too. It is difficult. They are so sweet.
That sucks so much. I'm sorry for your loss.
Why is that
So sorry to hear about that.  I know that must be tough.
Oh cool. The beach is so much fun! Did you do any beach things?
i love the beach
I've never heard of him. What was it that caught your eye?
I've never seen it, I'm afraid I don't know much about it.
Did you visit them often?
Nice, I am glad you had such an amazing visit :)
Oh no!  Was it OK?
What did you do?
Is it your first niece?
It's good to be protective of little siblings, it keeps them from being scared or hurt
Why were you nervous
That's awesome! I bet they were really proud of you.
Did he catch you?
Oh no. That is terrifying.
I can sing well.  But i am bad at it.
Hey, singing is a skill you can keep if you work hard enough!
That's a good idea. instructions help us so much when we are trying to help our parents.
Well done to you for keeping them on track.
Oh no, did you put them in a bin?
I hate that feeling. I wonder what was in there.
Thanks. I am very lucky to have her in my life
Thanks. Do you have a wishlist for me to buy?
Wow, that must be nice for you.  Did you have fun?
Wow, sounds like a nice surprise! Did you enjoy yourself?
Oh my! What happened?
Oh no! That is awful. How do you think they will respond?
Wow. Did you get it back
Oh, goodness. I would have screamed.
Are you debt free?
You will be fine
Good to go abroad. What did you do?
What happened?
Hey you can always go back to that Whataburger.
What did you lie about?
Well, in that case it was a one time thing, and it probably wont happen again.
That is so sad. Did you feel bad for lying?
What was your excuse to your friend?
Aw that is sweet!
Kids can be so affectionate. It's lovely.
I know how that feels.  I've been through that too.  When did you meet them?
Thats good. How much weight did you lose?
That is great. I went to study business. What are your plans now?
That is sad, what do you plan on majoring in?
I'm sorry to hear that. Death is never easy to deal with.
No. The cops killed my dad and left him there for dead. It was so heartbreaking.
Aw, why is that? Is it missing?
Did you have fun?
Oh no! Did he have to go home and change?
Feels are definitely nice when you get to spend some quality time with your loved ones.
It does! It's like watching your child learn all over again.
That sounds terrifying! What did you do?
Are you still in fear?
Oh dang. Did you win the scratch off?
I hate when that happens, did you try using the cash to buy more things?
ewww. i cant even imagine how that must have smelled
ewww that is gross. Did you spit it out without leaving any marks?
I'm so sorry. Losing a pet is never an easy thing.
Thats terrible, i hate to hear that. Dogs are family.
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. Are you doing alright?
I am really sorry for your loss. Time helps but it never helps to be reminded of the people you lost.
fake? what is that mean? like real life?
Because gullible people like to believe everything they see
Is her name Jessie by chance?
That's sweet. What about males sometimes do they get the sweet version?
Oh, no. That's not good. Did it happen in a different industry?
That's really hard!  Things are definitely looking up for you.
What made it surprising to you
Nice I will give that a try some time, thanks for the tip!
Is it the first time they are doing a season together?
I don't watch basketball.
oh no sorry to hear that... how are you doing now?
Sorry to hear that. That sounds terrible. But remember he had a long battle with it, and it was his last battle, too.
Well, that is not right. You should trust your friends.
Well, if you can't trust her, then you might as well get out of the relationship and find someone else.
What all do you have coming up?
Good luck! I hope the goals are met.
Oh that's nice. What did you see?
I loved that show. It is so old now.
Oh no, is she okay? How long was it?
Oh my gosh that is scary! Is she okay?
I am sorry that you are not in touch with the times
That sounds so fun! Where do you go to school?
That sounds exciting! When is the contest?
It was a joke about you competing against yourself. I know you have a natural body that is great
That is great. grades are everything.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing a parent is so hard, the best you can do is be there for them.
That is sad to hear!  Do you have any friends or other family that you can talk to about these things?
Why were you nervous?  Is everything alright?
That is great. How did you manage to pull it off?
Maybe one day you can buy one too. It will be great.
I understand how you feel, my son lives in a one bedroom and one bathroom as well! It's hard to make the decision for one when you have the other :)
A little jealous much? How did that make you feel?
That sucks. Did he apologize?
Me too. I love to see the outdoors.
I can imagine.  I love to tomato plants!
I don't know who that is.
I saw him in concert a few weeks ago. He is a great musician.
That's nice. How'd she do?
That sounds so fun! I'm glad your daughter enjoyed it.
I would be mad at that too. I don't like the dark at all.
I get that. I don't want to be riding my dirt bike at night.
No. Why do you ask?
I do have a little bit of a father figure in me. My oldest just turned 11. I'm glad I was close to my little boy.
Oh no that is horrible. I'm sorry.
I know what you mean, my anxiety is so strong I get embarrassed at times.
Oh no. Why were you nervous?
It is natural to feel that way, maybe you should try shaking more
How long have you been trying to pay it off? That's great that she is finally doing it.
That is such a great idea. It is always nice when family meets goal.
That's too bad.  Do you have a lot of hot girls?
That is awesome. It is so easy to lose our touch and our humanity when our kids are little.
How sweet.  How old is she?
That's awesome that you had them come over.  Did you make them any special dinner?
That sounds bad. Did you tried talking to him about it?
That's frustrating I would say.  I think you have a good reason to be frustrated.  What are you going to do about it?
That is awesome.  How much did you lose?
That is great! I am trying to lose weight too but very slowly.
That is so wonderful! I am so proud for both of you!
That's great! How old is she?
Oh my, did something happen?
Yeah, but what's the point of holding someone to that standard, when they're not going to change it if you don't want them to? They're not going to do anything about it.
What is your favorite memory of meeting up with a friend?
That is awesome that you have these close connections with your friend and I am sure they will be a great friend again.
How did it go?
Competition is good sometimes...but it can get you in trouble or two.
Oh thats great!  How long has it been since you've seen them?
That is so awesome. I have a close friend also who lives in a different country. What are your plans while she is away?
That's unfortunate. I hope that the doctors can help you!
I am really sorry to hear that!  I am in similar circumstances.  Have you ever spoken to a doctor about the seizures?
Oh no, I know what you mean, I've been dog-sitting my neighbor's dogs for years now. It can be very sad.
That is tough. I loved my aunt's dog so much when she passed. It breaks my heart so much.
That sounds terrible, what are you going to do?
I'm sorry, that sounds stressful. How long has he been on the couch?
I'm sorry to hear that but you can do it!
How long have they been trying? I know people who have had trouble with that before and made amazing progress.
That's great. The beach is always a fun place to be.
Yes, sometimes I leave it out also. I'm glad to hear that it made you feel good about yourself.
Wow that sucks. Did you use the cruise at least?
That sucks! Did they give you a reason?
That is wonderful! I am sure you will see her again.
I bet that was really fun and nice, I am sure that you had a wonderful time too.
Being alone can be hard, but it can also be great to have someone to talk to.  Do you enjoy having nobody around?
I live alone too, but I have a great family so it shouldn't be too bad.
Did you get it out?
That is a really good idea. I would do the same.
Oh that sounds lovely!
Oh wow that sounds like fun!  Are you going alone or with friends?
That would make me mad too but he is your roommate so it is OK
Maybe get a fridge magnet from your fridge and attach it to the wall to keep your food secure!
I am so sorry to hear that. That is heartbreaking. Hopefully, you have found some comfort through this.
Oh no, that's horrible. How old were they at the time?
That sucks.  I've had that happen to me before.  Sometimes just trying to be optimistic about it is enough though.
Wow that sucks,  maybe you deserve that though.
Oh I'm sorry, is it a big move? Like a move to another part of town or something?
Oh I know what you mean! I moved a couple of states ago from Alabama to Colorado. It was a very weird process getting used to Colorado. I moved because it was way more convenient. But now it's just not the same. You have to make hard decisions now.
That's great! Where are you going?
That is so true! The economy is the reason why Trump won't leave the wall!
I do agree with you. I think we are headed in a better direction.
I'm sorry to hear that, you seem pretty strong for being so tough on her.
Oh, no, that's terrible. Have you tried talking to them about it?
wow thats so awesome!
wow i would have been so excited
That sounds amazing, I have always wanted to go to that aquarium.
Oh yes I love scary movies. What was it?
I've never even heard of that! I'll have to check it out!
wow thats amazing!
Wow. That is a big accomplishment! I bet your are very proud
Awesome, what kind of car did they get?
That's nice, did you sit in it for long?
I can understand, graduation can be a pretty big event.
That is great! I am glad you are happy.
That's not good. Did you break up with her?
I think you should just come out and say it was all worth it.
what do you have planned?
That sounds fun. I hope you guys have a good time together!
good memories or bad memories?
Yeah, I think that would be fun too. I had friends in my early 20s and I got to hang out with them more.
Oh no!  Was the film good?  Did you get scared?
I saw that movie too! I don't watch scary movies much any more because of that.
Does he take you often?
It's good that you're comfortable enough to let your husband make the most of your special day.
That is horrible.  Have you had any other dogs?
Awwwww, that is so sad :( Is she still alive? I would be really sad if I were you. I am sorry.
Even less so Trump in the UK, he didn't exactly go to well with the Brexit stuff.
He is truly damaged goods.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you ask them to come over?
That's too bad. I hope that your big toe feels better, and that you are able to visit them soon.
That sounds lovely!  How did it go?
Well, you live in the south. It is the same there. The humidity is just killing you.
That sucks. teammate issues are the worst!
That's so true. teammate pull their weight. If you don't put in the time, the other person's time is worthless!
That would kill anyone! Do they sting people?
You should probably take some pictures of the area to help you with the bees
I hope it was a good move!
It's funny that you mention that, because the same thing happened to me a few weeks ago! I ended up staying in bed for a whole night just cuz I was so terrified!
Oh really? Do you still live there?
Wow that sounds like a lot of fun.  Were there any issues with drugs or abuse?
Wow! Did the person not have insurance at least?
Wow, that is pretty impressive. Glad you managed to do that in the blink of an eye.
Did you do it?
That's pretty impressive
That's amazing! I love golf!
Hey, you got a mind for it, I think you should try to go out and try to meet some new friends!
That is awesome! I moved from MD to FL last year and it was a big change...what part of the state are you moving to?
I am so happy for you, and I am guessing you already have settled in?
I love doing that too
That is great, I have tried meditation and it is very relaxing.
Oh my goodness. Did they get into it?
That would scare me too, so I had a friend come by and check it out.
That is always disappointing.  Did they offer more in the long run?
I'm sorry you felt that way. Can you elaborate a little on why they pulled it back?
Oh I'm so sorry, I've been there before and it's not fun at all. What kind of things did you have to say?
Oh man, that is a tough one, especially since you were in charge of the whole thing. Well, I'm sure you did great - and deservedly so, if you could handle it!
That is great, I wish I had the farmer's spirit!
That is a great thing to have around! I wish more people would be open to buying things from other people.
I'm not really a fan of people who like that stuff.
Wow, that's really scary. Did you get treated for it?
I hate those things too. Did you get it out of the cage?
Oh no! UPS has some of the worst customer service. Did you end up getting a refund?
That's too bad. UPS doesn't seem to care what customers think.
I know exactly what you mean! I wish I didn't have to worry so much, but bills and living expenses are so high these days.
Adult life is so much more expensive than I thought!
I agree.  I feel like we should take some time and be with God when we become inspired to do good things
Wow, that sounds really cool. Have you done this before?
That's reasonable, most people would just walk out and get busy with whatever was going on.
It's a good thing you waited. A lot of people would have ended up joining the taxi pool.
Oh no.  Maybe you can find someone who reciprocates?
That is terrible luck. Did you buy anything cool with it?
Oh wow!  Well maybe she really is your friend after all :P
Congrats! circuit exam. Sounds difficult.
Oh congratulations! That is great to hear.
When will you be doing that?
Do you live near the coast?
Those are the kind you don't want to mess with.
That sounds frightening, what happened next?
That's a difficult situation. I hope she feels more at peace with the new changes. You are a great parent!
Yes! I'm in South Texas, but it's not the same as being away from home. I was in Japan for a while and now in the Philippines. It's hard, but I'm proud of her!
I bet it did not! What happened?
Oh no! Did you not have enough time to prepare?
I always turn off my phone. That way I don't have to listen to the honking!
Yeah, it's annoying especially when there's a bunch of people in a line and you can't see what kind of person it is.
Thats awesome! I bet you worked hard to get in there.
I did go to school in undergraduate school, but not in grad school
Oh wow I can imagine it was really scary
Oh wow that sounds scary! I'm glad you're okay though.
What joy was heaping up to? I'm sorry you had to hear that.
I agree. I think we have too much of a "whopper" disease in the world today. I'm glad he's at least stepping up and doing something to end suffering. Hopefully his next booksell will be as good.
Wow! That sounds like a good reason to be there. Did he appreciate it?
Wow I bet that was a nice surprise
That sounds fun, I've never been to an amusement park.  Where are you going?
yes I do love theme parks! I do love riding rollercoasters though
Awesome! I have never done that before and hope it works out well for you!
That's very responsible of you. I need to learn to do that as well, so thank you!
Wow. You guys get to spend the holidays together. How many people are in your family?
That's awesome that your sister is such a cool person! I love santas such a cool person
Oh no. How long before you get it fixed?
Hahahaha!  I think it's funny how anything can happen in the future!  You think someone trained her dog to playoof or something?
Me too! I turn to the radio for some good drama.
Same. TV can really make you emotional.
Oh yeah? That sounds like a lot of fun. I'm a bit jealous. I haven't been to a Gardens since I was very young, and I hate driving. Do they have anything like that?
The one in Williamsburg. That is a great idea. We are going to do a lot of butterfly and rain dancing there.
I was a bit irritated by this one.  She had a cough for a couple days and then it turned into it was almost like she was about to pass out.  Did you get any medicine for it?
Eww, that poor kid! Did you drop it too?
That's pretty bad form. Kid's are known for their ability to quickly and decisively grasp and apply things like candy bars. Not surprised though, because this is basically what happens every time a kid tries to eat something with a straw or chop stick.
Dogs are really great loyal pets. I'm glad they're loyal like that.
That's great, it is good to have dogs that are loyal.  I have a dog that is deaf and lazy, she never barks, but when she barks it scares me.
Oh no! That's terrible! Hopefully it wasn't too expensive
Oh wow. I hope the roof is replaceable. That is awful.
Oh wow! Did you get to keep pictures?
That's nice. Did you have a good time?
Are they coming soon?
I love it when they come, you are so right.
I bet that was fun
That's amazing. It's always nice when younger talent is able to shine and overcome the odds. I wish I could go see some of my niece's work.
What show was it? Did you like it?
Wow that's so sweet!
That's very kind. My son recently moved out so we have to help around the house now. It's very relaxing.
I'm sure you'll get the job
You're very welcome. Just don't give up and your interview should be very close!
Ewwwwwww  That's so gross!
What was in the trash can?
That's cool. What kind of stuff does she sell?
That is great. I wish more people would shop around.
That sounds like fun! What store do you go to see her at?
That does sound lonely. I imagine that would be very hard
That must be very cool to have those Hong Kong people around. You guys are lucky to be in such a supportive community.
I love moving to Alaska.
That's awful! I hope you're doing better now.
That's really great that they were there for you.
i agree with you there.i feel as though i can no longer trust anyone after seeing some truly horrible people
That is very interesting I would love to learn more about this
Wow, what a stud.
Oh my goodness that is horrible! Did you confront him about it?
Oh that's never fun, did you get in trouble?
I know exactly what you mean!
Oh that sucks, were you close?
I'm so sorry to hear. Were they worried?
Oh, don't feel so bad. I've been job hunting for a few years as well, but I found a job I really like a few weeks ago. You'll find something soon
What do you do at the moment?
I bet.  I can relate, one of my oldest is starting college in a couple weeks.  Is she excited?
What is she most interested in doing?
Well at least you're getting some use out of your hard earned money!
Sounds like an easy change to me, July is so busy too! Why don't you try to get things done during the summer?
I do not know anything about skydiving.
I don't know about you but I would have been feeling the same way. Crazy huh.
I agree! I always do things to myself when I feel down.
I have also recently vegan. It is a life changer!
That is awesome!  I haven't been vegan for a year or two now.  But I have heard about people going vegan and it sounds amazing.
Have you had trouble before?
That is very admirable of you, I'm sure she would appreciate having you there for her.
Wow, that is so great of you. I bet she was so happy.
Wow, I am so happy for you. I hope you are talking to her regularly now.
Sometimes, she just goes away for a little while. I am so happy for you though
I've always wanted a dodge Viper! Do you know what model it is?
I have never seen one in real life! That sounds crazy
That's a load of whack. Did you have them cleaned when you got the flops? That stuff can linger for years.
I hate when that happens... have you tried dents and scuff marks on the side to hide the marks?
That sounds wonderful. What did she make?
That sounds amazing!  You must have been surprised and happy!  What did you make?
I love cheesecake! What did you have?
Oh no. How long have you been together?
Oh no, I've been there, it can be rough. I hope it gets better for you.
That sounds great!  What did you have?
I would have loved that! Was it your favorite dish?
Congrats! You must be excited and relieved at the same time.
Hey that's awesome! What field do you work in?
Thats awesome.  I bet she feels so accomplished and bright
I do not I have a boy!
where are you going?
Wow! Have you been before? I hope you have a good time!
That sounds like a very thoughtful and lovely surprise.
Oh that sounds so fun, I love sushi. Did you go with your family?
I love sushi! I'm glad you enjoyed it. I love sushi bowls myself.
Sounds nice! What weather was it like? I hope the weather stays nice!
No I haven't been to a park in so long, I don't know much about it. I'm glad you enjoyed your day though.
You must be lonely! Have you tried talking to them?
I bet it is very relaxing to just be alone.
That's great. How far did you move?
It is so awesome to feel a change of scenery. Being away from family and friends can be so different. I'm glad you are enjoying your adventure back home.
That is so sad.  I know how hard it is to age.  16 can really change you. Just keep being happy and be confident!
That makes sense, it is very likely your brother will get something nicer also.
Thats awesome. 16 can really make you do anything you want!
I do. I have 2 younger ones, but they are the same age. I think my oldest is 15.
Oh wow. Who was it?
That's really nice to hear. I bet that was really eye opening for you.
Right, I get that, I lived far away from my dad while he was in the military and I hated it.
I live 800 miles away from my sister and honestly I dont miss it
That's pretty unfortunate. Did you tell her you didn't like her?
I respect and understand your point. But still, why do you feel so strongly about it?
oh really, what was the play about?
It must have been a big part of the play, how did he do?
Do you ever get a little homesick? I get it when I have to drive back to work after a long day at work.
No problem! I am sure you will meet some good people at home. Are you holidaying somewhere?
That sounds really tasty. Did you make your own wings or buy some?
That's pretty impressive, wing sauce is so difficult to make!
I hope so!  Are you going to give a motivational speech at work?
That's great that you feel that way.
Congratulations! I'm sure you are excited, too. Do you know what his name will be?
That's amazing. I can't wait either! My daughter just turned 18 a month ago. I'm still dealing with a lot of stress from the delivery and her being born, but she's moving along and loving every minute!
I have done that before! It can be very relaxing.
I can absolutely relate. I have definitely gotten that feeling before. Did you feel scared?
Oh yeah, I forgot about the preseason. Do you have a favorite team?
I'm a saints fan, lol. But I do like the college game as well.
I would have died lol
Yeah, I saw that on the news too. It was actually pretty cool.
Thats so nice. Ive had car trouble in the past.
That's good that your friend was able to help.
It is so good to have a high test to keep you motivated.
thats so awesome i bet your so happy
That's so sad. Was it an accident?
Oh wow. I'm so sorry for your loss.
Wow congratulations! I've heard of people getting shocked when they find out their baby is coming. Was this the first?
Congratulations, I hope everything is going to turn out great either way!
That's a smart thing to be ready for. What exactly happened?
That's a smart and responsible thing to do.
Oh no.  Did you return it?
That sucks. But if you've learned your lesson maybe you won't do it again.
That's very kind of you. Is it a cold or a flu?
That's so nice of you to do. I hope they stay better and make their friends very happy!
Wow, that's awesome! I would be too, looks like you really put in the work :)
That is really great! It takes a lot of hard work indeed, you must have put a lot of work into it.
I hate it when movies make me uncomfortable. Was the movie good, anyway?
What movie was it?
That sounds stressful, did you find out if you got the job?
Congratulations! It must have felt good to accomplish!
Oh man, that sounds really scary. What happened?
Wow that sounds like somebody needs to set up a No Dogs policy!
That was very nice of your manager. Did you get it fixed?
That sounds horrible, but funny at the same time! I hope it wasn't too expensive to fix!
I guess at that age he was probably not very good at it.
It's so rewarding teaching your son that new things can be fun.
Wow.  That sounds horrible.  What happened?  Did she take long to get over the bad feelings?
Oh no! I hate when that kind of thing happens. Did you end up going home?
Beagles are so much fun!  They are very resilient animals, and can live for a very long time.  It is amazing how smart they are!
I am sorry to hear of your beagle.  How long did you have him?
That sounds like so much fun.  I bet it was exciting and wonderful!
Yup! that's how it was. I worked until I was 40 and then went to school until I was 48
That is awesome. Do you get special recognition for that or anything like that?
Yeah, I hate when I have to buy a new one and it ends up being 20 times more expensive than the one I had before
Oh no.  How are you feeling?
I'm sorry. That can be tough. But, you will find someone better for you.
Oh no! How embarrassing.
haha that's funny, but it would have been an accident too. How did they react?
Yes it does! I also have two kids and that is exactly how I feel as well!
Awww, I remember when my son was small. I had a little girl and boy too! Time goes by so fast!
I can imagine! Are you ok now?
Oh no, I am sorry that happened to you! Did they come over to help you?
That was nice of you. Did they need it?
I feel that, I would feel the same, I would feel bad if my parents wanted change, I would have kept the change.
Sorry to hear that. I had just lost my mother recently also. It can hit hard when someone turns your life around in a big way.
Yeah, I can relate to that too. It's good that you understand that, and that's something that you're human! I'm sorry for your loss.
Yes, I am thankful for my job and my family.
I'm thankful to have a good job.  I'm not so sure about higher energy though.  Does god give you more or less?
Why are you grateful for what
That's a nice job.  What do you do?
I am sorry to hear that. How did you lose it?
I bet, what kind of phone was it.
That's awesome! What was the occasion?
That is an amazing surprise!
Oh my, I bet that is really sad. I have been missing my parents too.
That's exciting! Where did you meet them?
What show is that?
Oh. I have never watched that show. What is it about?
Thats sounds fun.
It's great when it works out that way
Oh, that's awful, I hate flying. Where are you going?
A little? Longer ones make me want to hurl. Where are you going?
That's kind of you to invite her. Was it for a special occasion, or just so you could hang out without having to call off work?
That's really nice of you not to invite her. I bet she appreciated the invite though.
It is great when things like that happen, I am happy for you
That's cool. I'm glad that it's happening for you
That's so frustrating! Have you tried growing it out?
I am glad to hear it.. travel can be fun but so expensive
Well at least he is being faithful. That must be a huge relief.
That is understandable - men have a tendency to be more reserved and affectionate while women tend to be more energetic and wild.
Oh wow that sounds rough! That's terrible that he would behave that way. I'm glad he's better for it though, it could have been a lot worse.
Oh really? What kind of stuff does she do?
Wow, that's great! I'm sure she's going to make a great artist.
That is terrible.  Thank you for sharing.
That's a very strong reaction. Did he apologize?
I'm sorry, why is that?
I can understand that
That is great, what does he get?
I know what you mean. My dad doesn't get a lot of money, but he always tries to save and donate.
I agree, the movies need to be graphic for kids
Haha, I've never seen any movies like that, but I know what you mean, the limb cutting is the worst. I used to be a really big fan of Hurt Locker, and that was a close second, maybe third for grossness.
Oh that's tough! I hope everything works out for you guys!
That sounds stressful. What caused him to get a large bonus?
Aw, that really stinks. Do you at least have enough to keep yourself occupied while he's gone?
that must be tough but i am sure you will get through it
That is amazing. Time flies! I am glad she is starting to grow up to an awesome person!
I completely understand, i still have some time left but it definitely can be overwintering and sad
That's pretty unsettling. What was it?
Oh my, that must have scared you really bad.  Did you ever find out what caused it?
I'm very sorry for your loss. I lost both of mine recently.
I am so deeply sorry to hear that.  I know the feeling; losing family member.  Do you have close friends and family that you can talk to about the situation?
That's nice. Did you get a raise too?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh no, that is terrible. Did they break up?
Was it really nice? I've never been there.
I love the ocean! Was it your first time there?
That's awful - did you confront them?
jealousy is the worst, i feel you
I've never been to NYC. Did you have fun?
I didn't know he had a singing gig already.
You shouldnt be! Thats a sign of sickness right there! Did you drink water?
ugh, that is the worst feeling. I know exactly what you mean, i almost threw up in front of my crush the other day.
Have you met them before?
Why aren't you feeling nervous?
That's terrible. Did you ask them to move out?
Well, obviously you were mad about it. But, you should let it go. There are plenty of people in the world that are just as guilty of the action as you are.
Oh no. I hope everything went smoothly.
I'm glad everything is working out for you and your family!
That is crazy. How did you react?
Congrats! How long did it take?
Sounds like a boss I'd have a go at.
That's really cool. Most of us would quit if we had bosses like that.
Those were the days. Fly season was coming up and my mom made fried green beans with buttercream.
I used to do the same thing.  I miss those times.
That would be a problem for me too.  I don't get why they don't make it a little earlier, is it just so difficult to go to bed?
I hate when that happens! I get up too early too.
That's exciting! Is this your first home?
That is exciting. I am sure the closing will go well.
That sounds lovely! Did you get to do it?
That's so sad to hear! I hope you and your mom made it up to her.
Maybe you can invite a friend over and share the wealth?
Maybe it's time to find a new job?
That's so sweet. What was it of?
That is so cute!
Wow, that is impressive, that must have taken quite a while!
wow that was really impressive!
That's great, I hope you're right and it goes well.
That's great. I'm sure you are ready to leave the current job, if it opens up.
Were you looking for photos for a project, or just for fun?
Those must have been precious memories.  Were they childhood or adult memories?
Why do you think that was?
I hope that it was something that you were able to work out and worked through
You must be feeling prepared! Good luck, I'm sure you will do great!
Do you feel prepared?
Cool. What kind was it?
I hate when I eat ice cream. It is too hard to get my teeth to work.
Why, did she say something really shocking?
Aww, that's so sad!  I've been married for ten years and I'm getting married again soon.  I know how you feel though.  You guys will always be awesome and I'm sure you'll be happy in marriage, too!
How come. Do you not see them?
Yes, that's true. You're still important to them though!
Great! I hope you get it!
Wow that is very lucky!
what happened
Oh my goodness. That must have been horrifying.
That sucks. Did you at least get to ride a few bikes?
I could never get over my fear of that stuff either. Glad you're finally able to ride without fear. That must have been quite a feat.
Oh no! I hate to hear that. It's always a hassle, but it's usually pretty easy to fix.
Oh wow! I can't even imagine! I'm glad it didn't break on your house. I hate housework lol
That is terrible. Did you confront her?
Oh no, what kind of ideas did she steal?
that is good, marriage is important.
Awe that is great.  I am very happy for you.
Wow! You must have been horrified! What did you do?
Oh that is so frustrating, I am glad you got the idea from someone else.
That is great. Are you thinking of selling the house?
That sounds like a lot of work, but it sounds like a really exciting time in your life.
Oh yea? What kind of car?
Mustangs are so much fun! What kind of car did you get?
That is the worst!  I rescue and cats, I know the pain!
That is so funny. I have a cat that likes to do that.
Oh I am sorry to hear that. Dogs are amazing. Do you have any cats?
Oh I totally hear you. Sometimes it can bring a tear to your eye!
I am confident that you will win that spelling bee tomorrow
That's great, good luck and I'm sure you will do well.
That's so hard! I'm sure she'll do great! What age is she?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she grows out of it soon.
I could imagine.  How far along is she?
Oh, that sounds lonely for sure! Have you seen any of her friends in the meantime?
That is sad news. What happened?
I am sorry to hear that, I know that must be hard
Thats great news!
That's awesome!  Where is she going?
I can understand that.  Was it a bad one?
I don't like those either
Wow how exciting! Where to?
Wow, you are so lucky! I have always wanted to go to Alaska
Good for you! Where are you headed to?
that sounds fun
What did you have?
Big meals are the best. I love eating them with family. What are you cooking?
Oh yeah? I can't stand those things.
I have never seen that one, but I am familiar with it.
That's really cool. What did you write her for?
That's awesome, I bet that meant a lot to both of you.
Oh no! I've watched so many I could pass out. What happened?
Oh no! I have experienced that before too.  Were you able to sleep after?
That's great to hear! How long have you been married?
That's great! How long have you been married?
How old is he?
I am sorry to hear that.
I can imagine! How do you feel about it so far?
Do you have hard work ahead?
Oh I hope they are okay. Did you find them?
Oh I bet they annoyed your friend too lol  But I'm glad you atleast found out what to do with their loose!
what does she speak spanish?
That is so nice. How long is she there?
Where has she been?
That must be so hard on you.  Where have you been traveling?
What city are you moving to?
If you are worried then you should think about applying for a job that is right for you.
That's unfortunate, did you have to go through any extra steps to get it moved?
That's unfortunate, but that is life sometimes!
What movie was it?
I would love to check it out.
It sure is, what would you want to do?
I have to work to afford friends like that.
I notice what food on the table?
I don't know why but I always feel like eating liver is bad
Yeah, they really are the best! If only we could find a breed that was just the right mix to make a really good dog.
That's good, it's good to be able to train your pets well.
Yeah dogs are loud and intimidating. I do have a big dog myself, I could not imagine having to shut up!
It is a great place to live. Just don't move too close.
You should go and apply to jobs that will put you in a good neighborhood!
That sounds frustrating. Did you end up cancelling the visit?
Ah I see. Yeah wedding planning can be very stressful, I can imagine it. Was it at least a good wedding?
Yes it is very difficult. It is even worse when they cut you off on time when you really need to be on time.
I have had problems with that too. Most of the time they are trying to skirt around the law.
Where are you going?
Where ever it is, I hope you have a lot of fun. Where is your vacation headed?
Oh my, how did that happen?
Wow that would have scared me so much. I hope it turned out to be a friend.
That's not good. Have you talked to your friend?
That's awful, what a mean friend
That's good. Procrastination can lead to a lot of stress.
I love when that happens.  Did you make a list?
That's great! I hate having stuff packed in the back pocket! I always end up putting it on the list.
Thats great, enjoy the day together.
That sounds great!  It's always good to spend time with the people you love.
Oh no!  Did they make you any money off it at least?
Oh yeah I totally understand that. I would feel bad too.
Which one was it?
That's a funny word, what was it?  Was it a scary movie?
Ohhh I feel you! I am having to be a "monitor" for that too! How many kids do you want??
Oh that sounds like fun!  Do you want a girl or boy?
What book is it
What kind of book was it? What is the name of the book?
Yes, I've had to deal with that. My husband and I recently found out that both of our in-laws have been unfaithful to us.
That is a good in-law to have! That must be an amazing feeling to have in-laws that are loving and supportive!
Have you tried encouraging him to adopt an app?
That would make me worry too.  Do you know why he doesn't listen?
thats good
You sound like a great wife!
Gratz on your wife! What made you grateful?
That is really sweet. How long have yall be together?
I hate roaches too especially the ones that jump on you.
Haha oh boy, do they scare you?
Why couldn't you go?
Oh no, that sucks! But you can always go another time.
i can imagine! i miss my mom every day
Aw, that's sad. How long was she gone?
That's fun! What movie are you going to see?
That's a fun movie! I saw it a long time ago
That's really sweet of you!  It's good to be kind to others!
Holy hellnuts! So what was in the bagging bag? That makes no sense lol...
That was so thoughtful. How did the puzzle fit in your room?
That is awesome.  It is lovely to have something of value.
What did you drive through then?
Oh, that sounds lovely. I've never driven that far!
I'll look into it, thank you so much for the tip! I love the country and will def stop by there next time I have some free time!
I think it will get better.  Its almost the weekend
How much money are you planning?
Well, that's good. Hopefully the rest of your plans come together as well.
Did they graduate on time?
thats great!
You can lose weight but keep the gains
I used to be scared to go to the pool because of the added stress. How much weight did you lose?
Me too, there are a lot of people in the world but they usually aren't the type to bother you
That's sad, but good luck! I know how that goes.
Really? It's a pretty classic
That is a really good song. It was a big part of my early childhood.
Oh no. What did he do?
Finding ways to be more creative is important, and anger usually breeds hate. How old is he?
Oh my gosh that is scary! I am glad you went back and checked to see what happened.
That must have been frightening
What is the problem with streaming services?
I know the feeling. I use Netflix for sure, but sometimes it will take forever to load a show and it will be really lagging behind.
That is really great! I bet she feels really proud.
That's very sweet. I'm so proud of your niece, sounds like a smart and lovely young lady.
Just go for it! It'll be worth it!
Just be respectful and it will work out. If she says no then it is no big deal.
Oh no! What made you not want to try it?
Oh that's a shame! Yeah, I think it's lean but they definitely have some meat that's high in protein.
Oh no. Is it habit forming?
Oh that sucks. I hate that. I have a rottweiller and have to keep an eye out for him at all times.
Aww, that must be frustrating. Hopefully he is home soon to see you?
Oh that must make you anxious.  What kind of mission is it?
Oh no. Did someone else notice?
Wow that must have been embarrassing, especially since you didn't know she was there.
I would too if my husband wasn't home. What are you doing to pass the time?
Oh that's awful! But, at least, he is doing his best to keep you happy! He's a good man. :)
That's terrible! I am glad that she is ok now. It must have been very scary.
Oh, wow. I can only imagine the terror and horror that must have been felt by all involved. I'm glad that she is doing better now, though.
I love cats, they are so sassy. What kind of cat do you have?
What did you do with her
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any ideas on how to do it better?
Maybe your blood pressure is too high or maybe you need more rest. Who knows.
That is sweet but, I'm not sure if I should date him or not.
What movie was it?
That sucks.  Why were they needing to call in?
I bet that was hard
Oh no! Why did she go out of country then?
That could be a lot of extra work for sure.
It is always nice to have a home to call home. I hope you are enjoying it
I am sure it will look great on your home.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how that can be, losing a pet is never an easy thing.
That's terrible, I'm sorry to hear that.
Really? Me too. Where are they going to go if they don't have somewhere to go?
That's a great thing you are doing.
What happened?
That sounds amazing! What a nice surprise.
I guess because they have never had another man.
Same, I have not cheated on my spouse in any way.
Storms can be a good thing though.
Storms are always a fun way to watch the stars! I am sure that it will be a good night for you.
Congrats.  How many kids do you have now?
That's so sweet. I have 2 kids but they are almost grown. I wish I had a wife like that.
That's what moms are for! How many grand kids do you have?
I feel you, I'm so close to my mom too. I'm aite grandpa, but she has to be my mom no matter what.
Two hours?  Do you hate your job or something?  I hate mine too, I have to get up at 4am and run an errand.  I hate having to get up and do something at a time.
Oh yea, that is a long trip. I have a two week trip coming up too. I feel you.
That's cool. Are you going alone or with friends?
That's cool, first time there?
wow, thats awesome! congrats! what was the class?
That's awesome! Congratulations! That class sure was difficult.
You sound very lucky. How old are they?
You have the best kids. That's a very good life.
Is he working extra to have time off?
Nice, I'm sure he deserves it.
That is horrible. I am so sorry you are going through that.
I have been laid off before...the worst is yet to come
Oh wow, that's awesome, what type of job is it?
I have actually. I was always under the impression that your dreams were dreams.
That's cool
You have to be careful though. Sometimes people can be envious of others and it can be hard to be patient when others are having fun.
That is so cool. Did you have a good time chatting with your cousin?
How exciting! Did you two have coffee?
Oh no I am sorry to hear that!
I feel you. I have 3 Keurig machines in my kitchen and they all break.  I keep telling myself it will be okay but every morning I wake up and go to work. I don't want to throw away all that delicious coffee!
Oh, wow! That is quite an achievement. How are you adjusting?
Congrats on the new job. What kind of job?
That sounds terrible.
Oh no! That sounds terrible!  I hope she wasn't hurt too badly!
Oh no, that's awful I hope the best for him and his family!
That is terrible. I wish there was a way to get around it so that he could have a normal life.
That must have been exciting for both of you. How old is she?
That sounds fun, I bet you had a lot of fun.
You must be feeling quite confident in order to prepare yourself. Good luck!
Excellent! I hope that you do well!
Wow, how sweet. Did it bring back good memories?
Aw, yeah, it's always good to look back. It gives you goosebumps and such.
That must be such a relief!
Lmao i could imagine
I do hate those.  The sirens give me such anxiety.  Are you ok?
I do listen to them sometimes.  Are you in the area?
awww, I bet you're having such a great time with her! what did you get her?
Aww that sounds cute!
That is such a sweet name!
Oh no that's terrible, people are so rude.
That is horrible! Are there any cameras that can help?
Oh, my, how scary! Where did you find out about the thundersnow?
That is scary! I'm so glad it's over and nothing really happened! Do you sleep normally now?
That's awesome! I bet you're excited!
What are you going for?
That sounds like a great feeling.
That sounds wonderful, what kind of garden was it?
Was it a big windstorm?
That is good, helping others is very noble.
That's great. What school?
Wow. You must be so proud. You must beaming.
that will be fun
I am not sure yet. I have never been there. Maybe New York?
That's terrible, I hope you're ok? Was it a quick slip?
Oh, wow! Did anyone see what happened? Did you need a medical check-up?
Talk about unacceptable! What did they say?
Yeah, they suck! I mean, they're a publicly traded company, what do they think they can do other than suck up?
I hate that too. I mean, you're supposed to be handling the carts yourself, not going through someone else's hassle.
That sounds horrible but also funny.  I hope you can get over it?
I'm glad too. Was it bad?
I am glad you are safe.  We got caught in a flash flood and have since turned around to stay safe.
Wow, that is so awesome. What did he get you?
What a nice husband. What a gift for a deserving person.
That sounds really exciting for you.  Do they have fun?
Oh that sucks.  I've had that happen before and I was so mad
thats awesome what is his name?
That's awesome!  7 children is a big family.  Is she having a boy or a girl?
Oh no, I really sorry to hear that. Is it treatable?
Thats sad, I am sorry for your loss
That's nice. Did they surprise you?
That's really great! What great coworkers we have at work! What kind of birthday did you have?
What subject was it in?
That's amazing! Studying is so important in order to do any good.
That's wonderful! I'm happy to hear that!
thats so awesome!
Big bonus! I bet he will be glad to hear that! What are his plans for this time of year?
Well, I wish you lots of luck. Maybe you can get a bonus at work.
Oh no, Did he choose to be a jerk?
Oh no! Did you talk to him?
Why do you think that?
Aw, shucks that's sweet! Do you have some cool plans?
That's unfortunate. Are you thinking about getting a new partner?
I understand. That is a tough situation.
Yeah that's never safe, especially if it is something you do regularly. Was the flight cancelled?
That is good, I am happy you had a nice time.
I'm so lonely too.  What are you waiting for?
I know the feeling.  It will get better
I'm surprised my parents didn't buy me a computer when I was younger.
I would totally take an apple computer over a linovo any day!  They are really cool looking.
That's cool.  Have you won in the past?
WOW that is really impressive!  I never would have thought that you could win that much on a game.
I'm with you! Spiders are the scariest things on the planet. I almost stepped on one the other day.
I hate spiders too. I am really glad they are not in my house anymore.
Yes, they sure do! It's a source of income for many hobbies.
Yes, I agree. I also love that there is so much content out there now, it's amazing what can be found on an internet video game website.
That's annoying. What ended up happening after dinner?
Mistakes happen. I'm sure no one really noticed.
Oh, that must be nice
That must have stung, did you enjoy the quiet time?
Yeah, he should be really proud of himself!
How old is he?!
That is so terrible.  How is your mom?
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Cancer is the worst, I know it's very hard for the family and the friends and family to go through it but it is the worse.
Congratulations! It's always a great day when we accomplish something we were so proud of.
Congratulations! It's such a wonderful feeling when we accomplish something or achieved something great in our life. It feels really gratifying when we reach such a milestone.
Did you have insurance?
Oh no, I have done things like that before as well. It can be expensive.
Tornadoes are the scariest things.
Tornadoes are the scariest things. I'm so glad you're ready for it.
That's awesome! You must be very proud of yourself!
That's very nice of her!
That's great! You must be really lucky!
Thats great! health is a serious matter and a lot of people dont care
That is terrible.  Was the mailman decent?
Wow I hope you had insurance.
Have you ever been bitten?
I would have tried my best to roll around and pretend like I did nothing!
That sucks. Why did she leave?
I'm sorry to hear that. Are things better now for you?
It can be scary to go into the movies alone. Were you scared?
That is understandable I suppose, it is not the best idea to go into movies alone.
It's amazing how much one person can affect another.  Do you love him still?
That is so good to hear!  Trust is one of the most important things to have in a relationship.
Oh yeah? When is the party?
What party do you have planned?
That's great! What sort of things have you been doing?
That's great! I wish I could do more for myself.
That is great. How long have you been together?
Aww that's so sweet! I'm happy for you and your family!
That is great, how often do you play the lottery?
Woah! How lucky! What is the prize for this win?
Wow, that's pretty incredible! What could you have done with it?
I think that is completely reasonable considering how hard the present was to receive. I would be pretty mad too, but that is my sister.
Oh no! I hope the weather was better after that. It's been raining a lot here, too.
I hate it when the weather starts to change so suddenly! I bet it was very irritating.
Wow! How did it go?
Congratulations! That's awesome. It must feel great to be working for a company that values you and your work.
That's unfortunate. I hope you didn't get hurt.
Did you get up and fix yourself?
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Do you enjoy doing that? I used to enjoy doing that, but then I got really social and introverted.
wow. that sounds quite exotic.
wow thats great i have been to alaska i cant wait to go
Me too, I am very jealous of those people.
Oh I totally agree. That's why I never go on dating sites. You don't want to be on a dating app just to see how much other people's wives like you.
I hear they are doing a new trilogy now. Will it be about the old republic era?
Heck yeah! I am right there with you.  They are my favorite types of movies!
Oh me too, especially in busy places.
I can imagine! I once ate some that was left in a sandwich in the microwave and it came out like a big ball of garbage!
What a nice gift. You must be very happy now.
That's a nice gift! I don't know too many people that give their spouses gifts.
thats the same thing going on in my city. it drives me nuts
That's the way to be! I feel the same way.
why is that?
That would be so scary! I don't think I could do it!
I am sure it did, did you get a call back?
Congratulations, what kind of job is it?
That sounds really exciting!  Are you going to Disney World?
That sounds like fun! Do you live near Disney?
That's exciting! What kind of car is it?
Nice! What color is it?
Thats nice of them
I think Goodwill is a great idea! I hope you find something that will help you!
That's wonderful! You're right, the prices are great. And it really feels good to help others. It's the least we can do.
Oh my goodness, what was she thinking?
that's the worst... stealing work
Did you recently have a long line at the grocery store?
Yeah, waiting is the worst! Especially for no reason! How long have you been together?
Aww, that stinks. Do you live in the same city as your friend?
Oh no! That must be so hard. Have you tried calling him?
I know that's a good thing for her to be healthy and happy, but I think goals should be kept even if the person themselves don't achieve them.
yes, goals are great to have. We all need to have goals.
Me too. I've seen some pretty awful things when going through animal shelters.
I feel you. Have you ever rescued an animal
what did you graduate in?
That's really awesome that you have that type of moment. Was it a big accomplishment?
Nice! What are you getting it for?
That is awesome. I hope you enjoy it a lot
That is so hard. I lost both of mine. They were both 25. It can be hard.
Thats very kind of you.I bet she appreciates your help
I agree. That is why I voted for Trump.
yes we must always work towards a better future. we need to be together
That sounds boring. Why did you do that?
I bet that was scary and lonely.  I hope you turned it into a lot of fun though.  What was the project?
Why did you get rid of him?
Im sorry to hear that.  Losing a pet is tough
Yes it is! Tell him he is lucky!
That is great! Is he a household name?
That's awful that someone has so much hate in their hearts for pets.
It is unacceptable. People who abuse animals are just terrible.
Hiking in the mountains is sooooo much fun.  Especially when the wind is blowing and the pix are blowing.  Oh man, do I miss my family.
It's always a good idea to meet people while hiking.
Aw I'm sorry to hear that. How long was she's been missing for?
Aww, what kind of puppy was she?
did he get better
That is not good! You must be so worried about him.
It's not too late. After he goes to college he'll probably want to sleep in the couch.
Oh no that's hard! I think you have it figured out though. I used to sleep in a crawl space and now I use a pull cord to get comfy.
Cool, where did they go?
Have you seen any pictures posted online?
I am too, but I'm not so sure I would like Italy as a place. I'm a New York boy though. I'm sure it's beautiful!
that was nice. did you enjoy it?
That was nice. Did you enjoy your lunch?
Yes! I'm right there with you. It makes me so nervous!
I feel the exact same way. I always blast music from my car stereo.
Have you watched any movies or scary shows lately?
I'm with you on the scared side. My husband has a night light that he lights up when he wants to.
That's so nice of you. It's about time someone did something about the animal shelters!
So many people just don't think about the dogs. What kind of dog do you have?
Wow, thats horrible. I bet you were quite annoyed.
Yikes, that's scary!
Oh no! How did that happen?
Wow that's awful, did you have to get it fixed?
Oh no!  That's so gross!  I would have totally gone red in the face!
That sounds awful! Hopefully the milk was bought in a convenient way so you didn't have to go hungry!
Sounds peaceful and relaxing. What did you listen to?
I love the rain too. It always feels so relaxing.
Oh my gosh, that's terrible. Were you okay, or did you have to go in for an MRI?
Oh no, that is terrible. Were you at fault?
I have never been into gambling but I used to when I was little! I always took the high road. What happened that day?
Wow. I never really gamble so I don't know what to do with all that cash
Yes, I love the city and its history. I live in Miami now
That sounds like a blast! I'm glad you had fun.
Absolutely! limb for limb? Don't you just hate that? limb for limb?
I am sorry to hear that.
Sorry?
No worries! corrected, thank you for the catch!
I think we all have our limits. I mean, my limit is my ability to hold a conversation. After that, it's anybody's game haha.
Haha, that's funny. Well, you did you? I guess you can't really argue with that.
How do you feel about this? Are you ready?
I hope it goes well.
Of course. It's not easy. But I've known some pretty awful people in my life. My best friend for instance was a terrible roommate.
That sounds awful! What happened that night?
That's great. It's always nice when a family member pays their debts!
That is very lucky indeed!
Oh no! How did that happen?
Oh no that is horrible. I hope you are ok.
Oh man! School shopping is the worst.  I hate it!  Where did you end up shopping?
That sounds great! I'm happy to hear that. I hate having to get everything ready in advance so I hope it goes well for you.
That sounds really frustrating. I'm glad you got to start earlier this year.
That sounds awful, I am so sorry that happened to you. What was going wrong?
Oh no! Did you end up eating it all??
Oh wow! Congratulations! That is so awesome!
That must have been very challenging, and nerve-wracking to deal with.
That's the worst part, the online shopping part.  It's never bad.  I'm sure the wait will be worth it.
Well, at least online shopping has a lot of coupons!
Eek! I would have screamed!
Oh my gosh, how did you get it out?
What was too much?
I think I would decline that offer if it were me. I am allergic to deception
Well you should be very excited for him. He must really be working hard
What does his large bonus usually consist of?
I guess that was the right move then.
Wow. I would have been so pumped up if I had that kind of money.
Oh no! Was it in a year or two ago?
Oh my gosh!  That sounds traumatic!  I bet you had some good laughs though!
I'm not great but sometimes I like going over my notes to understand what's going on
Thats great, good job.
Aw, did she try to wake you up by laughing? It's cute.
Aw, did you give her a treat to make sure she wasn't doing it on purpose?
What made you want to go back to school?
Wow. That's pretty amazing. And congratulations on graduating!
Oh, that's a terrible thing. But, I guess, also a great thing that you didn't hear about or see happen often like you would have expected.
Oh that sucks! I'm sorry to hear that. But keep trying and you will get in!
That is terrible! Did you guys have fun together?
Maybe he is picking up on some desires you have.
What do you mean?
I agree. When did you start playing?
That's true! I haven't been to one in forever.
I'm with you there. I hate that too because I love riding them during the summer.
You must be so ready to get started!
I'm an engineering major, too! And I agree, my life will be much nicer once I finish school and start my career!
That's nice.  What have you been grateful for?
Aw that's really sweet of your dad to be able toiver that kind of gift.
Little brothers can be good at bowling. Does he practice a lot?
I used to when I was younger but never really got into it. I never could get into it with my parents either. Bowls are fun though.
You should call the police. I would
That is so scary!  What do you do to deal with it?
That sounds like a good strategy, even if you don't end up doing well.
Hey bowling can be fun!  If there's one thing you can count on it's having a good partner!
well, you should tell your friend and hes/her friend, that is what friends do i guess
Well, you made the right decision for you. You probably don't want to mess up your friend's feelings like that.
Aw sorry to hear that. You'll still have your good times though.
Well, you seem quite lonely. Maybe your childhood was a bit boring, because you seem quite lonely.
It's important to take some time for yourself before the school year starts, that's what got me in trouble in the first place.
That does sound hard, but I'm sure you'll do good!
It's a good time to get involved in student organizations and get involved in student life events.
That is good. Yes procrastination is bad. But you can start over next year. You know your goals.
I love when that happens. It's like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders!
That sounds like a great night. What kind of pizza did you have?
I hate that, my kids are teething, too. It's like they grow up so fast.
Oh no, how old is he?
What game is it?
I have never heard of that game.   What does it look like?
That sounds very unwell. Have you brought it up to them?
That is really frustrating. I think parents need a little tough love and to not take it out on each other.
Oh no! I remember when the power went out in mine, too.  It was awful.  The only thing I could think of was the movie "The Day After Tomorrow"--but that was a very short movie, too.
Storms can be quite scary but it's good to have a roof over your head during those times!
You definitely should do your best. homework is not fun.
That is a good attitude. I am sure you won't. I hope you will be successful.
That is good. What kind of music is it.
What kind of music did the artist make?
What kind of skills
That sounds fun though.  Does he have a good deep south cousin?
Oh yeah? What type of job is it?
Don't be nervous, you'll do great!
Oh no! That is not cool.  I hate when that happens
It happens to the best of us! You'll get that form letter back and nothing will be different lol
Ahh that's a bummer! Well at least you had a good time and it was a good time at least.
That sounds like fun!  How did you feel about the isolation?
What kind of vehicle is it?
I think you should be happy for him. What type of vehicle is it?
It can be done. Just be careful not to drive recklessly
I know the feeling. I have a feeling you are going to be driving an older clunker for a long time.
OH wow. That's pretty extreme. What happened?
Oh wow. Gas can take a while to get to.
That's the worst! What did you have to do?
Oh no! Do you think it needs a new battery?
Same, it feels so awkward!
Yeah that is me. I get really nervous and think I'm going to die!
That sounds horribly gross.
Haha that's funny. Well I am sure that was an exercise in mental strength that you all went through!
Haha, that would be awkward.  What did you do?
Haha that's pretty funny!  I would probably feel the same way if my car was on fire.
Are you able to take some from public schools?
That's awesome! What are you studying?
What was done for you to finish your service?
I'm proud of you too! What kind of military did you serve in?
What was wrong with it?
Nice! Did you use it for anything special?
Oh no that's terrible, I bet your very sad. Have you tried to talk to your parents?
I am sure it will turn back around for you soon
Oh my god. Have you told your boss about it?
I am sorry about that, I hope that you get that stain off.
Oh my gosh. I am so sorry. Are you doing alright?
That is a relief, how long ago it was?
Oh I know. I always have to go to the bathroom at the end of the day.
Some people need to do with their own toilet paper, I guess.
Who is team leader?
What do you do?
I hate roller coasters!  They are scary and so loud!
That sounds like a great time! I love Six Flags! Do you ride the rides more than the roller coasters?
That is so sweet! How many kids do you have?
It is very important to not take things for granted.
Oh no! Kids need to stay away from dangerous things!
Oh wow, I can only imagine how terrifying that must have been.
That's really annoying. Have you tried contacting the bank to have them authentic the account?
That's a bummer. You'd think they would be instantaneously verify right?
Hahaha!  I know that feeling, my friend.  I love waking up early just to go to bed.  Are you going to make it to sleep soon?
I know that feeling, I used to be an early sleeper, now I am an early riser
That doesn't sound like a good thing.
I would have went in the sink and checked to see what it was and if it was a ghost or not!
That sounds like so much fun.  How did it go?
I totally get that way too. I'm pretty bad with presenting in front of a crowd.
I am sorry to hear that. She was very important to you
I am sorry to hear that
It is always a good thing to be confident.
That's awesome. You must be feeling pretty confident in your decision making.
thats a good idea, good idea
That's cool. I always just leave my tool box with my toolkit.
Congratulations, is this your first in your career?
That sounds exciting! I hope you do well.
I am sorry to hear that. It must be very disappointing to have to say goodbye to a loved one like that.
Ooh I love the SUV platform, too! My mom had an old chevy malibu, and it was my favorite car when I was a kid!
That's a bold move!
That is awesome. I went to college for a few years and never really went anywhere.
Good things happen when youre content.
I'm with you there! Sometimes I like a good breakfast too!
thats great, what are you going to do with the money?
You're quite anxious about an unexpected expense, hu? Glad you're able to anticipate and take safety into consideration.
What did you change your view on?
Congrats, I am sure that this will make you a better person
That's great! Where is the cruise headed?
Wow that sounds amazing. Where are you going to go?
Why is that?
Wow! What kind of car?
You are such a lucky person!  I would be furious if my best friend was spending my money frivolously like that.
Aw sorry to hear that. Why didn't they?
Oh no, that really sucks! Did they say why?
Aww thats nice.  I would have done the same.
That sounds nice
Oh no! Did the bride have to pay for your dogs?
That was really nice of your friend. You guys are lucky to have eachother!
Well, at least you had some entertainment while getting some of your mind off of it.
Oh no! That sounds terrible, but I'm guessing she didn't make you feel bad about it?
Oh wow. That must be tough. How long will she be away?
That is tough, but at least she is going to school!
Wow that must have been really exciting to find that kind of stuff
That sounds wonderful!  I am sure it meant a lot to you
That's really hard.  What did you end up doing?
Oh no, I'm sorry that happened. I bet it was hard for you.
Oh no, that's unfortunate. How did it turn out?
what ended up happening
Oh no! Did he get better?
That's really great that you guys got to spend some time together, though. Did you guys catch up on each other's lives over the flu?
Oh yeah? I know how you feel. Waiting for something for someone is the worst feeling.
It is very hard to be patient when others are waiting for you.
Yes, they are. I have a little one myself.
I have two dogs myself. I love them very much as well.
aww, poor feline, i hope she recover well.
That's expensive. What are you planning to do about it?
gas station? that's a scary place to be. i hate that
gas station? that's awful. shooting in a store. that's a whole different world. glad your ok
Im sorry to hear that. How did he pass? sudden or natural causes?
Im sorry, that must have been hard. I know the feeling too well
That is no good.  Do you enjoy your alone time or do you enjoy the people around you?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have someone around you that you can talk to?
wow that must look nice
That's awesome!  It's always nice to have a new car.  Are you saving up for it?
I am sad that my friends dont take me out to eat.
Oh wow! That must be really tough
Oh no! I hate when that happens.
That is awful. Did you ask for a refund?
That sounds terrible, I hope it was an accident and not a hit and run.
Oh no. Was the other person a child or older?
She sounds like a great person.
She sounds like a great person
Whoa, that sounds scary! What was it?
Oh wow, I can relate to that, I would freak out too
That is a wonderful surprise! What kind of car?
That is a cool mom.
Shame on you.What did you do?
That's too bad. Maybe one day you will get invited.
That is not cool.  How did they do it?
Oh that is terrible! Are they your friends that pull pranks on you a lot?
What happened?
That is terrible, did you find it ok?
That is a very good feeling
I'm so happy for you! Cuba is a wonderful place!
Why?
Wow. Why would she do that?
Awwww.  Maybe you can go the next day and see it?
Aww man. I am sorry.  Maybe you can go next weekend?
i love vacations
Sounds nice! Was it nice and relaxing? I've always wanted to go to the beach!
Wow, that sounds like a great time! Where are you going?
Wow. Caribbean sounds like an amazing time.
Oh no, what happened next?
I know that feeling! I have such a craving for chocolate now. Did you have any left when you got home?
That's great! Cancer free is such a great accomplishment. I bet he is so happy.
That's great to hear. Cancer patients are really tough.
Wow that sounds like he needs to relax and maybe get a divorce.
Wow! I would be furious! You should tell him to hurry up
Good luck. Whats the job?
Those are always good. Have you been doing this for awhile?
That's annoying.  I'm glad you don't have to deal with that.
You can always tell them to get off it is.
Life can be weird like that sometimes. Was it a performance review? Was it for work?
I'm guessing this was at least a "nice" job?
Yes I have 3 children. I am happy that summer is almost over.
Yes. I do have children. It is a relief. I attend High school and College. Yes, I do attend School.
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that! Death is never easy for anyone.
Thats good of you to say.  I dont think people realize just how vulnerable they are when they lose someone.  It is tragic and devastating.
16th birthday is crazy, almost 16 years old now.
That is pretty crazy.
I can understand. Kids can be pretty argumentative.
Its natural to be a little angry. But, you should never reason with your emotions.
I hate it when that happens.
Holy cow that's awful. I'm glad you got that guy and his family some money. That's a terrible story to tell.
Where did you guys go?
That's awesome!  Where did you go?
haha, yeah thats happened to me before too, but its funny the first time.  You tripped over the cord, didnt you?
Haha that's a funny story.
That's sad. Was it a really expensive one?
I am so sorry to hear that. It must have been so sudden.
What did he do?
That's annoying, especially when it is something a child should have known better.
That must be fun, how often do you sneak it out?
Aw that's sweet. I love sneaking away treats like that.
At least the dogs are being helpful.
Oh that stinks! Well at least its getting better!
That is great! nursing school is great.
That is awesome! nursing is very under-appreciated.
Oh that's so sweet!  Did you get it on video?
That's so sweet! What flavor was it?
That must have been so nostalgic.
That's awesome. Was it a surprise?
AC is the worst! Do you have a fan or a fan in case you get stuck somewhere.
Wow. That must be terrifying. AC in this heat is unforunate.
That's great! Are you all going to be able to stay in one place for a while?
Great, how far away are you moving?
Congrats! I've been trying for a few months but it's definitely a lot of work.
I do conditioning and strength work out
What'd you do?
That's great! It's nice to know he has been helpful like that.
Why is that?
Great news! What does he do?
yea i know. mine is almost a year old
That's amazing! It is amazing to watch our kids grow up, it is an amazing experience.
Wow that must've been scary!
That is so scary! I am glad that no one got hurt
That's great!  It feels nice to have a clean home.  Baby can sleep for up to 8 days!
That is nice. How old is he?
That happens sometimes but you can always start again tomorrow
Staying with it is the important step!
Why? What is the problem?
That is a tough situation. You should talk to him.
That is nice. How old are they?
I wish I could go on a vacation like that!
That's great! I love new dogs, they're so much fun!
I love dogs!  What type of dog is she?
Aw, that's a bummer. Maybe you can take a tour?
Yeah it can be hard moving away from your loved ones place.  Are you going to have any sort of activities or go hiking?
That's really awesome! I'm a bit jealous.
That's great. I am a bit jealous. I have always wanted to play soccer.
Im sorry to hear that. I hope that something good is happening for you.
I hope it starts helping soon.
I am sorry to hear about your father's passing. That must have been really hard.
I'm so sorry to hear about your father's passing. I am glad you had a good time while he was alive. Take care of yourself and your mother!
junk food can be healthy if you make sure to portion it out
Aw that's too bad. I think if you're really dedicated, you could make a change like dieting or fitness and you'd look way better.
That is terrible. Why didn't you get it?
Wow that's sleazy. I hope the police can help you.
Oh, naughty cat.
Oh no!  What did you do?
That is awesome! I bet he is so happy!
I know it's really cool when those early moments come and go. You should be proud of him and show him how to be a man.
I am sorry to hear that.  What happened?
That sucks. Well at least you two got to have a concert. That's something.
That's not a fun thing to do. Did they have water?
That's gross. Did you tell the family?
I can understand that
That is very fortunate. I know exactly what you mean.
Thats impressive. I bet that was a lot of study. How did you do it?
Wow, what do you think you did great?
I am sure it is, but it could also mean it will arrive faster. I'm waiting on a new computer also but not too excited.
Oh no! What kind of computer is it?
Yeah, I once or twice.  How did it feel?
Oh my word! That's the worst, what did you do?
That sounds very metal. I went to one before too and it was very emotional too.
Oh that sucks! Sorry to hear that.
Very true! Has it ever happened to you?
Hm sounds like it worked out for you guys :)
Oh that's unfortunate, is it a growth spasm or something worse?
Oh no! I hate to hear that. I hope he is in a better place now.
Hahaha! Same. I used to go to the old Holiday specials as a kid!
That sounds like a lot of fun! I remember the same thing with the old Star Wars movies!
That's pretty exciting. Did you have fun?
that sounds awesome.
I'm glad you had a place to do that.
Oh no, that is so sad. Did you keep it in a safe place?
Thats really sweet of you. I know it is difficult to lose someone so special
Yeah I know what you mean
That sounds tough, but I'm glad you took the stand and told your girlfriend to ease up. I'm sure everything ended up being ok.
Why is that?
I am sorry, heights are scary
Wow that sounds like it could be scary, do you go in too it often?
Oh wow that does sound like an exciting time though
Sorry to hear that. Are you ok?
I am sorry to hear that.
Did you experience any?
Haha I can understand the fear-inducing qualities of some. But I think it's fun to go and have fun! I think it's more about the experience of going into one, rather than the destination.
Oh, that's not fun. Have you talked to her about it?
How does she snore? I have never even knew there was a term for it
That is cool.  What does it look like?
thats awesome.. was there any prize?
That's great! Do you have any kids in college?
Oh nice! Have you decided on a name yet?
Sounds exciting! Where ya headed?
Sounds exciting! Are you going to see a movie there?
That sounds lonely.
I bet that was a relief.  How did you cope?
That's impressive, how do you think you did?
That is great!  I hope you do well on the test!
Where did she go
That is so sad. Did she say how it happened?
That's a great feeling!  It's the best feeling in the world I'm sure!
good for you, where is that?
That's great, how long will you be on for?
awesome! I love to hear about great interviews.   Are you nervous?
did you get in trouble?
It's cool.  I love playing pool.
Aw man.  That is pretty darn bad.  Have you tried to find out the reasons why?
I'm sorry to hear that, I know how you feel, I have a friend with the same issue.
That is a good attitude to have.
That's wonderful that you know things will work out.
That is great to hear! What did she major in?
That's great that she is going through that. It can really take a lot of determination!
That is a beautiful way to be. You are free to do what you want as long as no one is around to disturb you.
That is so true. You need to find your own companionship.
That is disgusting
Oh no, I hate to hear that. That is so gross
A boy for what?
That's great, I also have a boy and want a boy.
That was so nice! What kind of car did you get?
It is nice that your parents were able to help you out like that.  They are usually not so lucky.
That sounds fun! Were you nervous about it?
That sounds fun, where did you go?
Wow, impressive! Where did she fly to?
Must have been a sight to see.
Why's that?
oh thats good
I hate when car mechanics say what they want.  I had to fix my anissan for way more than I was willing to spend
Wowza! That sure is frustrating!
That's awesome!  Congratulations!  Boy or girl?
Congratulations!  I'm sure the first few days are going to be amazing!
That's great! I have never flown before, so that's exciting for me.
Congrats! That sounds like a lot of fun.
Oh man I hate to hear that! What did she do?
I would be so sad. I hope she didn't cheat on you.
Wow congrats! I love babies. Do you want a girl?
Wow, that is so exciting! I have two boys on the way, they're almost a year apart.
That sounds really exciting. How did it go?
Oh wow. How did you feel about it?
Wow, that is a long time ago! Did you have fun seeing him play?
I am so sorry, that is such a horrible thing to lose a pet
Wow! That's... interesting. Well, I suppose, you just never know what kind of people a person can be. I'm sorry you're in that situation now - but maybe things will work out for you, and things will work out for her, who knows.
Wow, she must've really been devastated. You should've went with her.
Oh no! That is awful. Did you find anything?
Wow. You should've went straight to him and used him as a washroom stopper.
That is awesome.  I think everyone deserves a child.
Congratulations! That is exciting!  Do you feel nervous?
That's awful! I'm sorry to hear that.
I am sorry that happened.
Are you in the class?
Wow that's awesome, I'm glad to hear she has pipes too.
Oh my goodness! How long have you been trapped in an elevator?
I would have been terrified!
Congratulations on the home you got.
That is nice! I am glad that you have a new home to enjoy!
That's pretty crazy, considering he's the one who usually does most of the chores.
That sounds like a problem.
That's cool. What did they say?
He's doing good. He must be one of the most beloved youth leaders in the world.
I know the feeling. It is the worst feeling.
I know the feeling! repeated repeating yourself is the worst
That sounds wonderful! What kind of movies do you like to see?
That sounds so fun! I'm happy for you guys
It sure was. How did it make you feel when you took the final exam?
What are you studying?
Sorry to hear that. What job was it?
Aw, that sucks! Did they get the job?
oh no what happened?
I do not like those places either
Uh oh! Hopefully no one saw you do it or it got messy.
Oh no! Did you end up telling her what happened?
Are you moving to a new place?
That is exciting.  Do you mean affordable in terms of space or income?
I bet you did great! What did you have emergency come up over?
It's great you have family!
oh no. were they just not nice about it
Oh well at least you didn't pass out.
Congrats! It is always nice when our kids get good grades!
It is weird the amount of changes that happen in an 8th grade.  Does he have a college in mind?
That is customer service in a nutshell.
Customer service is very important in today's world. People can be so rude
Oh? Do you always notice them?
I understand what you mean. It's annoying when you see people with tons of friends on facebook. It's sad.
I love swimming.  I can be a little overboard though.
I can imagine! I wish I could swim like you!
She is most grateful for you, good man.
Aww, that is so sweet of you. soup can be so nerdy.
What do they do for you to be grateful?
It is always nice to have family that is helpful.
Was it your birthday?
That's really awesome! Was it your birthday?
damn.. did any of the people in your yard get hurt?
Oh no! I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.
that's amazing!
You must have felt so proud of your dog.
Oh no. That is terrible.
That really stinks. You don't have a great group of friends?
Does he at least treat his job well?
I would too. I am currently in the same situation. It sucks.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you complain to the restaurant?
What kind of food was it
Why were you anxious
I hate rollercoasters too.
That is terrible, i hate when friends make fun of each other
That is terrible! Did you let him know it upset you?
why not join facebook groups
I know exactly what you mean. My best friend moved to New Zealand because he was lonely. I am here and there are so many people but no one to know or hang out with.
I can understand how you would feel that way. Is there any chance for you to get to talk to them again?
That sucks, have you talked to them about your feelings?
I have never seen the movie, did you enjoy it?
I have never even heard of that movie.  What was it about?
Oh, I'm very sorry!  I've lost both of mine, so I understand how you feel.
Sorry to hear that. How are you holding up?
why is that?
Well sometimes people get attached to a certain somebody. Maybe it was for the better you know.
Sounds like a wonderful time! Was it your first time?
Sounds amazing! I love the beach!
I feel the same way.  When someone talks down to me, it makes me angry.
i know how you feel. I dont know how some people are able to say some things to others
Thats great.  When family comes together its always nice.  Do you have a large family?
I totally hear you there. My family is the best!
That must've been fun! What was the occasion?
That sounds like so much fun. Was it your birthday?
Me too.  I hate it when it happens.   People can be so hurtful.
I know what you mean.  World is definitely not good now!
Why don't they pay you attention?
Have you tried talking to them?
That is terrible. What did you do?
That really stinks, I hope it is just a cheap accident and nothing to be worried about.
That's just rude, I think!
That sounds pretty rude honestly. I don't understand why people have to act that way.
What trouble do you get into?
Same here! I try to be but it can be tough. Has it happened recently?
Congratulations! That's an accomplishment you and your family should be proud of.
That is so exciting and exciting! I am sure your doing a great job.
Oh, don't worry. I never go.
I hate the dentist too. I'm glad you're going to avoid it.
It is good to have friends like this
It is really hard to get a dream job, I was really lucky.
Haha, I have no reason to not try, I have faith that everything in life will be just like my picture
That sounds like a very familiar outcome.
That must've been exciting!  Did you have a good time with it?
Congratulation. What kind of car did you decide on?
Toyota makes great cars
I would have died!!
I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds terrifying! What did you do?
That is very nice. You are very lucky to have such a neighbor.
She must work for an AAA group.
Oregon is a great place! I'll have to try it out, sounds interesting.
People in NC are really nice. Makes me wish I lived there. I'll have to give it a shot!
That sucks so much.  I'm sorry.
Sorry to hear that.  I know it must make you feel terrible, but remembering the good times can help you through the pain.
time for Plan B
Lightening is very scary. I hope you stay inside.
did you enjoy it? i love family time
That must be nice to have time to unwind
Sounds lovely. Unpacking can be hectic, but it can also be productive.
Sounds like a lovely night.
How is it split?  I don't see it.  I see two extremes.
Unfortunately, i agree with you. There are too many people who hate each other and everything is falling apart.
I'm sorry for your loss.  It must be very tough for you.
I'm really sorry for your loss. That sounds like a really tough thing to deal with. I hope things get better for you guys in the future.
Oh no.  What's going on?
Oh that stinks. Did you make it up to her?
Awesome! Have you been looking forward to it?
No, who is that?
Wow, that's impressive. What did you expect from that?
Wow, that sounds like she's trying to do a good job. I'm sorry you're having such a hard time.
Oh wow. Are you excited for them?
I imagine this is a happy place for you.
Oh man, did you end up going?
I love Virginia Beach! My aunt lives there!
Did you go on any cool vacations?
Wow. How did you do that?
Well, at least you won. That's something.
That is so awesome!  You must be so proud of him!
I'm so happy for you!  What will the bonus be?
That's nice! How old is your son?
That is great! He must be so happy!
That's the worst... I hate it when you can't get anyone to agree to places for family. Are they refusing to go to places for your family?
You should talk with your family member to see what he likes.  My suggestion is to just keep trying until you get one that everyone likes.  It's what I do
What is a PB&J?
Me too! What do you have planned for this weekend? :)
4 10 hours sounds about right. Are you going to have any fun plans?
That's disappointing.  Have you ever fought with your friend?
Maybe you can work on your friendship, or work on your relationship in general.
Oh no! Is the doctor promising anything more?
Oh no! I have MS and that is terrible. I hope you do well and avoid the autoimmune issues too.
That is scary!  Was there damage to your house or did it just scare you?
Oh god! Are you okay?
That must have been a pleasant surprise! A nice gesture by him.
That's awesome. I bet you were so happy.
Me too! What does your favorite holiday have to do with your favorite season?
I completely understand. I miss my mom's Christmas and New Years as well
That is awesome that you have a great sibling-in-law.  How old is she/he?
Sounds like a good person. It's nice to have someone that is there for you no matter what,
That's too bad. The weather should have been better for your vacation.
Wow that sounds awful! Hopefully it wasn't too long!
Well congratulations to you both!
That's awesome, good for you both for putting in the work! What type of work does he do?
That's good that you trusted your father with the pets!
That's a fair point. I'm sure they had a hard time choosing which animal to leave and which one not.
Did it ever come true?
Is it something that can be redone, or still a problem?
Oh my gosh! That's so scary! Did you figure out what it was?
That would be so scary!  I think only in movies does it actually look like that.
That's sounds like a wonderful time. What movie did you see?
That's good, how did you enjoy the movie?
That is unfortunate. I am sorry for your loss
That is so sad. I'm so sorry for your loss.
Did you guys ever end up talking about the situation together>
It would make things worse for her.  I would tell her.
That is a horrible thing to hear. Have you followed up with your doctor?
Oh no! Lupus is such a horrible disease to mess up! I hope everything works out for you.
That would really annoy me. It's like she thinks her boss can do better.
That is annoying indeed. She doesn't seem to understand that her coworkers are not always perfect
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. How is she feeling?
Oh no.  How did she get cat syndrome at that age?
That's awesome! What are you going to do with the winnings?
That's pretty cool.  I like to play the lottery sometimes, but usually don't win.  What do you plan on doing with the winnings?
That is a lot of money
Oh no! What happened?!
Oh no! How did that make you feel?
Ah, yes, I understand what you mean. Alcoholics need help too!
Oh no. Did you end up helping her get out of the house?
Oh no! What happened?
wow that is crazy!
Wow that's crazy! I would have thought knocking it down would make people mad.
Well it's a good idea at least.
I do love mexican food!
Oh that is tough. I am sure she misses you and that food!
Ohhh, I'm sure you'll do great! What is the class?
You should do great. What is your major?
Oh I love hockey. Were the opposing team pretty good?
Oh I love hockey! Have you gone to a lot of home games? I went to a couple recently.
That sounds scary
Central texas represent! We actually don't have many coyotes here but they are definitely more common then other places I've lived. I don't blame you for being worried. What kind of dog was it? Was it a big one that you saw earlier?
That is terrible news to hear.
Oh man! Im so sorry. That has to be awful.  Mine passed away recently too.  Hang in there....
I would hate that. Have you tried looking for hobbies to take your mind off of things?
Haha yeah, sounds like a good idea!
That's great news indeed!
Congratulations! That is great news. Your life will be much better off in a few months.
That is great, an A is great and she has accomplished something!
Oh no! I know how that can be! Did someone give you a hard time?
Oh no! I've been there before! What kind of sweet did you ate? And what kind were you?
Did you get out and check it out?
Oh no. That sounds scary.
That sucks. I loved that show when I was little.
I've never heard of this but I'm definitely going to check it out.
That sounds nice. What show is it?
She needs more sleep
Oh no! Why would they move away from Texas?
That is huge.  Do you think the change will be bearable?
That must be nice, to have a new place to live
That's great, it's always nice to have some kids around.
Oh yeah? What do you think is going to happen?
Oh that's the worst! I hate when that happens!
Oh my, did you feed it?
That is great! tabby's are so sweet.
Oh no, I hope you called the right person.
Oh, I hate when that happens! I bet you were mortified!
That's awesome! How far along is she?
That is so awesome! I love babies. Do you have any kids of your own?
Really? Where do you live?
That's interesting. Did you have fun?
Oh no, that's horrible. How many people did you lost?
I am so sorry to hear about that, it must have been awful.
Oh my, how did you find your friend?
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you hitchhike the truck or ride in the car?
That's cool. How'd it go?
That's great, how old is she
What movie? I'm too afraid of the internet right now!
I can't stand gory movies!
That sounds very nostalgic
Ha ha, you must be feeling nostalgic, maybe try joining an interest group?
Well, atleast you have some good friends!
Maybe you can set up a meet up with people at your job?
Why did you run into him?
I would have gotten up and run some fast.
Oh that is cool! You must be proud.
Mustangs are awesom.
wow! are you excited?
I wish I could afford a vacation like that!
Thats great. Are you doing it alone or with friends?
That sounds like so much fun!
That sounds really fun and like an all around good idea.
That would make me feel even worse. I am sorry.
That is terrible.  There is nothing worse than someone expecting too much from someone else.
Im sorry to hear that but I bet it was fun. Where did you guys go?
I am sorry for your loss. Where did you guys go?
I don't think I could win that much money. Was it a scratch off?
I splurge a lot but it's never enough  lol. What kind of lottery ticket did you buy?
Wow! You must be so proud of him! I wish I was more like him!
That's cool. What was the award for?
Wow... That is really something to be proud of! Good for you! What was the award for?
Oh no, that's mean. I wouldn't want my boss to do that to me either.
That is so annoying! I would be furious!
I'm sorry.  That's one gift for a grown man right?
Well that's nice. It's good that your husband bought the gifts for him and not your cousin.
Oh no! Did any of the people there notice?
Oh no. Did anyone notice?
That is great.  I am glad you both can do it
yes i agree
That is scary! How far did you fall?
Oh no! I hope you are ok! Was it scary?
Aw, that sucks. I'm sorry. Do you stay in contact with him at least?
I am sorry that you feel lonely.
Yeah, that is tough, but I guess that is life. You can't always be prepared for it.
Yeah I understand that
That's great! ACT is a great score.
ACT is a tough school to get into. What helped you?
Where are you going?
I am so happy you got to enjoy such a wonderful and relaxing vacation.
Where did you go? What happened?
You should've been more honest with her. What did you lie about?
That's cool. Did you win it at a contest?
Oh that's great! I've never been to Florida.
Oh really, how much was it?
What did you do with the winnings?
oh no. where did they move?
Maybe you can call them and find out where they live?
Oh my goodness, so people like that are dangerous, wreckless drivers.
Did they ever apologise to you?
Did he come back with a new dog?
I bet you were super excited for him to come back home with you
thats great, i hope nothing changes, that is the worst part
I am happy for you! I am proud of my wife and kids as well.
what was it
Oh that is so nice! Who did you receive it from?
That really sucks... Did she even apologize?
That's such a heavy thing to throw in there, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I know how hard that can be for everyone, but it must be so difficult for you as well.
Oh no that is horrible! I'm sorry to hear that, I know how hard that can be for parents.
I haven't, is it good?
I've never seen it. I always thought it was too scary for me.
Oh really? Did they take down everything?
What kind of toys r u referring too
Was it last weekend? If so I'm sure she will understand.
Oh no that is tough. Hopefully she will forgive you.
That is awesome!  How long have you been together?
Sounds like a great relationship
I understand, I am sure it can be tough
I understand. I have same issue.
Well, happy birthday to him!
That is so exciting. Are you excited?
Yes, it is very nostalgic. I love that as well.
Yeah, I think the same. It's like Christmas without the presents.
Oh no! Are you okay?
Oh I hate storms! Are you at an airport or somewhere else?
What game is that?
WoW is an amazing game! What are your plans for this Monday?
Congratulations, you must be excited!
Congratulations! It's always nice when a good story gets told.
That's a nice idea. Maybe the kids can see them?
Yeah that is a bummer but at least it's organized.
Oh wow! I am so sorry about that. Will you be okay?
im sorry to hear that, i hope it turns out well for you, maybe you should get a second opinion
Congratulations! That's a big accomplishment!
That is great, did she have to buy diapers?
Aw, what kind of puppy is it?
Aw, that's nice. I love dogs too. They are so sweet.
Good for you.I bet your really excited about getting a degree.
Wow. That's quite a big amount.
I know what you mean. I hate it when that happens.
I know it can be silly, but did he offer to buy you the game?
That's a good movie! I loved it when I was a kid
I remember that movie too! The graphics look so old now!
What about 5?
Sorry, I meant in the past. How are you doing today?
Oh no.  How far away is she moving?  I hope it wasn't too far
Oh no, what's wrong?
I'm so sorry! That is a tough situation. I know you will find another job so don't stress it.
Oh really? Why is that?
Yea it makes me sad too. Hopefully things will get better in the future.
That is no good. Do you live alone?
I'm so sorry. Maybe you should move closer to them next time?
Oh no, that sounds horrible.
Oh, no I hope that he gets some relief from that!
I'm so sorry to hear that. How old was he?
Im so sorry. i know how hard it can be.  My pit died a year ago and it hurts to think about it.
Oh yeah, I remember that feeling.  I think I remember that feeling vividly.
I agree, that is the worst! Especially in the summer.
Wow, that is awesome.  Did you keep it?
Wow, that is pretty lucky
Did you kill it?
Wow that must have been really scary. Did you kill it?
Oh no, that is rough. Good luck!
That is definitely a stressful time but I'm sure you will be fine!
Oh no, you must be nervous!
Have you had trouble with it before? I know it can be nerve racking but once down pat you start to remember all the steps.
Sell what? Everything?
That's great! What kind of stuff did you need?
I am glad you have that kind of relationship.
That is a great thing to have in a relationship. Faithfulness is very important
Oh no, I am so sorry for your loss. Are you and your family ok?
Wow, glad to hear it wasnt as bad as you think!
Oh wow, that's quite an interruption! I hope you at least enjoyed the flight.
That's really frustrating that they would take their word over anyone else.
that was really cool of your teacher
That's cool. It sounds like you have a bright future ahead of you.
I do too, the fishing spots are very nostalgic.
I haven't done much fishing in a while. I used to enjoy it when I was a kid, but haven't gone in forever.
That's the worst. I know how it feels, what with having to clean the plates and all
That's the worst.  I've done that before.
Oh no I'm sorry to hear that but glad it wasn't something you did on purpose! I'm sure it will never happen again so don't feel embarrassed about it!
Oh wow! That is impressive. I guess people are more concerned about keeping cool than actually being careful!
Wow! I can't wait either! I will be watching the Orange Bowl.
Roll Tide
Oh no. What did you do?
Oh no, I hate when that happens. I bet it smelled awful.
What was the occasion?
Wow that's awesome, I can't believe my friend did that either. Well done to him, that is a great accomplishment.
That is so cool! It was a realised kindness from him, I am so glad you got to have that bag!
That is such a lovely story, I'm so glad he was there to help!
That would really anger me too. I am glad your neighbors are cool with it.
That is ridiculous! I don't think the laws are the same for everybody!
It won't be too expensive but will be a pain.
That is a bummer. At least your not in the financial struggle anymore.
Oh no! Did you confront them?
That is horrible. I don't know where people get their inspiration to do such a thing.
Wow how exciting. I bet you were super nervous.
Wow that is so impressive! You must have been pretty proud of yourself and your knowledge!
That is wild. What size was the band, and how many people were in it?
That's amazing, they sound incredible live.  What a great band.
That is pretty awesome! How long did you bowl for?
I've always bowed with my left hand. I feel like a dummy
Ew, that sounds like a disgusting situation.
That sounds horrible!
Phase in your life? That's exciting. I hope it's a good thing for you.
That is great! Debt is a drag.
What was the mistake?
I think you do too.  If you're trying to learn from your mistake and stay committed, you'll be far more successful in the long run.
That's great. You must have prepared very well for this upcoming school year.
I'm sure you will be fine
That is great. I wish more people would be like that.
That sounds like quite the opposite situation. You can feel quite content and at ease while still having something to be envious of.
Did you pull your hair out and try to use it to reach the bowling net?
That sounds like quite a bit of bowling! Do you usually bowling?
Heck yeah! I own a 2014 4runner! Best car ever!
Haha, I don't blame you! I would be so jealous too if I had a new car, I love older cars!
What kind of car did you get?
That's great! What kind of car did you get?
Yeah I love those nostalgic feelings. What was the playlist?
I grew up in the 80s so I know what you mean.  I love the 80s too!
Oh my!  I bet that is so scary.  I remember when I was admitted to the hospital for chest surgery I was pacing around like crazy.  What a difference a year makes.
oh that is horrible, i hope he will be ok. the wait is killing you!
That must make you feel so good! I am so happy for you!
I bet that is so much better than your old place.
Did you apologize to them?
That would be so awkward. I'm sure everyone could see that it was a mistake.
Family reunions are the best.  I hope it goes well. Are you going to be there?
Family reunions are so much fun.  Do they usually last for very long?
I would be too! That is awesome! How long did it take?
That's great, what gym was it?
You sound very excited. It's always a great feeling to be on top of things.
that is good i bet you will feel great once you get the hang of it
That sounds really cool! I really want one of those! What color is it?
Fun fact : His first name is actually Don!
Oh man, that's not a good idea...
That is pretty funny hahah
They sound like jerkoms, what did you do?
If it helps at least, try some slower songs. It really helps me relax!
That sounds creepy
Haha that would be so annoying! I bet it was something gross!
That's great. I hope you have a good time.
That's so cool. I hope you guys have a great time!
Yeah, I love those times too. What exactly do you think about?
That's so sad! Do you get to talk to your neighbor often?
That's great, you must be so happy right now
I agree, I feel like I have so many chances to get a good offer too. So keep looking.
That must have frightened you!
I've lived in a wheelchair my whole life. I can vouch for their abilities.
control what?
You're definitely gonna need to see the doctor to help with that weight.
That must be nice!  What kind?
That is a nice car! What kind of chevy is it?
I do not blame you. I do not know what to do either.
Ah ok. Well make sure you call him. He may be answering there.
That's great! What will you be doing there?
I am sure you will have an awesome time.  Are you moving somewhere new?
OH no.  Was it a stranger or someone you knew?
Oh wow, that is terrible.  Did they take anything important?
that's awesome. i wish i had that feeling
I agree.  I was so grateful when I had food on my table as well.
That sounds so awesome! I love patterns! You should sell them.
That's pretty neat! I don't have any kids yet, but I've always wanted a sawing machine and want to have one eventually. I just use a few needles and thread them together.
That sounds great! I hope you two have an amazing time!
Scotland is beautiful. I have never been but i would like to.
That is so true.  I think it is in our blood
It's nice to hear that. It's one of the most important things to be grateful for
Aw, that's sweet. What kind of dog is she?
I do not. I really like dogs, but I have never owned one.
Oh I feel for you! I start school Monday and it never goes back.
Oh man, I hate summer, I'm so ready to get back to work.
I think everyone does it to some degree, it's how we become the best we can.
Yeah I know how that feels, i get a little guilty when i think about how i could have been much more careful.
That is wonderful! I bet you are prepared for everything that is ahead of you.
That's the spirit! You got this. You got this
That's amazing. What kind of car?
That sounds so awesome! I wish he gets to have a vehicle so soon so he can be able to enjoy it as much as me :) SUV's are really cool looking
That's great! I love making car upgrades myself so when you have the cash, do it! What kind of car is it?
Buying used is sometimes more money.
Were you hurt?
Oh, man, I can imagine how terrifying that must have been! Did you guys get home safely?
I can imagine. It's hard when they are young and you feel them out
I feel you!  I'm a parent and I feel the same way.  30 is still pretty young for me. I still look at my kids baby photos almost daily.
ve actually made some changes for the better lately.
Oh no! accidentally hitting enter is the worst. I always double check to make sure I'm still on the enter key.
That sounds like fun! Was it something you really were looking forward to?
Wow that sounds really healthy.
Oh that sounds delicious! I need to go to indian restaurants more often.
That is awesome. I will definitely have to try that sometime.
Why did he do that?
Oh god, that's terrible! Did your dad help you out?
I would be too! Did he have to go to the ER?
I would puke too if my step dad showed me a cut. cut off his pants or something lol
Wow that's crazy. That certainly takes a toll on one's life. It seems like he wanted to take his own life, and to do it with style.
Yes it is sad that he went through this. I felt the same way when I heard about celebrity.
I agree. The problem is society seems to view them as second class and do not care about them.
Aww, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever been able to visit her at least?
I bet that was so exciting and nostalgic for both of you.
Wow, you must've felt so proud, that you were able to witness that epic moment live.
Haha, I remember doing the same when I was in college and going to a football game. I was a football fan but I hated the boring boring boring boring football matches. I hope you got a refund though!
Wow. That's very interesting.
Yeah, the teachers in my school are terrible. I don't blame them.
Wow, that sounds like an awful thing to do to you.
That does sound like a very effective security system.
Thats great! How old is he?
That's great. How old is he?
That sounds peaceful.
I can relate, it's good to be reminded what a peaceful time feels like.
Oh, lucky you! That would have been freaking scary
What type of cat was it?
That's so great! You sound like an incredible person.
Wow, she is amazing! I am so happy for her.
What is that?
Hulu is my absolute favorite! I can't wait to try it!
that is horrible!
That's horrible.  I hope it wasn't a stray or someone you knew?
That's awful. I lost both of mine in a fire.
i lost one and one and one and one.... im so sorry for your lost one as well!
That is very thoughtful! Did you get lots of presents?
That's awesome! Did you get a lot of presents?
Oh, Do you think the orders will be delivered by the end of the week?
Oh, wow. That's kind of odd. The military likes to make things complicated so that they feel like they have to make things as tough as possible for them, but they're also looking for other things to do. I hope everything works out!
I know what you mean!  Have you ever been to an animal shelter?
People are animals, what do you expect?
I do the same thing with my Christmases.
That's a good way of looking at it. I think about my childhood all the time, what great times we had.
I have a friend who does that.  I think it's because they are so broke.  It makes me feel disinterested in their spending habits.
That's crazy! I spend about that much on groceries myself
Congratulation! where are you moving to?
Wow! Are you moving to a new place?
Oh no, that's awful! I hope it's not going to be one...
That's good, it can be a lot of stress.
That is awesome. twin siblings!
That is great, I have two great family members.
Oh my god, is she just a puppy or is she really old?
I would be nervous too!  I have two dogs and they are easily frightened and run to the bathroom without cleaning
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing family is always hard.
That's terrible! My grandmother passed a few years ago and I still get nostalgic thinking about her.  I loved playing games with her.
You're so lucky! I would be so worried...
That is so great that they were able to help you.  It must have been stressful.
I know how you feel, I'm working on a suitcase as we speak. Hopefully all goes well for you.
Are you worried about being out in the elements?
thats awesome, happy marriage is the best feeling! how long were u together
It's always good to have the right people in your life. You're lucky to have a good partner.
That must have been a nice surprise.
That sounds really nostalgic. I love old pop and punk songs.
Did you study for it?
Did you study hard for it?
You seem to be an avid sports fan. Did you win anything else in the game?
What is the PGA championship?
Wow, that's amazing. What is the course?
it sure is. it would be fun to teach someone how to free fall as well
I'm in Florida. It really is an amazing sport. I just wish there was more interest in it in the US.
Oh that is cool, do yall still have each other?
Oh wow! That's a nice motto
Oh my gosh! That is the worst. I hope you didn't get too mad at them.
Wow! I am sorry to hear that. It is nice to be able to find what you like and can afford.
That is horrible news.  What happened?
Oh no that's horrible! I'm sorry to hear that! Are you going to get a new one?
Do you ever get scared?
that sounds like you trust him.. how long has it been?
I bet. That takes a lot of discipline to accomplish.
Congratulations! You sound smart! Which doctorate did you go to?
Where did she go?
AOK!  Well, I hope she likes her new country
Oh no, that sounds awful.  Are you doing this for vacation?
I bet you are relieved.  What country are you going to?
Oh no! How long did it take?
Wow. I bet that's embarrassing
Oh no, what happened?
That's always tough to deal with. I hope you're getting better at handling those mistakes in the future.
Haha.. that is embarrassing.  Did anyone say anything
Oh no!  Did they laugh at you?
Oh wow. I bet she will miss you a lot?
That would be a bit boring. Do you enjoy her being away? You could always watch a movie or something.
That must have been very scary for you.
I can imagine. But, sometimes it is good to be alone.
Yuck, I know the feeling too well. You're in college, you don't have to worry about roommates
What happened to the other things?
That's cool, I've driven from Louisiana to Indiana in the winter. It's not the greatest, but it's fun.
You are very lucky
That's terrible, I hope you were able to take care of her.
I hope she feels better soon. Did you take her to the doctor to get checked out?
Oh yea? What were you doing all summer?
Oh that sucks. Well hopefully summer is better for you then.
That's not good!  How does she lose so much weight?
Oh no. That sounds awful! I can't even imagine what you're going through.
Oh I feel you. I've been there before. I hate losing at all cost.
I completely understand that.  I'm in the same boat as you.  It's so disheartening to see your hard work rewarded but then you get crushed.
Why is that?
That is awesome.  Where are you going to go in November?
That's so sad.  How did they lose them?
That is horrible!  I'm so sorry.  I hope they are in good hands.  How did the news make you upset?
Aw, I'm sorry. That must be hard. Have you tried encouraging her to go outside?
Aw I love dogs! I have a rescue dog that lives with me. She's beautiful.
I can imagine! I'm sorry you had to go through that. At least you had her with you.
Oh wow, that must've been quite an adventure. At least you guys managed to make it through the tough parts of it.
That was kind of them. They are good at giving and helping.
That's really awesome that they were able to lend you a little extra.
I bet that must be really hard to do.  When I get the chance, I hope to visit my parents.  Where are they living?
That is such a sweet story. I bet you are really happy!
I am the same way! They are so creepy! I can't stand them. Especially if they are in my kitchen!
Yeah spiders are actually kinda cool to watch, if you know how to deal with them.
Was that something you were really looking forward to?
That's great! Did you get any neat gifts?
That would annoy me too. Why does he do that?
I feel you. If my kids were any more coordinated I would never be able to get anything done.
Were you nervous? What happened next?
Wow, that is unfortunate. I guess you had a right to be there.
that must have been annoying
haha, that's great, at least you got your money back, right?
Oh no! I hate when that happens
I hate when that happens!  I'm sorry!
Why do you feel surprised?
That's nice! What did he give you?
Oh no, I'm so sorry. Beagles are such great companions!
Aww, poor Beagle. I hope you are finding another pet to fill in the void.
No, I do not! I'm still a cat person though.  My cat is kinda elderly :) But I do want a cat someday.
I have a little dog and I love taking her in. It's so rewarding!
why does he scare you?
Haha! You can get good chili, but putting chili in a chilli? HMMMMMMM!
Did he do well?
Thats great!
Good for you!
what marathon are you running?
You should go easy on her, talk to her about why you are socially awkward.
Local mom's are amazing! I hope it goes well for you!
That sounds like so much fun!
That's a lot of places! What kind of butterflies? Emeralds? Emerald butterflies? And what did the butterflies taste like?
Well, I think if you believe in yourself, you can do whatever you want!
You'll get there, don't you worry!
Yes, I was rear ended at a stop light the other day.
Oh no! I haven't been in one yet, but I've watched a bunch of youtube videos of people falling off. I'm sure it's terrifying
That is so sad. I am sorry.
That is terrible, I feel for you.
How about you actually contributing?
How are they going to do that? By not telling you?
I haven't. Have you?
Wow. That has happened to me. To be honest, i am not sure I could deal with it
Yes, I have 3. Have you?
I have a puppy and it is the worst. It is hard to keep clean
That's smart, it's much better to store a small amount of food than a lot. How's is going?
That was very nice of you to do.  Did you end up finding the piece?
That is bad. Did you know who it was?
He should at least get a thank you note from you. That is good that your neighbor is decent.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have a job?
Oh man. That's terrible. Are you looking to rent it out or buy it outright?
That must of been a nice memory to have.
Wow, that's awesome. Did it bring a lot of new life into your life?
Oh wow, did you make it on time?
Nice!  Did you enjoy your trip?
Glad you had fun!
Oh that sucks! Are you able to reschedule?
That's such a bummer. I am sorry you had to experience that.
What made him a rock star?
Oh wow! That's crazy! He was definitely a rock star!
flooring work can be strange.  What kind of strange situations came to mind?
Oh my goodness! I would be so mad at whoever had to replace that sub floor, that poor cat.
Ugh, that's the worst! Socks are a life saver!
That's pretty funny! My girls use the same toys, but they're given little sticky traps to keep them away from accidents.
How long was it?  I am dreading mine soon, I don't like being bald!
How long did it take?
Oh my! Did anyone see it?
Wow. I bet no one said anything. I would have went home and said something.
That sure is exciting. Did you get anything cool?
Oh no! I would have been filled with so much rage also!
Did you study well for it?
That is great.  Are you proud you have worked so hard?
Yeah it can be really tough to vent.  What's the problem?
That's a tough situation. Hopefully you find someone.
How is she doing so far?
That is good. How long have you been training her?
Me too. I love Christmas. What's your fav part of the season?
Me too! Christmas is the best.  I love the weather, the food, and the people.  What's your fav part of the holiday?
Wow. Did you play all the slots?
I would have been so jealous and angry
Why were you scared?
I can relate to that. I used to be the same way as you, until I realized that the fear was actually preparation for the down grade
Whoa that's exciting. Are you excited?
I would just be nervous. I have never been on a dating website
oh thats cool
Confidence is the golden key to success. If you can't have it, here has a good chance you will not.
Is it a cat or does it have a boyfriend?
That must be really annoying. Have you thought about getting a cat alarm app?
Wow congrats! I wish I had the time or the drive to get my degree! I am in the process of getting one myself, but it's a good step!
Congratulations! I am glad it is almost over and you only have a handful of classes left.
What happens if you try too hard?
Haha, I bet that was embarrassing, but it's a good story for when you grow up and become a better cook.
You must be very lonely.
I hate when you have to bail and it sucks.
Oh, how did that make you feel?
That is tough, but you must have really tried to be nice to her.
Did you know the actor playing the character was the real life version of the character?
That sounds like a really good movie!  Did you see it with someone special?
Oh man that sucks! Hopefully it wasn't a deadly teapot.
I would have passed out lol
Sometimes that happens when you are in a hurry.
Oh wow, that's a positive spin. Yeah, sometimes you just have to roll with it.
And did you give him money?
That's awful, I'm sorry.
That sounds so motivating! It's so easy for us to focus on one thing and do something else to get better. tips for a new habit?
Congrats. You should be proud that you did it. tips are always good. Do you tape your mouth shut?
thats awesome
is that good or bad?
Life is a lot of fun. I have had some pretty bad ones.
That sounds really amazing!
Oh no, I hate it when my neighbors do that!  Did you talk to them about it?
Oh that is too bad. Maybe try to practice indoors?
I know right. I have a Chase and fidelity account and they never do anything for me
That is terrible!  I would switch too.  Did they at least give you your money back?
That's cool! Did it bring back a lot of memories?
That's cool. I always loved going to the arcades too. We used to play all the time in the basement.
Ouch!  I hate the dentist!  The pain is terrible!
Ouch, I hope it's not too painful!
Oh really? I've never heard of that before!
Dang. Well, I guess I'll never know the true value of camping.
That's awful. I hope she's alright and you guys were able to get over it. It was a scary situation!
Ouch, I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you didn't take any damage.
That's pretty funny though, at least.
Oh my god. Did you get it back?
How much do you think you could lift?
Well it seems like you might be able to get to a certain weight and not others.
I know right? Think about something and then just let it happen!
Are we talking about yourself?
Oh nice! How much did you win?
Wow, that's amazing. Where did you pick up your winnings?
That sounds like it was very fun, how deep did you go?
That sounds so cool. You go to places that are fun but don't try to make it a competition. That's cool.
Aww that's awesome! I love puppies
That's awesome! It's lovely when families have multiple pets!
That sounds like fun. Did you have to get special permission to be there?
Oh man, I love Steely Dan. They have some great albums.
What type of breed is it?
That sounds very cute!
That is terrible!
Oh no! I would have been furious too. Did you have insurance?
Oh gross! That must have been so disgusting. Did you get rid of it?
That would freak me out too. Did you manage to avoid getting into a mess with it?
That sounds scary
did it make you feel afraid or anxious/
Did you prepare at all?
That sucks.  I've had those before.  Did you just not try at all?
Oh no! Did you find out what it was and try to find the culprit?
That would really gross me out. Did you find out what it was?
Oh no! That's awful! Did they stick around to help you?
Wow, that's awful! I hope you weren't hurt.
When and where is the speech?
You will surely deliver my friend.
Did you say anything to them?
That's the worst, is there no way of getting them to let you in line next time?
Oh that's great! I always got a little too nervous during those kind of tests.
103 is amazing. I hope you score high.
awww that is adorable.. i bet it was full of moments like these
I know the feeling. I wish I could look back fondly on some times in life.
oh thats cool, was it a good game?
Oh wow that sounds awesome!! I have always wanted to see a Rockies game live! What was the attendance?
Oh goodness, that must have been awful.
Holy cow, that's awful! Did you get any of it cleaned up or no?
Oh no! I hope he wasn't hurt!
That's too bad. What was the accident?
That is always a reason to be proud
Wow. Those cars are slick! I love them.
What was the exam on?  I hope you did well.
That's amazing, congratulations on getting accepted!  What was the GRE Exam for?
That is a lot of studying.  What grade did you get?
That's awesome.  College is a lot of work
Did you have any money in it?
That is awesome, did you get a refund?
Yeah it's true. My neighbor lets his dog graze on the sidewalk outside every so often just to see how it feels.
Some people are just so nice. I know that feeling - we got tickets to the Superbowl and he was grateful.
Aw, I bet. How old is she?
That's impressive! How old is she?
time off is always a plus for me as well
I know what you mean, my job requires me to be on call 24/7 so I can get home sometimes.
Good for you. Studying is a very important tool to have.
Oh that's awesome! That would be so nice, and you can make a lot of money too!
That sounds terrible! Do you have a car?
That's a real shame. Maybe the city can offer to foot the bill.
What was the variety?
That sounds so disgusting! Did you ask them to stop saying the things they were saying that day?
Oh no! I hope everything is okay and it will come back okay.
That's really good of her, and lucky she had such great results.
damper on what?
Oh wow that sounds stressful.
That is a concern many have faced but unfortunately it's the nature of life.
That is a tough situation. Do you think there is a way out of this?
I used to love playing them. I can barely remember the first level.
I agree, I played an old school game called "Alaska". The sound of the game is just so relaxing.
I haven't been to America much but I hear a lot of great things about it! Is it pretty small?
That is so cool!  I love hearing about micro breweries.  I love visiting ones that make great beer!  I love a good micro brewery!
Aw man that's so mean. Did you say anything to them?
Yeah it can be annoying when other guys just stare and don't even say anything.  Hey look what I got for you last night!
What is Anthony Bourdain famous for? I've never heard of him. I'm sorry to hear that.
Aww, that's terrible, but it's nice you have such a great chef. He sounds like an amazing guy.
Wow! That is so nice of them! Was it a surprise?
That's really cool! Did you have fun?
Fresh peaches bring about the best vibes.
That's really great!  twin fawns?  I don't know what that is but it sounds cute!  Do you sell them on etsy?
Oh wow! Two months? That's a long time to be without your wife.
That is really exciting for both her and you!
He's probably sorry but also looking forward to it.
That sounds exciting. I hope everything works out for you and your new neighbor
That's the worst!  I would have complained!
Oh wow that would be awful, what do you think you'll do about it?
OMG that's disgusting! Some kids have no respect for property
Well at least you didn't get towed out of the parking lot!
I bet you're so happy for him!
That's pretty cool!  I don't blame you, though I would be pretty nervous too.  Do you know if the job fair was anything that he really wanted?
That sounds great. What are you drinking?
Soup for lunch? Wow I'm not sure what I would do with myself.
That sounds stressful, but I am sure you did good on your interview.
That sounds terrible! I hate when they don't follow through!
That is really cool to hear.  I assume he got the Startrek package?
Oh wow - that's awesome! I wish I could afford to travel as well - "cause money is tight these days
Sorry to hear that. I have the same feeling. I am in the UK and we have had to get our leg fixed also.
Oh that's awesome!  What are you going to do while she's away?
I bet you cant wait.  Where did she go?
Uh oh. That sounds pretty uncomfortable.  Did you talk to someone else?
That's so annoying. Why did you need to ask again?
Oh, that must be hard. How are you keeping yourself occupied?
I bet that would be a bit scary
I'm sorry to hear that. Waiting really messes things up.
That is so sad. What happened?
I know how it feels.   My parents brought me a new laptop because I got sick on my last one.
That must make you feel bad.
Oh no, that must be so hard! I hope she is doing alright!
Awe, that's too bad. I hope she comes back soon!
Aww that's awful! Did it sting you?
Oh no! That is awful. I would have been so scared. I hate how they are so tiny. I can barely see them in my house
i live in south texas and they are really bad here too.
Yes! I live in FL and have never seen a mosquito. Until now! I'm terrified. Maybe I need to buy some spray.
did she do it for you?
That is too scary!! I hate spiders!
Oh wow, that sounds exciting, but also kind of scary at the same time. I hope you all have fun.
oh wow! that is so cool, i want to do the same
Oh no! What happened after?
Ew, that sounds disgusting!
Oh, my goodness! That is scary.
That's a bummer, what is wrong with your hip?
That's awesome. Where are you going?
That's awesome that you had such great friends to help out.
I agree, I hate having to call someone on the phone
Oh my, I would be so annoyed!
I am sorry, that is so sad
I'm so sorry to hear that. My dog had cancer and passed away too when I was very young. It's hard.
I'm sorry, that must be lonely for you.
I am sure you will make it up to them.
That's awesome! I hate upstairs neighbors.
Ugh, I am the same, I can't stand the people upstairs, I have a dog that needs to sleep and I can't stand the people upstairs either. I have an above ground swimming pool and I feel so safe now. What about you? Are you moving to a new building?
Oh no!  Where has she been?
That is a long time.
Yes it is.  I just wish I had a college that was somewhat competitive.
Thank you! I am hoping to have enough time to get things under control before winter, so that I will be ready for Fall.
Hey good for you!  That's a great attitude to have going into a game.  What position do you play?
That is awesome, I wish I had your drive.  Keep up the good work.
That sounds tough. I'm really sorry to hear that.
I'm sure it will get better as you get older. It's always a learning experience
That's awesome. Where are you going?
Oh wow, I've never heard about a "trip" to India. What exactly do you have planned?
I love it when that happens
Oh man! I am jealous! That sounds like an amazing week.
I can imagine that was quite a wake-up call. Were you quite annoyed or content with it?
That is so nice to have some change of pace. I am happy for you
That's pretty funny. Did you get a raise for your trouble?
Wow, that is pretty bad
Why empty it?
Wow that does sound a little scary!
Oh wow that is a long time! Do you know what breed?
That is great news!  What breed is it?
Thats so great. First day of school can be so different.
That is a big day for a kid, but I am sure it will be a good one.
What an exciting couple of days that must have been!
What color was your wedding?
That's not nice at all.
Yeah dogs are great but that is very annoying
Congratulation. Which church are you going to?
Wow, I bet that was an awesome experience. I am so happy you guys got to have such a good relationship!
That must have been no good.
That is no good, did you get a refund?
That sounds really fun. What kind of food does it serve?
Restaurant? I'm sorry. What did you order?!
Sometimes people have different opinions, that doesn't mean they are wrong.
That is interesting, you had a hard time condensering your own belief.
That's good! lumber is usually very heavy and expensive to repair!
Wow! I bet you were really impressed by his gifts!
That is sad. How did he pass? If you don't mind me asking.
It's really tough. How did he die if you don't mind me asking?
Thats too bad. Did he have a good reason?
Yeah, It's always disappointing when a friend you really enjoy doesn't get to come over to your place. I'm sorry to hear that.
Wow, that's so tragic. I hope your husband was in a better place when she passed.
I'm so sorry, that sounds like a nightmare.
That is so awesome!  I'm glad you found her and are keeping her.
That's so sad, my cat went missing one time as well.
That is a bummer!  I know it must be nerve-wracking!  How are you doing?
How old are you? I'm 26 and injured my hip once and nearly broke my ankle!
I agree! I'm afraid I would enjoy it if I were a little younger, but it would be exciting at the same time, as you said.
Are you going to do it this year?
That sounds so nice! I bet it looks pretty good too.
It sounds like you really enjoying yourself!
Oh no, bugs are the most gross thing.
Haha. Bugs are gross. Did you get it out of your hair? I once bit a bug and almost passed out!
You will be ok! Just be confident!
You will get it!
That is nice. dream often about the past.
Sounds like a nice dream! Were you able to close with your friend?
What did she say?
Oh wow! I love dogs. What kind of breed was it?
Awwww! I love puppies! What kind of breed is the puppy?
That sucks, maybe you could find a different place?
Ebay can be annoying sometimes
You shouldn't have! You monster.
Oh no that's a bit extreme.
I am sorry to hear that, I hope he feels better as soon as possible!
I hope so too, that's very sad to hear about.
Cool. I never really joined any kinds of Crew. Just danced with my friends a lot.
I'm glad you have a blast again! Yes it has been so long since we have had a blast like that.
Nice! Have you been playing?
That is a very good idea, maybe some local tournaments would be a fun addition.
Oh my! That must have been heartbreaking. I'm so sorry that happened. Is there any chance for them to mend their relationship?
That sounds so sweet.
Eww. bones? Man I would have been so mad.
That is terrible. What did you do?
i do too. what's worse is seeing people hurting animals is what gets me the most.
i agree with you
was it a bear?
Ha! I used to play the raccoon prank in school. I'd get up on stage and place trash on top of the trash can and then slowly walk out. I loved it.
I hope so. If you need help with something, just let me know.
He probably will. He knows you're a good friend so he probably will.
wow thats crazy
He sound very confident.
Yeah I saw one crash in the ocean once. It was pretty freaky.
That sounds like a recipe for disaster. I would be so terrified
Yes, I get a bit annoyed by people who are just rude. Does she at least try to be nice though?
I hate when that happens.  It's so forced and theres nothing you can do about it.  It's like they just assume you know everything and if you didn't know then you didn't grow up.  It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
It must be so difficult. Do you have any friends that you can rely on to help?
thats really sad
Oh man, that's scary! My daughter did that when she was little, she had to have an xray of hernia.
That's too bad. I hope that the next xray can find out what's wrong.
That's terrible. I hope your room smelled good also.
Oh wow, that sounds like a messy situation, but hopefully it will get repaired in time for you to be able to re-suit.
Me too. I hate having to get everything ready for a car accident.
I hate when weather like that happens! I bet that was a relief though!
Are you ready?
What is your degree in?
Did you die?
Oh man that sounds like a trip!
I'm sorry to hear that. It's always tough to be away from family and other friends.
That sucks, being a parent always feels so drained. But at least on the weekends you can enjoy yourself and get some good snowboarding!
Yes I totally agree. I felt the same way when my dog passed away.
Oh wow. I know exactly what you mean. I have lost lots of pets. They are just like family.
Did you get to do that?
That sounds like the most amazing experience ever! How far did you go?
Wow, she must have been pretty handicapped to have to go through that.
I am happy that she is on the right path and will be successful.
Rainy days can be so boring.  What do you do to keep yourself occupied?
I feel you, it's been raining and cold here for weeks.
Sounds pretty awesome!  I've never seen it, but I always wanted to
That sounds scary! I've never been able to really enjoy horror movies because they always seem to make me feel sick or anxious. I hope you did okay, if it was a close call.
insurance is so expensive!
It is crazy, my sister in law's insurance was 211 a month when we got her car.
Wow. Did you have any sugar with it?
Oh no! Well, it will be okay. Don't feel guilty. Do your best and be proud!
Oh no! I hope you are okay! Was it like a bad dream or what happened?
I'm so sorry to hear that, I hope you're doing okay!
Is the dog ok?
Oh no! I hope you find him!
That sounds terrible, I am really sorry. I hope you can come up with something better.
Sometimes ghosts are more interested in our past lives than we realize. It could be that she simply decided that since we're long distance now, she'd rather hang out with people who weren't ghosts, which is understandable. But you still don't know the full story.
That's very nice of them, did you pay in full?
That is very nice.  It is nice to know there are still good people in the world
Oh wow. That's awesome. Is he excited?
Heck yeah!  Is he going to the draft?
What happened?
That sounds awful! Did you complain to them about it?
oh no!! that must have been so embarrassing!!
Oh no! I hope you were alright!
i know how you feel i get scared too
I would have been terrified too,  Did you kill some innocent?
That sounds really annoying.  You should definitely talk to them.
Did you complain to them?
Wow that must of been quite an ambitious endeavor...
Yum! Pizza for breakfast? I'm down.
I know! I was thinking the same thing when I got my first salary.
I can imagine! That is great that you were able to take some of the time to prepare. It sounds like you have a good future ahead of you!
Awesome. What type of classroom do you teach?
Oh that sounds exciting! I bet it's tough teaching at a small school though.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you tried to find a new dog dealer?
Oh my goodness I am so sorry to hear this! My two dogs are getting too old and it is impossible for me to take care of them any longer. I hope things work out for you in the future!
I agree, I think debit is the way to go for sure.
I hate having to call and get a hold of the company. So you lose out on having to call and get a hold of the bank. I have been through it too
That's great. Is she getting a raise too?
She must be proud!
Wow! That's awesome! What was it about?
Wow. That was really nice of you. I bet she was really happy.
That's a big time change, but I think you'll be fine!  Does he have a good group of friends to help him along the way?
Oh I understand. But as a mother, I can sympathize with you. It is very tough to give our kids new experiences and make them grow up to be kind and happy but it is so doable as long as you do it carefully and do it everyday!
Yeah it will probably be hard, but I hope for you that it works out for you! Best of luck to you!
Yes you do, but you also have to deal with him as a child as well.  You just never quite know how he will react in a given situation.
That is awesome, I love nintendo and the switch, I would have been ecstatic too! What games did you play?
I bet! I remember getting the nintendo in the 90s. It was a blast. I also remember playing mario kart with my brother. We won 1 game. We would play it a few times a week until we got tired of it.
What major is it?
Damn that's pretty bad. Are you able to do it?
Nice, were you surprised?
Nice! I love video games.
Absolutely! I always make sure to do that. Makes making a list super easy!
That's awful, I hope you didn't make any mistakes during the checkout line.
4?
I have always wanted one of those! Do they eat alot?
thats good, im happy for you
Wow that sucks. I can relate, although I've also been through that. It's hard to stay motivated sometimes
oh nice.. what made you happy..
That is awesome! It feels good when life really feels right
Oh no that is nasty, did you go see a doctor?
That's a bummer.  I hope you're feeling better.
Haha that's cute! Did you guys have a fight?
Lactose intolerant people are the most annoying people in the world.  It's one of my biggest pet peeves.  I don't know why people don't just say no to everything.
Hahaha, I've had that happen before. I love that when it happens!
What are you most worried about?
Oh no! That is scary! I have two daughters myself.  I hope everything goes as planned and that everything turns out great for you!
Aww, that is cute. Did you continue walking?
Oh that is cute. attacked what?
Don't worry too much about it. You'll do great! If you need to you can always take it again!
That's impressive. What are you studying in school?
That must have been very upsetting. Did you talk to her about it?
I'm glad you were able to move on, but it's important to remember those things in life.
I agree 100 percent.
that's a funny image.
I agree. But everyone does it and its not like you have a choice.
Yeah, I would have too. But fortunately there wasn't anyone else there so you could probably make it up to him without incident.
Wow, that's terrifying! Is it still alive and well?
Wow, it must be really big to have that close to your house. I'd be scared to see it too.
That's really cool, what kind of art does she do?
That's really great that you are so talented. Maybe you could collge art with her.
That's so great!  It seems like you have a great relationship with Kayla!  How long have you been friends?
that is amazing, so glad to hear she is such a great friend
Oh my god, that's terrible. I can't imagine what that's like. You must have been terribly anxious about it.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope the cancer goes away for you.
that is crazy, did anything happen? or was it just the wind?
Oh no, that sounds terrifying! I'm glad you're okay though, I would have been terrified!
What happened
That's a shame, but I guess you can only trust your father so much.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Is it treatable?
It's never to late. Even if you get positive news, you can always start the process of looking into it.
I can relate.  Was it with your friends and family?
I remember playing that with my friends.  The original snake, right?  Right?
That's good to hear. How did it go?
I am sure you will feel better about it after you prepare well.
Oh that's so sad, is it treatable?
That is such a hard thing to deal with. I'm so sorry that it took so long for you to discover this.
That is sad. Did you enjoy the movie?
That sounds boring
Wow he is a sweet brother.
Haha..thats sweet..thats how it should be
That is absolutely fair, did they actually do it?
Oh yeah, he's a pretty bad guy.
That sounds creepy
haha that's hilarious! I used to do that when I was little too, but realized it was for the best once I got older
Whoa that's out of left field. What are you going to do?
I feel your pain 100 percent. I have been betrayed by my wife before and it is one the hardest things I have ever been through. I have never cheated on my husband either!
Flawless. He is a honorable man.
Wow. What a kind thing for you. You are a good uncle.
That is fantastic! He must be really intelligent!
Wow!  He must be smart!  That is so awesome.  I am sure that makes you feel proud.
Wow I have been thinking about this for a long time. Is it a completely new ability?
Wow that is amazing news! Your dog must be very intelligent.
That's a pretty substantial amount of food for a major league. I think it's safe to say that you may be the eating champion
HaHa ha, I would never dream of challenging myself. I would be like, "Dang, that is a lot of food, do you think you can eat even a whole bag?"
Thats good of him
Good for you. The flu is no joke.
That's so sweet!  How old was you then?
Aww, that is so sweet and I am glad you can relive those memories with your mom.
That's unfortunate. Were you able to clean it up?
That is no good. Did she do it on purpose?
That's pretty cool
Wow, that's incredible. He must be smart!
I hate when that happens.  It feels like they just handed you the job, but you know they will promote you somewhere else if you keep trying.
I would try to find another job first. If you don't get it don't look for a new job.
That sucks. Sorry to hear that. Air can be a scary thing to see.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I love cats, I would want them to live with me too. Have you tried to find a new roomate?
I'm so sorry! That is one tough break.
Oh man, I am sorry, are you okay?
What kind?
That sounds really good!
Nice. It's always nice to get a change of pace.
You must feel so good about yourself!
Oh that sounds like fun! What are you making for it?
You are forgiven for this one, it happens every so often.
That can be really annoying especially in the summer! I hope it's back on now.
Oh no, that is terrible! I hope no one got hurt.
why what happened?
Why would you go to a country that is that crazy?
Oh no! I hope it didn't rain
That's a good plan. I hope you didn't get burned.
It's never good to be stressed. It's worse to spend it than not having it.
I know the feeling of struggling for your money. What did you fix?
I bet. How did you cope?
That sucks. Xbox live is your friend.
Has something changed recently?
That's awesome. It seems like you've been through a lot lately.
I am sure the panic will soon subside
Because they have nukes, duh!
You will do fine I am sure of it.
You'll get the job just don't be too overconfident.
That is great.  It is pathetic if you did not get it before.
Wow, that sounds like a pretty strange thing to say. But, also a good thing in your case.
That is great.  Congrats
That is great!  You must have taught her well.
That is always a good thing to have. I hope your new place is nice also.
I would do the same! I hate being by the stairs too much!
Wow that sounds like a very stressful situation! I am glad it is all working out!
wow that sounds awesome! it sounds like you have a great family!
Sometimes. It's hard to forgo some of those good memories though.
Yes I do sometimes. I recently went back to college and have spent a lot of time on campus studying.
I understand that, I wish I could do the things I used to do.
Sometimes technology just doesn't work the way we want it too. Sometimes I wish I had a friend who could help me do things my way.
That is very nice of them. I wish more people would take the time to do that for others.
That's awesome! disabled people are so generous and helpful!
I used to play all day long. It was so much fun. I wish we could go back to those days.
That's sad, maybe she will come over when the time is right.
Yes! I love being home alone
Yes I love to read also. I'm a history buff and love to read about the Civil War and Reconstruction. What do you do for work?
I bet it was a nice surprise!
Oh that sounds awful! I feel sorry for you.
Scotland is very large. You should definitly go there
It must be a very nostalgic place for you.
That is nice. Dogs are so important
Aww that's sweet! I'm glad you love him so much! I'm also very envious of my dog who's two years old!
Wow, how did that make you feel
That would be a sight to see lol
I feel the same way. If you see something and you don't like it just report it!
I am sorry you go through that, but I am happy you are able to help out.
That is awesome. I have never won that much!
Wow! That is really lucky! I never win anything
You can do whatever you want, I'm just glad you won
Oh man that sounds terrible.
Aw, that's cute that you got to use a potato to feel better connect to someone.
Cats are sometimes very destructive.
Oh no! I hate when cats do that! Were you able to clean the floor and get the smell out?
What was it
I'm sorry to hear that, maybe next time!
That's awesome! I love buying sausage! What brand did you go with?
Oh yeah? Was it good? How cheap is super cheap?
That is a tough situation. Is there anything that can be done to help?
Have you seen her before?
That's awesome. Where did you go?
Wow, that sounds awesome. I have never been outside of the country.
That is awesome! I bet they are really proud of you.
That is great! They must be so happy and relieved to be going back to school!
Sounds fun! Have you gone before?
OMG I have done that so many times. What did you do?
HAHA that's great!  I don't think I would have thought that.
What kind of skills does she have?
Sounds impressive! How long did it take her to prepare for a week?
That's cool, when is the tournament?
Chicago is a pretty big city!
That's awesome! It's always nice to watch them succeed.
Wow that's a long time, good for you!
thats great
That sounds great.  You're welcome!
Oh no! That is horrible, what did you do about it?
That's horrible, what can you do about it?
oh yeah what is the ebay bid for?
That'd be so awesome!  What would the comic be about?
That is terrifying. Did you get away from it?
That is scary! I have heard of people getting bite by those dogs and that is terrifying
I agree! Have you tried any new apps?
Absolutely! And the smart phones have become so cheap that a quick glance at your phone brings up a wealth of information that you otherwise wouldn't have even access to.
I hope it didn't taste like garbage!
What kind of cake was it
Financial stability is so important for a healthy family.
Financial help is always very needed. I'm glad you're prepared.
Horror movies give me so much anxiety. I can't watch them late at night.
I've never heard of that! Was it good?
That is awesome.  I am so glad people are open to new foods and places.  I have never been outside of the country.
That's pretty neat! I haven't really looked into the organic stuff much myself, but I've always heard good things! It always makes sense to get your food from where you live so you can know what kind of things are in it.
That is the worst!  I feel like I have to hide from food touching me if it happens ever.
Yeah, it's definitely a no no. You probably shouldn't do that again.
I hear you. I always take away their adult diaper rash collection.
thats annoying
Me too. It really irritates me and should be illegal
i agree. i always cut them off. it's not fair
Did you take it to the ER? I would if I was in your shoes.
That's really sad, I wonder how it got into the yard?
What kind of restaurant?
Where is it at?
That sounds amazing! I love indian food. What brand is it?
What store is it?
Wow, you must be pretty good at it to be so confident in your shot. Do you practice often?
What kind of game is it?
Talk radio? I don't know what that is.
That must make you so mad! Have you tried talking to your neighbor to try and understand why it is that?
I feel you! Some people just can't take no for an answer.
Maybe he/she just needs to relax.
That is true, we must make the best of every day.
That's exciting! I've never been to Vegas before.
She will definitely sing in the 90s. She was amazing in Atlanta as well.
That's awesome! Have you been looking for one for a long time?
Congratulations! I hope you enjoy your new place
No I don't. I'm actually on the far side of the country in an apartment by myself.
Wow. Did you get it out?
That's disgusting. I don't know if I could manage a roach even if I had all the ingredients laid out for me.
You must be quite anxious about it!
That must be quite a drive!
Wow congrats! I know you worked hard for it.
That sounds awesome! I hope it turns out amazing.
That's really great! Do you have a Prime Plus account?
disabled people can be so frustrating. i'm glad you're getting the good stuff delivered to you
Oh my, why is it so depressing?
Sounds like a really good movie! Did you like it?
Oh that's so cool!
That's really cool. I wonder if it will be taught to his younger siblings?
That sounds like a nice thing to do.
Ouch. I hope you are feeling better. Did you hurt yourself?
That is so terrible! Did you do anything?
Oh no, is your brother still in college?
did it wake you up?
That is weird! What did you do?
Oh cool! What places did you go?
Did you enjoy it there?
I bet that was fun
That sounds awesome. Where did you guys go?
What were you thinking?
That sounds really fun! I've never done it, but it would be cool.
I love ziplining!  Did you have fun?
Ouch! How did that happen. Did you have nail caps?
Oh no! Are you ok?
im sorry to hear that.. what happened?
im sorry to hear that, i know how that feels
Yes, many people have survived cancer. Many have died from it. I'm very happy for you.
That is really good.  You must be very proud of yourself.  And your family.
Where to?
That is great.  California is a great place to live.  What do you want to move to?
Yeah it is pretty upsetting. I try not to be a jerk and pick it all up myself.
I feel the same way. It's annoying to see.
That's pretty lonely.  Do you enjoy your isolation?
That's pretty sweet. I'm happy for you. What kind of animals do you have?
That is a lot of cards, did you spend a lot of money?
wow that sucks, maybe you will win the lottery
I bet. Have you already planned it out?
That is a tough situation, but sometimes you just have to board the dog. Maybe you can find a new friend who will board the dog instead.
That's great, what kind of jobs did you apply for?
Good luck with that. I hope you get what you want.
I love the fair, what kind of tickets did you win?
You should go for it!
That is scary, what do you do about it?
that sounds very scary
What was the occasion?
Wow that sounds amazing!  What was the name of the star you were seeing?
Aww that's nice. How old are your kids?
How fun! I love family members that are actually helpful and helpful.
Nice, what kind of shoes?
Oh wow, I would be pretty frustrated too.
Did you end up sticking with it?
Did you read the instructions before you ran?
sounds nervewracking
You'll be great! Stuttering isn't the end of the world!
That is bad. Did you go to the manager to get it back?
It happens to the best of us
Really? I bet that was fun
Holy cow, I have never done that before! How long did it take you?
I used to be a car crash victim! It's traumatic to see.
I'm so sorry that you are going through that. Are you okay?
That's terrible. Did you call the police?
That must've been so aggravating! Did you ask the person?
That's scary. What happened?
Oh my, what a scorcher! What was the occasion?
Wow. I have never seen that before.
Wow that is impressive! I guess I could never bench that much.
That sounds like fun what kind of cats did you get?
That's a cool cat cafe. Did you like the cats?
Ouch, did you get medical help?
Oh geez! That must have been so scary! Did you go back to your car and look for it?
That must be a pain to clean
That must be annoying
Thats really sad. They say the older you get the more you can notice things like that.
That is sad, but you must have a lot of love for this cat
Oh yeah? I bet that brings back lots of great memories!
Older songs are always better, but I do miss the good old days when I was young.
Were you able to find him?
Were you able to scare it away and get it back home?
Oh that is really awesome! What did you do with it afterwards?
That's awful, how are you going to keep it from attacking you if it's injured?
Oh, that's nice! Is it your friend?
Roast is one of my favorite things to make.  What is your favorite part of the roast?
That is great!  You must be so happy!
Wow. That is nice. Where will you go?
Are you ready to meet it, or do you not think you will?
Top secret? You may want to get that checked out by a doctor.
thats a shame.. where has he been
You could always watch tv or do hobbies.  My roommate just got back too, so I have that going for me.
Oh no! Is she getting better?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that.  Is the dog better?
I am sorry that you have to go through that.  I hope that she is okay.
That is awesome. Where to?
Wow that sounds really fun! Have you always been on cruises?
Thats so nice
What did he come home to? A mess?
Oh no. I hate bad storms!
Oh wow, it's been bad here for a while now. Are you getting warnings?
What a surprise! How long has it been since you've seen him?
That is so scary! I would be so scared to be in your position!
Yum! mac and cheese is one of my favorite things to snack on late at night.
I love mac and cheese
Cool. What type of necklace?
What kind of necklace and shirt was it?
Have you taken him outside?
Oh no, accidents can be so aggravating. I have two dogs, they're not that bad. But I'm sorry to hear that.
Well that's good. It's good to appreciate your co-workers. They can sometimes be humble and give you the credit for things you didn't do yourself.
It's always difficult moving up, but you must be excited about where you are in the company!  How do you feel about the promotion overall?
That sounds really fun. The water park is always a favorite of mine.
That's sounds like fun! How old are your kids?
Awwww. I love cats. What kind of cat do you have?
Aw, that's sweet. My kitty used to enjoy going to the bathroom with me and chihuahuas. Now she's all over my room as if it's my own property lol
what kind was it?
What kind of toy was it?
Congrats! I hope you're excited!
Congrats! I hope to propose when my kids are older and married :)
That is stressful, do you have any family that can help?
That is bad news. I hope you guys can figure something out!
I'm sorry to hear that, were you close?
That is sad. Did you get a new cat?
That is so wonderful!  You must be so proud and she is so special!
That is awesome, I wish I was an artist like her.  My daughter is an artist too but, for different reasons.
I bet that was scary
Did you manage to avoid one at all
I bet you were terrified! I would be too!
I hate when that happens
Yuck! I hope your dog hasn't become a habit of it.
Oh my goodness! That has happened to us multiple times and we always end up putting her out! It is a terrible situation.
That is good. How long has it been since you have spoken?
That is great. Do you take pride in your speech?
Oh gross, did it get on your clothes?
That's some serious dedication.  Did you do the laundry?
I hope it wasn't a clogged toilet or something like that.
Oh no! How did you manage the situation?
Nice, what kind did you get?
Did you buy it or try to find it on the internet?
Oh no! What were you doing wrong with it?
Did you get help?
Oh no. How did that happen?
I am so sorry. I am glad you are ok though.
Oh really? How did that feel?
Really? Why not?
Nice! What did you guys eat?
I hear you! It is so good to be whole in the moments like that!
Oh no, is everything alright?
that is so scary! you should have been very scared
Oh no!  Did your dog notice and correct you?
Aw. Well I am sure your dog appreciates it as it is a treat! Dogs can be such good foodieves!
Did he make you feel guilty for listening to loud music?
That is cool that your brother was looking out for you.  Did you flip it back up?
I hate when that happens... made a mess before?
I hope that it didnt.
That's bad. Do you have to return it?
Oh no!  What book was it?
Nice. What did you get?
That's really sweet, what did you get?
That's too bad. Have you spoken with your property tax rep?
Yeah it's annoying the way taxes are raised in many places.
That is a very good way of looking at things.
I do have a partner. Unfortunately, I do not think I'm ever going to be fully satisfied with their attention.
I hope it goes well!
It's good to hear that it was a painless process. What was wrong with your application?
That's really annoying. I wish I had more friends like you.
Give her a few days and then try again
Oh, well don't feel bad then.  It happens to the best of us
You should inform your mother.
I would be terrified lol. How old are your kids?
A roller coaster sounds amazing!  But you are right, it is scary to think about.
Oh no, what happened?
Sorry to hear that, mine passed away 2 years ago and I still think about him a lot
I think we all have. Things we care about always seem important to us but we forget what it's like to care about.
What things do you care about the most?
did you have a lot of good times there?
Its crazy that you can see your family from just a couple of miles away now.
I don't really but I know there is some cool stuff on there for those of us who love to watch them!
I watch a few youtube channels. I like to learn and I like to learn about different things. Nothing in particular I really like. What kind of stuff do you like?
uhoh, sounds super scary! What happened next?
hahah that is pretty wild!
Wow that sounds really difficult.
What kind of steaks were you using?
Thats always nice when you can look back and remember the good times
i agree. Everything you do now is so much harder.
What kind of job do you have?
Well said my friend. pray for me and your family!
Oh no...do you have any plans for the future?
That's too bad. Why did they have to be crushed?
Oh no. How did that happen?
Ugh I know that feeling, what happened?
Yes, I love video games. Which ones are you thinking about?
i do love video games, im just not very tech-savvy
I know the feeling.
I know exactly what you mean. It is annoying.
It's been going great so far. I was happy to hear that!
That's great that you had a good year. Did you study hard for the exam?
It's been mediocre so far. How about you?
That is awesome! Congrats!
Oh no that's terrible, did they sting you?
Oh no, bees really are nasty. I hate bees!
Yes, I played a lot of COD
I do. I loved playing them. What games were some of your favorites?
It's going well. Just a bit slow going.
I am as well, its nice to be enjoying life right now.
That's awful! Did you tell her no?
Well, you probably deserve the blame for putting your dog there!
Wow. Did she mess it up big?
That is no fun, I hope she had a good lunch today.
Oh no! That's not good.  Is it a puppy or perhaps sick?
Oh no, I'm sorry. Did you take him to the vet to get his smell removed?
Oh no! Did you find out who did it?
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that.  How is your cat now?
Oh my, did you enjoy the visit?
Oh wow, that sounds scary! I would be too scared to even try going up there.
How did it go?
How'd it go?
I love chocolate! Did you enjoy the treat?
Oh, that is not good, what did you do?
Did you hurt yourself?
You should be fine! It's not as bad as you think it'd be.
That is good you are thinking ahead like that
I completely understand.  I always tell them to be quiet and carry their own weight.
I do not, do you?
No I do not, I'm terrible at video games.
Why did you turn her down?
What did your partner say?
Did you all have a good time together?
I love those moments, how old were the people being reunited?
How did that work out?
Well sometimes it is good to try and get back in the business even if it is just a little profit.  It can give you great emotional value I think.
What an exciting time for her! How did it go?
kindergarteners are so little! How old is she now -
That was very kind of you. Did he pay you back?
Well that is very kind of you.  I lent a friend 400 dollars but he has spoken too soon.  Can you lend me some more?
Oh wow, was it a suprise?
Well that sounds terrible! Hopefully you were able to make it through the entire day!
Lol, did anyone else see?
Wow. Must have been embarrassing.
Oh no! How are you going to get it fixed?
Oh, goodness, what a lunatic!  That's awful!  How can people be so careless?
Oh man. That sucks. I hate that.
I don't blame you for being nervous. You're only human. I would probably feel the same way.
That's a long time. What do you do?
I am glad to hear that, that is a long working career.
I'm not familiar with the word "job"! Can you give an example of something you have done that required certification?
That sucks!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Did they reschedule?
Oh wow, I could have imagined that being a huge inconvenience, glad everything ended up working out!
I love Chinese buffets. What did you have?
OMG! That's a crazy feeling right there. I'm so jealous. Was it worth it at least?
Sounds like a great vacation. Was there anything new to do?
Sounds like a good time.  Did you guys do any cool things together?
That's terrible, I'm sorry to hear that! I know how upsetting that can be!
That's so sad. It's like losing one of your best friends and it's just crushing. I'm sorry.
That's pretty sweet. What did you end up singing?
Haha, that is funny and well deserved. I have done something similar before. But I guess in a way that is kind of funny. Congrats on the marriage, it is always a joy to have!
It's rare these days but when you do find someone, cherish it. Treasure every moment!
Marriage is the only thing that matters in my opinion. I wish you all the best and success.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find it.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I've lost many before and never had anyone turn it in.
That is a great thing to do. I bet the people who work there are very grateful
That sounds like a lot of fun! What are you hoping to learn most from this experience?
That is wonderful to hear. It must be a great feeling.
thats great to hear, marriage is important but hard to find, glad youre happy
Thats a great place to be. Being stable gives you a lot of clarity and control over your stress.  I am glad you are in such a good place.
I am sorry to hear that! Are you able to get it fixed?
Oh no that's awful. Did you find something else to ride around in your new car?
Maybe it's time to find a new job?
That's a bummer. I'm in Chicago, and it seems everyone here has at least one or two big cities in their backyard, with a high unemployment rate. I'm glad you're ok, though!
It happens to the best of us, dont be so hard on yourself.
Oh no! I am sorry that happened to you! Did you confront them about it? Or let them know it wasn't your thing?
That's how it is for me too. I order a lot and never get it. I swear sometimes it takes an hour for it to show up.
I know how that is.  It is like the more you look at it the more it seems like it will happen.  I ordered a shirt from the website today and its already here but not in stock!
I'm so sorry. I bet she was loved and cherished.
Aww I am sorry for your loss. Losing a pet is never an easy thing.
That's sounds like fun!
That sounds like a lot of fun! Where are you planning on going?
That's a tough situation.
Wow. I struggle with that too. My dad is in the same boat. He's one of the most successful people I know though, has a nice house, works hard and goes to medical school at 50.
I know how you feel. My family is also very poor.
That is great. What kind of project was it?
That's a real bummer, well at least you finished it all.
That's great! Did you find out what was the problem?
Oh I am sorry to hear that. Do you go to different doctor's?
I am so happy for you!
Well, that's not the worst thing that could happen in a week.
Well, you could have still lost that weight even if you cheated. It's a win win situation.
Those exams can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine if you prepared.
What subject is the exam in?
Sorry to here that. Did the group find out about it? And how did you feel about not being able to attend?
Happy Birthday!  Did you get a chance to Afterwards?
That is good, it sounds like you have a great family!
It is wonderful that you have that supportive family. I am glad you have that.
I am so sorry, that is heartbreaking.
It's so hard when you have a pet you love and you have to say goodbye. I have two dogs and I'm so sorry.
Why not? Is it difficult to drive?
What kind of car did you end up getting?
Aw, that is sweet. It sounds like you really love him!
That's really great! It sounds like you have a great relationship.
Oh no! I'm so sorry that happened! Did you apologize to her?
I am sure you apologized to her after that.
Cool. Where are you going?
That's really exciting! I bet there will be some cool museums there!
Oh, that is so sweet of him! You are lucky to have such a good dad.
That is awesome. I have a sheath as well.
Oh that's sad :( I'm very sorry to hear that. Do you have some of your own children?
That is good that you have learned to be content.  I think it is important to have that kind of focus.
How did it go after you arrived?
congratulations. what type of job is it?
Yea, it's definitely harder now that you have a car. At least you can still bike or walk to work.
I'm glad things are better now. I'm still in college and I'm pretty bummed about not having my car to drive anywhere anymore
It is so hard to master something like that!  Are you going to go again?
wow i wish i could gouba do that
Oh, those are good movies.  I don't watch a lot of British movies.
I love those movies too!
Oh no! Were you late for work?
Were you in a rush to get to work?
That is so awesome.  Have you been on any sort of training?
Very nice! Do you have a lot of talent in your movesets?
Were you not paying attention
Were you rushed to the hospital?
Were you prepared? How do you think it went?
Sometimes that can be a good thing. Sometimes it can be a bad thing. I'm glad you decided to do the right thing for you.
That's really good that you started there. What kind of places do you like?
That's really great that you appreciate that! It's good to be positive!
How long do you train for?
oh man, do you do any sports or is this just for fun?
You can train
Have you heard of the program program?
You should drink more milk then.
I am jealous! I love working out!
Nice! I love to work out.
Ouch. That has happened to me before. Did you ask the doctor about it?
Oh no I'm so sorry. I can imagine how frustrating that can be.
Oh, that guy is a creep. What did you do?
What texts? You can't just ask people what they are talking about and not share it with anyone
i know how that goes
What were your reservations about the buffet?
Was it good at least?
Oh, no! Did you end up eating it anyway?
Wow! I am very proud of you! What is your max.
You got this!
I've seen a couple of those. Which one is your favorite?
Oh man i love scary movies!
Smoking is the single most responsible lifestyle choice I've ever made.
That's a really interesting world-view. I'm glad you're finally able to make that choice to quit.
Oh yeah? Did you do it?
That is so scary!  I would be so scared!  What did you do?
what kind of things you got done
That's very neat. I'm not a fan of paying the bills myself, but I admire the hard work that goes into it. It's a hobby that can be very fun for many different people.
That's awesome! How did you do it?
Sounds like you worked out hard.
That's gross!  What did you do?
That was very nice of you. I bet he'll forgive you.
Oh man that sounds super scary! Are you alright now?
Oh my gosh, that sounds horrible. I can't imagine how you feel. I hope you're feeling better.
Aw I am sorry to hear that, I hope it's a picture of a happy time?
That happened to me too, it can be hard to not be in a relationship for a while. Have you talked to him about how you feel?
Crying can be such areating
I can understand, getting sad can be quite sad.
That's sad, did you miss it?
Eww.deer are so innocent though.
I hear you. That's why I carry around a food dehydrator just in case lol.
It's really difficult to lose weight.  Do you have a fast metabolism?
That is so cool.
Wow, that speech was certainly inspiring and dramatic!
Yay. Was there litter box full?
That is so amazing.  I love puppies
Easter eggs? Never heard of that.
Easter eggs are the greatest amusement park attraction ever!
cloves give me such a headache.
cloves give me horrible anxiety sometimes too
Oh no, did it break?
That is unfortunate. Do you not have a photo to prove it?
Oh no!  Did you have to pay extra for them at least?
It would be nice if karma was calculated for the amount of money you stole.
that's so nice!! I love dresses, I'm glad you enjoyed the ball
That is absolutely amazing! I am very envious of her!
Oh wow, that must of been a pain. Did they give you a reason why?
Ouch, I know how that is. I'm a dentist and I'm always nervous about making an appointment. What did you get done?
I can't imagine life without the internet.
I agree. Sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming though
Yeah I love sleeping to see animals
It can be hard to get used to
Oh no! Is your dog okay?
Oh my god. Are you going to get another dog?
I know what you mean. No bills or responsibilites?
I know right, I had none either.
awww that's so sweet. were you close to them?
I know how that would be. Sometimes it is good to look back.
That must have been a relief.
Congrats! What do you hope to do this next semester?
What happened?
Haha! That's good that it didn't tear anything up!
Sounds like a great plan. What is your workout like?
That's great, what kind of program are you running?
oh no!! what was it??
Oh no! Were you in front of a big audience?
Wow. That's awesome. How long did it take?
That is great! I am happy for you! What do you like to work on?
That's great! What are you going to do now?
wow thats awesome.  How long did it take?  I cant even do 20 minutes in the gym
Were you surprised?
Dang! That's gotta be awkward. Do you know if she's still in touch?
That's pretty cool. Has he been getting better at it?
That's awesome. Tennis is pretty much the only sport I can play.
I hope it turned out well for you. How did it make you feel?
I'm really glad that you were able to work things out. That must have been a really big deal.
I agree. Do you miss it?
yea i know i had bills but it was nice
Oh no, I hope you recover well.
That is so scary! I'm glad you are doing good now!
Glad you love it. Do you work out regularly?
I love going to the gym too.  It can be very inspiring.  I used to be the most consistent too, but now I have dropped off a few times.  How about you?
That's interesting. Do you see them as more of family or as more of a "pedo" than a "your" parent?
Yeah, it can be tough. But, sometimes that can get you to the right person.
Thats terrible
Thats really sad to hear... I know exactly how you feel.. I have two dogs and have had them for well over 15 years
Glad to hear it. How did they betray you?
I am sorry to hear that. That is hard.
That's so sad! I'm sorry to hear about your cat, but it must be heart breaking!
That is so sad. I'm sorry. At least you had a lot of cats before her.
Oh no! I bet that was scary!
That cat must have felt a little peeved, hu?
I can imagine. Is everything okay now?
i can imagine it was a very stressful time for you
I know that feeling! Mine are soon.
I feel the same way.  I'm going back to work in September, so I'm trying to get my mind off of it before then.
Oh, wow. It's always nice to visit, but it's so hard to be around people for long.
Oh no, I am sorry. I am sure it was not too big of a deal to him and you. Did he enjoy the dinner?
That sounds fun! What color is it?
Congratulations on the new dress! I love a nice new dress. I'm sure you'll rock it at the wedding!
Good to hear you got to sticking with it.
Congratulations! It's always nice when we accomplish something we were so sworn to never do, even if just temporarily.
Nice, what type of opportunities may I ask?
Cool! Do you think you will get it?
That's good. How did you do?
That is good advice. Hard work usually pays off!
Ouch that is awful. How expensive was it to fix?
Oh man! Did he apologize to you?
oh thats good.. how long had you known him
yes it is nice remembering old times.
Nothing better than being free
That sounds relaxing. You sound determined.
That would be very scary. I think you could try yoga pants to see if that helps.
I had those dreams too when I was in school. It was terrible because you could see the clothes changing hands constantly.
Maybe one day you can. It's not impossible.
I know how that feels. My friend just bought a house last month. He and his wife are struggling financially.
I bet you had a good time?
That's a really good idea, actually. You can always travel on a vacation, where you stay for a while and then come back!
Oh that is cool! Did you guys have a good time talking about the things that happened in the past?
That is good, memories are always nice
I would have been so annoyed! Were you able to get it cancelled?
I am so sorry, I hope everything turned up ok
I am really sorry about that. What happened?
I am glad to hear that! It sounds like you have been taking steps to break through the block.
Yes that is very bad. I think we have to have an open and honest discussion about that.
I agree totally. It's an awful thing to deal with.
I would be so angry. You could have checked your block list and found out who they are before messaging you.
Oh wow, I would be very apprehensive, too. I would block them from contacting you in the first place, so you wouldn't have to see those messages.
That sounds so fun! I'm really jealous. I'm afraid of heights, but I'm also very scared of falling.
It should be fine! I'm sure you will have no trouble
oh no. I hope you get that figured out.
I get them too sometimes. I'm in a small town with very few people.
You sound so motivated, I am jealous!
You must be very strong!
I am glad it turned out healthy.
That is very sweet. It is so nice to know that your will do great things for your family.
Wow that's pretty cool. How long do you think you'll be able to kick flip for?
Wow that is impressive! You must be pretty good.
That's a tough situation to be in. I'm sorry. But being lonely can be good for you. Maybe you should try to hang out with other students to make some new friends.
You can't always be online only study.
I believe in you, I would be nervous too. Just try your best and don't worry about it
I think you will do okay. I am sure you will make it.
That is good. You should do everything you can to make this relationship work.
Not really. I have a boyfriend, though.
Oh really? Why is that?
Yes I hate those sticky sticky bugs that are everywhere! I am so afraid of them!
Being single isn't all that bad! You're doing something right if you're able to do it!
I am so proud of you! You are doing great.
That sounds lovely! I've driven most of the South from Alabama to Florida. It's a long drive, but it makes for good conversation piece after work.
That's a long drive!
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Were you driving recklessly?
That is horrible, I hope you had insurance.
How did it go? How did it make you feel when you did the decision to let her in?
Patience is very important, and being patient is very important too.  How did it go?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried encouraging her to play with other rats?
rat love is a mystery
I love Six Flags! Do you go frequently?
I have never been to one before.
Wow that's really interesting! Is she small or large?
Have you taken her to the vet to get checked out?
I am sorry, that's terrible.
Oh no. I hope everything works out for you.
I would have been so sad. How did you feel?
oh my gosh thats so funny i would have been so embarrassed
Oh man. I hate when that happens.  Were you able to work it out?
I'm sorry to hear that. You have to live with it though.
I feel you! I just preordered my first album and I'm stoked to listen it tonight.
That's awesome! Congratulations.  You must be jazzed up :)
Wow, how exciting! Are you going for work or pleasure?
Wow, I had no idea. When are you going?
I agree. We mustn't take it for granted.
That is very true.  I have faith that we will one day be able to solve all of life's problems by our own if we are willing to do the right things by the right people.
Oh I do not like the woods!
That sounds really scary!  I'm glad you survived
Oh my word! How did that happen.
That's disgusting. What did you do?
That's so nice. What was it that reminded you of her?
Oh wow, that is really nice of her! What a caring person.
Wow. She is awesome.
Well, that will be fun! Hopefully, they have enough food to share. :)
Well that is very exciting.  My family is coming too this year but it is a long ways away.
That is very sad.  My mother in law is in a nursing home now and she is not expected to live much longer either.
That's sad. You have my sympathies.
Yeah i can imagine it can bring you down but in the end great accomplishment none the less
ah thats bad, was you tired because of the traffic?
That sounds terrifying! I am glad you swerved around safely!
How's it going with that?
Thats really tough. I bet you can tell him that its ok though.
It's natural that people with money love to spend as much time with their partner as they do.
I feel ya, I have a hard time respecting people sometimes myself.  But I guess that comes with being a person
oh.. why didnt you knock him out?
That could definitely cause an argument. What did you do?
Why was that?
That must've been humiliating.  I hope you weren't too afraid to ask for another pair.
Ooh good luck with that!
That's funny! What are your thoughts on the whole situation?
I feel the same about mine. I can't wait to go!
Yeah I understand that, maybe one day when they are older.
That is awesome!  How did you win?
Sounds amazing! How did you win?
Oh, how exciting!  When is it?
That is great!  40 is an amazing number!
That's exciting. Do you have some family members that are going to be there?
She sounds like a nice person.
Oh no! I bet it was so scary. Are you okay?
Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that. Are you and your family ok?
Wow. That's quite a while period of time.
Good for you. You can't live your life alone. others can make your life crappy.
It seems as if you are following a different kind of vegetarian than I am. I am a agnostic vegetarian and even I can't be vegetarian.
Woah, that's pretty scary! Has she done any damage to her belongings?
Was it for school?
Hopefully, you will do well and earn a nice bonus. What is the certification exam for?
Good luck.What is the certification exam for?
It's okay. I do the same thing when I see my wife's. How old is she?
Oh no. Is everything okay?
That's great for you!  I assume that you've worked hard for it?
I bet you were shocked and happy at the same time
That's terrible :(  What happened?
Its hard when your partner leave you. I know how you feel.
move to the center of your city! you'll meet lots of new people
That is tough, but also makes you appreciate your neighbors more.
That is terrible, are there any other exams that can take your place?
That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.
That must be annoying. What song was it?
what song?
oh yea i remember those as well
They are pretty nice. Did you use them once?
Are you looking forward to buying?
How many people are you expecting to see?
That's a bummer. I'm sure you were happy for her though.
Oh, that's disappointing. Maybe you can see her next time?
Oh that's disgusting! Was it her first day of school?
My cousin had just had spaghetti too! It is so gross! My grandmother used to make it and I bet she used to make it worse.
That must have been horrible
That's really terrible. I would be livid too!
What were the memories of?
I know the feeling.  My little girl just went off to college last year and it feels like I lost all of the good time I had with her when she was little.
Did you do this because you wanted something in particular or because you needed something?
Haha, I love diabetes. It's no fun trying to eat a bunch of junk food, especially when you don't have to eat it all day!
Sorry to hear about your loss.  Do you have any friends and family that can helps you through this time?
im sorry to hear about that
That's pretty cool.  What did she get you?
She must have really enjoyed that.
I'm really sorry to hear that, I'm sure the feeling is mutual though.
I'm sorry you're going through that. It's definitely stressful. I hope you'll get the right one soon.
Oh no! I hope you find it.
Can you retrace your steps to find it?
I am so sorry to hear that. Did you call them?
Well, at least you realized it was you and not a random person on the internet.
Same here! Nothing like a good dose of reality checking.
i agree. older I's seem to age gracefully while young people's seem to shrivel up and go shrieking.
Oh no!  That must have been embarrassing.  I would have been so embarrassed!  Did anyone help you?
Oh no! That must have been embarrassing! But I'm glad you're okay!
I think that would be weird.
That's weird, I think cats are more like family members than friends
Oh no, I bet you really liked those items! What did he leave you?
i bet you really enjoyed looking through those items
Did you two have a good time together?
That's really great that your dad is such a good father.
What happened?
Oh man!  That had to be embarrassing!  I hope you weren't in any pain!
Oh wow, that is very nice of you!
That is very kind of you.
Oh that is so great! I love puppies what kind was it?
Awe how cute! I bet he's fun to play with!
I'm so sorry. That is awful.
You're so welcome. You can tell she was upset, but you can't help but feel she wanted to do something to hurt you. Either way, you're a good husband and I am sure your wife would have loved it if you were able to help.
Oh wow, that's impressive! I don't know anyone who drinks soda! I try to stay away from it.
That's unfortunate. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I am addicted to coffee so I understand.
I'm glad you understand your actions. It's important to be able to have open communication with your partner, as you said.
Sometimes when kids are kids it is difficult to be direct and direct with them.  It sounds to me like you did a good job of raising her in such a way.  I'm sure she will forgive you eventually.
That sounds like it would be very nostalgic. I used to love playing games from the 90s. What types of games did you play?
Wow that sounds awesome! I love COD and COD 2 are my favorite games of all time
That's not good. Were you qualified for it?
I am sorry, I am sure you did everything you could to get the job.
That sounds terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.
What kind of things have you changed lately?
That is awesome, I am happy for you.
That sounds like a lot of money.
That's a lot of money. What do you guys do for fun?
That is a really exciting dream to have! I'm glad you can make her happy.
I do too but I don't have that kind of relationship with my friends
That is good. Sometimes hard situations make hard decisions.
Oh no. Did he come home?
That's so sad!  Did you find his way out?
You must be so proud of them! I'm glad you have that type of relationship with them!
It is certainly worth it! I used to not be able to skateboard.
Oh no! Did they say why?
Yeah, I had a 6th grader who was very forgetful too. She had a couple of fumbles in her first day, but was otherwise fine in the 4th.  I had a 7th grader who was the worst though, she fumbles a lot, but she got better.
Oh no! Did the new person do a good job at least?
I'm sorry, that sounds like a hard situation. I hope you get the opportunity to get a similar opportunity in the future.
haha.. late, but funny
That sounds like a sticky situation. Did you tell him about it?
That's so bad. Have you gone to a doctor for it?
Oh that is awful, I am sorry! I have the same problem. Are you on meds?
I have always wanted one of those! My son has had one for a while now. What kind of car is it?
That sounds like such an amazing experience, I bet it was scary and awesome! Grandpa gave it to him for his birthday? What a nice kid you are! :)
Did they even leave a note saying they had broken it?
Oh that really sucks. Did they even damage anything?
That is wonderful that you had someone to help her.
That is really nice of you for doing that. I'm sure she appreciated the extra service.
That is great to hear! Kaching is an amazing feeling.
That's so sweet! How old is your son now?
That sounds very nice and blessed. I am happy to hear that!
That sounds great! I'm glad to hear that your blessings have brought you great joy.
Were you sad to look at them?
Yeah I know that feeling.  It seems like so long ago!
Aretha Franklin is the greatest singer of all time.
Aretha Franklin is the best singer ever.
OMG. RICE AND SOUP. Yum!
Oh man, I'm jealous. Sounds yummy!
Oh no, I'm sorry. That must be stressful, and I hope everything works out.
That's a real bummer. How long do you think it'll take for them to be reunited with their father?
awesome! when do you get the grade?
I hope so too! Good luck!
That's great! Are you excited?
That is always a good idea.  Did everything go as planned?
Thats terrible, i feel like bullying should be stopped.
Thats awful to hear!  I hope that changes. bullying needs to stop.
How did that go?
Good for you, you are a person of morals.
I'm so sorry to hear that did he get better?
Oh that's hard! I hope she gets better.
A kitten? How cute! I have 3 cats, they are adorable. Do you know what kind of cat it is?
That is so sweet.  How many cats do you have?
I can only imagine, music is so much fun. What cello were you playing?
That's great! I've actually never played the cello. I was always a flute player, though.
Oh man, did you tell any of them or did you go to the restroom?
Oh no, did they laugh at you?
That sucks. Why didn't you want to stay?
That's too bad. Maybe he should take a break?
Maybe you can ask him for a break? I'm sure he'd be happy to hear from you.
Well that's not good at all.
That would be disappointing.  You could have returned it and asked for credit
Oh man that sucks! I hate when it happens! Did you end up buying a new one?
That was nice of you. I bet he appreciated it.
You are a good friend!  How old is your child?
That's great! Kids are the best
Wow that must have really grossed you out, I hope you were able to find some to eat.
That would be gross, I hope you reported it to someone
You got this bro, you got this. Just take a warm towel and get out there and start playing.
Just try to have confidence in yourself and your abilities, and that way you won't embarrass yourself or your team.
Oh no! Did the vet find out who did it?
Oh, wow!  That's a big dog!  Did you have to go to the hospital for stitches or were you able to get him removed?
That's a great friend! What are you most excited for?
I like your thinking.  What game did you play?
Cool.  Are you going to stay at her house or to visit her for a little bit?
That's good that you still have your word to hold onto.
Oh wow. I bet that was scary for you. I would've freaked out. I'm glad your cousin was understanding.
I bet that was a tough phone call to make.
ah thats a tough decision, i like my sewing machine too! keep it for sentimental reasons
I understand. Sometimes things that are irreplaceable can become collector's items.
That is amazing!  I bet he or she worked really hard for that.
That is really amazing.  It is nice when someone can get ahead in life.  You must have felt very proud too
Whoa that is horrible, did he take any damage?
I would be too! Did you confront them?
Aw that's cute! I love stuffed animals.
Aw, that's so sweet of him, I bet he appreciated it. But I'm sure you miss him a lot.
That is awesome.  Sounds like a really special moment!
I can't wait for the day that I get to finally spend with my family!
Yeah I've been there before too. I hate going to the zoo. Too many animals
That is so sad! I love zoos, and I feel so sad for the animals!
That's awesome!  Are you sending the essay to anyone?
That is pretty cool. I haven't been to Washington in ages.
Where to? What city?
Where to?
That's kinda mean.
Oh my gosh. That is kind of mean.
That's nice. Are you a part of the work team?
That's very kind of you! You must think you are being considered for a promotion.
That's so awesome! What did she win?
I would of loved that too! What is your sweet 16?
Woah! Really? That is crazy. Did it look like a kangaroo?
Wow, that is pretty gross. What did you do after?
Are you going on vacation??
It is always better to be ahead of the game.
Oh no! Did they leave a note at least?
Are you going to sue them?
Awww. I bet that was a special moment for you.
Aww, that's so sweet. Did you end up getting to take her on a puppy trip or something?
That's nice of you. What did you get from him?
That would be nice! What did he buy recently?
That is so terrible! I don't get why people can't just be nice and help others.
I know right? Why do people have to steal what is yours to others.
What kind of news?
Waiting always kills me.
Oh that's awful! I'm so sorry!
That is disappointing. I hope something better will come up for you.
That sounds like someone wasn't happy.
That's disgusting.
Where are you moving?
Where are you guys moving to?
What book was it?
That sucks. I borrowed a book from the library once and it almost torn up too. What book did you borrowed from the library?
did you cry for a while?
What kind of dog was it?
That's great.  Did you just get a job offer?
Good for you! Statistics can be tough
That's really good. Are you pretty sure you're going to do well on it?
That is really good! You must feel prepared already because you have prepared so much!
Why did you give it to him?
Oh, man! I'm so sorry! Is your friend okay? Can you repay him?
That really is, it is good you stayed loyal.
That sounds like a good job
Wow, that sounds very interesting. What sort of things does your work consist of?
What job did you interview for?
Oh that sounds exciting. I hope you get the job.
That's really cool!  How far did you move?
That is true in a way.  It is a difficult move, but it is good that you have good friends already.  How far have you moved?
I feel you, I have a guilty pleasure for body wash lol
I understand. I have done the same. I sometimes regret buying something new.
Staying at home is good sometimes.  At least you don't have to do anything!
Staying at home is the best thing you can do today.
That is tragic. I am sorry for your loss.
im sorry for your loss, hit hard by a car. i love my pug he was always there for me
Is it coming straight for you?
Sounds scary! Are you going to be able to stay in contact with someone that is helping you out?
That is nice of her.  It sounds like she really loves you.
That sounds great! I'm glad you're getting better, soup is my lifeblood.
It's really frustrating when the restaurant claims to but they aren't and you get sick! I hope your eating habits improve as well.
That's a bummer. I'm glad you have people who look out for you. You shouldn't have to put up with gluten free food just to get a bun. It's cruel.
That's racist.
Oh no!  That sounds so wrong, and so unprofessional of the kitchen staff.
Awe that's cute. It's nice to have things that remind us of our simpler times.
Aww! I remember those jeans. They were so cute and comfortable.  You must feel sentimental about it!
That's nice. I hope they were delicious!
That's really nice. pancakes are sooo good! What did you have for breakfast?
that's awesome, what kind of bacon was it
I would have asked her how many hours are in and out day and how does she do it in a week. She is very dedicated and knows what she is doing.
What a great surprise that must be for your friend!
Well I hope he doesn't slip up and ruin your plans! But at least he's trustworthy enough to do that for you
That's very nice of you. What she needs is a friend that is there for her no matter what. I wish you the most success.
thats awesome of you
Sometimes it's hard to be in a better position. What kind of car is it?
That sounds cool, what made you want one of those?
Wow! I would be jealous, those things are really cool
What are you saving for? Are you saving more for something in particular?
I think that is normal, they have to learn somehow!
Well she is growing up, I think she will learn to remove things from her pants quickly.
What kind of toy did your son want?
That's so exciting. How old is your son?
That is great! I've never been on a cruise. Have you gone on one before?
Wow that is exciting!  Have you been on a previous cruise before?
Oh no did everything turn out alright?
Oh my goodness. That must have been so scary. Is he okay now?
Being humble is the way to be.
Well I'm glad you're back on track!
junk food can be good in moderation though, like a snack
I feel guilty for eating junk food as well
That's great! Did you guys have a great time?
That's so sweet. presents are the most precious things in the world.
That's nice. It's nice that she wanted to participate.
She must be very talented! You must have felt so proud to show your daughter your love.
That is terrible, what is it a type of?
that sucks
That sucks. Is she going to be alright?
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any meds that can help her keep her weight down?
That sounds relaxing! What kind of cat do you have?
That is awesome, did you get a pet while you were chilling?
Nice, did you feel nervous about it?
I am sure you will be fine. Don't be nervous.
did you enjoy it?
I am happy for you
lol....that would make me lol....what did they do?
Oh wow. That's a throwback!
Oh, that sounds like fun! Did you guys have a good time?
Thats awesome.  How old is she?
Well that's nice of him to help. It's always good to have a dad that is able to provide for you.
disability doesn't help much if it's taken that long for the disability to kick in. I hope you get it though!
I'm glad you have someone to talk to. How did it go?
It can be daunting. I hope it goes well for you.
Thats awesome.  Is there a lot of kids in school nowadays?
Aw, that's a cute surprise! I bet that makes for a nice change of pace!
Did they not invite you?
Oh man, that sucks. I bet it really frustrated and lonely! Did you make any friends while driving?
That's pretty long. How long was it for?
Why only one cashier?
How was it?
It's hard when you're sad, but you should still be able to take some time and grieve.
Wow how exciting!  Where are they going?
That's great, where did you guys all go?
college?
That is true, college is so different
That's sucks, but I suppose you could always make it work with facebook and stuff like that.
Lol that's pretty low
Sometimes people need a little redemption.  At least she was honest.
What did you do?
That sounds terrible. Some people just don't understand how others are treated.
I am sorry, I hate to hear that!
That is sad. I am sorry.
That really sucks. I am sorry, but I bet you will see her more now.
That's a real blessing. It feels like summer has been so boring, and now with school starting again it makes me want to be ready for school again.
I am sure it did. Its good to be prepared for school.
Oh I'm sorry. Did everything turn out okay?
Oh, I can imagine. I'm in the same boat as you. I hate when you spend so much money worrying about something and then it turns out to be nothing.
Oh no. That must be so hard on you. I hope everything is ok.
That really sucks. I hope he's better now. But at the time I'm sure it felt terrible!
What sport is that?
That is very true! Life moves fast when you are away from it
That sounds great, I've never been fishing before!
That sounds interesting!
That sounds really good. What are you going to get?
I love dominos, have you ever had some?
Why are you nervous?
I hate that too. I always have to sweep the house then I feel ready to go!
what did you have in mind
Cameras are very expensive, so it sounds like a smart move to get one!
That would make me mad, too. What did you do?
That must be so frustrating, especially when you have to do such a thing repeatedly.
That sound like it's going to be fun!
Nice I love camping.  Where are you going camping?
I bet that was scary!
Oh my god.  What did you do?
Do you have an umbrella? It's very hot where I live.
Maybe you should get the hose again.
Aw! What kind of cake was it?
Aw man.  Don't feel too bad.  Some cake allergies can be really hard to deal with!
Those can be nerve wrecking. I hate them. But good on you for putting yourself out there.
You like spending money?
They must have good ingredients then.
Oh yeah, I love the chocolate ones also. They're just so rich. Do you have a favorite brand of cookies?
I bet that was very nostalgic. Did it make you happy?
That's wonderful. It's always nice to see little moments like that.
That is great. My daughter is the same way.
You must be so proud of her.
They must've got a big order. Did they have it in stock?
I know right. I think Dean's is one of those few. People who love it are weird.
Oh wow! Congratulations!! I'm so happy for you!  I bet you're so excited!
Awesome! Congratulations! Is this your first promotion?
Is there any chance you won't get it?
Is there anyway to get the promotion?
That's so great. Medical supplies are very important to have.
That's horrible! Did the punishment seem fair?
That is insane. Have you contacted your attorney?
Wow, I didn't even know they made it that far!
That is awesome.  I can imagine how excited you were when England made it to the semi-final.  Was there any big plans before the game?
I remember that feeling.  Were you on the bus ride home?
That can be so much fun though when they are little and learning how to be social!
It is crazy to think that kids can change so much at such a rapid rate. How do you feel about it now?
Oh that is awful.  I hate it when something like that happens.  Were there other people at the workplace?
Oh no! I can imagine how gross that would be. I hate germs!
Whoa, that's a lot of charges, what was they accused of?
That's horrible. I feel sorry for the people that have to put up with those animals,
yes we need more people like you who will protect them
I agree with you there. Jail is too harsh.
that is so nice of your son, how did it go?
You must be so proud of him!
I sure am too! They have been a big part of our school for years.
YES. Kids school is awesome!
The older I get, the easier it is to just skip the commercials.
Hey that's a good plan!  Where are they headed?
Awww... I hope you guys enjoy your time off!  And yeah bored would be the worst!  LOL!
That's scary!  I don't know too much about dogs, but huskies usually have a high fever when they are loose.  Did you get it inside?
That must have been frightening.
I am so sorry to hear that.
Oh man, I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are all right and everything is okay now.
That is great.  It is so important to teach your children properly.
That is cool.  You must be a great parent.  It is always nice to watch kids learn things.
That is really bad, what will you do?
Oh man! I would be mad, too! How did you find out?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Did she give you some money?
Wow, that is very lucky for you. Sometimes life just gets in the way.
I know the feeling! I went through the same thing. How long have you been married?
I know the feeling too, getting used to all the noise and crowding.
That's messed up. Did you getIn trouble?
Oh no! Well that's terrible that she didn't check your back. Did you end up getting in trouble with anyone?
What movie was it?
Haha, sorry to hear that! Did you try to watch it late?
That was very mean of him. Why did he forget?
That really stinks, what are you going to do?
why arent you alone
Hahaha i can relate to that, my son is like that too, he won't leave me alone to pick up his chores!
Are you nervous? butterflies are quite attractive.
You definitely won't if you just believe in yourself!!
Oh my, did you kill it?
I hate bugs! I would have bit that too!
Oh wow.  I bet you were frightened.  Did you get hurt?
Oh wow, I'm glad you were able to get away safely.
What type of dog did you get?
I love a nice dog, what breed is he?
That's a really big piece of pie. You should share it with someone.
Eww, yeah that's pretty selfish of you. I'm sure she'll make sure to find it and make sure to eat it for you when she gets back.
Oh my goodness, that is terrifying!  What did you do after?  Did you get attacked?
I would have totally made a mess, he doesn't like people lol
That sounds terrifying
That must have made you feel really good!
That is great, bonus is always nice.
That sucks! Hopefully you can find someone to go with.
Thats terrible. Im sorry. Maybe go on a date with some of your friends
I love butterflies! What kind of camera did you use?
That is awesome! I love butterflies, and I bet that is a really beautiful swallowtail.
Ew, that's gross! I hope your dog was all right!
That's gross, did you get mad at her?
Did you try and get your cat to go to the bathroom?
Oh no!  Did your cat get tired?  That cat needs to stop playing.  Sucks that it's so annoying.
That sounds exciting. How do you think it went?
Thats exciting, I hope you do. Just stay positive and keep doing your best
I bet that was scary
Oh, dear! I always try to keep a cool head, but it is very stressful when your on a plane!
That was a really good idea though.
Well, he is more honest than you. And probably knows you didn't actually win the million dollars.
What? Did you call the cops?
That's not right.
That is so sad.. I feel sorry for you.
I am so sorry to hear this happened to you, but remember him as a boy and not a cat.
Wow, I bet that was awkward. Did you tell him you found out?
That sounds very interesting. I'm sure he appreciated the effort.
Oh congratulations!! I bet you were so proud of yourself!!
You did great, I am sure they appreciated it.
Aw, I bet that gets annoying.  What song is it?
That's really annoying, I dislike most music.
Okay?
Working as a consultant, doing some design work
Oh my god, really! Did they react by slapping you in the face?
That's terrible!  I would have been so mad at you
What did he do with the car?
Oh no that is a terrible situation. I am sure he will pay back at least $1000.
Are you nervous about which major to pick? I'm sure you've done the research.
Nurse, nope. graphic design is great, and is more of a business degree
That's a wonderful idea. It can really make the difference in the Christmas shopping experience.
Well that's good. I think it's important for everyone to be able to put away a little bit of money in case they ever need it.
That is horrible. What happened?
Oh no! I hate it when that happens. Hopefully things work out for you guys
Sometimes there is. If he says no- there isn't much you can do.
That's good that you are taking a stand on something.
That's really rough! I'm sorry to hear that.
I love leaving a few bucks extra just to get me through the day.  But I have to admit that I have come close to doing the same thing.
I'm sorry to hear about that, it must be tough for you
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I think it's important for husbands to have space for their families, and husbands to be able to talk to his grandmother and other family members about things. Take your own time, and make sure you spend time with them daily, and you'll start to feel a lot more
Oh no, that must be really stressful! I hope everything goes well for you.
That's smart. I hope everything goes smoothly.
I'm sorry to hear that. I know your pain very well.
Thats terrible, i know exactly how you feel.
It does, but sometimes we don't have the time or the motivation to do those things.
Ah, the good old days of childhood. When all of your cares and needs were felt. Good for them.
It must be so difficult letting go when they have so much potential.
Oh man. I bet that was scary!  I can't imagine doing that.
Oh no that must've been awful!  Glad everything turned out well.
Oh wow! Congratulation. I know that game can be difficult.
I'm so jealous! Congrats, that's so awesome.
Aww that is so sweet. How old is she?
That's awful. I hope you got one of the cute ones that doesn't want to water, and can clean it up. Sometimes they like to burrow-out, so it may make them feel more at ease.
Were you alone?
oh no! that sounds horrifying! I bet that did some damage to your body
Oh no, what happened?
Oh no! I hope they are okay!
That is great. Is she going to grad school?
It must be so nice to be a parent and see your children grow up to be successful.
Oh, no, I'm so sorry. I'm sure it's been rough.
That's so scary! I am glad you are okay now though.
Oh boy, that must be hard.  How old is she now?
I am sorry, that is difficult
Is the car in good shape?
thats good of you. i wouldnt let my sister borrow mine either. she has to have it with her to drive.
What type of test is it?
Good luck! What subject is it in?
Ah, reminiscing is always nice. What was the song?
I know the feeling. I hear old pop and retro music all the time.
That is terrible, I am sorry.  Have you tried to cope with it?
I bet you were very upset
Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope she recovers well.
Oh no. I am so sorry. Is she alright now?
Nice, what was it? I am on a diet and trying to stay healthy!
Sounds tasty! What did you have?
How did it go?
Trust is key. If you don't have trust then what's the point of life.
Caffeine can definitely cause headaches. Have you considered getting some of those natural sweetener sodas?
Caffeine is a bad thing in general. You shouldn't drink it in the first place.
Good luck and I'm sure you did fine if you did get it. What type of job is it?
I sure hope you get it. Waiting always kills us.
Oh man!  Why did you clean it?!  Did you find anything cool?
Oh, no. That is infuriating. Some parents won't take responsibility for lost toys. I've found that if the parents aren't satisfied with the toy's behavior, they usually will return the toy to the store to be sold at a later date.
What is Shepard's pie?
Sounds like a good plan.
How did that make you feel?
Oh wow.  How did that make you feel?
That sounds really scary! What did you do?
I bet that made you feel a little anxious.
That must have been overwhelming!
That sounds amazing!  Do you have kids now?
That would be hard!  Did you make it up to her?
That is nice of you
Thats awesome what kind of paintball did you use
that's awesome! I don't know if i could ever find all my old stuff. i have a bunch of old pics myself
oh yea i remember that. it is always scary to go skydiving.
Skydiving is definitely an extreme but I've done it before. I'm glad you made it!
What kind of dog was it?
Oh wow, that is unfortunate. Hopefully yall were able to work out a new relationship.
On no! Were you okay?
That's embarrassing, I hope you didn't cause any damage!
That's awesome! I bet that meant a lot to both of you
I bet! Were the memories any good?
Congratulations! How long have you been living in this yard?
You should be proud. Your yard is beautiful.
That sounds awesome! What kind of park is it?
That sounds like an amazing day.
That does sound fun! Has it rained most of the day?
snorting chocolate doesn't do anything for me but i'm sure your trying to stay thin!
That's a real shame, well it's good that you managed to cut down on sugar anyway!
Oh no! Did he give it to you as a surprise?
Awe a friend you have, I know what you mean, my uncle gave me one when I was a kid, i dont think I could get it back
Oh yeah, that can be dangerous. Is she okay?
That's great! It's nice to see someone who is responsible enough that they won't take themselves too seriously.
That's awful! I'm glad she is ok. What kind of car was it?
That is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.
She sounds like a great person.
Family is great
That sounds scary!
That can be stressful. I bet you were fine after the flight.
That sucks. Why'd you have to cancel?
That is good that you had a plan. Sometimes people don't like a certain partner.
That would be, would you say... nostalgic?
I love that feeling of relaxation and contentment.  It sounds cliche but it feels so good!  I have a feeling you are a happy parent again.
Neat, I love skateboarding! What kind are you going to get?
Might be a good idea to get some Venom wheels since they've been doing well on the street.
That was nice of you. Did you guys have fun?
That's too bad. Is she going to be mad at you for not doing her job well enough?
That's awful. I hope she's okay.
I love meditating children.
That is great for her but I don't think I could handle that.
That's cool. I don't have a sister but my brother has a fiance. I hope they have a good marriage.
That is so awesome.  What is his name?
You should try it!  You will love it and your new pet!  adopt.
Was the storm severe?
That is awesome,  is she okay?
That's cool. I'm in college and have little programming experience. I wish I was as smart as him.
I'm glad you were able to get through it. What was the issue that he was having?
Congrats. Is it a big one? I hope you get it.
That would be great! I would feel nervous too but I'm sure you will get it
What is the name of your charity?
That's a pretty cool thing to do. I'm sure you have a good feeling about it.
That's great, I love when my wife gets happy!
She must really be excited!  How far west coast do you live?  I'm in Florida.
I live in Florida too. Why do you have to go so often?
It is good to visit as it can give you a different perspective on life in general. I'm in Florida right now and really miss the Gulf Coast
Oh wow. Must've been exciting.
I remember my first day of school. I was the same way.
That can be pretty scary. What subject?
That sounds hard but I'm sure you'll do well if you prepared. What is the language?
thats great news. You must be anxious waiting for the call
That sounds great, were you nervous about the interview?
oh thats cool
what movie? did you like it?
That's awful! Did they compensate you for the lost time?
That's terrible!  You should file a claim with the IRS.  You could get a whole new job!
I am sorry to hear that, that sounds stressful!
I have 2 dogs myself. I really love them!
That sounds frustrating! Have you tried reporting it to IT?
I'm glad you at least have the tech to get it done!
That's so sweet. It sounds like grandma's days are really getting to you.
That's funny! My girls do the same with my food. I think it's good that they get to enjoy grandma's time.
Oh my god. Is there anything you can do to help?
Sorry to hear that. Do you have any children
Ah, that is a pity.  When stocks go up, it is because people buy them.
That's unfortunate, I'm glad you put your money where there mouth is.
Oh no.  I hope you took him to the vet to be checked out.  Did they find anything wrong?
Maybe your dog was ill.
That's awesome. I'm glad to hear that, you must be pretty smart.
That's awesome! languages are fun to learn, and a lot of fun to work on too. You must be pretty great at it, then!
oh that is so nice! i just put in a weight and hope it doesn't roll off
That is a big ollie! How long did you train for it?
That is really exciting. The beach is really fun.
I am jealous of you! That will be so fun
That sounds wonderful!  I am so glad you will have something to do and feel better!
what?! that's awful, i'm sorry!
That's horrible.  Were you able to sleep in the plane?
That's pretty cool!  Did she surprise you with it?
That's an awesome gift!  Did you have any idea what you were going to get her?
That sounds troubling. What happened?
Well that was pleasant. It sounds like you have a good relationship with your boss.
That's good! I bet everyone was impressed!
Thats good.  Where did the raise come from?
Oh no!  Is the car in good shape/last?
I'm sorry to hear that. I know how that is. I hope things work out.
It will be tough if the car goes. But you need to try your best. You sound like a good person.
I know what you mean, it's such a wonderful time of the year
Oh I bet, I had some of those too when I was younger. I loved playing with my old ones.
what happened?
Oh wow, I would be too! Did you ask her about it? She may have not seen it.
OH. What did you do?
Well atleast you got a day off!
I know the feeling of not having expectations. I think it is a beautiful thing.
I bet. New jobs can be really exciting, but you never know about the hidden challenges and temptations that could be lurking around the corner!
That's great! I'm sure you'll do great.
How old is he? I remember when my girls use to do that.
That sounds like a great time! I hope he has a good time and is as excited as you are!
Nice, hope you do get it!
You will get it.  They like people who are passionate about what they do.  They will value your passion more than anything else.
That's great!  Is it a big company?
Oh nice. That sounds like it would be a good promotion
Oh no! Did they take him to the vet? Did he get hurt?
Oh that's sweet. It's good to know that no matter what happen, he'll always have a happy home.
Oh, that sounds exciting! What kind of job did you get?
That sounds like it would be a little uncomfortable for sure. How did it go?
Aw, no problem. What was it that made it so awkward?
I hope the doctor knows something I'm going through right now. It must be hard
Oh wow. I hope your doctor can give you some treatment options.
Wow, that's pretty awesome! I'm sure you're real proud of him.
That is amazing, I am so happy for you!
haha...that is too funny
hahahaha yeah that is not a good sign
that's great, kids grow up so fast, you should be proud of them too
Wow!  You are an early worker!  What do you do now?
I love the sega. I used to play sega with my dad all the time.
Of course I will always help. Do you need anything?
Oh no that must have been horrible. I am so sorry you're going through that. What did you decide to do?
Try yoga or meditation
I would love that if it worked.
I would buy that so fast! I hope it works for him!
I hope everything is ok.
Oh no! I hope everything is okay now.
Oh no, I hate when that happens!
That sounds scary!  I hate that!  Did you get home safely?
I agree, but first we must agree that you need to stop spreading rumors about other people's illnesses
I hear ya. I hate having to do work when I am trying to get things done!
Me too! I'm always ready for anything!
Me too. I always make a list and start packing it all the time.
Oh no! Was she disfigured or what?
That's pretty cool.  How long did it take to recover?
What happend? Will you miss her?
Oh no. I hate when that happens. Did she forgive you?
That's interesting. What was the reason that he felt compelled to do that?
That's interesting. It seems like he's been taking a lot of steps to make the position more official.
What kind of toys did you find
I know that feeling, it is nice to have things from your past sometimes.
Was it fun? Did you enjoy it?
Oh wow! That sounds lovely. I've never been!
What is your major and where are you currently studying?
Venice Italy is a nice city! Do you mean the University of Venice?
Wow that would be a surprise I bet
I am so glad you found her and not someone else.  It is always nice to get a good glass eye.  I know it was probably just a random person looking through the eye and seeing glass.
Me to I love Halloween thats why I love my family the most.
Sounds like fun. What are your favorite Halloween movies?
Are you planning on getting out of the company?
Thats awful! Why did they lay you off?
Was it a big one?
Was it a good lie? or a bad lie?
thats amazing.. i bet you worked very hard for that
That is great, I've been in my job hunt as well.
I'm so sorry. That's awful.
That is horrible!  Were they driving at a stop sign?
Oh nice! Did you get a nice present?
Oh that is so nice! What kind of shoes were they?
Nice,  Did you get the job?
Nice! I hope you get the job!
Oh no. That must have been scary.
Wow that would be really scary! Are you in the house?
What is the prize?
That sucks! I hope you win!
That was nice of them I bet your thankful!
Did they help you move your car too?
Sorry to hear that. Will you be able to try again this week?
Oh man, that sucks.  Maybe next time
Really? It was a good movie
I would imagine that would be both exciting and a little bit frightening at the same time! What made you do it?
I agree.  They don't seem to care about the interests of the people.
I don't think they own him. It's more like majority of the country doesn't share your view.
Aww man I am sorry to hear that!
That is so sad. How did he die?
How did that go?
I have had that happen. It is very frustrating.
That's not good. Did you have the files backed up?
Oh man! I hate when something like that happens! I bet that was frustrating!
Hey at least you had a good time with that! I don't really watch the sports
Oh I know the feeling. I'm a Boston boy and I hate it as well.
Oh no, I hope it nothing serious.
Gross! I hope it's nothing serious and you can just get a makeup fix
Oh that sounds like fun. What were some of your favorites?
What was the show? I'm looking forward to going to one soon.
Nice! What kind of job is it?
Great, good luck to you.
thats great. what was it?
That is great. What did you drink?
Wow, that was very nice of her. I wish my mom did that for me.
That was nice of her
how are you adjusting?
That sounds really lonely.
That is really a bummer.  Is there another dentist that can fix the braces?
That's a real blessing for both your family and your health insurance. I am glad your aunt was able to help.
So, you're the one who's to blame?
wow, that must have been quite relaxing, i am happy for you
What was his/her occupation?
That is so hard! I am so sorry. I am glad he has a new job and he is doing good
Wow, that is very nice of them!
Wow, that's really considerate of them!
Thats really sad to hear. At least you have good memories!
Awwww I bet that was nostalgic. Did you pass in front of your grandma too?
That is terrible luck. Did you have any sort of camera?
Oh man that really sucks.
That's awesome. Is it a good story?
What is the story?
Awe how nice! Was it a good surprise?
Oh that is so nice! I have always wanted to go to hawaii
That's great! Congrats! I have three dogs and one cat. Love them to death. What kind of cat are you getting?
That sounds so adorable! Congratulations on your new pet
Oh no. I'm sorry, but that is so difficult. I hope you will be able to come back and have them with you.
That is so sad! I am so sorry. I hope you can find someone who is able to help you.
oh cool! is he excited?
That's good, do you think he'll enjoy it?
What did he do to make you forget?
Oh no that is terrible! Hopefully it isnt a habit that stays!
Good for you.Going back to school can be very scary but it is so worth it.
Going back to school can be very hard, but it's good that you are taking it seriously.  I'm sure your parents are proud.
That's awesome. I love finding old family items.
That is nice. Did it make you wish you had things of your grandparents too?
Oh that sounds awesome! What kind of shop fix did they do?
That's great! Did they fix the shop?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How long has he been smoking?
That sounds terrible, what kind of drama is it?
That sounds like some great pleasant driving!
That sounds like a great time. What made them so great?
Oh no. That must be so stressful
That's terrible. Are you in charge?
I can understand that.  Are you going back to school?
College can be hit or miss sometimes.  Was she upset that you were not there much?
I bet she felt really sad and left you.
Aw, that's sad. Hopefully y'all can spend a lot of time together again.
Oh no! Do you have someone to call?
Oh wow.  I hope you find them.  What kind of car do you have?
What happened?
That is funny, roommates can be strange can they not?
That is very reasonable of you.
It is good of you to be so forward thinking about things like that.
Why is that?
Wow, that is a lot of money!
Good job. Was first place the most important thing?
That's great! What kind of race?
I would be so excited! What a nice surprise. Were you happy about it?
Wow. Sounds like you had a lot of prepared material. I hope it turns out for you, but I wouldn't count on it.
oh thats so nice, i love looking through my old photo albums
I know the feeling. 90s were the best.
That's really intense, do you guys still keep in touch? That sounds like fun!
That sounds terrible!
Oh no!  That sounds scary!  Did you go with him?
Oh I understand that completely.  It is pretty dangerous stuff to do.
I'm sorry to hear that but hopefully you can find time to catch up with him.
That is hard.  How many kids do you have?
What is the job for?
I'm sure you will nail it.
Don't be! You will be fine
That is exciting, family is so important
That is so sad. Did you help it get to the owner?
Oh no, I'm so sorry! Did you stop?
Oh no! How old was it?
I can imagine, it is very scary to be in front of your peers
Aw, I'm glad to hear it. How long have you been married?
That sounds wonderful!  What did you have?
Why!! What happened?
That is awesome! Congratulations
Yeah I get that. Music can really transport you anywhere!
Oh wow! I'm sorry for your loss. I can understand how you would feel that way. I hope you have some friends and can spend some time together.
That sounds like a very relaxing and happy way to spend your evening!
That's awesome that you have a pet who is helpful! I love cats but they can get a bit wild when they have an emotional moment.
Ouch! Is your dog ok?
I feel you on that, my friend. Dogs are so important and they can give life meaning. It breaks my heart seeing them suffer.
Hahaha that is hilarious!  I guess he really like you.
Oh no, did you ask him why he didn't ask first?
I'm so sorry, I know it must be hard.
Uh oh. I am so sorry.  What happened?
Awesome! I'm jealous!
I just finished that show today actually. It is one of my favorite shows of all time.
Oh, no. What did you decide to study?
What were you thinking at the time?
That's embarrassing, are you ok?
Oh no, did you get hurt?
soup is really good for anyone
That is so nice of you! soup is so good
That is annoying.  Sometimes it can be hard to pin point what the right thing to do is.
that's great, i love when people don't get shy
That's really impressive, good luck to you!
Oh, I'm so ready for that! I'm sure you'll do amazing!
Oh snap! Are you mad?
That would be a bit weird. Is there any chance he can come back?
Why did you break up?
I totally know how you feel. dated characters make me so mad. I'm sorry.
That is awesome! I bet you worked really hard!
That's awesome! What are you studying to get those grades?
Awww! I love kittens.  What's wrong with it?
Oh, I am so sorry! I am sure you had a rough day, but that plant was not your fault!
That is wonderful. It's so nice to be close to loved ones.
Visiting nursing homes is so nice!  They have some of the best doctors and technicians there.
Well that's nice of you. You're supporting her.
Oh I bet you're jealous of her skills!
That's great that you have a trustworthy and caring mother.  You must be proud of her.  What was the secret?
Sounds like you have a wonderful relationship with your mother!
Oh wow! Congratulations to him! I bet your were nervous and excited!
That's amazing!!!  I'm happy for you.  3rd year is a big accomplishment!  What school did he choose?
I am so sorry to hear about your sister. I know it has happened to everyone, but it is the nature of life.
That is hard. i'm really sorry to hear that
I understand, I have felt the same way when my daughter first started school.
Amazing!  I went to college in Alabama too!  I love Alabama and the people there!
Oh that sounds so nice!  Did you do anything with the family?
I can totally understand that! I have to work all day, so I have time to just relax and recharge. I bet you had a great time though!
That sounds exciting! How long will he be gone?
That sounds great! What are you cooking?
That is awesome!  Where has he been?
Oh that is fun. I love being surprised. You're husband sounds like a keeper.
It feels nostalgic, doesn't it? Do you miss him?
Time sure does fly by. I wish him all the best. I remember starting my own school myself when I was 5. I loved reading the books and playing the guitar!
Congrats! That's an amazing accomplishment. It must feel great to be rewarded for your hard work.
That is great, It always feels good when someone you worked hard for gets rewarded.
I hate it when people do that.  If it were my son, I would've been furious!
I can believe it! That's so mean
Thats great. Is she excited?
I bet that was a nice day
I hate when that happens.  I always make sure to have everything packed and set up when we go on vacation.  I'm a little OCD about things like that!
I bet it was disappointing when you forgot everything.  Hopefully next time!
I would have been so mad at him!
that is a slap in the face, glad you werent made
Oh, that sounds scary! Did you find out what it was?
Oh, no! I would have been terrified. I'm glad you were home alone
Wow, that sounds like an awesome birthday. Did you get a lot of presents?
That is awesome. I wish I had a surprise party.
I'm sorry you felt that way. What was the argument about?
Oh well thats life I guess.  Its good you are open and honest about it.
oh god, that's so scary!  I would have freaked out!
I am glad it was your shadow.
There are plenty of people in the world who need your help.  It is good you did not take it for granted or you could have easily stolen.  I am proud of you!
There are plenty of people in need all around the world. It's good you gave them something to help with.
I am happy to hear that, when my children are in their teenage years I will be able to say the same!
Congrats. It is so good to have a child that is healthy. I have two little daughters myself.
Why did you have to walk away from those conversations?
I can totally relate. I have the same thing going on. It's one of the few things I don't miss.
Oh no! I can relate, buying a new car can be so anxiety-inducing.  Did you have to call your dr?
I was in a car accident recently. I was wearing a seat belt and someone ripped it off. It was horrible.
Wow. That's awesome that you have that to support you. Keep it up!
Thats good.. I need to join one of these groups.
I remember being so nervous too.  What happened?
Congratulations on your achievement, I am sure you deserve it!
That must have brought back a lot of wonderful memories.
No, it's totally fine! I'd say it's even better to hand write. You don't need fancy cursive or anything but you can still read it and feel good.
I think it's a good idea to have things like that to keep for the memories and things that are meaningful to you
I am sure they will be happy to have everything sorted
Slippery floor, or slippery people?
Oh no, did you get hurt?
Why, what was the secret?
Oh, I am super sorry, I bet you feel awful! But that is the only thing that can happen, unfortunately. Maybe she has a secret admirer you can go out with, and be "friends" with for a while.
Aww, that is sad, but maybe you can make a special trip toMemphis for it.
Oh I see what you mean. I always feel that way, but then I remember that it was all part of the plan.
Awesome! You must be a great parent!
That's very encouraging! I wish I had a daughter
What type of car do you have?
That's great, I'm glad to hear that.
Sorry to hear that. Do you have enough people for the house to handle the load?
That's a good plan. I would just leave everything behind as is, but if it gets really messy I'd go all out with deodorant and antifreeze.
That's great. Sometimes family isn't good with money.
I feel you, my brother is like that too, he's never lied to me and is always straight forward!
Aw thats great I am happy that you have that kind of relationship with your brother!
Aw, that sounds adorable. I'm happy for you. I hope you guys get closer again soon!
That is wonderful.  Nothing better than an intelligent person after high school.  Sounds like you are very proud!
Teenagers have amazing potential.  What is her major?
That's good. Where do you work?
Sounds like a plan, I hope you have fun.
I am so sorry to hear that, my grandmother passed a few years ago and I still get so emotional about it.  Are you ok?
It is unpleasant indeed.  I am sorry you had to go through that.
Sorry to hear that, you are loved in her memory by all.
I am so sorry to hear that.  I am glad she had the goodness to go you know.
That's cool. I just preordered the new one.
That's awesome! I just got a PS4, though.
Thats very good. Im sure she misses you.
I know it is very hard, but I have lost both of mine, they are truly special people.
Closest neighbor to you that you have is a block away. What are you planning to do with yours?
You are living the dream
That's great! How far away is your friend from you?
That's cool, I have never hung out with an actor from across the continent. You must have put him in a good mood.
That is absolutely heartbreaking.  I have lost many animals to cats.  It is horrifying.
That's great, what kind of neighborhood did you live in at the time?
awww, that's so sweet of you to do, I bet he appreciated it
How cute! I love trees. Did you cut it back?
Did you graduate?
What class were you taking?
I am sure she has forgot about it too. Did you call her?
Oh wow, that must suck to not know your mother-in-law's birthday. I'm sure you've talked to him plenty to make sure it's not something that you miss.
Oh no! Did someone take you out or something?
I think that's a good secret, haha. Did everyone find out?
Oh no, that sounds awful. I hope you can get through them.
Yeah, those are definitely real dreams. You should find a hobby to take your mind off of them.
Stealing from someone is always a tough one, I can imagine how you feel.
It could have been worse. Could have stolen a kidney.
That sounds amazing. I would love to go to a retreat.
That is great! I need to try and go to a retreat.
Me too, I love the holidays!
That's sounds awesome!  Harry Potter is one of my favorite books!  What book are you going to see?
I'm sure it'll be in there. Just stay confident and you'll get in.
That is exciting. I have faith that you will get in.
Nice! I love cooking. What sort of dishes will you be trying out?
I'm not vegetarian but I've always loved the good olives and onions in Chinese. Can't go wrong with some grilled chicken or steak! vegetarian btw ;)
What was it that happened to
That must of been so cool to see.
I am so glad to hear he is healthy.
Thats great to hear.
That's great.  How long have you two been tegether?
That is awesome. Everyone loves a faithful partner!
That sucks. Did you beat her up?
That's a silly mistake to make.
That's terrible. What do you plan on doing about it?
Well that is terrible. I hope you get back in trouble.
That's a good thing did you use the highway for your emergency
That's good, how much did it cost?
that's nice of her. are you guys very close?
What a nice friend you have! She must be so excited! What's the gift?
Hey,we all do stupid stuff when we are young! dont feel bad
oh wow that is horrible
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing a parent is very hard, I can't imagine.
I'm sure he is happy that he is better
Life is good now?
What made you happy in life?
What type of cats were they?
That was very nice of you. They are probably lost.
What about 5?
You did? what was the grade?
Oh no! How badly did you swim?
Oh wow that is embarrassing! Were they tucked into your trunks?
Really? Why is that?
How did it feel after?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you still friends?
That sucks. Did you break up with him?
How come? Do you think managers are trying to micromanage you or what?
I feel you.I am the same way
Yeah.  Tooth cleaning is a chore
I totally agree. I don't know why some people think it's a good idea to have teeth that constantly.
Chills are so wakeful. Why do you get them?
That would freak me out, what do you normally wake up with chills from?
I bet that helped. I have been there before. Keep working out.
That's awesome! It's always good to see yourself improving, especially if you're having a hard time in the beginning.
Oh nice! It's always nice to go skydiving. And it sounds like it was really exciting!
I have always wanted to do that.
Good for you! success is an awesome feeling i agree!
Congratulations! What kind of music do you produce?
Do you have a big job?
That is very exciting. Do you have a doubt that you will use it for something that you will need later?
I have heard it can help calm you down. Have you done it before?
Meditating can relax you
Sometimes it just feels like nobody wants to be around you.
I know what you mean. I'm lonely sometimes too.
I hear you! I have been trying to use my emotions to control my kids lately and it is working!
yes i agree with that
That's awesome, I'm happy for you.
Thats awesome.  How much muscle have you lost?
That sounds fun! Do you have everything you need?
That is awesome! Have you always wanted to go camping?
Oh no. What happened?
Wow, it must have been heartbreaking.
Wow I could only imagine the shock of that! I'm glad you made it. What kind of rock?
That is very lucky! Rocks can be very destructive to cars.
Oh no! That is annoying. I'm glad you were there to help.
That cat must have a lot of struts.
Connections are important. I think you are doing a great job!
Connecting with God is the most important thing in your life.  I agree. Have you been religious recently?
Oh, that's terrible. I take breaths in the morning and afternoon, but I try to avoid going outside in the rain.
Oh, man, I know how that feels. Have you tried switching to something else to relieve the stress?
I know what you mean. I was one of them.
I am sorry to hear that, I have the same feeling. But kids do get popular eventually
Nice, I like taking baths. Did you find that it helps?
Nice! That's a good way of thinking.
It's important to be eating a healthy diet. How much do you eat?
Oh man. Do you feel like a million bucks? I need to go get me some of that!
Yeah that's true.  Especially if you consider them a "marketer"
Yeah they do a good job at giving a false impression as long as the person buying the product is honest
Aw that's frustrating! I bet you wanted to help her, but you didn't have to.
Oh no!!!  That's awful!!  I'm so sorry that happened to you.  I'm sure they didn't really need it.
I used to listen to that band.
Oh I feel you.  I used to listen to some of their stuff a lot when I was younger.  It's crazy how different genres can create such great musicians
Did you get it in the mail?
I'm happy for you. I've been trying to get mine for a while now.
I'm so sorry. That is a horrible thing to happen.
That's really horrible. Did they have any money?
I never do those unless I really need something. I guess door to door sales is the middle east by chance?
That's terrible, did you get in trouble for it?
Oh no, I hate it when that happens. Are you going to have him pick you up?
Oh no, does he sound like he needs to go see a doctor?
I don't know enough about fake religious services to speak on that.  I do know something about the abuse of vulnerable people though. That's very scary!
It's really sad and makes me feel as though I'm in the wrong crowd. I'm an ex practicing attorney and I work in the area, I attend church and attend a regularly called meeting of the Presbyterian church.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to overcome my deep rooted belief in god
That can definitely be worrisome but also liberating.
You should be fine.  Its the nerves that worry me the most.  Do you have a good team to work with?
Oh no, what did the mechanic say?
OH no, did you have someone come and look for it?
I am sure you will have lots of free time this week.
It sounds stressful
Oh no, what did he say?
That is terrifying!  I have experienced similar things from roommates before.  Did he/she eventually apologize?
why did you steal
What made you almost steal the computer keyboard?
Oh wow! Congratulations! Is this your first?
Oh wow I'm happy for you but I can tell you are very nervous. You have to be!
Oh yeah, I loved thanksgiving. What about you?
Yeah I agree! What was your favorite part about it?
Did you ask him to leave?
Haha that is weird! Did you confront him?
Oh my goodness that would make me so angry!
that's horrible! i hate that there is still some people who dont care about others
That's awesome! I love finding new items to try. What kind was it?
Oh that sounds really good! I haven't had sour cream in forever
That's great.  How long did it take for her to get sick?  That can be very dangerous.
That is great. It sounds like she is getting there. You must be so proud of her.
Wow.  I've never seen it.  Do you play on it often?
That is really cool.  I think minecraft is one of the most fun games out there
Why? Is it cancelled because you can't make it?
That's unfortunate. Maybe you can plan for a later date?
That is a great attitude to have!
What do you mean?
Yuck! Do you think it got inside?
Wow that is gross, I am glad you saw it too because if you saw 2,000 of them you'd have seen them all.
Oh no! Why are you so nervous?
Have you taken any tests yet?
