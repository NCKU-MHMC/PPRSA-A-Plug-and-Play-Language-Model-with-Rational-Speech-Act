That is terrifying! I know for sure that you will be fine and that they almost lost a loved one. They are such bad people!
Well that's all we really know about him.
Well, I went to Venice with you!
Yes, his license was revoked.
I'm sorry to hear that, it must be hard.
Yes I think that's a good thing, you can learn to embrace the distance, you can love the unknown!
What concert was it?
That's awesome. Are you going because you want to go to see them or because you just really like U2?
That is so terrible. I am so sorry for your loss.
That is terrible but they will be okay no?
Oh no! I hope he's okay now.
Ooh, that's nice of you! How old are you?
That's good that you are hopeful. What's wrong with the economy right now?
No problem, I'll talk to you tomorrow about spring cleaning at work.
Geeze, did the nanny died?
I protective of my kids too. Always watch out!
That's great. Where did you guys move to?
I have been there. Ik basically lived in your house for a whole year. How come you were not affected?
Oh no! Did he get fired?
Yeah but what a random occurrence. There have been plenty of times I've cheated by taking cool pics of weddings.
Oh wow that's a really steep discount if you ask us. Maybe you can find a local Apple store and get one for 399 usd.
Empty bowls are usually a terrible feeling. I hope you find enjoyment in your new bowl of noodles.
I am sorry, you sure are loved and needed
Well I hope it wasnt too hard for both of you! I'm sure she'll be happy to know that you are there for her.
That is awesome, do you love that baby?
Good! I wish I could agree with you more. I have tried, and it's not fun.
I feel the same way in general
i heard a while ago that changing diapers for a living is crazy hard work, and takes a lot of dedication
Athletes always seem to have their own set of rules. Glad you're not his parent.
Some people need to "grow up" I would say! I really don't like the idea of children who watch TV all day or play games all day. They need to "grow up". They have so much development to do on their own when they are young. I'm glad they are learning and feeling responsible for themselves but I wish they would let their kids do what they want whenever they want
thats terrible
The phone conversations can be a timesaving appendage when you don't have a written record. It's well worth retaining the conversations, for they can provide closure and context for your relationship.
I know that feeling well, my sibling is my best friend and I miss him like crazy. Is she able to come over more often?
That's a real testament to your fertility.
Yes, love is love. There's no better feeling than that.
Oh yeah just everywhere you needed it. The ATMs I worked at had WAY too many machines. It was crazy!
You went from being scared and depressed to being positive in one day. I'm glad you're doing great now.
What did they do?
I'm so sorry to hear that. My parents lost mine, so did my siblings, and I lost mine, soaks it all in air every once in a while.
Well that is great. Where do you think your intuition is leading you?
That is wonderful. Leadership is all about trust and having a good time. I am sure you will have blastas and have a blast!
ylee you must be very lucky, how old are you
OMG! Was she like, "What did you study"?
I'm sorry that you feel that way. Maybe you should try to hang out with some of the girls and see how they feel about that.
I'm sorry you have to go through that. Have you thought about trying to get along with people?
It's so great you still have those memories of that time. I wish you a lot of luck in raising them the best that you can.
That is so cute! I had a little girl like that when I was a little. cocoon in a sling. Thats so sad.
Yeah, I have never had the hot dog with ketchup and mayo.
I am sorry, that is awful. Did you talk to the manager?
Ah, so this is where my orphan story ends.
I am sure he will now respect you for it.
That's good to hear. I hope it does and that you guys are able to be together.
Mom always has that last bit of information you need to make a decision responsibiliteseous
that is true, but it is difficult to look back and be ashamed, it is very normal to feel that way
Ha ha! I bet it's not as bad as you imagined. We all make mistakes.
I am so sorry to hear that, it must have been so hard. Friends aren't made in heaven or earth. I hope you find peace of mind.
That's great! I like to think that my own leadership has been inspiring as well! What company do you work for?
I would encourage you to be confident and to take things day at a time. Not to be so hard on yourself.
I try to stay active. Also, create lasting habits that will help you in the future.
Wow, that is crazy, has she moved recently?
I'm sorry it has to be that way.
oh wow, i bet it was an amazing experience, did you enjoy yourself and glad you did that good!
ohh that is a nice name it makes it stand out
How interesting! I bet that was a blast you both enjoyed!
oh, I am glad to hear that, after everything that happened, it would be really hard to romantically approach someone again?
That's so sad. Are you going to be able to keep up with her when you have kids?
I'm not sure I understand how that is possible. You must be very confused.
Oh yes, I have to think of that--even if it's in anger, it's never a good strategy to let that fuel it. Anger is never a good way to advance the cause of any cause
That must've been embarrasing. How did you find the cat?
I'm sure she learned quickly that her grades need to be up.
I have never been! I think it's very small and the rides are not very fun. Did you have a good time?
That's pretty neat but I know how it feels, especially if you don't visit often. I was wondering if there was anything you could do to bring something back to that special memory?
That's wonderful to hear from someone you've only had a very short time with. Did you guys communicate in a normal way or in tongues?
Nice. I hope you can help him find the car he wants!
I do like to organize my house sometimes, it's kinda fun.
Oh boy, I'm worried I'm going to have a baby. My daughter is due in a few months, and my son in law's due in a couple of months. What are you doing to try and get those kids' leases lined up as soon as possible?
I don't respond to those, too busy lol
It would be so easy if everyone was on their phones it would be terrible. Maybe have people write down things like, "Hey, how are you doing today, if you could call someone or try to do something, what would you want to do?"
I'm sorry to hear that. How did it turn out?
You should talk to your boss and let him know what happened.
How did you cope?
That sounds awesome. I bet you had a great time.
Yes, I agree. I guess a lot of people think that they can do it all, or that they are the only one capable of something.
Exactly, I think a lot of people learn from their mistakes and move on.
Were you able to tell him how you felt?
Sort of like when you have to get prepared for a new job or something new comes up... be like, "I guess I will try to be nicer next time"
I guess he wasn't very nice, hu?
That's good to hear, it's crazy how some people will know your name before you even know them!
What are you considering acting on?
I hope you feel better!
Beautiful. It's in the genes.
Yep. They're in their 20s. What are you doing to pass the time?
It's so refreshing to find someone who feels the same way as you! It's a confidence booster!
I'm sure it is! Did you at least make a bunch of copies?
We know what you mean. In times of stress my partner has decided he wants to work more hours and earn more money, and it irritates me.
Oh I *hate* to hear that! My parents *didn't* like me taking in welfare when I was younger. But now that I've made enough to be able to get a job, I feel *glad* that I've made the choice to work. The sacrifices I make *can* *be* made again if *needed*. I'm *relieved* to hear that
Oh, that's unfortunate. What happened?
oh myww. that's cute. are you guys related?
You must be so excited about it. Will you be spending a lot of time in the sun?
That sounds awesome, Miramar is beautiful!
Oh I am sorry to hear that. I hope things go well for you on the bright side is the plan. Just be patient and you will see!
Ugh I would be so upset, can you send her a message?
I hate that he would do that
Well I'm glad you managed to stay okay!
You should. Li is a goldfish. What happened?
Oh no! That's such a horrible feeling. I'm sorry! Hopefully she pulls through and we meet at your place tonight!
why what happened?
Did you confront her about it?
No. I just kind of shrugged it all off.
Oh wow. I bet it was loud!
of course you were. who even knows haha
oh my goodness, that's terrible. i loved him so much.
I love diamonds, very exotic.
you are so thoughtful
That's great! Chicks are so intuitive about reproducing.
Think so! I think so too!
I do not remember.
Well at least you are okay, that is a good thing to know!
I'm glad you're okay! I hope you weren't hurt!
Wow, that's terrible of your friend. I'm sorry
Oh no! What did you do with all the food?
of course i had that happen to me as well. my kids needed lots of things from both me and my husband but when they needed help the response was always the dealership. so when one doesn't work or isn't available we resort to the other!
Did she come out of it? I feel bad for you.
Well I hope at least she's found another job that a lot more guys seem to want, like a maid or someone else takes care of their kids instead
oh my goodness, this is something that can only be described with amazement and astonishment! I truly feel your pain
that is very nice of mom, she has taught you a lot
That sounds awesome! Where are you going?
I always love a beach that is cool and tropical, and the gulf is no exception! I hope you have a great time and are able to find the time to get to your destination.
Oh wow. If she was determined like you I'm sure she will get a good one eventually. Good to hear that she worked hard for it.
That's awesome. It sounds like she's making good decisions as well.
Yeah, I've actually seen that happening a lot. Very annoying.
It's hard to not be around when you're not supposed to be. That's good.
That is so cute. I bet it was scary thinking about it.
That is wonderful to hear
That's so cool, I'm sure you are full of life vibes!
I have done both. I also do taping for some things. Are you a graphic designer?
I could not agree more. I have worked in some of the largest and most prestigious companies in the world and never once have I found people necessary working with me that I trusted or challenged. It's so frustrating and puts EVERYTHING OFF!
It is difficult to stay committed for too long - even if you feel like you know your role and your role only has one type of person - and that type doesn't tend to change easily.
I did the same with Halloween. I loved the speed of the news cycle and the speed of the news cycle meant I loved any time the news cycle was moving in that direction. Such a beautiful moment to grasp and cherish.
Well, I never tire of watching movie reels, and it's always a classic. I'm sure it brought back a lot of good memories for you.
I bet you got everything you wanted! What did you get?
I would have too if I was you. It's amazing how much thought and planning goes into a perfect Christmas dinner.
The worst part was the baby crying. I'm so sorry.
They didn't really comment on my game but they did question the way I play the game. I tried to give them feedback and they would typically give me criticism and negative feedback. It can be hard to differentiate the two though.
Yep. There's nothing worse than throwing away those who love you.
My sister and her husband are so exciting! We hope they have it all figured out, too.
Wow! Congrats again on your friend!
I watched some Netflix. Why is that?
I have never watched any of the dreary German shows. That is very odd.
Oh I've never heard of that one. I'll keep my distance.
wow. it is always good when you are prepared to go to court to prove yourself. i could not ask for anything better than that.
Wow, that's pretty good. It must've been quite an unemployment check.
That's always been a pain for me, getting to work in the worst traffic I've ever seen. How aggravating!
That must have been infuriating. I can see why that made you feel angry.
Well I bet you're calmer as you are now
kids will kids play that same. the older they get, the less they care
That is great. What is her major?
It's hard to keep up. Friends are there for a reason, you will always be able to count on them
That sounds so disgusting! I would have killed to have any leaf on my body!
A hoses or a hose barb? Maybe you should get a new shower head.
That's wonderful! I bet everyone who signs up for that gets a puppy!
What grade did you have?
Your parents are really awesome. They must've been very grateful to you.
That's a good thing. My parents wanted me to have a good childhood because they believe it's in my blood.
I read that once, it sounds like independence is a great thing!
5 years seems like a long time. Do you ever think about getting married?
I wish I could get a decent job doing something else. It used to be much easier because I had a side hustle.
Yeah, those types of things happen, it's just an accident at times.
That's always an important relationship to have, be careful not to overthink it.
It's exciting to hear you're set for a new adventure. Best of luck!
You can't really do anything about it because it's inside of you! You have to love it and give it your all daily to keep it going! You need to love and give your all daily to keep it going!
but they will ignore you
Wow! Did you get on your feet? Where are you staying now?
That's great. You must be very happy about that!
Sounds like she's a ball of energy!
I used to live in Meridian Tenn. When I was young my parents would take us and my brother to Toy R Us. I still love that feeling of excitement and childhood memories being redone.
Oh that's neat. I've never done that. I think the best part of the conversation is when you start to get really personal.
Wow, that is some time traveling. Do you feel nostalgic about it?
oh, i understand
I was a college student in the 90s. I can't believe it's been 40 years! Those were the good old days.
Well I agree that it's probably best if you aren't in one. Maybe finding a new one is a good idea.
Of course! As an adult, I reconnected with my kids through playdates.net and facebook events. I do a lot of face time with them and it makes all the difference to take the time to spend with them now.
Well I wish you all the luck and best of luck with your plans next weekend!
sorry, i believe that you are over exaggerating
That is not a good way to keep it. I think if you say anything it is to them.
oh yea i know how that feels
It's just as bad as you say. Kids under the age of 18 don't understand that! I had a colleague do laundry for me when I was pretty young
Oh, okay. So you guys are really into The Office. How long have you been together?
I still have not had the courage to cut my ties with them. It took me years to realize that they weren't making the right decisions for me.
That is scary, I hate falling asleep to animals
What made you to name your daughter after her?
Do you know the name of the flower?
Ouch, that's tough. You know how that goes, huh? There's only so much you can cary, eh?
Did you in any way compensate them for their assistance?
The way I see it, the universe is just so kind and interesting that it just wants to be with us no matter where we are in the universe.
Yes, I had one. It was amazing.
Every year sounds like a great year! It's a goal we both set to ourselves. But, I'm happy for you! It's rewarding to both of us.
It happens sometimes, I know a family that has had it happen to.
Oh that's a plus. Maybe you can find a lighter you like and keep them around.
I am sure that you passed! Why were you nervous?
I would be proud of you!
Yeah I do actually. What is your favorite
My cat does not like to bang into things. He used to do that with books, but now he just gets up and walks. Is your cat an old fogey?
I bet you are proud.
oh thats nice, good luck
That must have been very hard. I lost my daughter a few years ago and it was very hard.
I understand exactly what you mean. I try to spend time with my family and friends even if I have to travel.
That's really impressive. Think of the opportunities it opens up for!
Wow that sounds like a really smart guy! I would love to meet him because he sounds like a really cool guy!
Oh well that's a good thing. I guess it was a bad thing that she found you in a litter. I'm sure it'll be okay one day.
Who is "she"?
Sounds like a great strategy. Well, I hope it works out well for you guys!
No, mostly music. An escape to be honest. What was the first song you ever heard?
I used to live in a very Bible belt area and we'd get lynched for the same thing.
How sad for you! My cat Cell belonged to my sister so I got to use her trickset tricks when she was little. I still have her and use her tricks set n controls everything in tricks :)
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Did you lose him again?
A little dog die isn't such a big deal. I had a cat die about 5 years ago and since then has been fine.
Yeah, the heat makes you queasy pretty hard.
oh snap!
Well, that's good. It would have been stressful if it wasn't for you.
That's quite an imaginative move! I wish you all the luck in the world.
Absolutely! Thats great! I'm glad I was able to help you.
now what do you mean exactly? are you scared of him?
I don't think he would want to join the military if he doesn't like the lifestyle. I hope you both live a happy life together!
That is crazy! You have to think about all the options in life. Thats what makes it all so hard to think about! :)
that is so cute! i have a dog and a kitty
elf love is unconditional i think we all have our moments of it
If I were you, I'd keep trying. Maybe this time, it works!
Oh, when is the date?
I hope she does, and that you meet her in the future!
My birthday was in August.
Oh yeah...I love getting love from my friends. Why do you say you like it?
huh?
I'm sorry to hear that. How did it make you?
Oh my, what happened?
What acid was it, and what color? I can't remember.
Cold chocolate plus a marshmallow? Yes I do I love that combination
I should get that tonight!
That's a great thing to have going for her. To be able to care for you so well.
Well that's good of you to be able to do that. Sending good memories is the best thing you can do.
The lights didn't go on. The refrigerator didn't open. Finally, the dog ate it.
I under-illiterated. I will know when I am good and when I am terrible when I have to read comprehension on a test.
That's very kind of her!
I do. I miss my mom. Why did she pass?
Thats a bummer, hope she sees youogood lol
I hope she is open to it, I'm sure she is happy for you!
I'm an interior designer. I make pillows, collars, etc. I'm not sure what I would on the average person.
I am trying to get a side hustle. You can get some side hustle done if you want to.
Hopefully you do well this semester. What are you studying?
Oh I see, good luck with that then!
I feel you. I thrash about on the internet trying to find a good movie to watch when I feel like it, I think it's called "Hellboy 2"
Is it related to the Jack In The Box beetle?
I love animated movies. What are your favorite kinds of food?
I just watched the excellent scary movie called "Girl in Black" by András Klug.
I don't think you that much though, I am a very content person in my life.
sound like a sad day right
Wow, that's a lot to take in! So exciting. I wish you the best of luck!
Oh, well that marine engineering sounds interesting! I hope you do well with it!
Well that's a blessing and a curse! On the one hand you have someone who shows true love and on the other you have someone who isn't faithful.
It's nice to hear that a dog has a caring and loving owner. I hope your friend recovers well!
I do I think it is fun sometimes but I don't know for sure. I do like to look at my family tree though.
That's so sweet. Family is so important
Then you have to let that guy know that you're ready tozai
Good luck! I am sure she will come around. Kids grow so fast.
I don't know, I just play video games all day long lol
The wedding planning!
Oh my, I am so sorry. I hope she gets her money back!
I agree! I guess I can't help myself! Sometimes I wish I could be cool like you!
I'm so sorry to hear that! I know how precious those are!
I hope you do, that's a very proud moment.
oh honey, what kind?
I hope so. I think you are very lucky.
That is wonderful! I meet some people in life that we don't know much about. But it is so nice to meet them now and give her all the love and care
I have a brother named Christian who is a wonderful person. I also have a sister named Juana who is a wonderful person too. Do you have a special bond with anyone?
That's wonderful. You're lucky to have such a caring family!
At least they are able to help you out!
Why did you do that?
You are excited about this or??
Well, it's funny you say that. Sometimes people make a trap by means of which they one time lose their belongings.
aha that's a very interesting story.
That's awesome! I went into finance and found a lot of debt to pay. It was painful, but I'm glad you did well.
That should be exciting, I could not be where you are living right now.
I hate when doctors tell you what to do. Do you have a problem?
what did you buy? i did not know pregnant women usually have second opinions
Yeah, I think you need a lot of people to make it work. I'm sorry you're going through that.
Mine is going through that exact process right now. I went to Mexico for a few months, and got to see all of my family! So bored :/
Really? What does that mean?
What is winning a PS4?
Yeah, I know! Kids these days, they can easily have 20 or 30 sugars a day! They really shouldn't even be consuming snacks in the first place if he's going to be putting them in!
That would be stressful I know, but like I said you got this on good terms.
That is so sad, you must be sad and not able to focus on anything else. but you will get over it, i hope.
I in turn, miss them. But I'm sure they'll come around, wouldn't want to wait.
That is hilarious!
Haha! It happens to the best of us. Were you able to get them all dressed home?
well, age is aessingroying
No I haven't. Did you get a raise as a result?
Did she have a casket?
Oh. Gosh I'm sorry for your loss. That's so hard, so sad.
Sounds like you made it happen! Hard work is required to get any job.
I agree. If they are truly talented like Steve, they should be the new Steve.
That is normal, you never really connect with people that way, hopefully after this baby you will have a chance to reconnect.
Yes be happy in all situations. You deserve to be happy.
That's what I do, I do it like 5 different keys to different notes. Awesome!
Yeah, that is pretty sweet. How old is he?
I guess so, it's just something we're not supposed to talk about yet.
That is absolutely wonderful! Models are pretty and desirable I think.
I have not, I would be very surprised. Is he a regular guy?
Nothing really. I'm sure you sound like a very interesting person.
It was a little over a year old
I don't think I know what I am supposed to do when my order is Starbucks but I feel bad for them if it happens more than once!
The most expensive drink is probably vodka.
Oh that's wonderful. What a proud moment!
whats the name of the one that will be next?
That's awful. Did you eat it all?
that is sad, you should visit that place more often
That's a great way to say no. I've had a few in my life.
they are just doing their job better
Yeah she is pretty crazy.
Oh wow... I'm sorry you didn't get your money back.
That sounds terrible. Did you ever get to pick through it?
Oh well that's a good thing then
I do not thik chicken well unless it is cooked very low and I cook cook it for a reason.
I definitely agree that all the ingredients are necessary for good cooking, but I think you should try to keep separate the prepackaged and the fresh ones!
I can see why you were. I still do not know how I would have reacted if you told me during a baby shower that you were doing.
hahah you have some really great boys then
Oh no! Those exams are really tough! Hopefully he didn't study too hard or anything.
I hope it does not happen again.
Did you talk to your teacher?
Amazing! I am glad you are studying! I am studying too for Chemistry.
That must have been so cool. Do you know that player today?
I am glad he is safe and the story of his parents became his story as well.
I would get yourself a generator so that you can at least get by for a little while longer.
hope the next person up gets the same treatment as you.
That is so cute! I bet you are happy and proud.
I had 12 different labour suites!
That sounds scary. I always try to go and hide when that happens.
Wow! He must have been very beautiful.
That's awful. What happened to him?
Oh my, I hope he is in a better place now that you're there. Sending you my way.
Oh, I wish I had son to try out for the teams. He always seemed to break out of the group.
That is great, I am sure he will do well wherever he goes.
Hope you have a loving, healthy baby boy! I am sure you do!
Well, that's great. I hope you have fun and may the best come first.
Wow, that is scary! Were you able to avoid it?
Dang. If I had known you had that much money I might have decided to steal it as well. But I didn't. Maybe when you look back at that he was just trying to help you!
Have you been thanking God for long?
I guess you should tell him that and he'll come around
oh no! how embarrassing!
lenorthew
yeah me too, i love listening to my music
I love Mike Tyson in Mike Tyson Boxing. That's a cool name.
sorry about your high hopes for your dog
That is not good, are you going to get your machine fixed?
It is a great thing to be grateful.
I do that as well
I had the same thing happen a couple years ago. I'm still trying to piece together what happened.
I totally hear you. I love my wife and I and I am eternally grateful for what she did for me.
Wow, that sounds pretty funny!
Did the smack that did good?
oh wow, now she is banging 3 random guys a day lol
Oh I get you. I hate it when other people's marriages are threatened.
Kids can be one of the most underappreciated contributors to a family.
my brother is in his early forties and works in a Nike sweatshop in finneapolis. he also makes a decent salary at 32 he work very hard
Wow you lucky kiddo! That's a lot of time to plan ahead!
oh no! that's terrible. i'm sorry.
Dang! Thats a good question.Shes a really nice person. Why would she do that?
That is very surprising of you.I had an affair happen with a relative of mine and now i dont even think about them
oh no! why did you have to leave?
Oh hahaha I've been there. Gets old quickly.
I'm sorry you missed out on that connection.
That is really a no brainer, you need to be up to date if you are going to be a good student. I am still awaiting grade 12 though I am hoping I will make it that year also.
Yeah it's a pretty common mistake people make when they're younger. Hopefully it paid off and you've since made changes to cut down on those gas bills.
oh my condolences for your dear friend
He sounds like a good Jason Mamoa. The voice is alright.
Im happy for you. Adaptation is the best.
Its good to have a friend in this world. I wish we can get away from this world and be free of having to worry about money.
Oh no! Is your friend upset about it? I'm sorry, but if someone is infidelity in your words, you need to get that person out of your life!
I agree, it is hard to be in a relationship with a person that has those kinds of emotions for more than a short period of time.
Wow, I would be pissed! Have you ever been jolted out of a rage by something that happened at 17?
You'll understand when youare trained.
That is quite an impressive feat! What degree did you complete?
Yes, it sounds like it. Congrats on the graduation!
Aw, I'm glad you're being honest! My kids are always telling me how wonderful it is to be a mom, and I'm grateful for their confidence in me taking care of them.
Thats great! thats what the week is for right?
well done buddy
That's awesome! I'm sure she wholeheartedly misses you and your laugh every now and then!
Oh no! Did you get bitten?
That is cool, I am sure you are talented
i agree! the bad rep really hurt their sales.
Oh wow, I bet you're excited about that. What game is it?
I recently got into FIFA and have been playing it pretty well so far, so good for you!
That's great, Junior Managers are some of the most demanding jobs out there, do you enjoy it?
talent is certainly something to be proud of, wow I am very impressed
That's a great idea! I bet you'll enjoy your new position and it will help you along your career.
Have you ever passed? I can only imagine. If you've ever passed, you probably tried hard and it will come easily.
I don't blame you. It's just got to feel a little weird, I guess.
can you move or see in the dark?
Life is a rollercoaster! I wish I could lie down and just let it go! But I get really nervous and anxious before a crash even has a name! So, I really wish you the best!
That's incredible! I am so happy for you! How is being a first year going?
That's awesome. I am sure you were very proud of yourself.
what? did he say something realllll?
Yes, I dont blame them either ha
That's a good thing. I hope he gets it.
you want to go inside?
That sounds terrifying!
oh yea i can imagine
wow, congrats, are you excited?
That's a long time. I'm so proud of you!
I have actually, once.
That's terrifying! I hope it wasn't too costly to repair!
no i haven't but i would be more scared of them if i did
How did it turn out?
I have wonderfully played but no Everquest honor I know
I only used to play it when I was a teenager.
Yes, I have had there many times. I have always been a fan of their biscuits.
That's too bad, I always try to get shorts at department stores. I like the brand's new sliders, but I'm not a big fan of their new colors.
Yes. It is so terrifying.
That is pretty scary! I went to see it with my daughter a couple years ago and the shadow was terrifying! I swear, I would have passed out if I hadn't gone to get dressed!
I have watched thrill rides but not really been coaster riders.
They really do. Manufacturing places like to make money from you, if you work there long enough.
No I think you know your husband really well. There is nothing wrong with having a relationship as long as you are happy with the person. I hope you find someone
that's horrible, i'm sorry that happened to you
Where are you going?
that's over a� hours away, kz
That's great. When is she getting a new job?
that's a great sign, you should be proud of her
That is so sad. That must be tough.
That is so cute! What kind of puppy was it?
Yep, they're really well mannered dogs. They know when you're trying to be annoying, and lower their guard.
I have dated a few, but I have a thing for dogs. Thats about it I guess.
that is the most amazing feeling i could ask for. you have to be proud of that!
ah you coudnt have been that frustrated! my gut always dies when u see someone eating outside today!!
What did you do after she realized it was your fault?
i know right! how long have you been on this island?
Oh, well that's just the worst sometimes. I feel for you! You have to have a plot and then tell the kids what happened... and then have them do their part to keep the lights on.
well, why did you cancel?
I would be very nervous too. Driving in the winter is not fun.
Wow! I'm glad you made it out safely. There's always a camera somewhere.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. How did it affect you?
That's a wonderful thing to hear. You must have been very young when she left.
Oh no! It's the other way around, right?
Wow! That's a nice distance! I hope next time we go.
That made me feel jealous, how did it go?
I assume you were very surprised. It's always nice when you have a surprise party.
Why did you steal it then?
Ooh, well the cat really liked it, so it seems you got the promotion on film. Congrats!
Did you make any friends?
Video games are so relaxing do you plan to go on vacation anytime soon?
Oh no! That's so sad. I'm sorry I can't help you.
That's a shame. I have a friend who has a college in Baltimore that has a lot of options.
That's very thoughtful of her!
That's a great gift
Wow, that sounds amazing! I would be really scared if I rode it too
mia, you are lucky you are not deaf!
what did do??
Oh that would make me angry too! Well you should tell him that - it is no good if he does not believe you!
oh my god, that's funny. what did you do?
You deserve a raise, raise you do what?
Woo hoo! That is a great feeling!
Good luck!
Oh my! I am sorry to hear that. Did the girl want to go on their dates?
I always like to remind myself to take the long view on things like that.
Wow, that is nasty! You must have screeched and cried!
I know its probably way to late but I think you should try it
That is so sad. What did you do after finding your pet dead?
oh thats sweet
Oh no! Is it a dog or possibly cats?
Yes, that's true! I have never once watched a hazing incident on camera.
I completely understand. It's a very emotional time for many people.
Just be sure to write down what you did that makes up for it.
That sounds really great! I can imagine it was really enjoyable!
Oh, no! Time that you didn't use?
It is. But we do have to face some problems.
I think a lot of people miss out on all the great natural beauty that is available to them because they don't seem to care much about resources used for human consumption.
its a trap everyone makes, thats why its hard to change someone's opinions. you can't trust anyone
No, it is not fair in a healthy way, but it is totally fair in a unhealthy way. Just keep at it and don't even think about the unhealthy way it comes into your life.
tornadoes are definitely terrifying i grew up in texas and we had some as well
Sometimes you just have to "grow up" and realize that things you used to fantasize about don't make any sense to someone you were "able" to provide a basement for. I hope you get that new idea that's "right" for you!
That is so wonderful and worrying about the future is good :)
I remember those days were tough. There was never a time to get back out in the sun.
That's a good way to go about it I think.
That is great! Where did you guys moving to?
Thanks, I'll get on that as soon as I can, the issue of culture shock is very real. I was raised in Europe, so I always had my eye out for an opportunity like that.
What gift did you receive?
An awesome an phone! I bet that was a lot of money!
Yes. What is the reason you're giving it back to you?
Oh! That's such a great thing! I hope you're able to keep the baby during this time! You sound blessed.
Oh wow, that's not good. What has he done?
Oh no, any specific reason that you're scared of driving at night?
That is a bummer. Have you thought about getting one of those portable, flat screen computers?
i know, its the fastest growing way to go about life these days.
I would ask them to stop, but at that point you just hope they will get the message and stop.
Well, you should just abandon the baby and adopt an adult if you don't like them.
yes it's horrible!
It's lovely to have your back. Have you been around them long?
No, we get supervised by my husband and we ride bikes or skateboards in the summer. So, I can barely go to the beach! :( Do you ever ride a bike in the summer? I wish I could get outdoors and do that!
thats awesome that they are learning so fast
That's awesome that you are proud of their progress. I have a daughter who has Asperger's and uses a a a Spelling Bee occasionally.
That's great! It's the attitude of, "Well, at least it was done today!"
I can't even imagine paying so much rent! Congrats in a lump sum!
What was the exam for?
That's great! I have been there. Did you get a promotion?
Oh wow! That's not always the case. I just had a surprise for that, too. Did you know they had other options if you didn't?
yo hopefully you will have another chance at it
now that is a strong word, but i can't imagine him not understanding the word meaning
identical in every way except personality
Oh no, how did it go?
That is happening too. Dad-less are more often than not, and they do not get to make all the calls. They need someone to lean on when they need to lean on
oh that sounds fun
Nice. They really are resilient.
That's sounds great!
uh, what about you? You in town?
I don't have any but I would be mad if I had to deal with them. They should be more ashamed of themselves!
that is so cool, how did that work for you
By meeting a neighbor! Or maybe you and someone you knew crossed paths at a bar? I bet that would give you a little bit of chills!
That is great. Good job.
Crescent
ohh, wow. That's interesting.
Well that's good. You can still have communication with her.
aww that's pretty cool. I'm actually in one now but I want to go to college myself.
I agree. It's a shame that some people can not only find success, but also live successful lives only through degrees.
She's a dog, you know. Maybe your dog hasn't had enough exercise or food in the day or something.
hahaha you probably did it on purpose
Aw, that's a good thing! Makes sure you don't stray far from the right path.
That's something I hope you can carry on forever.
I am sorry to hear that! I have felt that way before.
Yeah, no doubt, poor pupper.
That's wonderful to hear!
Well that's wonderful then! I wish you much success at this new vocation!
I prefer it that way
What happened?
Well happy celebrating with your friends!
yeah that's part of being human. it's part of life and part of learning.
Oh.. $15? That's a pretty significant amount of money.
I love Texas, what did you do there?
My favorite thing there is the dog park with the turtles and bugs.
Wow, congratulations! What a wonderful day for you and your friends! I hope you have a wonderful career ahead to which you all trained and prepared yourself.
I'm glad You'll get another shot at this, good luck!
Oh wow, thats nasty! I've known adults that do that! I would get him to the doctor and get him on vino!
That's too bad. What kind of sugar was it?
aha, that isn't something I ever thought would happen in this part of the world! Sick!
Did you get your money back?
He must like Mexican food!
Ah, well I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been a very expensive mistake.
That is so cool! I think kids these days are always amazed by what other people can do.
Oh, wow. I bet that will help you when you get older. Congratulations on that. That's a very tough area to deal with but worth it in the end.
Oh wow, how interesting. What makes you say that?
That's really good. Is the job being filled by someone else?
You must be a great parent! I am a soccer mom, but I do not play the game.
hahaha, you must have some great teachers, who's the older one?
I'm glad you have that confidence in yourself. Sometimes the best way to get people to laugh is to surprise them!
Ground breaking is a funny thing, I got a few thousand though from Groundhog day.
Do you guys write a lot together, or does she only write for a few employers?
That would be a wonderful idea! I'm sure you are knowledgeable. I'd love to be able to help you with that!
Oh, that's very sweet. How did he do that?
Yeah, I really hope that the IRS does not take advantage of that and that you get on your feet soon after paying your back.
That does sound annoying. Has it barked at you yet, ma'am?
Awww I feel bad for the poor pupper!
Aww, that's a little strange. Could be a man trying to reassure her... or it could be something more.
That's understandable. What's the problem?
That's funny. I've never been a huge basketball fan but I definitely know where this is going.
Oh. She could be studying now if you guys were able to patch things up
I am so sorry to hear that. How did she die?
You are welcome home.
It's always tough waiting, but do yourself a favor and go to Vallino to do it this weekend! You'll have the support of your family and friends along for the ride. You can do it!
That's good to hear. You can only get so big in glass towers.
Oh no! I'm sorry, is she allowed to say that?
That is very exciting for sure
That's great! That means you trust me completely with the safety of your baby. I love when mothers are that confident.
That sounds like a lot of fun! What kind of food do you serve?
Oh, you made a plan?
I know the feeling. Work all day and not get to enjoy any time too much.
God is always faithful, that's amazing I'm happy for you
That is a great outlook to have... although we all have had our bumps in the road!
Ah, that's too bad. What happened?
I'm impressed he trusts you like that.
Aw man, I know how that is for a reason. It's like you were out of the room when he did it, bro. I'm sorry you're sad.
It is a really hard thing to go through. I really hope that you will get a second chance and be successful.
how come?
Yeah, its always nice to get what you've got when you get a promotion.
i used to play with such a young i couldnt even imagine how kids feel
That is so sad, I am sorry for that
Yeah, I have mixed feelings about that.
I completely understand. I have kids of my own and under armor is a big no no.
That's amazing! Was the kitten your cat or did you foster him?
Sounds like a big baby! I'm sure he'll be around forever.
I think it is when my kids are teenagers that it starts to slip away. Just try to keep a cool head and remind them of what not to do when they get into trouble. It's not easy, but it will gradually get better!
but you are right, it is very important to bond with your kids these days and it will be for a long time
That is awesome. I don't know about you, but I have been in a few different tech companies.
that is good. i hope she stays for a long time
Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened to you dog! I took his insurance policy, but it's totally rip to get him another dog
Side effects can be interesting. I had a patient who had one of those and it was terrifying. She was always in a bad dream state, couldn't sleep, and had horrible body memories. It was terrifying!
You shouldnt have. You cant do that to a friend.
sure, you should of also told her, you are the father of her i believe
Oh no! That's terrible. What happened?
I bet! Hopefully you learned that it's okay to have different take on things. It's in your head.
Wow, so far away! I'm jealous! Have fun!
That's no fun! There's nothing to be scared about. We've all been there!
That is very true, and I think everyone can relate to that
That is terrible, I am so sorry
Oh wow, a military type of dog wouldn't be surprised.
That is scary! I would be scared too!
That's too bad. At least she has you to help her through this difficult time.
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that.
Oh happy for you! I'm happy for you too!
wow, thats a long time. you should tell him no10
Oh no! That is such a shame. What did you lose?
That is a good idea. Perhaps she can borrow your sweater for a couple of nights?
Yeah, that's always a weird thing. I'm guessing it was for your work on the game?
Wow, that's awesome. I bet you worked really hard. I also highly recommend your work.
Congratulations. I am very proud of you. Excellent.
That is good. I am glad there is no problem.
of course i know how you feel
Oh yes, and yes it is, but it is by far the easier process. You have more time to prepare
Some don't care if their kid is sick. They will donate nutrients even if you have to feed them.
I wonder what that woman looked like to someone who doesn't look like that. Embarrasses you, but it's also fun.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever thought about setting up a system to have people whisper at you?
That's a tough situation to be in. I hope it all works out for the best.
I am sorry. At what age do you think your daughter will be able to have children?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
Where are you going?
Oh wow! That sounds really exciting!
Roll in the dirt? That's not safe for a bath.
I am so sorry that happened to you!
That is nice of your cat, does he do that a lot?
good times
You must've been really nervous to even do this. Is it what you wanted to do?
That sounds like a real neat and tidy job. You guys must have spent a lot of time preparing.
thats good
Well, that's something. Coyote or human?
I hope you get married!
What a bummer! Sorry to hear that.
I hope you get married!
well that is good, congratulations!
I don't plant gardens. Too busy picking weeds.
I hope you get married!
what did you do?
what did they give you? tell me...did you get a refund?
I hope so too, hopefully this is the beginning of a better city for you.
I can understand that. What happened?
I can relate I have two sisters and a brother and it makes me uneasy as well. I don't like feeling as though I'm the only being in the world.
is your dad a police officer?
What was the association's last meeting about?
Do you have a lot of unanswered phone calls?
Oh, no. I thought you said no one was close to you.
you need to look for a restaurant that specialis in your town
Fingers crossed! Applause when you win!
That's pretty nice. Do you have a lawn?
I hope you have a great retirement ahead!
He must be very excited to do that.
Did you catch up on your life at home?
I'm sure you are both relieved.
That's great! How is your sister now?
I am so sorry to hear that!
I am glad to hear that.
aww that is so great. I had never even realized we even had a gender anymore!
Wellfa like i, you are lucky.
awww, what a weird relationship. Maybe its time to find a new wife.
You have a great mom! I'm sure you have learned a lot about each other as you've gotten older!
ohh don't worry, there's plenty of other people out there who would love a new truck!
That's a great attitude. I wish you the best of luck.
Happy Birthday! It's always good to see those emotions in someone.
It's OK to face difficulties in life. We all have them.
Thats awesome of you, have you taught her how to use a machine?
That's how I like it though, to relax.
That's so awesome. I've been searching for a tree in my backyard and I just think God doesn't exist. There's so much weirdness in the universe.
That's great! I always try to do that when I feel like I'm going to lose everything.
oh wow i am also a singer, i can also dance
Wow, you really shouldn't be ashamed of your age, that would be a waste of time and energy
Well, you have to love your husband in this situation. You don't even have to like him.
A little precaution is all you need, I hope nothing bad happens!
Are you nervous about whether or not you get the job?
Is there any way to get a good tech support job?
I guess the most important thing is that you both get enough sleep.
I understand that
ohh true, but as long as you keep to the spirit it should not be a problem, are you happy about it?
You may want to put straw in the toilet bowl.
I love chocolate, what kind of chocolate bar was it?
oh i know what you mean
Oh, wow. It's great to hear that things are moving in his favor. Good for you, husband!
i hope he finds something that will make him feel loved
OMG. I bet that was so frustrating.
That's good! What color is the car?
oh no that's horrible! are you thinking about trying to find it?
oh yea i can understand that
hachi means "great" in hirinese
That's so cool! Is this their first child?
Was she very excited to see you?
I hope it gets better for you.
I'm sorry, are you alone?
That's absurd! They should be the one to fix it not you.
)
I am glad you won't have to say anything again.
That sounds lonely. Did you do anything to relieve the stress?
I'm sorry you don't have a girlfriend, you should look one soon!
Internal growth, that sounds right. Are you going to be a better person then?
I'm sure it was a difficult process for you but it paid off!
That is true. You have to make the best of the situation.
Thats what we do. Enjoy our moments and remember all the good times.
I am so sorry to hear that.It is so hard to lose loved ones that have such a part in your life.
That's what family is for when you can't be with them
Sorry to hear that. Why are you getting cold feet?
Oh no! I'm sorry. I was worried that you wouldn't be able to resist the taste of Nutella.
Awww, I love learning things today. I always have to go back and learn things for myself. How sweet.
That's so sweet. It's great that you devote time to your family.
i can understand that
social out
I can understand your befrugalty, but I hope that you will have the patience to wait for her return with you.
Yes, she said she wanted to do this for a long time. I hope it goes well and you have a great time on the date!
That's great! Where are you going?
Oh, that sounds amazing! How's Mother Nature?
oh damn.. i would have been extremely mad also, if they didnt have a problem with you guys meeting up at the last minute.  i would go ahead and get a catering company also if i ever meet with one
She must really like you because after the party was over, she would give me a big hug and said "that was very nice of you".
The past is a funny thing. Did you enjoy it?
delivery girl is the worst, but delivery boy sounds worse still.
It was great. I had a great run this past week. Found a new hobby?
I'm named Alexa. I love talking to her.
It was good. How long were you asleep for?
happy birthday! you must be excited to share this wonderful experience with your son
Wow. I wonder how the college would react to that
I hate when that happens, even if it is a good meme. Some people are so into the sounds and visuals of a live concert that it can be overwhelming to maintain a clean and organized space.
That's good to hear. Did you get the job?
So far so good. I'm sure they will knock off at least one more before the summer is over.
Oh, that sounds lonely. How did it go?
At least you seem to have figured out a way to get around it. I'm sure it'll work out for you one day!
How long did she have to fly for? Did you get a refund?
Do you have a job hunting friend?
Nah, those are kinda sad. How did the other guy fare?
Ah, so theres no problem then! I never argue with people, I just let it go
oh no! I hope your nerves were relaxed and you were waving at the people on the boat!
Yeah, I'm sure he didn't even notice! At least the cat felt bad about it, right?
That's cool, what did you do?
I can imagine. When I got hit, I thought I would never walk again. I was wrong.
That does sound stressful. Did you have a good time?
were they able to calm them down?
oh yea im guessing u had a good time?
I am sure the interviewer is going for your soul with those eyes. You will fit right in!
oh no! sorry about that. did you apologize to the person?
Did you call him out on it?
Yes. they don't take breaks as much. Accidents happen all the time
That's unfair, what orders do you have coming up?
how long did it take you to get in?
I am sorry to hear that, is there any chance of a cure in the works?
I bet it was a great time when you were a kid.
i have never been out in the sun i stay indoors
How much does it cost you?
yea all the hard work they put in, it's almost always forgotten about
That's very true. It sounds like you have good people around you.
That's a good thing! I hate insurance companies who skulk on us. We actually helped start the Alaska Airlines Healthy Lifestyle campaign back in the day.
that isnt good, are you going to explain this to them?
It can happen sometimes to the unexpected. Just wait and it will come in stride
I definitely would, thank you for what you do.
I am sure he did a good job.
That would be a major sacrifice! But it is so rewarding to watch babies grow up, you should do the right thing and give him a loving home while you go back.
That's a good idea! He will learn eventually.
I completely agree
I agree. In those instances, it is best to speak to a police officer.
that is horrible, how did he get lost?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. That is such a shame.
Wonderful! How long has it been since you've seen her? That is a very exciting time.
That is good that you are happy for her though. She is 6 months? You got this.
oh thats good
Well, you've got to be careful, she could just get a different doctor and you'd be out of luck.
Yea. She is very lucky to have a friend like you.
That's amazing. Nursing is a tough trade.
that is so sad
What made you think life could be worse?
Oh no! I hope it didn't spell disaster for ya
That's great! I'm glad it was just a trifle!
Oh yeah? Did they die a horrible death?
Oh, I didn't know she was that good! I'm glad you got to see her this year.
I have had those feelings as well. The freedom to do what you want and the money to do what you love. I think we are all missing out on those moments if we are content to just stay at home.
That's true. Mine was sunnier then too. mine was a 20's car with tinted windows
Oh no that's terrible. Did you catch them?
Oh, I am so sorry to hear that! Your apartment is probably a lot better now!
Wow, that's brutal! Were you out at the time?
ohh, that's bit scary. I hope it all turns out for good.
Oh no! That stinks. I am so sorry. Were you able to get it after all?
Well that's good. Sometimes you have to "grow up" and learn!
Oh no! Were you able to free them? That can be embarrassing!
Oh no! That's the worst, crying in class can get really bad.
oh my gosh, is your nose so bad that it makes your cat itch?
Must be some really disgusting things she does. I dont think people should be shamed for who they are.
that's wonderful! so nice to hear
That sounds like a lot of fun! When are you going?
Oh no! Did you have to call a cleaning service
I am sorry you have to deal with that!
Awesome. What was the prize?
Oh wow, you must be pretty good at the game. Why did you get the part?
That is interesting. What does he normally talk about?
That is my biggest pet peeve! I am not a very nice person after all!
You must be my roommate, lol. I'm guessing you don't live with me anymore?
Was it a high hopes thing or did you lower your expectations?
Oh no! Are you hurt?
it's good to find people who like you. you're lucky to have that
thats nice to hear, is she busy?
Wow that's so sad. I'm glad you had such a good time.
Ooo, that is so funny! I guess it was not unusual then
hahaha I bet she was scared
That's unfortunate. Is it something that you would ever want to talk about?
That's great that you have such a great group of people around you!
That would be a very interesting situation to be in, and I'm sure you'll be able to work it out with her. If you don't want to risk it, you can also tell her the keys to the house are with you, and that you won't go back and ask her.
Aw, that's too bad. What do they match up too well?
You could be any rich person out there
Yeah, you are so vigilant. You should try that when her back is turned.
Yea thathess getting on so fastirish,ust be unfair to the many that have worked so hard to get here.
I'm sorry to hear that. How are you holding up?
Mine sites can be scary, mine lining sites are even scarier. We bought our house there!
Just cherish on time for your teacher and everything will be fine!
That is good. If they are being helpful to you, then you should be loyal to them.
I do hope that things will get better for you.
that's great you have that good friend
It is always nice to have someone in your life that you can count on. I hope you are better now!
That is impressive! How far away was he from you?
Good for you. Are you doing well in life now?
That is so nice of you, I'm proud of your ability to parent.
Yeah, that's good to hear. Sometimes it's hard to judge other people when you're in the same situation as them.
That is so sweet! I hope he is doing well!
I am sure he will turn out to be a wonderful dad.
That doesn't sound fun! Did you guys get in contact with the police? I've never had to deal with a crazy animal!!!
That's good, it sounds like the smaller one is just really sweet.
Has your dog trained to do that?
Right on! I had a friend that got her puppy a couple of days ago. It's a rescue, but she was so sweet and sweet and sweet!
Oh, that's awful. That's heartbreaking. Are you going to get him fixed?
Oh, I see. Well he's feeling better and hopefully toasting you for it.
I certainly haven't in a long time. There's always been something up in the air.
I'm glad you love the little things! I know we can't control everything but trying could make a world of difference!
oh that's good, finally some good news after such a long wait!
That's exciting! A little anxiety is always good, but I'm positive you'll turn 25 this year! Best of luck!
I have. It must be very stressful.
I'm so sorry! I know how you feel!
Not really, they are pretty annoying though
I played that game when I was a child. It was okay.
That's very nice of you. What kind of pets do you have?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better soon.
That's great! I'm sure you passed both times. Why did you fail?
Exactly, and you will end up with a great score.
No way! I would have screamed! I don't understand how people love going to restaurants
Well they obviously do. You should definitely make their job easier by making them call you when something like that happens.
Not that I'm aware of. I watch but I don't do much else.
She's very fun! How old is she?
Wow! That's a pretty bad predicament to be in! Were you able to walk out of the shower without putting on your pants, or were you still late?
did you tell them you gave them a beating?
i bet you were very annoyed about that.
i agree. it's a shame that people can't be replaced quickly.
Aww, congrats? What kind of puppy was it?
I also cherish those moments, the joy of introducing a new member to a really great family.
I know how you feel. I love memories like that.
That is true for me. My kids were a bit younger.
That must have made you feel so proud.
oh that's interesting, what did you do?
Oh no! How old is he?
Im so sorry, yes that is breaking. I wish you all the best with your divison!
Nice, I love vacation time! I hope you had a lot of fun.
Wow that's awesome. You guys will always have those memories of you and each other.
I was 22. My parents drove almost every weekend.
Yes, it was so exciting. It is such a happy memory.
That sucks, where are you going?
that sucks, well you can always have a late night together and be happy
That's awesome! What makes you excited?
That's pretty awesome! what does he want to do ®
Nice! He must be feeling better than normal. He always seems to overthink things and doesn't know what to do next. I'm sure he's been having a lot of fun trying to figure things out right now.
No, I don't. But I wish I did. Do you?
Did you find anything interesting?
Old Beanie Babies are so nostalgic. You're reminiscing back to childhood!
ah must be a good child then hah
That's unfortunate we do that stuff to kids but it's good she wants more. Hopefully the money can be seen as a reward for her.
Oh no! We all have had those moments! Is the baby okay?
I hope you got a good look at it before you left. You could tell it was OK.
That's great to hear! I know how important food is to her.
That is awful I am so sorry!
That's horrible, was the cat friendly?
That's so good to hear! Cats are some of the most compassionate creatures. I hope the trust grew into something great!
oh man, how terrifying that must have felt. i can imagine how you must have felt!
That is really scary! I am so sorry you had to go through that.
Oh that is good! I am glad it worked out well instead of a disaster!
yes exactly, put the blame on yourself
Oh, wow! She's pretty young for adragon. That makes sense, but I guess all you can do is try to help her along
Oh, wow. That's someones vacation. I'm sure it's a lot of fun.
Yeah, put off on payments can become a burden.
Ah nice. Is this the first for your family?
You got this guy. He's going to start making money right out of prison.
how is that for you? what are you eating?
I just got an iPhone and I already trying to read on the go. It's so convenient.
Yes I think I would have went with his mother and his father and his aunt and his cousins and his nieces and his nephews and his uncles and his aunts and his cousins and his uncles and his aunts and his cousins and his cousins and his cousins and his nieces and his nephews and his nieces and his nieces and his nephews and
True, he's clearly a Silencer. But at least they have a bright future ahead of them if they continue to train and get good at hitting their gaps in the schedule
That's awesome. How old were you and what was the cake?
Do you live with your mom anymore?
That's a big accomplishment! What made you want to study?
Congrats! Good luck this upcoming summer vacation!
Wow that is great! That is achieved over a diet, so you must have a lot of healthy stuff to lose that weight.
Those are two things I've heard are hard to have in life. I hope you get them in life sooner than later!
Oh. I was raised mostly beer. I don't like it because it is too sweet.
2% is pretty good I believe. I also used heavy cream in place of butter.
I am happy for you
I am so glad! I am sure pizza is a great food and you deserve to be.
There's always the next adventure. But, I'm anxious to get back to earth.
Thank goodness it wasn't more serious, I hope it wasn't too bad.
oh no, that's bad. how long has it been since you last spoke to him?
I hope it works out for him and you
Oh that's annoying! Did you make it out of it without any regrets?
See, it's such a beautiful thing when we can separate the wheat from the chaff and realize that the difference is very real. Makes dealing with people much easier!
Oh, that's so nice of him!
Oh. Does he still cheat?
Oh no! That is terrible! Did you break up with her?
Oh god. I was about to say the same thing. I guess all you can do is just hit them a few times and hope they don't land another blow. But better safe than sorry!
Did you enjoy it at least?
Wow, I think that story is true. Wow! I am truly a sorry person.
Oh i bet! It must have been so scary and exciting!
Oh yeah I can imagineans. That is to good to hear! I hope there was no surprises missed!
What happened to you?
I'm glad you survived and am glad your future looks bright.
I can't imagine what you must have felt like thinking that thinking. It's very hard to lose a pet.
i hope you have memories of her
I do not like to sit in the front with my wife. It gets uncomfortable.
OK, now I understand. You probably wanted her not because you were desperate, but because she wanted you. I hope you find someone more deserving of your love!
Dang, that's quite generous of you! There's a whole world of difference between being able to do that and them taking advantage of you. I'm sure that your son will appreciate that!
Absolutely! I'm glad you feel you weren't let down! I'm always happy to help as much or even more.
Are you going to stay at the shelter?
I had a rescue dog called "Tootsie Rolls" when she was young. I miss those soft, cuddly snouts.
Why is that?
I am sure you will be able to enjoy your little friend very soon!
good vibes keep flowing in the good ole United States
I guess diet and water are not bad together!
oh wow! i was so excited for you. was it your first time flying all the way?
Yikes! I would be too. I would have said so right then and there. I am sorry you are going through that.
Yeah! Are you a NES gamer?
Those games were definitely played when I was a child.
I bet that was scary
WOW! That must have been scary for you! Can you feel your ghost?
Wow that's great. I really wish my daughter would be talented like your son. How old is she?
Even if you don't put in as much time as she suggests, you can still make a difference.
It means you are ready to go. That means you are awake and thinking ahead.
Yeah, have you tried talking to your boss?
Oh, that's so sad! Was the kitten okay?
Thank goodness she is yours again. How long did it last?
That is an amazing accomplishment!
Did your friend get a little jealous and left you?
Oh wow, that sounds scary! Have you actually gone to see it? I always fear going to see tornadoes, even watching youtube.
I'm so glad it didn't affect you too much.
that's awesome, congratulations to him, how long have you guys been together?
Do you know what the ring symbolises?
What kinda car?
Those are great cars, always looks great in the road.
Oh okay. That makes sense. I like kids but I'm not ready for the baby. Maybe you should try and MOVE the baby to a different room.
I'm sorry! I'm sure if you stayed with it a little longer it could be just a matter of time before you gave up.
Oh okay, sorry to help him out, but I've never even heard of an A before either. Where did they get their information from, and how hard would it have been to check to see if they were shipping to your area?
That does sound horrible. It's just the taxman coming after you. You should definitely expedite the situation
Oh, that is not cheap! But surely it is good value?
Just talk to someone that you trust, you know?
Do you think you will enjoy it?
I'm saving up for my own apartment now!
So, were you promised your own place?
Oh I'm sorry, did you guys have a fight?
MUCH BETTER! She is a lucky lady! I am sure you will both come around to liking it again.
Did you later find out that she had an affair on yours brother
Your babygirl will be great. be careful.
Are you excited about it?
That's unfortunate. What did you do?
Sounds like a stressful day. Did you find another job?
That would be nice.
Do you like to socialize with your friends?
Oh yes, so you feel bad for her? Yes, you are a good boyfriend and will do whatever is necessary to support your wife.
Smart move by you.
I am sure you will be able to do that
That's good to help yourself along
You need to be more careful next time.
Was it? If so, good
I bet. I would be the same way. I didn't get into college so can't vote.
I smell a rat.
Oh, I have met a few like that. But, they usually live on the street for a while.
Friends come and go in life, what really matters is that you develop good ones.
Probably would. That's a terrible thing to do.
I know what you mean. Dad's can be like that, it's so hard to lose them.
I'm really happy for you.
That is great. Does she dabble in any other art?
Everyone wins when two people are able to work together successfully.
ummm yeah that can be hard to swallow. What did you do?
That's okay, you will find someone who will be worth marrying.
That's a good thing. Where do you go?
I get that, I guess that makes sense.
Why? Have you been together long?
Wait a minute. Did you?
oh no! i'm so sorry
Oh then go out and have fun!
Oh that's awesome! I wonder how you would have reacted if he hit you?
haha thats good you survived at least.
What about 1?
It happens I suppose, but there's many, many other places where it shouldn't be. Hopefully you'll remember your mistake soon and will be less nervous about it.
I hope you do well! If you're nervous, don't worry. I've hveds do well legally too.
Was it a fighting game?
That is no good. How did she get into that situation?
It really does, especially when they try to blame you for it.
ooh no! Are you alright?
Oh, I see. Well, at least you survived.
sweet! i bet you are thrilled about that
That sounds like so much fun!
Burritos are nastier than tacos. I had one as a kid and it was just the head.
That's terrible, but unfortunately people have to work in something like that. It's not easy losing a pet, either.
It was great. How did you enjoy it?
Good for you. I hope it be another good day for you.
I'm not sure I've ever been in a completely dry climate. It's always a mix of rain and snow.
Whoa. Did you actually see them? Or were they counting on you?
I have had that happen to me before, but it was just the breeze.
ok tell me why
I am glad you have a pet to keep in touch with!
That's wonderful! Your nerves are very healthy. Just don't stress about it.
Good luck, and thanks for the great job!
I love the sloth! I am so jealous! I hope you have a great time!
Wow that sounds very exotic.
That is really disgusting of them. I hope they get the help they need.
If you think I should then you should. I don't know who did it but I hope you catch them.
thats a good summary i hope it stays that way
That's a good thing.
I know what you mean. It's crazy how much everything now costs.
It's a good thing! My daughters age really is getting to me. I barely keep anything to cover them in theirs :)
What tv do you have?
Do you win often?
thats cool
Well that's wonderful! You must be so proud of yourself.
I am sure you are. You can save a lot of money if you do.
Wow, that is an awesome car! Ive had one before myself as well! Price is insane!
That's wonderful. I bet she is happy you are enjoying your new life together.
i love the watch, i have it, and i upgraded to the quartz version, i wanted that too
That takes a lot of effort! I graduated college in 2008, I never had to put in a day in college.
I am sure you will find one and if you do you will thank God that He has one. Just keep working and I will pray for you
Oh, I am the same, final grade I get isnt that important, all that matters is you deliver
are you hoping to do well on that course?
Oh no! What did you do?
Well, that's too bad. Maybe this friendship will last a lifetime.
I'm sorry to hear that. It's hard to watch kids grow up without me being able to.
That's so sad. Do you miss her?
oh thats disgusting
I wouldn't go back either. There's a lot of those types of restaurants all around.
Yeah I visited when I was a child as well
I am not actually related to my grandparents. My family is mostly made up of my great grandmother, and my great grandmother's great grand parents. Are you related to your grandparents?
Thats awesome, looking to keep them in the loop?
Those were the good old days!
oh well it must be lonely for you as well
Yeah, did you check on the dog after?
I hate doctors, they're always either very drunk or very hungry. What did they do?
i understand. i hope that all goes well for you
That's so awesome! I wish some one took the time to do a thing like that.
I have. It was called "The 3rd grade" and it was called a cruise.
I could never afford to go, I grew up in a very close family and was very close to our families. I felt you.
What did she do?
Docs are sometimes hit or miss. Is this once you've had them do it 3 or 4 times?
i would just make sure that there is no drama between us and only talk to him as a friend
I really hope he has learned that no one is trying to sit on your lap!
Great, are you sure you are prepared?
That's great that you're studying. I hope that you'll do well.
That is wonderful. Do you have a favorite restaurant to eat at?
Im not a good at diving. I could sure kill it at a pool.
Wow! What a surprise! I bet you wanted something more and forever gift!
Thats sweet though, hope he doesnt take too long :)
I know right? It was a present from a dear friend when I was a baby.
Kay Jewelers? I've never heard of them...but those sure are expensive pairs of diamonds.
that is too bad, what did you end up drinking?
That sounds scary! I'm glad you are okay...but I really hope you don't have to go through that again!
Oh man! I hope it goes well! Have you confronted him about it yet?
I agree. I don't know enough about dog poo to say I'm comfortable.
I am not even close to my sister. I know that I have many good brothers but I try to not to let mine know how I feel.
Depends what your job is. I think you should tell them but only if they meet your standard.
ohh, that's good to hear!
That's great to hear. I hope you had a good day.
That's so sad. I'm sorry.
im sure it was not! you should take steps to reduce your chances of repeating the mistake!
That's great! Your company should really appreciate your loyalty.
Hey that's a moneymaker!
That's awesome! Old memories, hu?
I wish you the best of luck with your payments.
Oh that's awful, did you call out to anyone, like?
Can you spoil any future games you're planning?
Sounds like you have a very good relationship with the earth!
i agree completely
Sounds like a plan. What are you planning?
That sounds so fun! I bet you're having a blast planning it
Truth be told, I'm still friends with someone who was burned by a camp stalker. They were probably disappointed in you, and now both of you have stories to tell. I'm sure you'll both will be more careful in the future.
That's his right as a citizen of the United States! he can do with it wht he want!
Yeah, I would have said the same thing. If your boyfriend is bad you should just say so without hesitation.
that is a weird day haha
I'm sorry that happened. That's no fun at all. Hopefully you learned a lesson from this?
that is disgusting! i hate that happening
I can't imagine how bad that is going to be! I hope you're able to manage it though!
Oh wow, that's amazing. Maybe you could watch it while you wait for something in particular?
You can try watching some TV shows or browsing the Netflix. Both of which I find guilt free.
That is not a good idea. I am bad with food and probably wouldn't understand.
Okay great! I would say the same thing to you.
That is great, where did you all go?
I hope you feel better the next time you see each other!
That's great! How are you doing?
He should be ashamed of himself.
That's a good thing. At least we have some money to spend.
yes all the best
always good to have friends
oh i here it coming 🤔 sorry about that haha
That sounds scary, were you and your family okay?
I'm glad you were able to make it out alive. You'd be hard pressed to find another car or dog to pit against you.
I am so sorry to hear that, I have a friend who has this disease too
I don't know if I could do that. My girlfriend says it is safe though.
oh my goodness, that must be very difficult. i'm sorry.
i am soo sorry to hear that!
That's bad but seems to be localized to baking soda. Not a lot you can do really, until it gets deeper in the ground.
Oh no! Did you clean it up? The puddle is ole Chippendale.
That is terrible. How did she do?
That's unfortunate. Are you guys still friends?
That is very rash. I would get on that alarm and make sure my credit card is ready.
It's become so normal for people to do that nowadays, that it's kind of annoying. Even I have learned to call people names when they violate my space!
Yeah, I don't think they're subtle. I think they're loud and obnoxious.
Yes and I'm sure you would be more than happy to move if you could.
Older people don't afford very much for orthopedic care, do they?
That's great news. I wish you a speedy recovery.
I had a fall 3 years ago. It wasn't my fault, just happenstance. It's different now though.
I would bring a friend or relative over for pizza and cuddle up with my baby. They are worth every second of suffering.
i know. it's so hot and humid here. it would be cool to see them move around a bit.
That's a positive attitude! I would love nothing more than to be able to mow my own lawn!
I'm sorry; I'm not sure how to respond. Have you tried talking to a teacher?
choosing the wrong career could kill you right away
I am not a fan of remakes either.
Is that an adaptation of a true story?
For example in the movie 13th it was a 13 year old who was framed for the murder of his college roommate.
with all the advances that people are making with their life I would say kids can be just as smart as adults.
That's great. What kind of job did you get?
Oh, I have never tried that! I will have to try it out!
That does sound like a nice change of pace. I'm glad you have found one that good.
That's always a good thing. I hope your boss rewarded you for working hard.
I am glad you are happy!
Wow! How kind!
Ouch, I always do that. Does anyone know where you are going?
Haha! That's a wisest move. You'll be more afraid of the consequences, I think.
That's disgusting, why would you ever want to do that??
Me either, I don't like people getting upset over nothing.
Wow that's amazing, congrats on the good news. So you must have done well in the interview then?
Well that would be nice if your boss was telling you what to do!
I have been on the job hunt for about a week. I have three days.
I believe in myself and my abilities! I have done great things in my life and would never change it!
100 Dollars sounds like a lot, did you have to pay anything else?
I wish you luck. I bet your husband bought a nice car if you know what I mean.
Oh that's great! What made you so confident
Oh wow! I thought there was a limit to the amount you could buy, but maybe you could put off paying it in full until the following weekend?
That's cool! It's nice to be appreciated!
Aw! You'll make him get one!
That's funny. I kind of did the same thing with my mom when I made her lunches one time. Her reaction was, of course, disbelief.
Haha. Well as long as he's hungry enough, that's what he'll be getting.
Yeah, it's a cruel game to play. You never know when they'll cancel and then you'll have to play that again.
oh man that is a bad feeling
What are some things you could have changed tomorrow?
You're such a naughty girl!
what did she do?
was she expecting a stranger?
you must have been well prepared for it!
I certainly understand the concerns people have about the Boy Scouts of America. I would be more worried about global warming. The BSA has a long history of supporting renewable energy and combating climate change. I would send them a letter of concern if I were you.
aww, are you really sorry for breaking up with him?
I used to be that way too. There was no real social environment for me. Now, I meet a lot of cool people!
Oh awesome! what will you be getting?
LOL. That's funny.
wow i am happy for you
I want to be a dad one day. I wish i had children like you.
I hate having to deal with fines. What do you do if it's a high amount?
Well it seems like that's actually been a great decision on your part!
Oh Disney Fashion Police! I bet you are excited, and anxious for the new years resolutions.
That's great. I wish I had a basement so I could do something like that.
What might have been causing your troubles?
That sounds horrible! Are you going to sue?
I'm sorry you feel that way.
That's terrible, hopefully the admissions committee at your school has an affective way of handling that
Wow, i wish i could be like that
Well I'm glad it makes sense and not make you angry anymore. I am sure you will be happy when you get to the next position and your pay will go up!
Yeah, that's a tough situation. I do hope it gets better, though.
Wow, that's pretty soon. You must be so proud of him!
I hope the results back are good!
That's a pretty long time. I'm sorry you don't have one.
That's awesome! Good for you, I'm sure you will do better next time!
quit complaining and concentrate on getting what you want!
Was it a nice restaurant?
Oh wow! That would be quite interesting.
You should reevaluate what you value and what you don't and be open to possibility. Once you are that young you will see many more possibilities
What ended up happening?
wow i hope it works for you!
Yosh, I usually eat something different everyday too.
You must be a tough cookie! I'm sure you'll do great!
Oh really. I just ate small portion of rice, I think. I think I might be hungrier than usual today!
that is scary to hear, i hope they have fixed everything
Are you still living with her?
I understand! Dont you dare leave him out in the rain! May as well call an ambulance if it gets dark!
That's too bad. I bet you were really worried.
Oh, I'm sure she missed you. Do you have a place to stay for a while?
That sounds great! What was it about?
I see, what you should do is look for work online.
I understand that, that is how I made a decent wage before the internet
awww. don't be anxious. you will be fine
I have no idea where you'd find one. I'm kind of broke myself.
That is a great way to be a parent. Being so organized is so helpful.
Yes its rough but I hope one day you can enjoy having a boy in your life.
Height is not the only important thing in a relationship.Weight is not the only important thing in a relationship.
What happened if I may?
I agree, we all have our faults. Sorry you felt that way.
oh that's ok? i completely understand
Oh tricycles are cool. Did she enjoy owning them?
Oh no! Are you going to have your portrait taken of her in a few days?
That's awesome. 50 metres is very tough.
That is great! Is there any way you can improve your scores?
Yeah it's always a nice treat. I used to get sick when I played themeto my grandma. What platformer was your favorite?
Oh ok! I thought it might be a problem with the game. Hopefully it isn't for anything game related.
Yeah I would be too. What happened?
I don't know what you have in mind. I definitely don't want to go in them!
Awesome! What kind of car?
they make good trucks. there is a lot of money in them
that is a really good movie! how old is she? do you think that she will like it?
Oh wow! I bet you guys were having fun! Did she prom in it?
Well that really stinks. Did you try to look for a cure for it?
It's tough, but I think we all feel that way when comparing ourselves to others.
eww that is gross
oh wow.. you should write a positive review about it
oh really hope it be a good one
it is an awesome looking bike, love the color
Nice home you have so you can enjoy the fruits of your labor. Mine just bought a boat and headed for the Gulf Coast.
oh i hear that, i had some of those before too, its great to hear that it will be done
That's true. You should try to make more space in your life for her.
Will you be able to spend it at a store or at home?
That's awful. I'm sorry to hear that. Is your cat being watched?
I know that feels horrible, but it will be a child from your womb! HooH
Oh no! What a bummer! Stay positive and try to get something else lined up!
I am sorry to hear that. You may resume most jobs now, but you may never get a promotion. Know that you are good at what you do and they will come around.
oh cool, I love looking at old photos
Oh you must have been so happy that day!
What was the wonderul?
That sounds like a really fun weekend!
That can be scary, what part of town?
All the best! :)
I see. I think that if you stole money it is most probably to buy the food, not that you did it on purpose. Why did you need the food then?
17 years!! That has to be a really tough age for him. I have to deal with my mom who is 93 and has had some issues in the past, it is tough!
ohh, that's not good! what was the test for?
None of us know how to "do it" until we are supposed to. A lot of people get injured because they don't
Oh my goodness, that sounds horrifying! What did you do?
That sounds terrifying! I'm glad you managed to getaway!
Were they nostalgic?
I still do not have any, one day i want to
That's a nice thing to think about! How did you get the new job?
good luck with that
oh yea same show thoce
Oh. I have never seen it. I know it has some really terrible songs.
was it nice?
I'd love to go on a beautiful ocean voyage, maybe I'll get the chance someday!
did you atleast study enough to pass?
Im sorry
Oh, how exciting. Are you planning on having fun?
Yeah, sometimes life just seems to want to drag out, and it's hard to concentrate on something if you're tired.  I think you guys should try and think of an opportunity to try and get out there, rather than rescheduling your birthday!
Oh I'm so sorry! I love my dog! It's so sad when that happens.
Aww, did you run away or let her kill your dog?
What happened to him?
I am so sorry to hear that. THe outlook after is hard.
i love the beach, how was it?
is there anywhere in particular you like to go?
I love history and fine actors like that make it stand out from the crowd. I was always happy when I heard the score for that show.
Lin is a wonderful story teller, and Lin is a wonderful person!
Oh, how was it?
I am glad you had that joy.
Oh no, I hate that! What did you do?
Was it a bear?
That's wonderful. Do you love her?
That's a great attitude. There's a lot of people who think that.
About what? My girlfriend's parents?s?
I'm happy that it turned out well instead of fizzle out.
Oh no! Did you call the police?
I bet you made it out ok.
I can barely even talk. Do you ever worry that you'll be unable to speak?
Dont feel bad, its an easy process. You just have to know the correct way to do it.
onto some puzzles they werent so good at, so i figure if theyre easy they might as well get the job done
Wow, it must have been quite a pain to go through with all that maintenance.
Dead mice are nasty. Did you put them in your food to make them sick?
Eww, I am sorry for your loss.
Why don't you wake up and do something about it?
7
oh, that's good and bad.
That's great, I'm glad she was nice with you guys!
Oh no! What happened?
Aw I'm sorry, but you have to step back and let them figure it out for you. I know it's hard
Don't kill it. Don't try to. It's a cute name though.
Oh no! I hate when friends do that! Did he sit on the chair next to you?
All right, that's a lot of bills because you probably never take time for them. Do you have any special tools or computer labs you can use to help you out?
That's a really great attitude. It seems like you know what you're getting into when you go in to interview. I'm sure it'll be fine.
Its nice to have a guide while going abroad. how far did you go?
I bet. Socializing is such a huge part of life. I am so jealous of you.
Oh man, I love Whataburger. How was the food?
i've felt guilty after doing stupid things too. we all have
Oh, I see. Well, trust me when I tell you that even if it is one time, she will be upset if you lie when she is worried about you.
oh no, how did they react?
Dang. Did you get really sick?
Awwwww, that is cute! How did you react?
I do not like kissing either. I guess animals can be reindividuedentially cute.
i would have also feel that way. but i haveing friends, so i think i am more nervous.
I'm glad. Hopefully you continue meeting in the future!
oh also its a great job opportunity
I lost my job years ago and I've been through a lot in that time. I understand how you feel. I hope you find something better, but just know that things will get better.
I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
I am a lawyer, and yes, the cops are a big deal. I hope it all works out for you.
Awwww, I'm sorry. Do they have any young?
Did you have any luck at all?
Oh, that's not good at all. Was he in your car?
Those competitions are some of the most fun I've ever had.
i know the feeling. i used to wish i could dance. no longer wish i can do it. all I want to do is learn to dance.
Oh man, that must have scared you so much I bet. I am glad you are ok.
I don't blame you, but that flu can be really bad.
Nice! The scratch off tickets are very expensive so if you go with the right people it can be a great investment
I am sure you could've Blackjackwon it.
Oh no that's gross! I don't think anyone would find that funny! What was the cake made of?
that's no good, what happened?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Did she give you a funeral?
That is hard, losing a loved one so young. But you are here with her, taking care of her, so it is okay.
i am so very sorry for you
It will get easier
Aww, I don't believe the Fake News is the real deal. The Data is the real deal. Why do you feel that way?
I know, it's sensational news and gets people excited.
I never give them any.
That is exciting! You must be so proud of her! How old is she?
Gosh, that's terrible. Sorry to hear that. You gotta find something else quickly!
Things are really good for you at least. Hopefully this will be a nice positive feeling for the future.
I love Aldi! I think I would not go back.
I will be checking them out!
Oh yeah! When is the new season premiering?
Good for you guys! Perform well we sure you will!
I'm so sorry to hear that. How long ago was this? I know it's hard to lose a loved one when you're young, so I can relate to your feelings.
is he on chemo?
That is terrible. How did you find out?
Yes I would be sad as well, I am sorry for your loss.
Yeah, that's awesome.  It's a lot of stress to sort through all of that, but once you have set a goal, it's much easier to meet it.
Double shifts are always good
oh really? i love him
I have never seen it, but I heard it was good.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh no! That's a terrible thing to experience. I hope she is alright now.
Why did you join a different kind of dance crew?
That sounds good, I like hip hop.
Good luck! I hope you do, and if I were you, I would try to do more than just diet!
Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow! That's awesome! I am proud of you! Good luck!
wow. proud of your son, hu?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have close friends and family that you can talk to about these issues?
Its okay, you will grow and learn from these mistakes.
Oh really? How'd you handle it? I bet you were happy for them and your friendship has really grown!
Oh wow, that is luck, but i'm sure you worked hard for it.
That would be hard. You must be so happy for her, but her big house is a little bit special.
Mine does too. We have a ball in the backyard now.
That sucks! My cousin and I were friends in college, but she wasn't one of ours. I bet you were mad!
Shame on him.
In nature? There's nothing like the freedom IN nature.
That sounds pretty wonderful! What a pleasure that is to have fresh produce all year round.
I hear him! He's so amazing!
I love concerts.
That sounds like fun! How old is she?
You're a pretty energetic kid. Mine goes stone quiet when she's young.
I don't believe that. I would never do that.
It is a very difficult thing to be. Faith is a very stubborn thing.
I suppose I might be called one now.
Wonder if that's the day you get to wake up surrounded by pictures of your daughter.
I am sorry you feel that way. I am glad you are okay
I would feel the same way after 3 months! I'm glad you finally got it moving again!
Oh no! Were you able to go over?
Well, you should keep flying all the time then. I suggest you to read some korean books to get through it!
Aw, that's about as far as my family has gone. It's nice to have reliable debt but I think family should always pay first.
Absolutely! I hope all that hard work pays off for you!
Oh girl, it's an understatement. How did it change?
that all sounds really great. I hope you have a more mature relationship with him now
Oh sweet. So exciting! What part of "oh welcome" made you happy?
Aw, that's so sweet of you! I hope you have a great time!
cosigning a loan with my son, expecting he will do the right by you, he has let you down by being late every month
he doesn't have the same drive
wow such an achievement, are you doing any more?
wow! thats great! how did you follow the plan?
That's great. I have a daughter named Kira and I love that she is going to college and making her own decisions.
Yes! Very exciting times. A lot of responsibility but *at least* with her *ahead* of her, I think -- ooh, that's brave! :)
I've been there. I know how it feels.
yea its hard to not put everyone in their place
That sounds fun! What are you guys going to do?
oh thats awesome, i was wondering if you would be okay going to a new school if there was a new professor
And did you get the high score?
Well that's sweet. Any special motivation to pass?
That's wonderful! I hope you have fun!
Which college?
That's extremely scary, I'm glad you're getting the treatment that you need! Is it life-changing?
that will be interesting, good luck
Awwww, my girlfriend's cat used to roam the neighborhood a lot, and one day she told me she was going to get a new cat, and she wanted to get a relationship going with a cat, and I was like, "No way, you can't do that with a cat. You can't even have a relationship with a pet. That's not how it works. So
I love animals and all that, I'm sorry to hear that. I know you're in pain, but it's unimaginable.
What happened to him?
that's a great idea. I wish my friend had stayed with him
Oh wow, are they in their twenties?
haha they sure were worth it!
Nice! The beach is always a nice trip.
I gotta say, leaving some things to chance is a terrible strategy. You should try it this weekend and see how it goes!
well i am happy they changed their mind about it
Oh, so then what were you doing before now?
I hope you don't have to go anywhere, it would be unpleasant.
Sounds like a lot of fun! I'm in the same boat! I like to take time out to visit my grandmother in the nursing home.
I'm sorry that you feel this way.
it's a waste of a ticket to cancel, if you play your cards right
Yikes! How big was it? Do you think it was dangerous?
Did you get your gun?
That would be fun. Do you know where you are going?
sounds nice
That's not fair! You should report him!
That's the one everyone seems to like but nobody uses. I think the slow cookers are awesome too. They're so convenient.
That is so tragic, we always love our siblings but it is hard to lose them so young.
Oh my goodness! That's so awful. They're probably in a nursing home. That's so scary, because that's nursing home. It's not something that's easy to recover from. But they're in a good home, and I hope that they get better.
Ah that's true. But that's life. We all make mistakes.
yes, i can only imagine how hard it is to go through life alone.
Oh man! I would be so scared! Do you know what temperature it will be?
Yeah it gets cold pretty bad under here.
Cross country skiing is definitely something I would like to try!
So good! What do you have planned?
That is a good thing to hear. I wish you all the best in life.
That's happened to me before, my sister is incredibly messed up. I try to stay away from alcohol but I'm constantly telling people about my problems.
Yea that can be stressful, I'm sorry. Do you think it will work out?
oh wow! congratulations!
The place has evolved alot over the years, and the animals are really creepy!
Ah! Oh wow! That's one of my favorite things in the world! So pregnant? That's interesting! Sounds like you had a wonderful pregnancy, too!
I have never seen that and I know what you mean. There are a lot of scary movies I don't scare too much lol
roses and he twin brother have swords. they are the oppressors
wow that is a biggie!
That is terrible. What a stressful job to do. I hope they have had insurance at least.
That's awesome, what kind of car?
that's a nice ride
That is awesome! I went to college for a few years, but haven't been out yet.
In that case I'm sure you did great, congratulations!
Why did you do that?
Just tell them the truth. If it makes you feel better about it, I would come clean anytime.
I hope you all have a lot of fun. If you guys are having any fun in the meantime I'm sure you'll enjoy the visit of your family in no time
awww that is awesome that you were able to see them that long ago...that is a sweet place to land
I know what you mean. I still spend a lot of time with my high school friends.
I understand. I hope you feel better soon.
Yeah I love scary movies! What was it?
Awww! Is she your daughter? You must be proud.
You are so lucky! I also cherish my anniversary every year on the 30th. What is the occasion?
That's great! Are you a bride or a groomsman?
sorry to hear that. I rescue dogs, so I feel your pain
Companionship is so important, and oftentimes, we don't even realize that we have ones that are so important.
What is his policy on the world?
well maybe you can work something out
Awww, that is too bad. Is it something that you can recoup?
It will get better. Heal the right things and it will work out fine.
Oh wow! Where did you go?
Oh, well glad you made it back safely.
Sometimes teamwork is more beneficial then alone.
It's *weird* how we *see* the *same* people in the same places all the time. But that's *our* fault for not *reflecting* in a different way, I feel.
i have also got some sort of bee in my back yard since it looks like someone is up to no good. is this something they can handle?
Yeah, taking care of the lawn is a whole other animal. It sounds like you might need an adviser.
You are a brave man. I am glad you are being well fed.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure of it. I hate big storms too.
Sounds like a lot of fun! What horses did you have?
Oh man! I would have given my aunt a big hug!
Trailing half is the worst, but you did alright.
That's a shame, but you won't know until you try
Why were you nervous?
I am glad you didn't puncture your ankle.
That sounds like a beautiful trip. I wish I could go on vacation. Take some time for yourself and see how you feel.
Yeah, I know how you feel. If you don't find something new to do with your time, I wouldn't take your call!
Wow! Welcome to the OTHER side of the country. I have no doubt you will have a blast.
I... may just move to Germany. The people are more cordial there.
It's a lot of work to stay still in meditation.
Zen and carefree life are the perfect combination!
Oh no! What happened next?
Thank goodness it was nothing serious!
Uh oh, that sounds terrible, but yeah, sometimes you've just been screwed by people who think they know what is best for you.
Emotions run high very quickly. If you have a job offer it's best to back out of it now
I'm so sorry! You must have been exhausted. How did you do?
It was a good idea. I'm glad that nothing bad happened to you.
That is so nice of him! I wish I was able to meet like that
That's cool. I love my new neighbors as well.
Yes, I do love golf and will be traveling a lot in the future.
That's awful! I imagine it would have been quite an experience. I hope you made it out okay by the end of it.
I hope you don't need any doctor's help to treat it.
Wow! Did you get mad at him?
I am sorry, it sounds like you did the right thing.
What's your favorite memory?
you still have the same choices as child?
hahaha so you are a machine?
That's so nice! I wish I had a loved one who worked in that type of field!
I guess its a personal loss, but at least you did the right thing
Oh my, did the other woman report you to the police?
Sort of rude but maybe he had no idea what he was getting himself into.
That's so frustrating! Do you not have the same amount of money?
millionaire! wow! she must be a very smart girl
That's great! Did you study better than expected?
i can see that! it's always good to get in the groove of things
Yeah - that sounds amazing!
Sounds like a lot of work, hopefully you can enjoy your new house.
That's scary! I can't believe people are still doing that!
Im glad you didnt lose either of them. You were lucky that no one was home.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you feel at home?
No, I have always wanted to immigrate to russia
I hate when that happens. What did you have to tell the professor about?
That's not good. Did you get in trouble?
You don't honk in traffic to me either? I think its rude.
Yeah, If you're not careful a lot of things can go wrong.
That is great! Are you excited about it so far?
I did go to college and was very accepted but in college part time so far and in sororities I've accepted but still a bit nervous about it.
Oh no! Did the house get covered in snow?
Please do because there's nothing worse than waiting for the worst to happen! As long as you're happy and all, storms are a joke. I hope you're using protection wisely.
I was really sad to hear of his death, I lived in México and New York for a long time, worked in the US for a long time, went to Japan a long time, had friends in all those places, had great restaurants in those places, studied abroad in those places, been to those places, had great cookbooks in those places, visited those places, had great travel
Exactly. The only way to fight this disease is to create more awareness about it.
Good job! Happier days are the best. It's good to work for your boss that's been working hard.
Great job, glad you didn't get fired!
What kind of amusement park! I've never been there!
No, I used to live near one called Tomorrowland. It was amazing.
What does this account hold?
That's a wonderful attitude. keep strong!
That sounds wonderful! You must be proud of her for doing that.
I do believe in Santa Claus. He rules the children.
oh no. did you have it inspected? i hope it wasnt an allergy issue.
it might make you feel better that it happened to you now, and you will have many more good memories with your dog in the future!
What shows do you like the most?
ah the sadness is partly your fault. take more chances and let the tears come.
Oh, wow! That sounds like fun! That is a very interesting venue - sounds like a lot of fun!
I went to Williamsburg. There are a bunch of beaches there.
Oh yes, kids are easily scared by pretty much everything. I try to teach them about food handling and handling open carry but they aren't listening. Maybe you should bring a special treat in case they don't get it.
oh thats pretty gross.. how did he manage to do that?
Oh, well that's okay. I know how it feels to be cheated of something.
That's a good dog! They are loyal like that.
I love dogs, I had a German Shepherd when I was young and never knew what hit me. I had a Labrador also, she is so gentle and sweet.
Wow that roof must be tough
I'm so sorry to hear that, I hope you're able to get it fixed easily!
That must have been somewhat interesting.
That's of no concern to you?
That is great! Are you excited about their arrival?
That is so sad, I wish you the best of luck.
Aw I bet you were impressed! How old is she
Awww. That is great you gave her that
Absolutely, whatever it takes.
Oh wow! My kids would be so generous! I bet you feel special about that.
That's great you had someone to help him out.
Are you applying for another one, or you went through with your first one?
You are very cautioned. Good luck
Oh no! What did you do?
I guess that means it was good
That's wonderful. How long has it been open?
Wow that sounds like fun. I love collecting things from my childhood.
That's so sweet. You guys should celebrate her birthday in a big way!
Oh I know that feeling. I was just saying this was the worst for me. I can't imagine moving to a country like that when I have a kid and it's out of the question. Is it a lot of work to get to work every day and being away from home. I can understand that. And I'm not even talking about the cost. I just know it makes you homes
That sounds great. I visited my family a few times when I was little. It's always great to visit!
I actually just came back from Amsterdam, and I cannot wait to go to that giant metropolis!
That's so good that your family was watching over you! It's really hard to get better when you have great care.
That is so great! I am happy for you!
That is true, i have been in that place too, lot's of people will tell you anything to avoid responsibility.
I hope so too, there is so much opportunity out there if you work hard enough
Are you happy for him?
Who is he going to?
That's the worst, especially when you have to walk away from it all alone.
Yes, they don't care about anyone but themselves.
I'm really sorry. I know how that feels.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Was she awake most of the time?
You can always go back to school for a job. Don't let hate get to you.
I understand the importance of making some money though
That's awesome. I assume she's going to major in something and want to make sure she makes the most of it.
That's really exciting. Is she a girl or boy?
Well, that's pretty cool. Well, I hope you have some rest in the last month of your month!
I guess you will have to find another beach
I skied in a plane once.
That's a good way of thinking of it. I find it can make you more focus during difficult times.
Definitely! I'm sure it will be a great experience and you will thank me later!
I am very impressed with the food too! What did you have?
I love recipes! I always hunger for some fresh food!
I'm sorry, I used to have migraines myself.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That is extremely hard and requires a great deal of trust and courage. How did you end up helping her?
Oh wow! It sounds like you and your sister are the perfect match.
Sounds like a great mom/pop shop.
Not that often. I think she's in another state. But I'm not sure.
Cool, what is your favorite car?
Ohhh, that should be pretty cool.
That's unfortunate, I guess he has to sometimes. I guess we don't know for sure how old he is.
Yeah, I got a little jealous and I threw my phone into a trash can.
that's wonderful! what did she make?
That sounds like a nice dinner
My favorite meal is whenever my daughter consumes all of the forbidden fruit.
I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling?
I know being with your partner for so long is the issue. You should cherish the memories you've made together
That sounds great! What did he make you?
That sounds good. My husband loves potatoes.
Good for you. Will you be going back to school?
Wow! That's alot of hard work. I'm sure yours is well deserved.
I just love to see kids doing fun things.
I do. I will be 70 in February. Yes, you will be fine.
Are you coming to the US?
Wow, how exciting! I've never been outside of the country either. When do you go?
That was nice of them. What did they do to celebrate?
oh nit
haha that's cool, they must have been very wealthy
That is nice, what kind of ride?
I visited the parks and got to visit with some of the animals :)
Aw, I'm sorry you don't have family! You are lucky! I have a familiy, too!
Well if you guys went you would be happiest as a family and that would be a lot of traveling!
That's a good thing! Where did you go?
Being financially stable is important, but having fun and being adventurous are two totally different things. Definitely something we should all strive for!
That's awesome! I wish I had a good vehicle to drive myself. I don't want my kids to get a bad car.
I hope it is! Now you know and you can be more careful!
That's awesome! I want to marry a 16 year old in the not so distant future. they are so much more mature and responsible towards this age
I have a brother, but he's pretty young and kids are not something we do yet.
That is always a nice surprise
yes your mom is in a better place now
I can understand that completely, but I would be very nervous about that as well. Maybe you should try to find a new home first.
I think I can, though I'm not 100% sure. Sometimes my mobility gets a little restricted because of work, etc. I think visiting is a good way to go and it's always nice to see the country you're visiting too!
That sounds like it would be interesting.
That is very good of you to say. I am happy you had that training.
That's awesome, how did it feel when it was over?
Yea, it's good to see your close friend gets some support from you.
I think that's a good thing! Take your time and let your mind to rest.
Good luck!
Wow that sounds good!
I see, you must be feeling a lot better. That's wonderful that you feel so confident.
Im sure its a great time is you're reeading up.
I was thinking the same thing. Good for you for staying on top of it!
Wow congrats, congratulations to you on both counts! Is this your first?
thats good
Really? What were they about?
yea i can't relate to that, my parents were really messed up when i was a kid
Oh nice. I didn't know they were still around. Always nice to see what all the fuss is about.
I hear that, I can't wait to see them play.
I haven't been to a BMX park in a while, have you? Was it too much to see?
Yeah people die every day in this game. Im sorry but the game ended and he was one of the few that survived. I would be EXTREMELY nervous too
That's very nice of your friend. It's always good to have a friend who you can rely on for your things.
I'm glad you were able to get it fixed, it would have been an easy fix for you. I hope the problem goes away for you!
I bet you did great on it
That's great! I'm happy for you. Sounds like you've done well in the class.
That's so terrible. I'm so sorry for your loss.
I wish they would let you in on what is going on. I recently had a friend who had their health compromised and had to be on life support. It was really distressing to be in that position
wow thats great! you should celebrate with a drink or a meal
Wow, that's pretty awesome. What have you been doing in general lately?
i love how social media makes us worry and prepare for the worst! but honestly i am glad it looks like it has stopped
Is your home okay now?
oh wowo did you get caught
It's hard to learn that fast. I hope you learned your lesson.
It's GOOD that you are there for them. The flu can be miserable!
No no, try not to let his quirks make you feel less than welcome. I am sure he'll eventually get his act together.
Congratulations. You must have worked very hard to get to that place.
That's good. Work does that to us.
Oh yeah? I forgot, what movie?
that's a good way to start
That's a terrible feeling. How did it go?
Congratulations. I hope you can find happiness at work.
Did you ask your neighbor to let you dogs out? I'm sure she was just being nice.
Uh oh. Maybe she's trying to show you something?
are you ok? is your chair leg okay?
oh no.. I am so sorry you had to experience that
That's great, I remember that as a kid I had to teach myself to use a typewriter. I was terrible.
Oh you sound like a great parent!
Wow. That's not fun. Did you laugh or cry?
i'm sorry about that! we all need a break after this month though
Sorry to hear that my dog can be so sweet. Losing a pet is never easy, I know that for sure.
Well I'm sure he is in a better place now!
I just found out that I am going to graduate this year! Yay for you! What store did you work at?
LOL! You were right! I should of been scrolling through facebook looking for a competition like that. Good job though
Oh no! Do you have any complaints? I would have been very upset if I was riding your bus. How did you do?
Yeah - I had no idea. I hope your grandpa is ok.
I'm so sorry. Are you okay.
I'm glad to hear that. I've been through rough times by having to split, so I can relate.
Oh man that's embarrassing. I bet the other person was really mad at you.
How old are your parents?
That's really moving and kind of bittersweet. It's funny how time flies, but I have to drag my son's college along with him. Is he happy about that?
Haha yes they are so cute when they are little
That happens to all of us, it will get better
Oh knock yourself out...I hope you're not going to have that happen again!
Oh, that is very nice of you!
I think parents who invite their kids to family functions is a good thing. It shows that they care and are happy about their kids.
I'm sorry to hear that. That is a very difficult thing to go through and I am glad that you had friends and family that were there for you through it all
That's a tough one, I'm sure. It's something my parents go through daily and it's so sad. They're always like, "You'll be okay, don't worry about it" and I try, but it's hard. Not being able to help them makes it even worse. :( I hope you can all that you can and keep having great conversations about the value of life
I agree. I had a great job before I started work.
That's awesome. Is there a god?
Yes, that would be me. I admire people who work hard and take responsibility for the family.
That's impressive, how do you think your doing today?
I feel your pain. I had the same thing happen to me.
That's too bad. I hope the next time it will work out!
Was it a surprise at work?
That's a good age to have kids. How many do you have now?
I bet that is hard when you are away from home. I am sorry that you have to deal with that. Was this an event that occurred recently?
Have them meet your son before they meet your daughter! I think it's a great experience. They will grow up to be so great!
Oh, why couldn't it be stopped?
i have never done that much tv
I am like that too
I am glad it worked out well for you!
oh, sorry to hear that my friend.. where are you going
Oh I get that, but I have had really good ones too
did she turn you down?
She's not the type to go out of her way to do that. Somethings just seem natural
wow. good for you
It's pretty frustrating right? Have you thought about trying to grow anything else in your yard?
The grass is always gonna be greasy that's for sure.
That is a real bummer. On the positive side at least you have a strong support system.
You must be proud of him as well. He can do whatever he wants.
That sounds terrible. How did you respond?
Yea, well i hope it wasnt too bad for you afterwards
What does she do that is so cool?
That's amazing! You must be so proud of her.
That's terrible. Does she seem okay now?
Sounds like you have a very good friend.
What is wrong with your job?
That's such a hard trade-off to make.
I'm sorry to hear that. I know how important these are to your marriage, thank God for you to be able to share these days with him!
Hey. That's a great time. Enjoy your new found wealth!
I know what you mean. It is very gross.
that is awful! i know how that feels
There's usually a reason why; you just have to keep looking. The bonuses are usually really easy to find.
I think you are doing a great job - even if you don't know it. I hope you find someone soon that you really like.
A bit lonely, huh? Maybe you should get out and do something you really enjoy!
yea i gona miss my kids as well
Thats wonderful. Kids grow up so fast. I remember when my daughter did her first year of college. I thought she was going to start taking drugs.
I relive every single game with my son
Oh my, what is happening in that neighborhood?
Good, I am glad you are safe.
Thats so terrible. I am sorry for your loss.
oh my god, that sounds so sad. im sorry for your loss.
that's a great feeling how did you feel
That's terrible! How did she know it was a friend of hers?
Aw I'm sorry, you should do it! I bet it'll be over in no time!
Nice! How was it?
That is nice. You should cherish them.
Oh no! Did you confront them about it?
jealousy is very real thing, thanks for doing this.
That is a great show! I loved it!
I just discovered Lin Manuel's The Running by Neil Gaiman. I am really going to love this.
Oh no! What happened?
Harsh. Are you alright now?
Oh that's nice of you. Is it your first time?
Don't worry, you'll be fine! We've all done embarrassing things before. Don't be nervous!
That is really messed up. How did you find out?
It happens to the best of us. I hope it's not too costly to clean up!
Oh no. Did she end up being okay?
that is great, glad it worked out that well
Oh wow! How long had it been since you'd seen him?
What a lovely thing to do, I hope you blessed the ceremony.
That's very pleasing to hear, I wish I had a boss like that
That's an excellent thing to have in an area like coal country. Mine was co-opted by the mines worst, rude workers.
I once fired up a campfire and set the entire thing ablaze. Nothing could put it out, and I'd never get to use the matches again. I love camping.
Oh? What was in there?
I understand that, I have been tired as well. Its better to get a good nap instead of going long walk.
i know right. we all need hours of sleep to function optimally
That's wonderful! Do you have a title agreement in place for the house?
Nice! I hope it's a nice purchase for you.
Nice! What did you plans look like?
sorry to hear that - she will need help with that, I'm sure.
That sucks, I can only imagine how grind intensive that is for them. Maybe they will change their tune when they get a little older.
You should tell her that herself!
aw how old is she really. i bet she was determined to show you that she is proud.
oh wow, i am so sorry, was this someone you knew?
were they good at it?
That's so wonderful! I am glad kids can enjoy free time now that adult responsibilities have been taken care of.
Oh nice! I bet you are anxious to get started right? What kind of work will you be doing?
It's nice to have that extra peace of mind. Always to be working when your whistle lol
Ugh that is such a random and wonderful thing to find! Did you take a picture of anything in particular?
I bet! Sometimes I feel like I need a vacation, but I'm too afraid to go.
Where did he go?
Aw, that sucks man. If you ask him why he won't even talk to you, I'm sure he'll tell you the truth. All you need to do is just tell him the truth and he'll forget about his past indiscretions.
Oh yeah? I'm sure you are, because that's the only thing I've ever wanted to do. What kind of job?
I would too. I have interviews coming up and I just want to make sure I have it!
Oh no! I guess you didn't find one that day?
Wow, that sounds good but harsh
Oh no. What happened?
Who was married to who?
Oh? Why was that?
That's very true. Soldiers are an important part of society.
Congrats! What kind of job?
Oh wow, I was shocked when I learned I didn't get any overtime pay. That is very lucky of him to get away with it.
Oh no! What happened?
Oh wow, I guess you were a little curious about what it was.
Was he okay?
I'm glad you finally did something about that!
Oh no! How old do you think your car is? Mine is 22.
That's great. Before we know it, he'll be telling us all how to do everything.
That is terrible. Why did she do that?
You'll find the right one someday.
that is a great feeling how did you meet she was?
That's great, I was never too good at socializing, only best friends. I hope you stay in touch.
i was so shocked!
That's all you need, though. Have you had trouble talking to her about it, Tao?
That's exciting! I've been looking for a new home too. Are you excited?
Great, are you thinking of buying it outright?
That's awesome! I just got my new car! Was it stressful?
Sounds like a good bet. Do you like it?
oh wow! were you scared?
Oh my, do you know what might have caused it?
Same, hope it gets a little better. Maybe you should take some time for yourself and think about all that went into it, right?
It always makes me feel good to see my old friends in good spirits
wow thats good
Must you be pretty tired?
How old is she?
Oh no! My little ones can sometimes be such challenge. I am sure she will make it.
Oh she's not used to such a break? How long she was away
I bet it will still be alright. It's ___ weather across the country now.
I'm so sorry. I know how that can be.
I am sorry, i also missed my pet. is he home?
Expecting them is always a bit strange, what are they returning too?
My husband quit his job and is living with me. I met on a dating app and have been together for 6 years. I really want to find someone like you!
was it scary?
Oh, yes, I have had that experience as well. What did you do?
That's great! Where are you going?
Wow! I've never been on a cruise, but I've always wanted to go to Alaska. I've heard so much good things about this trip, so I hope you enjoy it!
wow that is awesome! where does she fly back to?
That's pretty cool. I bet you'll be proficient in no time.
ohh, what's the occasion?
Nice, I love cooking for family. Do you have all of your cooking classes done already?
Me too. And I still do think about it. I guess I was more scared for no reason.
Oh boy! I thought it was one of those old MGM movies?
That is awesome! These letters can be so sentimental.
That is great. I too have fallen in love with my neighbor's dog before. I hope you continue to cherish your time with her!
Oh no! That is a terrible thing to do. Was someone in the house?
That would make me so angry! I never thought anything of the sort, and now I'm angry elwope
aww she must be a keeper!
I don't know if I could ever buy a dress for a man.
you must be upset
Well that's good. You can always get a new one next time.
OH and how do you feel about it?
I feel the same way. I don't know what will happen next.
oh no.... that is sad. I am so sorry. I hope you can find a new friend soon!
Your friend is very appreciative of the favor.
Oh, that's sweet, I bet you are proud.
I watched a lot of movies as a kid. I remember looking forward to the end of the line as a kid.
That must be refreshing, as most people aren't compatible like you.
Im excited for you! Enjoy your day!
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you getting ready to move?
You will be happy in your new city though
Oh no! Did you let him off early?
Yeah, I worked very hard to get where I am. It really does stink that someone got to before you.
a boring movie is ok, my opinion is, a quiet movie is good also, what movie did you like the most?
Oh the aliens! Oh my gosh! You should go see it!
It sure is! I miss the days of having to work for my own stuff!
Yeah, it's a good time to spread the word and get in your neighbors yard more often. It's a lot of fun to yell and yell.
What did you eat?
Oh, that sounds so good. Do you know where they got them?
Awww, you lucky girl! I have a boy with a lot of issues, so will bet your dealing with a dog who is most likely very loving and loyal to you. Glad you got him :)
I really feel for you. I had to ship 18 people in a row to get my daughter interested in the military.
Yeah I feel you. I'm stuck with two bosses at the moment - my boss and my boss's boss. I actually just had a bit of a argument with my boss yesterday, over what to do about all this nonsense about "trigger warnings" and "safe spaces" and "you can't have this stuff on here" blah, blah, blah. It's getting really bad. Have you
I'm sure your hard work and dedication will be rewarded!
I hope you have a great experience there. I would be nervous to live in a city with no history/context
That sounds terrible. Did you make any adjustments beforehand?
pts :) how did you find your friend?
Yeah it really is. I've been in that position with several people I've worked with. It's very frustrating. Did you call to arrange to have the customer pay in full?
Most people arent that lucky
Wow! Congratulations, your a great person.
I went to Disney with my family.
sorry about that
oh really, its weird, but its possible that it is just some dream scenario, that is very unlikely.
I don't blame you!
You at least made your friend happy.
No procrastination needed, that's excellent.
I used to have an 80 year old that did the same thing
it is always good when your partner is there for you
I bet you were! How old are you?
That sounds great! I love going to the beach!
I understand.
Yea, you should try and avoid those things in the future at least.
I like the ones with blood and guts. I can watch them sometimes
Oh no, I hope you're okay!
It's an exciting time for anyone, especially when you know you want to have kids. With that said, it's extremelydifficult to know when you're going to ovulate and when you'll get the test result! I wish you luck and pray you get the results soon!
That's so exciting! I hope you're doin something wonderful for your future self!
That's great! What book was it?
sounds like yolo
Yes, many people have forgotten what a great in-laws are.
Yea that happens to all the youngsters. They like the company of old friends.
That's very admirable of him!  It can be tough getting kids to live by certain policies and schedules, but I'm glad he's starting to see that it's something he has to live by as well!
I agree, think about it as a kind gesture.
That's quite ingenious. Were you able to do it on your own?
Oh, well that is pretty nice of her, sounds like she has a good friend in someone else.
Why? What did she do?
I hope you still have the time to celebrate with her.
They do have a tendency to lose their minds sometimes. I would get rid of them with Mace.
oh yea i can relate lol
Oh no. Why couldn't you?
Aw I'm sorry to hear that. Sounds like you had a busy day.
I'm sure you were a much bigger presence in her life than I realized. How did you cope with it?
It sounds like she was a very dependable person
Oh that's nice. What are you planning on seeing?
i never even heard of purge, have you been purged before?
Well that was rude of you! I don't understand why people are so selfish
they's those little plastic bags that a lot of animals use to take food to the hungry. i love my blessing bags
That's so interesting! What was the puzzle? I'm always envious of people who can piece together puzzles.
Yeah, I hear Etsy is really popular these days. I never knew people could spend real money on things they actually use.
Well, glad you had fun.
Wow, that's nice. You're an avid travelogt, what did you do?
That's good. It's not too bad in the morning but certainly after waking up lots of times since the beginning.
Exactly! I try and stay awake during the night!
that's sound, I hope your work is worth the money!
Yes, it is great to work for a company that cares so much about you!
That's great! I'm sure you were super proud of them.
Will he be taking Advanced Placement? I bet you're proud.
That sounds awesome! I'm glad youre feeling better!
! Oh fun! I've never heard of water as an exercise - let me check my work out first. Maybe you could throw on some running shorts and a t-shirt and go for a run!
That can be a very happy thing. I have that feeling from my mom.
oh no! did you find a new woman?
Is that a favorite of yours? He's actually one of my favorites too!
I remember those games too, they were fun
Yeah, I know how you feel. I've been in that shoes, really bad. What did you do?
I really understand that, I have a trick for that, but I have to find the right bean.
Yea I went through that too with my wife recently and she had to call the police to get me to the hospital. You don't want to go in that house, i hope you stay away from it as much as possible.
I am sure it was very scary to you. I am sorry you had that experience. I hope it was an anomaly.
I use stitcher for a while then I moved to the Napster of the radio business. I have not heard a thing since.
If it's not on there anymore, it's not any good. Maybe try to find a ticket scalper and bring him the extra fee.
That's great. One that young she knows how important grades are and obviously cares more about her work than anyone
oh thats amazing you must be so proud of her
if its not too much then enjoy the experience
I know I would be apprehensive as well. I hope it works out for you.
Oh that sounds terrible. I hate it when meet and greets are wasted.
I haven't, but I'm sure you will find it!
Do you dinner with him all the time?
I can see that, I try not to be too obtrusive with my kids
Oh yeah, that's got to be tough! You must really miss him.
I guess hope is a pretty terrible thing to be
Uh oh, that is a very scary situation. Fly's aren't very good when you're not in the know.
That's a cute story. Did you like the mom?
Oh no, I know how that goes. Your husband shouldn't even be out of the house if he's not the center of attention. I felt the same when my husband was away for the Olympics.
that's so true. i wish I could just imagine what your family is going through.
was she alright? do you still have to pay for her?
That's so terrible. I can't imagine how hard that is!
Oh no, have you tried taking him to the vet?
I see, well hopefully she had a good time!
That's a lot of tries. What are you most frustrated about?
I'm sorry about that. I hope it works out for you.
Aww, that's quite a thoughtful and thoughtful gesture! Is your husband into anime?
Awww I've been thinking about doing one of those. If I ever win an Emmy's. I'm definitely going to give it a try
wow that's awful, were you still able to have lunch with them?
hope it works for you
oh, that has been a thing for a while now
Oh boy, I imagine that was a while lol
That's pretty awesome! Do you like where the house is/?
I certainly hope you do, too! I'm almost thirty, and I've moved around quite a bit, so I feel like I'm still a little baby in the making.
Oh my goodness, that's so sad to hear.
That's such a shame. I hope your cat has a speedy recovery.
It is a sad situation. We need to end it.
that's great, I'm glad you're doing good
What did he do?
Oh wow, how scary! Did you get a good look at his or her?
I agree, how long have you two been together? Can you just tell him how you feel?
Of course I have, and you should feel proud of yourself.
I am sorry, I am sure you have other things to do
pending a hearing and a possible bail review, i'm sure this is going to be a very long and drawn out process.
I hope it goes smoothly. Do you have kids of your own?
I can understand that. I don't have kids yet but I know how that feels.
I also can't decide if I'm a girl or a boy. If you could take one thing away from this conversation, what would it be?
Do you have siblings and if so how close are they?
OH no. Do you have any plans that day?
Yep. I'm sure you will find someone soon though.
I love Disney! Where are you going?
That's a good feeling! I am sure you will enjoy your new home.
Well that's great. It's great to work hard.
yeah that's always good! I'm glad it's paying off for you!
That's wonderful. What makes them so great?
That sounds so fun!
What does he do?
aww that is awesome, i hope he reciprocates
I am so sorry to hear that! Your feet are going to have to find other jobs but I know that your heart is in the right place. Hopefully this isn't too bad for you and that you'll keep being offered things.
Thats wonderful news. Good luck and I am sure you will be very successful.
That's great! I am so happy for you! What is the job?
Yes. I interviewed for a dream job in interviews a few years ago.
It is not good for the relationship.
yes! even though I am a quiet guy i love interaction with other people
That sounds so cool! Did you guys ever bump into each other again?
Was he staying at your place?
Oh no! I know how you feel. Everyone loses something when they buy a new thing. Ironic that it was the Keurig that I bought.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Maybe you can find work around or maybe you'll go back to roasting your own beans.
why is that?
That's great! I'm sure it's going to be a lot of fun.
Wow that's messed up. Is she okay now?
It's so sad. The most you can do is hold onto them and make sure they don't forget a thing.
My condolences to your family. :( DO they have a hope for him?
Im so sorry to hear that. I wish you luck and know that you will get better.
That is fun! You must have a lot of good memories up there!
Am so sorry to hear that. Have you tried discrediting the person who put food in the fridge?
That's a good strategy. Do you feel like you did well?
Indeed. When I took my first sutction in school, it ramped things up as well.
That's a cute thing to do. Was this for a school project?
I agree, it's interesting to look back. Which drawings have you drawn before?
Ah okay that might be a good thing! Are you a bit jealous? It's a pretty typical reaction to a first proposal.
haha I dont know why people are so stupid. im sorry for your loss.
Nice! Are you in a dangerous part of town?
I can imagine. I would have been so scared. Hang in there.
What type of dog is she?
That's a pretty name. How old is she?
That's a pretty adorable name. How old is she?
I hate when that happens! Did you call the police?
You should get a paint remover.
Oh my! I am sorry! I am afraid I have never had to endure a thunderstorm!
Yeah, it's probably because you're in a scary movie. I'm sure it will make you scared again, though.
You must be a very confident person to be so confident. I am sure you will get it.
oh thats cool
ah thats a good thing
oh no that must be frustrating
That's great that someone in your situation was helpful.
Wow. You should buy a chainsaw some time.
That is wonderful. You must be so proud of him!
That's great! Sometimes they can't handle the stress of it all, so they blow the calculator out of proportion. Again, good job.
I am happy for you! I am sure it will be a great time for you and your family!
To the Caribbean, but I want to go back to my childhood place in Texas!
Oh, that's awful! Are you okay? Were you scared?
Ah I see. Well sometimes pride takes refuge in the most disgusting places.
That is so annoying, they are so rude, I would give anything to stay with them.
yep us too if we work hard we can get by
Ah, that's embarassing. Did he apologize to you or the manager?
I think he got a discount for being disabled. I think most people just get two lunches.
That's good. Is your neighborhood in Palm Beach County nicer than your neighborhood in west Houston?
i'm glad it wasn't too bad, it must have been very expensive to fix
That's so sweet. What did you get in the mail?
You deserve a cuppa!
on no! what are you going to do if you dont want to go!
Special diets are very restrictive and they can cause all sorts of health problems. I hope you can find a way to go with them - it's hard to go with someone you don't know well.
Oh, that's exciting! Is it a boy or a girl?
Thats so good. I wish friends in good stead.
i am so sorry to hear that!
Sometimes it can be really hard to teach them all at once, but it teaches them well in the long run! That's awesome!
That is so nice! I'm sure it was a nice surprise.
I bet you'd be upset about someone else getting the spotlight. Like a jealous neighbor.
I hope you did too! Think you did okay?
It's great to have that discipline.
Aw, good for him! How did you raise him?
How did you do?
I hope it comes sooner rather than later!
I honestly wish the best for you, so you know that it will work out and that you are doing things the right way.
Oh that sucks. Were you guys close?
Then it wouldn't have been a problem for you to go ahead and buy it now
Oh yea? What's going on?
Hahaha! Good times. I wish i had kids.
How long were you together?
Don't feel bad, most guys want that, too. The problem is, most girls don't want you either.
it can be scary right
Thats awesome! I would be nervous too flying in foreign places. at least you had a good time!
Why aren't you getting any flack for that?
Dang, it sure is hot out!
Apple are pretty savvy about supporting kids nowadays, it must be nice to have such a great product
What are they like? My husband and I tried to get out of our first deal and ended up moving because we weren't happy.
I have never won a game of poker
That must've been a lot of hard work! I'm glad you guys got to enjoy that.
I hate spiders!
I am no longer afraid but I sure would be if I were you! I have a friend who recently passed and just started having panic attacks so you might want to try and talk to him after to help him get unstressed.
Yes, it seems like every couple years that they triple the size.
Yes, since the NES there has been a huge explosion in the amount of video games we can enjoy.
That's so sad. What did they end up cooking?
well done
oh, that's nice! it's a good thing that she's happy
It get better with time i think
Yeah, that's a good thing. I always see little kids grow so fast and then they're just barely walking.
I understand that, I have a roommate who is a musician and he is the most expressive person I have ever met. I hope you have some "time to catch your breath" before you start to date again.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Who did you call and where did she get her cancer from?
its funny how times have a different take on things these days
That's a great accomplishment! I bet you were proud.
That's a long time ago for sure!
Oh no, slid into something? I've never heard of a sliding object. Was you able to get it fixed?
That's what I did the other day. I shouldn't have eaten it, but I shouldn't be overdoing it either. I only eat ice-cream when I'm really hungry.
Oh wow. I hope you're ready for it. Are you in an area that gets storms bad?
If you have a timer in the breaker panel, you KNOWS it's out!
Wow! That is wonderful! You must have felt so special when she did that.
As you are I know it is a great feeling when you get what you want
Awww good for you! What makes you say that?
That is very sweet. I wish I had a like-minded friend.
That's terrible! What did you do?
I'm so sorry. Will you be okay?
I'm sorry, I think your situation is much more with reptiles than snakes for reptiles. Have you considered getting a reptile and watching it from time to time?
Wow, that is scary! Sounds like you must have been very nervous.
On purpose?
I'm sorry to hear that, it's going to be so nice to have some rest after this week!
were you scared you would be followed?
I guess going alone may be a bit too risky
That's so sweet! marriage is very hard indeed
That's a great setup! I hope you get a better paying job, that's always a plus.
Okay, where are they supposed to be staying now?
I get it. Do you not like them anymore?
That's great! How do you feel about it?
better than smoking weed
That is a good feeling I am glad to hear.
That's impressive. Do you have any children together
That is pretty lucky! Do you sometimes win on these types of things?
Im sure it was. But, it would be surprising if it wasn't. It's good it it was unexpected.
Wow, that would make me cry. I am so sorry.
Sounds fair to me. I wonder how they even found out?
Oh wow, that does sound like a nightmare!
yeah, the sandcastles were awesome! but yes, the beaches were fab!
That's great. You must have felt really excited and at ease.
You should be proud of yourself! You have worked very hard and deserve this.
That is awful! Were you okay?
Im sure it was, but it is so nice to see someone that care for you like that. Its a great feeling to care for others
That's terrible. How long does he work night shift?
i do too, i wish i could get out of bed and just focus on my problems at hand
wow I know the feeling! I was kind of scared for a few days when I first moved here, I hope everything goes well and i am able to find the perfect home :)
I live in Boston, so I've always had a soft spot for Alaska. She's so beautiful in the water!
I agree thats when you should confront them about it.
I understand, especially with kids. Sorry to hear that.
I have not seen any of the new Star Wars movies.
I prefer the older toys but say I like the new toys, I pick them instead.
Yeah, farting can be pretty embarrassing.
Yeah, I guess if you know you're eating a lot of onions it can mess them up.
that's a great gift, were you happy to get it?
Well kisses is just the beginning, make sure to give your wife two more soon!
That is what makes the streets so dangerous.
That sounds fun! I like going through my old shopping malls and finding old toys and games I used to play with.
won't you be too anxious? don't forget the history with the South by Southwest and the shooting at Georgia.
It's always worth the tears, at least they're not buried forever.
I heard they are notorious for interviewing bad candidates. Hope you get a chance to work for them then.
Awesome. I wonder how the interview went.
That sounds exciting! do you have a large family?
What will you do while you're gone?
That's awesome! What kind of car did you get?
Oh so you're getting a new car is it a rust free one?
Nice! I heard once it rids very fast, it takes months to make.
I wish you the best of luck!
It's a great way to start
Oh that's the worst! Did you afterwards say something mean about her?
That's great! That's what makes paper fun, isn't it?
Why does waiting matter?
I've been there, it's terrifying. Are you in a hurry?
Oh no, how are you feeling about that?
Call him and give him a call. Or maybe it works out well before the trip and you both fall off the face of the earth.
Thats great! I wish I had a goal for the last few months I have been living off.
That makes sense. I don't want to focus on the negative parts of others. I want to stay positive and hopefully our success will be based on ourselves.
Me too, it breaks my heart. It's something I grew up too know about.
I t is also very sad.
Congratulations! What school did you go to?
I bet that made you very happy
What is Your tv?
I see, yeah I hope it lasts a good while. I think getting new tv's is one of the most useful things you can do.
How long ago did he lose his job?
I am sorry, I have been there too many times. What can I do for her right now?
Yes that is a great attitude to have!
You are so right. I hate when that happens.
That must have been lonely. Did you cry there?
Well that's good. What kind of project was it? Hopefully it won't be one that is too difficult.
how are you gonna get her back?
Sorry to hear that. My dogs died a few years ago as well. But they're like family pets, you never lose them
He seems like he's on the path to recovery :)
That's phenomenal. You must be proud.
Oh no, I've heard that a lot lately. It's no fun! I worry I may have to move.
That's terrible! If I may ask, where did you have fun at?
I recently been to LA and it's a totally different animal. The police are much better there and it's much easier to get around the city by car.
That's great that they noticed atleast.
That's so sweet. Did she pass away?
Sometimes children's birthday are so much fun and a nice way to remember the great people they have met along the way.
That sounds so painful! Is he a boy or girl?
Aww, that's terrible. I hope you try to help him eat. I know it's rough.
It'll be a lot of work, trust me. I've been there.
I hear you! I love my baby feet! I'm so bad about it, but I think I just stay out of their way more than they'd like to believe. I'm sure you'll get over it soon enough!
That would make me so jealous. How far have they been going?
That's great! I wish I were there, too. I am so jealous!
I do too! I need to get away from it all and start a family somewhere.
How nice of you. What did you order?
I love fries. What kind of burger did you have?
I know, it's really annoying and frustrating. It's worse when it's dark.
Oh no! I'm so sorry!
I don't blame you! the dark is no fun
i do that as well
That's cool. Hope they get a little bit of exercise too.
Wow! Is there anything about being a dog breed that you like?
Oh no! I hope it was only for like 5 minutes!
Were you in a tight spot?
Oh no! Did it smash into your house?
Yeah, I used to fix crashes with fulbox but that didn't help much and the experience was often frustrating.
oh, thats a let down.
Yeah I'm guilty of that sometimes too.
That sounds so relaxing!
Yea it helps calm me too
I'm so sorry to hear that. Is it an expensive car to fix.
Oh wow. Well, I hope some one helps you out!
I could see how that would be a lot of fun
That's insane, do you ever get nervous about the amount that you can spend before you hit that?
Yes! It's crazy to be from New Orleans - they don't really have a reputation for crime or nasty stuff. The media doesn't really focus on them that much either, so you just keep cruising by without much thought put into what's around the corner. Have you been?
Oh my devil! I've heard the voice in the past too! Sometimes people say things you don't want to hear. Very weird.
I know that feeling! I wish people would stop.
That was really mean. Now he's a junkie.
What about 3?
oh it was not an emergency
I can see how it would be hard on the smell
Holy crap! To top it all off, the place is dog proof. What did you do to quell your ire?
Oh boy, must've been a pretty cool day.
oh really? its nice to know that you are spending a fair amount of time planning for the trip
I have. I wasn't sure I could trust people, and it ended up being really helpful to know people better than me. Good for you for being able to realize that kind of knowledge!
That's so messed up. I would hate to have to deal with a party pooper
Wow, how sweet of her! That's crazy.
Yes she is. Everyone deserves someone like that.
Are you okay?
That's so awesome! I wish I had a husband like that!
That's great! Did you get everything done?
Is it because you have kids or because you have kids and cats? I can't stand cats that keep munching on things.
ah that would be a nice change of pace
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What was going on?
Daycare scares me. I have had that happen to be before.
That's wonderful! What did you get in particular?
I can imagine it was, school can be such a bore sometimes.
Yeah, it should be a good year for those online shipping things.
Yeah, I heard the same thing! I always pick those off when in store.
Oh my goodness! I would have screamed! What was it?
Things you can't change like if you used better glass! I would definitely stay away from them
Oh no! I would have been too! Did you not enjoy it?
How weird! You must have been pretty hungry!
Wow! What a surprise. What are you going to do?
We finally made it this past year and a half and it started to feel real.
maybe it was for something good maybe
You know he's a pretty smart person too, never doubt a thing, and is always correct.
oh no thats terrible. did you wake up with a cold
Oh my goodness! That's horrible! Are you feeling okay now?
Calc is a bing bing. I can't stand the practice exams. What subject is it?
Wow. Must be a really smart girl.
What did you do to get her to stop?
Did you hear her?
It takes a lot of hard work. What do you study?
That's great you were able to get that degree. What was the job result for?
Oh no! I'm sorry that happened to you! What was the college?
Oh you didnt get into Auburn? lol
... and now you guys are separated for the foreseeable future. Do you think that this is the beginning of your breakup?
I'm sorry. Maybe you can pick a different girl?
They are getting bigger all the time.
It's definitely something I enjoy doing, and something I could never do professionally.
That's too bad. I know it's tough when things you love close in on you, and it's no fun in the summer either.
Yes, February is a great month for those that were close. I hope you remember them and have a great time together!
You sound very confident of that. What are you going for in a career?
Ha. Tech-enthusiast, bless my heart. What got you into engineering?
That is good to hear. What keep you thankful?
what type of medal it is
I know ropes well as my son plays it. does it frighten your son?
I do like to bowl but not as much as most people. It takes a lot of hard work.
That's scary! What's going on?
Oh no! I hope your dog is okay!
Bowling is hard! I really like the card games too!
There's nothing worse than someone taking your fun! Thanks for saving the day, you deserve it.
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Are you okay?
Yea I guess so, but you never know how their relationship is supposed to be. It's always best to be understanding and to be able to leave her knowing that you won't be able to change the past.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have anyplace else to go?
That still doesn't explain why you're so down on yourself. You need to join a club for drugs in minors. It's a much better life.
It can be tough at first, but once you get used to it's like new again. Don't worry about it too much.
wow i am sorry to hear that, i hope you feel better about the whole situation
I'm sure you are more prepared than ever! What are you studying?
That's a shame. I know procrastination isn't fun but it can be hard to deal with in the long term.
Great, relaxing dinner usually does the trick.
Oh ok. I am sorry. I love pizza.
That is heartbreaking. How old is he?
I'm so sorry, that must be so hard.
What kind of game is it?
Oh ok. That sounds interesting. Have you ever met?
That is very frustrating. Have you thought about talking to a family member about this?
thats cute
That's a tough problem to be afraid of.
Man! That's so scary! Let me out of the house too!
That's awesome! And it's not like you have to do a lot - I recommend 10 hours a week.
I can imagine. Best of luck. Just make sure to study hard!
That's pretty great! What did you think when you heard it?
I am glad that you did enjoy doing so much of the time
Well bowling is not for everyone. Discover your gifts and make them your brother can replicate. It's humility at it's best.Bowling can be fun but bowler's often times delivers worse. Maybe consider practicing with friends or family.
Bobby Flay is a ball of passion,energy, and devilry! He strikes fear into my heart every time hera
What is your new job
Oh wow, I'm sure its not hard once you get the hang of it. I have butterflies in my stomach because I just had to rush to get home today. Hope you are able to recover well.
That's no good. customer service is very important.
It is better to have a vision for a restaurant that you would like to open and meet that vision with your own hands than to have it snatched from behind by a ruthless franchisee.
oh I love going on road trips, do you intend to return some time?
That sounds so beautiful and peaceful. I would love to go again
Well, my dear, do you have any other preferences? For example, are you a lover of cars, a lover of people, or some mix thereof?
That is good that you are careful. I wish I had a pet like that in my life.
It's not too bad. What kind of car should you get?
Doesn't seem like it would be that bad, other than the fact that you probably wouldn't be able to use it anyway. I certainly wouldn't be stuck with a busted engine either!
wow, why do you fence?
It was! I would have been! How scary!
That's quite annoying! What did you do?
ate a new one soon?
I feel you. At least if I'm the center of attention, everyone is going to know it.
The best thing you can do is just keep at it. If you get better you'll be like me and adopt the body like it's a daughter/sister. My sister started out with the same thing and it's much more difficult still but I keep at it and get faster.
That sounds like a lot of work. Did your dad find it?
Yeah, dogs can pretty much mess everything up.
Rap is a very interesting music. I cant understand most of what is said
Yeah, I wouldn't have been able to see haha
Oh no, I hope you were able to save some money.
Well that's very sweet of him! I bet you're not lonely now!
That's good. That makes you independent and able to live independently.
I am very proud of my son for standing up like that!
That's really good, were you happy with it?
That's great! What kind of car did it have?
Aww no. Why is that?
well that's good to hear
I almost always make a big stink when people do that to me.
Yes, do you have any idea what can be done about it?
Wow, that's really dangerous!
I am glad to hear that. There is no need to be scared of that, it is nothing to be scared about.
I am sorry, I have never flush but I know it is hard.
I work. I had a big ceremony today. I am so happy.
Yeah, that would be awesome!
Is this your first job?
Ain't that the truth. Wouldn't something in the settings make you uneasy?
High speeds are fun. I heard about High Peaks a few years ago, but haven't been on one in years - whaider you?
Aww that is so sweet! You must be feeling so proud of yourself!
Oh I know that feeling too. How did you end up meeting your wife?
Yikes, did you scream?
Panic is understandable. I would have been terrified!
that is a pretty bad experience
I'm so glad that nothing went wrong. And it wasn't even your fault.
Me too, I hate that feeling.
Lol! Maybe you should try and re-direct your focus to something more productive in the future. body, mind etc.
Oh no that sounds awful. What was it?
That is very odd. I never understood why people won't turn off the water in the sink or the fridge!
That's so nerve racking. Everything happens so fast.
They definitely can be tough, especially if you're tall and have to stand straight. I also hear that a presentation is 50% of your brain, so you have no control over it other than trying to minimize as much as possible.
I am so sorry to hear that. My uncle is one of the few people in his family that has been researching this disease.
I'm so happy for you. I know how precious a child a mother can be.
Right, you never know if they are the type to turn you down.
I hope so, too! Get out and meet some cool people.
That's a good thing! I carry a belt pouch and a few belts. Does your boss not take notice?
Yes, you should be more prepared.
That's great! What will you be doing?
That sounds exciting - hopefully you do well!
You will surely get a new one, I think.
I posted that to my friend, hope he can help me!
I can imagine you to be excited about it. Where do you hail from?
what are you studying?
That's a great start to the day! Breakfast is the bomb. You better be on top of it tomorrow when you start school.
Yum, I love cake and sweets. Definitely need to go back to bite into some more cake.
Good because now you have something to look forward to
It certainly does! Good to hear that you have one, it's very helpful.
Congratulations! I know that if I had a baby it would be the same way.
It can be hard to find that silver lining to every situation. I wish you well and look for the perfect situation to be!
That's awesome! I'm sure you are going to have a great time. What kind of cruise are you planning?
That's pretty cool. It's wonderful when our friends are able to help us out like that.
Oh yeah? What did she do?
Oh, a used one? That's a whole other ball of wax.
Very admirable. I wish the same could be said of my best friend. She works hard shifts to get the best deal.
Aww, that's sad.... how old are they?
Oh I see. Well that's okay. I don't know a lot of people who are going to celebrate Christmas anymore. At least you won't have to worry about getting sick or losing your loved ones.
That sounds nice. I'm glad you were able to take a break. You should be feeling better soon.
That's really great! I love when travel makes you feel like you are actually on a vacation.
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully it works out for you.
That was very nice of him. I hope your future boss is trustworthy.
Oh my, did they wake up?!
Oh, those are my favorite kinds of dogs, they always have such a sweet and loving relationship with you. How sweet!
How does that make you feel
It's a long and hard path to walk, but I'm confident that when I get through that hump up you'll be able to appreciate what a great companion I am.
Wow that is awesome, it is sentimental
Wow that's amazing! You must be a great friend to him.
I know that feeling, Mine took the day yesterday, and i was having the same feeling
That's good to hear.
How did it end?
That is really not cool. I would have lost my temper and hit him on the nose with a sledgehammer if I had been in your position.
Oh, was he better when you got there?
that is ok, i think we all feel that way for our parents, even if they do bad things we do good things for our own peace of mind
Yikes! Waiting is a real pain. What's the longest you've ever waited?
I have tried both methods and nothing seems to help. I hope you don't end up spending lots of money on a time machine.
They deserve a loyal dog who is loyal to begin with!
That's great! I bet he means the world to you.
Oh no! I bet she's in so much pain. I hope she pulls through.
188 is the new low lol. Well I hope she is okay now.
That's awful. Are you alright?
Did the other two people get hurt?
I'm so sorry. How old was your dog?
I am sorry to hear that. My husband has that problem too. Big loss for sure
I am sorry to hear that. Why are you alone?
Everybody likes a good conversation though.
Oh, that's a cool car! What color is it?
I know the feeling, I am ninety eight and still want one.
Its OK! You are not the only one! Vous êtes les bons temps donnés!
too bad but glad they have internet to take them anywhere
Oh no! Have you tried the refried beans? They are delicious.
Oh that's not too bad then. I hope you can find the original tanning bed.
You must have been so embarrassed. I am glad you are not that anymore!
Dang, I would have been nervous too. Did you get out and talk to anyone?
It's great to have someone who cares for you, I'm glad you have a brother like that.
What things do you enjoy most about your birthday
Wow where is it coming from? I would be so scared.
I totally understand. I can kinda understand how you feel then.
That is a great surprise! Have you ever been in a car?
I love Ford sedans! I have a viper and a volkswagen hehe.
Oh no, what happened?
Wow that is so annoying, so you probably dont talk to them much anymore.
That's terrible, how often do pranks happen?
you should punish them then
What movie did you see?
I have been there, I hate that. It is SO scary!
thats important to you
Oh really? I had no idea. I hope you are able to visit again soon.
Oh really? Do you know why she is doing it?
Oh, that is interesting. How is that working out for you at least?
aw no what movie?
i hate when people get excited over things like that. purges were always so terrifying
Oh I love the beach! I love being able to go anywhere and just relax all by myself. Two weeks is a long time to be away.
It's always nice to have a good day! Hopefully there will be more rain chances next time.
Nice! Where are you going?
Ah, so you guys went your separate ways? That's cool, sometimes you have to make those choices. Is there something in the way couples are structured?
Eww! What did you end up gobbling up?
Hated what?
That's amazing! I remember when that was news.
I'm so happy for you!
Uh oh. I would be mad too. Can we expect next time?
Yea, seems he has a future Secretary of State in him.
Oh man, I'm sure you will do fine! Are you prepared?
That's really good. You must have really prepared yourself.
Yeah, mine and your parents must be the worst people in the world.
i would talk to the police
Oh no! What was the reason?
You might want to consider setting up a new position.
Yes, but i have another job that keeps me busy.
I sure don't! I just want to be in school, not in a different one!
I am so sorry to hear that! It seems almost impossible to overcome the loss of a father, I am so sorry.
Awww well that's better than I would have done the same thing but I'm sure you have learned a lot in the meantime! I'm sure your very proud of him for saying that.
Really? That's insane. Did you go on your friends booze and did it feel good?
Ooh, that's pretty neat. What was it?
I am sorry, I think I know how you feel. I am sorry. have you talked to her about it?
Yeah I would have too. Your friend is always right behind you so you don't even have to think about it. It's not fun but it happens and most people will just talk themselves to sleep which is their friend's problem not yours
Oh no, that's terrible. I hate it when people are just look deceptive and careless with others' lives like that.
That's not very bad I bet. A cabbie should always be trustworthy.
I can imagine! Why did you decide to go back?
I can imagine! Enjoy the peace and enjoy the weekend!
oh yea i can understand that
Move along, all that time to laugh at the dumb thing you did.
Oh no! I am so sorry about that, how did it end up?
I feel you. I wish we could go another day.
Yeah but that is a different story.
Thats a good idea
Does your mom not like that?
How come? What was the flavor of the other one?
Hey that's good! You're not the only one that's had a bad week! I've been through that too last weekend when my son was born. You'll get through it!
well i really wish you the best of luck and hope it comes together!
Oh wow! You must be so proud of her!
I'm sure she will be fine
That sounds so wonderful. You should be so happy.
Congrats! It's hard to lose a betta fan.
That's very lucky! Hopefully our photos give our family and friends a good look at what we went through!
That sounds so fun! I hope you get to do something fun with them soon!
Oh noooo...I hate being in the sun! I'm sorry you're having problems. I hope it's only a matter of time before your paycheck starts coming in. Hope it's only a matter of time before your paycheck starts coming in.
Are you a fan of horses? I the flying kind!
That is awesome. I bet your are excited to be far away from your family and friends.
Exactly. job security is important.
\
Yea it's a tough, physical sport but so much fun. Sounds like you have a great story!
Oh no! What happened to you?
that's so sweet of him, it's fantastic when a spouse can do that for you
That's awesome! What made it great?
oh what kind of job do you like?
Oh dear. Is she getting into trouble?
That's fantastic! I love it when kids are so engaged and interested in the material that they can do so much from being able to craft their very own items!
Texas is not a great state when it rains!
That's so true. I hope you find peace with that.
Awwe that is so wonderful! It is so nice to have a peaceful life these days.
If it doesn't sound like tonight baby, I guess you are still hoping for a good night's rest.
how much did you eat?
I guess so, but persistence will pay off!
Oh no! Is it a day job you have now?
Therou? Nicht so he is unreasonable he made me late for a meeting.
I have never been to the beach, and it scares me. I've heard it's really fun though.
I love traveling. Did you take lots of pictures?
What kind of dog is it?
That's kind of cute. I bet she means so much to you
Ah that can be tough. Did you have any fun times together?
10 years is a long time to wait though!
Really? How so?
It's so refreshing to see someone that genuine and forthright about their play. They are so exciting to watch.
I am sorry you are going through this
I hope it goes well for you.
I'm so sorry to hear about your father. You must be very close to him.
Im glad, its always good to see the good in people even if we dont like them.
Haha, that's great that you can stay so active despite your being in the workforce! I wish I had your lifestyle!
I know what you mean. One day we will look like our moms and dads from when they were alive.
Well that's terrible! Did you complain to mail office?
Oh no! That's not safe at all!
Oh my, I bet that was a pleasant surprise! Did you introduce it to your cat?
Oh that's ok I guess. It's still a little weird I guess
haha well that's great!
Yeah they are so small but they are having such a big time!
Yes disappointingly true. I wish i could turn those things around quickly though.
Dang, that's frustrating! I wish there's a way for me to report a ticket issue! Hopefully they can't take the blame for the rain!
oh no. that is unfortunate
That's too bad. I guess they don't live in a closet like us.
on my way to work?
I'm glad you're ok. That sounds frightening!
I'm sorry, I guess you had to study really hard to get accepted.
That's a little bit weird though - but I guess sometimes it's good to remember the past!
Oh, well that sounds interesting, I hope it's something urgent you're waiting on.
That's good. It sounds like it was a lot of work, but at least you got it done.
no, no! but I hope that you live a long life
Oh no! Well it happens to the best of us.
I have never gone, but my friend did a while back. It was really good!
Well she was a good girl. I can understand how you might feel jealous.
Yeah, things always seem to go as planned in movies.
OOoh I feel for you, sounds like you really miss your buddy.
How old is the tumor?
That is so terrible. I am so sorry for your loss.
Same here. I used to love the first one especially.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I love dressing up as my favorite characters to get into the mood for the show.
That's actually super romantic. Did you two have a good time?
That sounds like a great date! Did you do anything wild?
There's places you can go to really drink in a social setting. You don't have to go to a bar to cool you down.
How old is your father? It's nice to have something he gifted you
All is well. When will you find out?
I understand, we all have to cut our losses and let nature take its course.
Thats sad. exes mess up us psyches.
Yeah, pretty much. I wouldn't take any more shortcuts.
I think you may have been scared because it is so far away?
Really? That sounds quite interesting. What is the name of the music festival?
oh damn i can see that now.. what ended up happening
ugh, that's terrible news. How are you feeling now?
At least you have changed your number. I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can at least see each other next time.
I was always afraid of haunted houses. I believe I was younger.
That is weird, but also good you are happy as long as you have fun.
I know the feeling, I am sister and we all snore!
Yes it is no good. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. If only it was someone else's fault.
Oh that's pretty amazing. I bet you were very excited about that.
Well, that's the dream come true for a lot of kids. A chance to try new things.
BAY SHOWER! Are you pregnant?
Congratulations! Is this your first?
Oh exciting! Where are you headed?
universal studio, that's awesome, I really wish I could go
i am so sorry to hear that. were you able to see or hear her?
That's too bad. Maybe you can find an ice cream parlor that specializes in flavored ones. That way you won't feel as bad about not finding her. ice cream is one of those things that really hits at the right time
hahaha did you study really hard?
That's great. I anticipate good test results for you.
oh well does she keep in touch?
oh wow I hope you can see them soon!
that's great! you sound very content with your life.
oh wait.. what is that?
That's great news. What kind of job was it?
That's great, how did you do?
thats no good at all
Table tennis is a game of skill. If one player can handle it, it's no problem for the other ones to not be able to play. If they can't handle it, it's a game of skill.
That happens sometimes. Maybe you should ask your professors and see how they feel about it?
I hope you can continue to climb the career ladder as you see fit!
I honestly hope they do and things get better for you.
Dang! Hopefully the baby gets a great teacher, friend, or aunt!
That's awesome. What did she major in?
You must be a good parent to raise a child who exceeds your expectations!
I feel almost the same way. I don't like feeling lonely.
you shouldn't be sleeping rough then a stranger's feet.
Is that how it's been referred to in the military?
Well it was fun to see her laughing and tickling your little face.
Oh that's great! How old is he?
I'm happy for you. I'm sure your husband will be proud of your new addition!
Wow, you are lucky to have such parents! Not so much anymore, I'm sure.
Will you still be able to do it?
That must have been exciting!
Do they live far away from you?
That is great. It is so relaxing to be independent.
It is indeed hard. But do you think you will make it?
Ah I'm sorry to heard that! What happened?
Oh, well that's a good way to start
Well, truth be told, I have never had a car problem myself.
Well that's good. It sure sounds like it works!
Congratulations! Boy or girl?
That's great! I'm proud of you!
Wow, that's impressive! How long were you staying at a hotel for?
Oh, that does sound hard! Well I hope you get to go again soon!
oh no. was she able to block you?
Oh boy, that's not right.
Wow, that's wonderful. It must be a happy time for you and your family
That's great! I hope you have fun!
That sounds like so much fun! I bet you're having a blast!
Oh man! I'd love to go on a floating vacation with my family. I'm jealous.
Oh no, I have a dog and she loves to bowl me while I am eating dinner. I know how you feel.
thats so sad
wow, that is shocking, are you okay?
Roomate must have been furious and didn't know what to do.
Wow, that must have been horrible. Are you thinking about going back and buying a new room?
Oh no! I am glad you are home with me now. Communal cleaning is good for you and others! I am glad you are healthy now and not in a hospital!
Wow! That is fantastic! I have two kids myself. I have so many photos on my computer of my kids. I am so excited to see them grow up!
How far are you willing to go for that?
That's incredibly awful. I can't imagine what that must have caused you.
Awe. I wish i didn't have a job yet. But then I don't have many friends anyway.
What are you going to do with the class?
wow, she sounds amazing. what instrument do you play?
Oh my goodness! How long were you in there for?
Oh my goodness! I would if I were you!
Well, I'm glad that you have something to look forward to. I'm sure it will be a source of joy for you and for your family.
Are you referring to the one near you or across the country?
ah that was ok
Oh no! That's terrible, what did you do?
Oh wow. Well then I for one am impressed! You guys must be a very obedient bunch.
I'm sure if you really studied it, you could come up with something!
who is having this problem for?
It seems like you don't have much else going on in your life. What are you focusing on instead?
Sounds like a great time, how come you're feeling happy today, personally I'm feeling content but on the flip hand, anything is possible for any reason.
I'm sure it will be fun. I've never had a campfire dinner at all.
Yeah, higher education is expensive.
What did you end up getting?
That is terrible. Did you offer to resign if they offered you a job?
Ah. Well that makes sense. Sometimes interviewers are looking for certain traits and sometimes to get a "read" on someone. I find a lot of people are justasses and don't know how to craft a good interview. interview with confidence
I have been there, I can imagine what it is like. did you do anything to put yourself on edge?
Yeah, they're on fire all the time and it's usually from arson.
Oh no! What happened next?
How embarrassing! I would much rather have someone talk with my ear then your mouth. lol
That is great! I am sure it will be tax free and be a nice bonus.
That must be very hard on you. You must be lonely.
You're a smart girl! I bet your family will too. :)
Yea in a way it is! I feel like I should be doing more like you, more akin to a mom then a guy.
I hope you were able to recover.
Yeah, I know how you feel. I love those moments when you see the best in others.
Congratulations! That's a great accomplishment!
now that is a positive thing
That's fair, that can be pretty infuriating. Did you file a complaint?
That's no fun. I bet it was a lot worse if you were a manager.
Do you ever hear any kind of commments?
It's even better when it doesn't come easily. I wish I could be accepted into a club like that!
Aww, I love to swim. I need to catch up!
That sounds so nice! I love swimming.
That's awesome! I'm sure she misses you.
That's great! It sounds like it's her who's getting better, not you.
That is good. Why are you grateful to your family?
Got any in particular in particular?
That's great that they wanted to have a party for you. That's the best birthday ever.
I am glad you got some sleep
Oh no! That's terrible! Are you OK?
my mom used to always use my brother as a makeshift ladder when we were young. now we have our own separate roof
Amazing! You must be proud of her!
I am sure she appreciates you being able to do what you do, too.
I was sad also when I saw them go. I guess they did the best thing They could with the money.
It is nice to have such a caring sister. Are you two close?
I would say tell him to keep it in reserve for a rainy day!
I'm sorry to hear that. Stewing alone doesn't sound like a very good living.
That's disgusting. Is your food next of kin insured?
I am sorry they did that but I bet it was worth it in the end.
did you have fun?
Did you like the food?
What did he do if you don't mind me asking?
sometimes it's hard to listen to people but once you admit it's wrong it's easier to change your ways. I hope your son is doing better.
i am the same way
I took the LSAT and it was taken before I knew how to spell. I took all the AP history at college and they don't even bother with that.
Oh I'm sorry. Can you talk to her about it?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it starts to look better for you.
Do you enjoy watching horror movies now?
Well, hopefully you are able to put on a good show for the crowd!
I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass?
Oh no, hope it starts moving again soon.
I'm sorry that happens. Do you have any friends or family that can help?
It was a very kind thing to do.
Wow, so you're not a big fan of the beach?
Yeah, those things can be so devastating especially if you aren't careful.
I am sorry you have to deal with that. How are you?
You can tell your mom?
That's always great when family is involved! Are you celebrating with them this weekend?
It is. I have found that doing the breathing post also helps.
That must have been a great surprise.
That is really great. I am happy for you
There is usually not much you can do.
Have you ever flown in it?
Why is that?
Well you could always go to a teachers office and plead your case.
Why did he do that?
I am sure it will all work out.
That's terrible, what do you do in the middle of the night?
I am sorry that happened to you but I am glad you understood their pain.
I get stressed out when my co-workers trust other people. Are they doing it out of fear?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan to get better?
That's awesome! Do you feel like you are prepared?
Woohoo! That's exciting! I hope everything works out for you!
They should not do that! It is not necessary or safe.
It definitely does. I finally found a man tonight I could bed!
That's great, he must've worked really hard.
You will! Mgt.
I would though but i can't know enough about biology to do thi
That's incredible!
That is my favorite kind of birthday party.
score! I hope your luck continues, you deserve one.
I would be excited if I were you! I have a mazza and it is amazing. I have one and love it!
That's horrible. How did it take?
... I'm sorry, that's a very tough situation. If you need someone to talk it out, I hope you find someone quickly. I'm sure your husband has a lot of really good friends in his community. I hope he's able to be a good father
Ah, that's a good point, I think we all know she's just trying to earn some extra money. Doesn't take very long to learn that, especially if you work hard!
I've never had cream cheese. How was it different this time?
Wow! I am really not a fan of Cabot either. They seem to go for the easy way out over thinking things like that. I hope you guys pull out all the stops with this one!
Haha, that's funny. The people you deal with can be considered your family.
I know this is a tough time for you as well, But rest in Power, He will be in your prayers again Soon
oh yea its nice there is not any one like us left.
Thats a bummer. Maybe you can reschedule.
That's a bit terrifying. I hope everything works out for you.
That's unfortunate. If you're not seeing them, that's a bit strange. Have you tried meeting in person?
unfortunately we are all human,some of us busy ourselves with other people,not us.
That sounds so fun! I love swimming.
Thats good. I am glad it wasn't too bad for your work flow
Me too. Not a good thing. Can you imagine a world in which you have to be afraid to travel? Ugh!
Yes. It's always better when we work together.
Sorry to hear that. I recently lost my grandmother to lung cancer. I know how much his love meant to us.
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's hard to see loved ones who have made mistakes and haven't been able to be with them. How are you doing?
oh im sorry to hear that
Uh oh, did they forget you were away?
You think it's very nice?
No, I saw them in concert a couple years ago. They are a beautiful band.
Wow, they deliver what? You trust them?
You did what you had to do. No beating yourself up about it. Just move on and be happy you got a new home and were able to make the choice you made.
aww, that's nice. Did your kids have fun?
I am sure you will be able to cheer on your team again someday!
Was it a vacation?
Oh wow! That sounds like an amazing trip, but I don't think I've ever been to Virginia Beach!
Awww man, the kids of the beach are born! How old are your kids?
Wow... that's quite a large sum of money. Did you play your ticket?
did you buy anything before the end?
What did he do?
I'll bet. As long as you can crawl, you got this.
oh that sounds like fun i bet!
of course. you're a good friend
That's unfortunate, hopefully you can persuade them to split the bill.
I don't know if I could or would ever do that.
Oh, I see. Well, I guess they will have to start next week with a bang. Can we expect a lawsuit then?
I'm sure you are, thanks for that! What is your favorite Friday tradition?
Wehr had that when he was in 4th grade
That's not a good feeling. Why do you feel that way?
Is he dead?
Try that! I think you will like it!
dang thats quite a radical idea. i hope it works for you
Oh no that sounds terrible. My first tornado was scary too when a comet came through during the night. I know the feeling well seeing things happen in the night sky. Was your reaction pretty raw?It's terrifying to watch those kind of things happen. But it's even scarier when you have the patience to prepare. Was your reaction to seeing that happen was anything likelihood, or something completely
inventory is full and we don't have room for more :(
Was it a expensive one?
How wonderful! Well, I am sure you will be able to replace him.
I love the holidays, too!
she probably still has some of it. you never know until you try
That's so sweet of her. Is she a beautiful woman?
It is so nice to have a friend like that!
I'm sorry to hear that. I've been there when I was younger.
Oh wow, so sorry about that. At least your daughter is very young and can grasp the concepts! It'll be great to have a time where she can say, "You were the first one I've ever laid eyes on"
Oh wow! I'm sure you were excited about that! How old are you both?
What type of work do you do
That is a very nice gesture by him. It is something that a lot of people would do.
Thank you for that so much to think about that
Did she?
I bet. Trust is the backbone of any relationship.
Aww dang, that must have been scary! Did you go out and check what it was?
That's really scary, I'm glad it was an unexpected shadow and not your actual one!
That sounds relaxing!
Then it sounds like you have a really great girlfriend!
I am so sorry to hear that! Heart Failure is such a painful condition!
I am sure he is glad that you are okay. It's nice to know people do still care.
That's his right as long as you weren't married! hahaha. That's very mature of you.
oh dang that is kind of sad
That sounds very interesting, what is lupus?
i am sorry about that! All i can do is be myself and try to figure it out! i hope it works for you!
That is terrible, that is why I always have a second job.
I say just let it go and see where it takes you. You have to spread the word!
Wow, that's so sad. I hope it wasn't something cruel.
Awwwww, I love animals! I have one that's been dying for a couple of years now. I still love her very much
That's wonderful! What will you do with the winnings?
oh, i would be as well
That's quite generous of you. Will your friend be able to help repay you?
What happened?
Oh no, that's terrible! Are you ok?
Oh no! Well, I am sorry you feel that way. I am glad that your friend came out ok.
Now you see where I'm going with this. A little self care at such a young age can make all the difference.
What happened?
I could imagine. I bet some people really enjoy doing that kind of damage.
Oh I get that, but I try to avoid the big cities where I can see things people don't see in my town, I guess.
shoot a couple of frames and let me know how it goes
oh my lord, you must be so proud of her
Wow. You are kind of jealous.
hard work pays of
Okay. that is great. I hope you do well.
Oh I love hockey! What kind of team did you support?
If you ever do go that would be amazing and nostalgic. You could play all the way through Toy Story and still have time to catch up!
Oh yeah, that happens to all dogs
I cant imagine what would happen that small dog would be hurt
I'm sorry to hear that. I know your pain so well.
It can be hard to be angry at yourself sometimes. I know it must be very hard.
is he gone for a few weeks? or is the quiet everything going on?
I always try to hide in my closet when I'm feeling creepy.
oh that's great! good for you guys
wow thats great
Awesome, I bet she is excited about that. I am the same way, I get so many mixed signals when it comes to the next stage in a pregnancy. I am happy for her though
Woah, that's a bad feeling. It happens to the best of us.
Oh no, you shouldn't let them into your life! That's pretty hardcore, lol.
How tiresome! Where you going, and what were you doing?
I carry a pepper spray
That's a very sad thing, I am sorry. :( I forgot the name of the father, I think.
It's good. I liked some of the previews online. Hope you enjoy it!
Oh yea...I've been thinking I want to do that when I'm older. It will be fun
Thats amazing. Kids grow up so fast. It's defenitly what I would do for sleep.
Oh, well good luck! Are you going to keep an open house to see what the new place is like?
Oh, I see! I am happy for him! You must be excited about it!
Oh, how are you feeling about it?
I can imagine that. It is nice to be able to do something that is fun for them
oh its good to see someone with cancer. how is is going?
oh damn, i would have been furious, they are supposed to be very good
I bet you were livid. How did you handle it?
awww that is so sweet. I love animals, I hope you perfected your handling of him.
oh no, did you get to sleep that night?
It's always tough being in a situation like that. I hope it was an isolated incident.
oh god!! first one yet? i hope it goes well
Nature really does prevail over us all, I think.
Really? That sounds like what I would enjoy the most! Do you go to spooky parades or just the fairgrounds?
That must have been pretty entertaining!
Oh no! I can only imagine how devastating that is! Are you OK?
That is great that they were always ready for you.
That is crazy how far we got
Old Chevys are great, do you like them?
Oh yeah? How exciting. It's always nice to meet the next door neighbor.
effort and passion paid off
Did you like it? I did not understand much of it.
Yeah I've seen a lot of gore but I'm not a fan of blood!
Do you feel kind of nostalgic about it? I know I do.
Old people are amazing. I wish I could meet them like that.
I would really like to get back to doing those. I have broken off many friends in the last few years but I still get to spend time with them
thanks
That's very nice of him! How long have you known him?
That is scary! I would be mad, too. Did he follow you and if so, how did he do that?
You must be very proud of her.
I can imagine that is a very desirable car.
How exciting! Where to?
That's a lot of fun, how fast will you be traveling?
What country are you in?
That sounds awesome! What are you going to do there?
Oh nice. I am white, so I do not have that great of a history... but I have a friend that is from Europe and it is his first time there!
Awww man! Are you gonna date him?
Are you gonna get counseling?
That's so sad, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you miss your dad?
Aww, I'm sorry. What a great lost dog you have! I hope you can grieve during and after your visit to him.
wow that is pretty awesome! are you going to give me money?
Well that's good. I wish you the best of luck!
how wonderful you both must have worked so hard for so long!
That is very cool, what was the award for?
oh. that makes sense.
Thats a strange thing to do! Did you tell her?
That is not fair! That must be so difficult. I hope you both can communicate more closely and that she doesn't take it too far!
Aww that was so sweet of you to do. I hope he got what he wanted.
I agree. These days, it's hard to imagine that my little brother was a child when he was. I'm glad he's grown up and is a grown man.
Oh no! That sounds scary! Did you hurt yourself big time?
Sometimes that happens, but I always back off now and then to show them that I am more important.
That's so awesome. So I saved 40 bucks last year. Thanks to both of you.
That's great.
Oh no, that sounds terrible. Are you okay?
i bet it was! you deserved it.
Aww, that's a bummer! Maybe you can find a therapist to talk to about it!
No, it isn't. I think the main difference is that I want my dogs to be around me, you want your kids to be around you.
I know how that feels. I have 3 kids myself, and honestly, I can relate to that.
Did you all move in houses together?
The new assimilation test takes a long time to make. I hope you did well.
it's okay, you will do better next time
Did you all have a blast?
That sounds really good!
I'm sorry you were feeling guilty. Was it a good lie?
oh thats ok, we all do stupid stuff at younger then
Wow. You are so generous. I hope you enjoy your vacation
I have been there 4 or 5 years. It will wear you out but it is beautiful the way it is
Wow that is amazing! How much was it?
Oh wow, that's not bad then!
That's incredibly frustrating. Have you tried calling their phone number?
You should! They are not hard to train up for, it just takes some time
Oh, no! That is awful. Is your insurance going to be able to cover what was done to your car?
I can understand that. What happened next?
thats amazing, what did he do to your dog?
im sorry, all animals are best so hopefully you will have another dog
How are they going?
I am not. Have you tried telling them?
Was it a new puppy?
Oh no! That's terrible. What type of vase did you receive?
oh no. is she going to take responsibility?
Yes it is! I always say kids do not understand that they make mistakes until they have been in a car for a while.
Oh wow I would be upset too. Did your daughter give you a reason why she was upset?
That is unfortunately very difficult to deal with. I hope everything turns out well for him.
I have seen it, is it good?
Yes, he can do that too, you just have to be patient
That's terrible, did you have fun shopping there?
I certainly will have to check that out. My daughter is going to be a woman.
That's terrible. Did you make it up to her?
Well hopefully it'll be better when it's older. With stress and stuff it's easy to get lost in your emotions. Hopefully you can let it settle and carry you through.
That is nice. A little trust is always nice.
Yeah you shouldn't even try
I agree. But be sure to not let it get to that point!
I have tried that and it gets annoying.
Wow! That's so beautiful. What are you going to do?
I'm jealous! Have fun!
Yeah, the holidays bring up a lot of memories. My favorite part about the holidays is getting to spend time with friends and family.
Or we could all go watch Netflix
I hope it's not serious, I hate bad storms in my area.
I am sorry, that sounds scary!
I will be checking it out on Monday! Maps, upgrades, stratagems...it's all there.
Sounds like a good game. What is your favorite character?
Congrats! That's great!
That's awesome, congratulations!
That is a great idea. I like to keep everything handy.
That is very annoying, you should not have to deal with that anymore!
Oh no! What will you do?
I would do that, its nice and warm out these days
that is great! i bet you are proud
That's so true!
a little spiderman?
You should talk to her a lot because you promised
That's a good plan. You guys should end up meeting in a place called Glass House. It's a job fair for new graduates.
That is a lot of numbers
What did he get?
yeah little things at times
Aw how cute. I bet she's an amazing person too.
awww. I hate watching horrible movies. That was soooooo old.
huh?
Ok, that is sad. But, I am sure they are trying their best
Yeah - sometimes pets go so fast. I'm sure she's in good hands in time.
oh i hate to hear that, are you okay?
I don't blame you. I have had to. Loud houses are a thing of the past.
I don't blame you. The way things are right now, the country is totally run amok.
i am sorry, i know, i have been in that situation as well
that sucks
Well I hope you two can see each other again soon?
Ouch, are you sure it wasn't an accident?
That's so kind of you! I'm sure he will appreciate that.
sorry to hear that
I bet you were so proud of her!
yea i feel like that too
Is there anything else you would like to say to them?
Oh! What did you do with it?
Oh, well that's no good... hopefully they will contact you with compensation.
Run!
Oh my goodness! I think you might be in for a surprise!
Oh, I failed the English I took last year, I know that by heart. You should feel confident in the English.
As you should, to graduate you will need to study harder!
You must be nervous. What will you be saying?
I understand that completely
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that!
great weekneden, I hope you have a great weekend.
That's wonderful. We're lucky to have each other.
It's important! Honest love is the best!
That's terrifying, so many people have evacuated before?
haha. thats a great feeling.
That is really frustrating. Did you get charged extra?
ya, that is true but it is convenient to have those places available to you, that is why i travel alot
Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself.
You definitley have great teachers, much appreciated
I used to fish when I was younger, but it was way easier when I was a kid. I love doing the flips and cork in the water.
Great, how many children do you have? Mine is 3, so I'm only prone to having babies
That must have been embarrassing. Were you able to recover by the time you got to go home?
Neither did I. I'm sorry.
Ah! Did the car start up again?
The first one was my favorite, thanks for the info.
Oh nice. I never start, lol
its a nice color
Oh no, what happened?
Don't people just drive away!? Did they at least cry out in pain?
Oh how exciting. I am sure you have a lot of proud memories of him.
yes all the hard work pays off buddy
- Did they have any idea who the culprit was?
Wow, you must be lonely. I can understand that. Did anything good happen?
Oh my, I hope you are ok? That is a crazy thing to do
sorry to hear that!
That's always a blessing when you have reliable transportation. It's good to know that you're not alone.
That's unfortunate. At least you will have a roof over your head now!
What did you do?
Did you call the police?
That's great! I hope you have a good trip!
I agree, it feels good to have all the knowledge and tools you need to take care of yourself.
That is crazy. I always thought rock and roll was all about the guitars.
Yes, that can sometimes be a little jarring. Was the set not meant to be?
wow that's amazing! i can not wait to learn to play this game!
I've never bowled and would be interested, maybe go to a local store and see if they have a spin and try it out.
No way, that's the worst.
Yeah, we talked to them after they had gone for at least 5-10mins. they need a lot of nurturing
Great. What are you going to do with the money?
I hope it is, for my work we have a ay y No way.
I wish you the best of luck!
Sounds like you have a great husband and a great wife!
that's awesome! what are you studying?
you got this workerplacements are coming again soon and lots of good ones too
That's great, it must be quite unaffordable for your friend.
That's quite an amazing feat! I'd love to be in that position.
Oh no! I hope it didn't hurt too bad!
That is impressive, i would be so scared if i encountered such a thing.
That's got to be frustrating. Does he have fun with it?
Of course, that is very important. When did this happen?
That's awesome! I had a new car too when I went into work and loved it! Not just a car though, these shoes are very stylish.
im sure, theres nothing like true freedom
Yeah I love hits. I like the classic tunes like "You'll be alright" and "You'll be in love".
Oh cool I imagined it was fun. That sounds like a good time!
That is so scary! Is he okay?
I am sure they will pass the tests they have. They have been through enough before
That is great. I have a neighbor with a ton, and I consider my floor about as quiet as a drum. It's a great feeling to have new neighbors!
That is awesome, peace and relaxation are the best for all!
How frustrating! I bet you felt terrible about it.
I am sure it was not a good feeling. I bet your date felt bad too.
I hope you all have a good time. Family reunions are the best.
i hope they make an effort to meet more often
That is great, how did you do it?
indeed it does and it feels great
That's awesome to hear! I bet all that hard work will pay off.
That's great to hear! I start Crossfit this coming weekend. I've been trying to get in for a couple months and never really achieved success. What's different this time?
Aw, that's so cool! I really wish I had a favorite toy or appliance. Maybe a gaming computer would be cool!
I bet that is a lot of fun! I would be a ball of nerves, even though I play videogames.
What if the noise was coming from the wrong place?
I see :) I hope they don't go back to that on a Saturday
It's just part of life, getting older. You just don't know when it's right to come out and say something or when it's not. It's been going on for so long that I don't know how it's possible to go into, but hey, maybe something good could come of it!
Or you could just not listen to them at all and be ok. I'm sure that'll work out!
Did you try to go to go home?
Well that's funny and terrifying at the same time. I hope you ARE clean now though lol
oh wow that sounds exciting! are you going to go to them?
I am sure they will be great parents.
How is it now?
I'm sure that is a hard thing to deal with
That is great, do you feel like that is a good thing or that you could have gotten a better deal?
Yes, I know how you feel. I had to buy a second pair last year.
Did you get scared?!
Haha! That must have been hilarious! I bet you were so happy!
oh wow! that's a bold move!
I'm sure you can do it! Keep your head up! If it's not too bad, I hope you can get it under control.
Wow, they must be so jealous of your success!
Have a nice day, I am sure they will appreciate you too!
Craigslist is a scary place, I have had phone calls where people were wanting to kill you.
that is a bummer, hopefully you can find time together to make your own memories, you both deserve to miss time together.
That sounds very exciting. What will you be doing in the forest?
I have heard that traffic is not so good in this city. Maybe try going to one of the waterfront parks?
OH no. What did you do?
Dang. Do you know who did it?
Sounds like a pretty good life. I'm happy to hear that.
I know that feeling. I still have some in my family.
pattern making! I really need to get a sawing machine, because it's so easy. There is nothing like having a 4 by 6 inch blanket that you can cut out patterns on.
That is my goal too
I arranged a trip to Cali a few years ago and it went amazingly well. But, the summers there is not my favorite.
Oh, yes. I wish I had a good friend who could take my place.
That's something I think about often.
Yes, I always remind myself to be thankful for the little things in life.
Aw, you must be so happy for your dog.
I have a few dogs. I love them, but they can get a little crazy when they don't have their owners around.
college?
Yea. I mean, it is over now doesn't mean it makes or breaks anyone. And I love holidays like it's the start of fall lol
I think people think that because everybody around you is doing well, that means you have no problem letting everybody do well.
Everyone does it. It's just an introverted feeling.
I totally know what you mean. I just hate the idea of giving up on a semester that you've invested so much in. Get everything you can while you still can, because when that's all, you won't need it as much.
I am sure you will. Part-time jobs are not for everyone.
Congrats, you must feel like an uncle to him.
Those are swell cars, would you recommend them?
That's awesome. What kind of car?
good deal. i am happy for you. stay safe
That is a horrible situation. What happened?
Did you call the police?
Oh no, how old is he or she?
That will be lovely, you will miss them a lot
Are you happy? What made you feel that way?
Oh lol. Well I really hope you continue to progress
That must have felt good! It was calming while you were in the middle of it
I just love Dragon tongue beans. I can't believe people still eat them!
That's very palatable. I'm guessing you have a certain demographic that enjoys the sight of beans?
I love organic! I have never found anything GMO. What else do you need to know?
What did he do?
That's funny, I guess snakes can be frighten scary!
That's great that he showed confidence in you and your abilities!
for what?
Thats sad, i was aware of him before and totally miss him now
Every dollar spent should be put towards something good.
I am sure you mean parapsychology. I was wondering if you could give me a call to talk about it. I have a psychic friend who can help me with my issues.
Oh I see, you had some good talks with her. btwn talking to her you have to keep your weight in check b/c of being unable to see her.
That's nice! I'm glad you had the opportunity to see her.
Wow that's shocking that he actually won that...utchy.
That is the best kind of drunken fun, the ones where you have a belly full of beer and can barely keep yourself going
OK, I have to go to 6th grade and they have no teacher at all.
I agree. Kids nowadays grow up so fast. It's crazy how they can do things we thought were impossible just a few years ago.
You must have been embarrassed when you went through that. What did he do after an earthquake?
I am sure you are! I hope all goes well with your new found happiness!
That's amazing! How old is he?
Wow! That's impressive! Good for him. It's never too late to get a degree or job!
I bet it was a nice surprise!
Yeah, here we are almost a year later, and same thing happens. She's still the same, age, same effort as when she started.
That's amazing! What did you do with it?
that is a really scary thing to have to deal with
Aww, that's terrible, sorry to hear that. Long time friends are hard to come by
That's great. Good for her.
I've never tried it, but my husband has and he said it's "the best thing he's watched in a long time"!
Hulu is a great option if you can get it! What's your fav show?
Uh oh. What kind of cat?
well i hope it wasn't!
I hear your concern. I remember in the old days the stories were the same - the hearth was ablaze. How could you in your right mind lose all your family in a wildfire?
How did he die?
That's so nice of them. Was it a surprise?
i bet it was i bet your are so lucky!
oh wow i am happy for you
I'm sure the official order won't change for a while. We should just keep packing our bags and going our separate ways, I guess.
I hear you. I'm always make fun of the way some people treat animals. It's not nice
To which I would respond with "Well sometimes people are really evil". Maybe you should try giving the guy a call and see what he thinks.
Ah, those are the good ones. Those are the ones you really enjoy.
That is wonderful that you are so fond of the old days. It is always wonderful to look back and reminisce.
Oh my gosh, I have friends like that! It's crazy they can't live without it. Do you spend a lot on eating out?
That's a lot of money! My husband spent about the same amount a couple of months ago
Are you going to Kansas?
I went on my first camping trip to Colorado in March and loved it! It's much easier to spend time out in the outdoors for the first time.
Well that's good preparation! It's scary when you do nothing!
That's good to hear. I hope your health improves!
That's wonderful. Are they happy about it?
Your family sounds wonderful. It's always nice to have some fun and enjoy family time.
That is a very exciting thing to do. Is she sick all the time?
That probaby sucks, I hope she gets better
Sorry to hear that. I have lost many family members over the years. Are you and your family around at the end of the hall?
i'm so sorry to hear about you, i had a similar experiencerain about my moms daughter when she was little and it was so beautiful as well
That's great that you had extra stuff to last you a long time.
That's really good. Everyone would like to get away and be alone.
oh haha. I do that as well. its so much fun
You will get through it, don't feel down. you are doing everything you can think of to make it through
That's great to hear. I recently got married, to a cool co-worker,same, but it's always the first thing people think of when they think of a happy marriage. Be sure to cherish every single moment with him, no matter what!
in your old age?
How was the song?
Ricky Martin? That's pretty amazing. I was looking at his music art when I was a kid. It's pretty cool.
We're in our senior year, yeah. Did you do well?
I am sure you did great! I would be so pumped about it if you got the job anyway.
Oh yeah I have a bit of a passion for golf in America. It used to be pretty popular there but not as much. So much fun!
What champ is he playing in?
Nice! I'm sure you are both very proud of your loved ones!
Skydiving is amazing! I actually took a job as a "skydiver's instructor" in Scotland. It's amazing how you can get experience like that and make friends just by skydiving!
I live in Florida.
Some people are always on the winning side of things. That's great! But, sometimes you have to win on your own terms, and that's ok!
oh how fun! its always good to have friends you can count on
Oh no. Did you end up going?
Yeah, those things are a bit of a relief. But yeah, its a relief to have a place like that!
That is terrible news.
Wow, that's gross, did it spread to others?
And thats what makes it fun - you can just be free to be and be outside - you are in the moment.
Do you love him?
Congratulations! What do you want to study?
At the very least it gives you a reason to keep coming back even if you don't feel like it. I want to work at a tire company someday.
That's awesome! I bet you're excited about that.
very good
oh its nice to see her again, sounds like you really miss her.
I can sense that tidbit of information making you feel peace. I'm glad you're not worried she'll let you know when she's home.
oh no! that's a terrible thing to have happen. burn at home please.
I would imagine so. I would hate that my friend.
Oh, no! I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Yeah, I can understand that. I don't like bad food, and I definitely don't like bad service.
Were you able to save any of it?
*sigh* It happens though, it is normal for teenagers to be embarrassed and ashamed at times. I hope nobody else knows about it and you can clean it up for next time
How does that make you feel?
Keep that positive attitude! There is a summer for everyone!
i can imagine how you were feeling. were you able to recover by yourself?
haha, you're right. I was actually in a city with lots of available apartments and I just could not afford it either. Well, friend safe drove across too - safe and I are going to stay with you.
I know what you mean. Renting is a pretty expensive thing. I paid $1/hr for my first apartment and since moved to a place $3/hr up. Gas is another thing.
Vancouver, Canada. It's crazy the different types of life you can get from outside the country - deserts, volcanoes, nature!"
IRA, I am sure you will be fine. How far are you heading?
It was probably worth it for you. Sometimes you just need a break.
How did she get sick?
Sounds like it. Sometimes when I go to a new restaurant I forget to bring enough money for my taxi.
Oh yeah for sure! I didn't get a chance to go to school much because my job went to such someone else, but I know some people who are really busy and sacrifice for their kids
i would have been upset as well, my father also worked all summer as well as i did
That can be very scary. I hope the surgery goes well.
what does she have going on?
More than anything, just hate losing so much! More so than anything else.
I agree, I get that. I would be extremely frustrated as well.
Oh yeah? What's going on?
Wow that's awesome. Congratulations! Are you going with your family?
That's terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you lost all your pets?
I lost my grand mom last year and it was just such a shock. It's so hard to lose a loved pet.
Is your dog Lab? I see that you have such a sweetheart.
What was wrong?
Oh that does sound rough. Sorry you had to go through that.
Well that's good news. What will you do then?
Were you guys able to find a similar house a little closer to home?
I am sure they will understand
That's a wonderful place to be. I hope to visit with my family soon.
That's awesome! Wish you lots of luck with your wedding!
Me too! Do you know what makes them so scary?
I was also scared, but I have since gotten over it.
Wow, you must have been surprised. Did you ask her for her birthday money back?
Oh man, you should make sure you put some stickers on the way to work next time.
I know! I like them squirrel sitting but they are too cute when they are playing.
I see, your son is pretty amazing.
Oh no, that's painful. Are you okay?
Well she will know better than to do that again
I bet that was a surprise and not something you expected.
Yea, that is pretty terrible. Their customer service is terrible.
Oh no! That is a terrible predicament to be in! I'm sorry to hear that. Did you ask him why he was done eating the whole loaf, and what did he say?
oh man theres only one kind of bread to dip in soup, that's awful.
Why is that?
That's nice, what did you receive?
Oh no, I'm so sorry - is there any possibility to adopt the dog again?
That is so sad. I am glad he is long gone.
I just got a new cat. Her name is Oreo.
They do. We need more people like you in the world.
What does your husband usually do to make it scary?
Nic! He's seriously doing that, he must be a chocoholic!
How come?
Wow, he really is a talented kid!
Holy cow, that's amazing! I bet you feel so accomplished when you smash that.
That's a good thing to keep you fresh.
Maybe you should go with them next time instead of making a new friend!
Hello all,
I love mines! I always wanted to go there but could never make it in the right place at the right time. So much to see and do. Are you coming back again?
Well it's good to hear someone is still here. Chills probably run like high as 23 stories right up to if you don't have any type of safety devices.
Oh no, what happened? Are you okay now?
Interesting, I like the jonwayne music too. What is it blasting?
no has it ever occurred to you? if it has you may be able to avoid it in the future
I am so sorry that happened to you! That is so scary!
That's no good, how did she die?
Oh that's so sad. How long has it been since she has been able to spend time with you? It's hard to lose someone so dear to you
did you raise a fuss?
They sound like a really good trust, and you should continue to have it!
No, I haven't. But yes, it is always so painful.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know what it's like to have to deal with something like that and it's so unfortunate. I hope you're able to get through it and that you're OK.
Yes, I did when I was about 14 months. I had so much fun with him/
The poo should be gone for good now, but you can always clean it up!
sounds like a good idea
Oh no! I'm sorry! What was it?
thats what i do, i would have left a note too
wow this is a good friend
I am sorry to hear that, I know how you feel. If you have family help them out as much as they can.
Oh god! I hate it when that happens! Is it going to be fixed?
That's so kind of her!
That sounds very fulfilling.
What? Are you kidding me? That's insane. Where was the high level travel advisory issued from?
That's great, nothing beats a good adventure.
Did you find out who stole it?
Oh no! That is a nightmare! Did you go on vacation?
Wow, you're no fun, sorry to hear that! Will you be able to reschedule with someone you trust?
What instrument was it?
Holy moly, that would make me cry! Such a sad and courageous thing to do.
Oh no, what happened?
Oh no! No way! It's one of my worst fears! I feel sick for people who have to deal with that every day.
That's ridiculous. What a child!
Same here. Kids can be really annoying.
Oh wow. How did it go?
That's great, hopefully it last a long time.
That's a sight to wake up to! I bet you were embarrassed!
I would be really upset. I would have told someone and gotten into big trouble.
Oh wow! What did it actually have in it?
Wow, that's trashy even for them!
That's nice. Did you study hard?
Congratulations on the test! If you're good then you should Pass!
yes i know that feeling
It's part of being human! I guess I have never heard the term before.
Oh really? That's a great idea! How's she doing so far?
That's fantastic. I'm sure she'll do great.
I love Christmas! Are you going to be getting lots of gifts?
yeah it is!
That's pretty awful, I would recommend going again though. Maybe get a spare machine for another time
oh god, thats so bad. You better go over and fix that, or risk the ridicule and even death threats.
Wow that's bad. Sometimes you just need a little bit of terror to let you know what's out there.
That's a good idea. And make sure you don't end up in the laundry room!
What was the person's first name?
I hope you do. I am sure you will.
I'm sure it'll be fine. Do you have any family nearby?
I sure hope that you do alright, it would be bad if you gave up! Just out of the water.
My boyfriend has a cat. It wakes me up every morning at night too. Is that a pet?
That makes no sense! Maybe he's never seen a puppy before?
Congratulations! That takes some serious dedication. How did you do?
I hope you do well anyway! What are you studying?
harmonising sounds really nice but at the end of the day, everyone makes mistakes.
Section away?!? That's pretty funny.
That is very good, you must be very lonely.
thats unfortunate but good for you that you were able to come up with a plan on your own
oh no, are you going to meet someone else?
You will have to be patient. Have you had issues with her before?
Did you like it? I am not a ring fan.
Do you know what's wrong)
thats awful! hopefully it did not ruin your day.
I am glad to hear you are alright
Cashiers are always nice people
I understand that. I hope you didn't get in trouble.
Oh my. Did you help him?
May I ask what the items were?
I'll get on that. The internet is amazing these days, I recommend it to everyone.
I'm sorry you had to go through that!
That sounds like a good habit to have.
Is it a little expensive than just taking a taxi?
It can be a rough life sometimes. How do you think it went?
That sounds so fun, it's been a while since I've had the time for something like that.
The loud noises probably hurt your feelings.
The best way is to just be and let other people let you be. i'm sure they love and care about you the most about it.
I really hate when that happens and I bet it will happen again. I had a similar experience at a couple places I was going to. Did you make a beeline for the bank you wanted to go to?
That has happened to me before. They had a teller's mistake and actually put my card in the wrong envelope!
Oh sweet! What a unique and fun addition to your friendship! What a good friend you have, this machine is truly special.
oh thats sweet
I am sorry to hear that. Do you have gum or is it not in your mouth?
ugh, I think I have had that happen before, have you? I hope it's nothing too serious!
I'm no stranger to camping. What actor were you going to see?
That makes sense. It was a one way ticket to heaven! How lucky you must be to have that guy at the front of the line!
Oh no, she didn't trip on you?
That's very kind of you, netflix is the best drug of all time. You brave soul.
I hope it was worth the surprise.
ah yea i can see that
How much can you lift?
Yeah, that must've been terrifying.
I know, it seems like all the busywork and worrying gets to you!
investigations and innocence day etc
That's amazing! Did you pick your favorite numero uno?
oh cool. then you should
That's interesting! What was the play about? I heard it can be scary when people swim into a pool.
That sounds so fun! My daughter and I will watch it all together in the future.
That sounds wonderful! What kind of puppy did you get?
Nice! What kind of dog is she?
awww that is nice. how did you enjoy it?
I used to think of that all the time when I was a kid.
What kind of puppy did you get?
Aww, that's sweet. I love German Shepherds! They are the best.
Wow, did you get the tiara back
There's only one king, and he's a fat old goose
Oh gross! Did you clean it up?
Gee, that's lucky. I guess I'm supposed to crush it now, huh?
That's scary! What were you feeling?
That is terrible. I hate it when people don't study!
Oh, that is a tough one to be honest. What happened?
I'm sorry. I'd say you deserved it if you asked for it.
oh wow that is weird, what was it smell like?
Oh goodness, I wonder how it got in
Oh no! That is so scary! Did you get hurt?
I'm glad you're okay and safe. Sounds like you surprised someone by coming to the light.
Oh wow, I bet it will be a great success. Do you have all the written material ready?
I didn't think about that at all. I guess it's like Fable Legends...I always end up playing the ending lucky rabbit lol
liners = dun dun
Yikes, did you get bailed out eventually?
math is tough
I wish I had studied sooner! Sometimes it feels like you know the answers but that's no fun. Maybe you can do it later this semester or next semester.
Oh that sounds lovely! I bet that brings back a lot of memories.
cornrows are pretty classy.
I haven't been to a baseball game in a long time, have you?
I'm actually a big fan of the Rockies myself.
What did you find?
She's been through a lot. I'm sure she'll come around.
Was he suspended? Did the insurance cover the damage to your car?
That's good. I'm glad your son is okay.
That's great, I always wanted a smooth ride vehicle
Oh, does he have any showrooms?
I'm sure you did well.
That's awesome. You must have a great teacher to encourage your continued study.
Oh, yeah. Did you do well?
It is ok. Most people are just worried about their job and not about the people around them.
That sucks. I wonder how you will remember that?
I never leave my house unguarded even when I'm out for a walk!
Yes, I sometimes feel like there is still some soul in the world.
That is amazing, I have never given anyone a ticket to a concert
What did she do to make you proud?
That is awesome! I wonder how long she will be in those for before she decides to break out in a show.
There's always next time! One day you'll smash through the barrier, buddy.
That's certainly doable. Cancel your ticket and fly out separately!
That's great! What are the clubs you're participating in?
Ah, so you will be working under an adviser this time. That's good news. I am sure you will do well!
That sounds very frustrating. Where do you haul it?
oh no, i would be upset, is your city municipality?
What was this?
Wow that's scary! I hope they threw in the towel now or will try again.
what do you think is going to happen?
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's awful to lose someone like that, and I hope they're doing well now.
Aw, man. That's sweet. It's funny how the wedding can ruin anyone's day. Maybe take your time and think it over before commenting. Sometimes it's better to be vulnerable in those situations, in case the moment doesn't work out.
Hey, don't take it out on him. It's his wife who passed out the money!
It's tough. A lot of people are still growing up. I grew up in a small town and had my parents help me when I was starting out. I can relate.
Well you must have a strong willed ability to stay calm under pressure!
Me too, I love to play Mario Kart! What game did you play?
That's a good way to look at it. It's nice to get emotional, sometimes it's necessary.
What state do you live in?
That sounds wonderful, I'll try to get to one.
i know that feeling, its theest comedy ever
I would probably do the same. I don't give anyone a reason not to pay me.
I'm glad you're not alone there. I had a similar experience years ago when I was working in a bistro. What did you do in the kitchen?
It's so great that you remember people like that! They tend to be overlooked sometimes.
That was very thoughtful. Did you feel nervous at all?
That's great. It's nice to know that people are still out there for those that are close to us.
Nice! Are they grown up now?
I love giving back to the community. Some of the best things we do is give food to the hungry and medicines to the sick. It is a great feeling to be a part of the community.
where is she going?
awww that's so frustrating, how did she manage to get work experience in go1
Did you need to go first?
I bet you're very thankful to him!
OH! I would have been so annoyed!
I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Try to negotiate if you can.
Oh no, did you find any kids aged 13 or 14?
Yeah, sounds like he's a good kid.
Amazing! What kind of job?
Sounds like a lot of different things than just camping. You may get him a job as long as you're faithful.
Yes! I love coffee! What type?
That's good getting some soup in with you. What's been going on in your life?
That does sound stressful. I would have told them before you even started work.
Yeah, at least you got some cool prizes at least.
That's great! But how on earth did they afford it all?
I can too - I want to travel the world but with my kids in the car!
Will you be able to drive to Raleigh?
That's exciting! I hope she has a good time
Aww! You're lucky to have a friend like that.
They just kept saying never mind the interview, they want to know whether or not you got them a job.
That's a great attitude. How far along did they get before giving up?
Did you love her there?
I would hate to spend even more time with them. I wish you all the best.
i know the feeling, i have felt that before too
Oh wow, impressive! A lab is so cool, you are going to love it
Well maybe you can keep the old one so you can gift your brother something nice!
Well if he is that good a kid, there's no way he's not passing the golden door by!
that must be hard, especially because you used to be able to talk to her?
You'll enjoy spending time with her again.
Was it a big wasp?
I would also lock the rest of the family and pets in too! Hopefully he will give it to you in time
i do too, they eat through everything
Did you go out in general? I haven't really been out in years.
Oh wow! I'm glad she was kind enough to lend you a friend. I'm sure you will both be ok!
No, I don't think so. I think it's more a feeling of peace and contentment. They seem like they're always worried, but I think it's more to do with your kids.
That sounds so exciting! By the way, what kind of skydive?
yes, i fingerpicked a bunch from my childhood, i hope you will enjoy it as much as i do
that is not good! maybe next time huh?
bugs indeed
Oh, no. I was just talking about that on the phone with my friend, he's one of the best guys you could ever meet.
Just be strong and do it! You'll be great when you're older!
Did you have fun?
I'm glad you have an easy going girlfriend who makes you feel at ease.
I agree. I don't have a cell phone but I understand.
were you able to block the video?
I'm so sorry to hear that, it's always tough to lose a pet.
Aww, that's terrible. I'm so sorry. I can only imagine the emotional stress that must be like for her.
I think you got a little emotional there. I understand how you feel.
I love the beach! I'm glad they took a day trip.
That will be nice
Whats it like? Sounds like a nightmare.
How cool! two months away from us would make or break the relationship in a blink of an eye! I bet you're proud of her!
I hope you can still stay busy while the dogs are gone!
I'm sure it is! I'm so excited!
That is so scary! I hate bugs too. What do you do about them?
That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish you all the success in life!
That's really impressive, I might need to look you up later.
I am sorry to hear that, you must have worked really hard to get here
-eric
I have never been to India. I am sure you will have a lot of fun.
Wow, that's quick! Where are you going?
Wow! What did you do?
Did you end up having to have them fixed?
I can imagine there must be a lot of fear and anxiety that goes along with that.
That sounds like a good idea. Especially if you don't mind having them at work during the day.
oh man that sounds abit degrading!
Oh, I dare say that. I've gone the whole day without eating once! lol
Closed indefinitely? That sounds troubling.
Just make sure you don't go crazy if you don't want to see any ghosts!
What happened to him? Did he move away?
I hope you two have a good time!
He's going to have a blast in the sun.
Yeah, time does fly really quickly!
That's exciting! Was it you?
usually when my kids are happy, its as if they have just won the lottery
Yuck! Nothing says clean in the ear better than a poop by a dog.
Yeah, it is a pretty common hobby for kids. they really enjoy it
That's a great accomplishment! How does the excitement feel now that you are officially engaged to him?
You will be so happy for him that's faithful people like you deserve to be.
Oh no! Did you have to clean it up?
well, i hope you can get it all away from her, and make it not an issue in the long run!
That sounds great! Did you go?
I don't even know what to say about that. Did you sue?
it must have been embarrassing, how did you handle it?
Well yousound like a good person then
Ton it seems like? I certainly have not used that much.
I'm happy for you. You deserve the big present.
That is heartbreaking, I am sorry for your loss.
It's really no problem I guess. At least now you know the drill you wouldn't go back to them again maybe
Oh no! Did he ever get a refund?
yeah that would have been so cool and fun
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that can be to go through that.
Yes, it can be upsetting and difficult to share a painful experience with someone, but it's even more painful when that person will never hear or understand. I'm so glad you have good memories of her!
That is so sad. Did you take her to safety?
yep i am glad someone came and got her
im sorry to hear that. is it a long distance relationship?
That's great! Standing always creams the best so itchy skin. I bet that psoriasis will pass pretty fast!
I'd like to do it one day, but I'd probably stay in a cockpit jet.
That's awesome! Is it mandatory to do that?
That sounds great! What kind is it?
Oh that's a lot to watch! What movies are you enjoying the most?
oh no what did you do?
Oh no! I bet that was so scary. Are you ok?
Don't be afraid to talk about your strengths, your weaknesses, and how you'll overcome them. I guarantee you'll come across as confident and prepared.
Sounds like you're on the right path. What will you be doing?
That'sawhatchee! What kind of memories did it bring up?
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully it's just a phase.
oh thats cool
Wow that must have been a surprise.
That's awesome! I hope he has a good life.
Oh no! Ebay is notorious for its insanely high prices, so I am sure you were able to find a similar one on other sites. What was your plan when you decided to return the dress?
That's a smart move. You can get a great deal on another item of clothing in the stores.
that is a no no! i dont like chocolate too weak
What a bums. You shouldn't ever take anyone for granted.
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope he gets better!
Oh, that might help out!
That sounds like a winning team. Was it a winning dance team?
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about 8 years now. Maybe if I just hit rock bottom for a while, I could meet some new friends.
i love golf too! why are you so psyched about it?
I do love watching soccer, but it is pretty lagutous in the adult world at this point
Oh no! My daughter would call any parent a name. That's very unfortunate. How did you react?
Yeah, I didn't know bear cubies are bad. Mama bears sometimes are.
complete with a snood! What did you do with them?
Oh no! Well, my advice would be not to mess with wild birds!
Yes, I know, it is sad
Oh no. I hate bullies, especially the type that call you names.
Oh no. What was it?
Yeah, that's crazy. Well, I'm glad you're not afraid anymore!
Right, you should definitely lend it back to him. But be careful, he might not be up to par!
thats good of you
Oh wow, what did you do?
That's got to make you so happy. That's amazing.
It's definitely creepy. Have you ever used it?
That is scary! There has to be something illegal about something that big
Sometimes you just have to remind yourself that they are people too, not a perfect machine.
wow i would accost them about that everywhere if i were you. thats strange.
Yeah it is. I had to get a new dog last year. It was his favorite.
Oh, I'm glad everything came back normal! Hope your kid will be okay!
I am so sorry to hear that. I am sure he is alright now, I hope!
Did you take them on vacation?
Wow, you must have vomited a few times.
They usually have the money to fix it so you should be happy about that!
what kind of kit did you buy?
Oh my, I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you will make it though!
ok
You've done wonderful, you must feel really proud of yourself.
I've never been on a coasters. That sounds fun! Who's coasters have you gone with?
Probably, but I'm sure there was something worse that could have happened...being on a plane half your age makes you apprehensive
Denver and snowboard! Never been there though, is it in Colorado?
Can you go camping or something?
Yes, I lost my cat a few years ago. I really regret it but also really glad I got another pet.
It's a difficult thing to go through. I wish you all the best with your new dog!
how many days do you think you will fail??
I had the same experience when I was younger.
Oh No!! But now she is 14 and totally gobsmacked she doesn't know any different.
Oh, wow, that's exciting. I would be as well.
I bet you were stressed. The weather in NH is terrible. It is so bad.
I can understand that
Was it at the movies? I've never seen it.
Oh no! I am glad you are okay. I hate those trains!
Have you found one that works for you?
Oh yeah I've had my policy cut back recently. It's very expensive.
Oh gross. I guess you could say that's a feat!
you'll know when its time to get stricter and more watch out for it
Oh no. What happened?
Being stressed makes things really hard to deal with. Being stressed is not a good thing.
That sounds terrible! What happened to your dog?
That's so true! My dog is dog mostly, but he can be an avid hunter sometimes.
Oh no that's terrible! Did you try to contact him?
That is rough. I texted her over and over, ever since we started school.
If people were nicer to you, you wouldn't have been getting coffee. What kind of drink was it?
I will bet you're a very nice person to do that for!
Ooh, that's exciting! I'm sure you are anxious to experience that for yourself.
That is awesome. I am glad you are able to support him like you did.
That's sad! I bet you will find another place soon though
It's funny, but I DIke I've heard that many things can happen when you eat rabbit fur.
i know the feeling, it is the worst when you are on the edge of your seat and have to push through it
Don't sweat it, everyone burns themselves at least once! I'm sure it's no big deal!
Did you get sick?
That does sound terrifying!
Oh no! I love dogs, is she in trouble?
That is so annoying! I hate when that happens
Oh wow, how fun! What kind of pizza was it?
won't you be doing a lot of work?
that is nice. what did you spend it on?
That really is good news. You must feel really relieved.
that sounds amazing, it's great when it works out well, i hope you are always happy
That's wonderful! I hope you do well
Sorry to hear that. I always loved dogs
Yeah that is true, kids always annoy everyone and tear things up.
Oh wow, I would hate having to get a new card.
That's no good. Do you have any luck getting them to pay in?
That's amazing! Where does she work?
Well she would be well compensated if she is an accountant then. Good to hear she sees you appreciate her.
Wow. At least you should be proud of her.
That makes sense. That's what started the whole incident.
That's wonderful. I think when they are young they don't understand the importance of school.
Oh. I can only imagine. My parents are the oldest of the three sisters, and they sound like they're having a hard time being there for their brother. I wish you the best, and support going forward!
yeah I agree. grow up fast!
What's your favorite skill he's learned so far?
I would be like that too. I am still pretty overwhelmed by new releases.
Ah, yes. I remember being up early and it being a lot of fun. I havent had that in forever
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that, I know what you are going through!
That is terrible, you must have taken a lot of practice tests.
He must be very productive.
That's a smart move on your part. I'm glad she doesn't need your help with anything.
Yeah, filters are one of those things that you can get for free if you have an auto parts store have a look!
I am sorry! I wish I can fix it fast!
That's how many cups of coffee I had this morning! Did you have coffee too?
Oh I didn't know that. I was going to ask the bearded dragon expert if that was true. Thank god it wasn't too old for them haha.
Thats a good sign! did you have a well deserved vacation?
You seem like a quite nice person. I might be inclined to try and get a job working there because of that.
That's great, how long were you asleep in?
That's the greatest feeling in the world!
That's no good! Did you get better after?
Yeah, that drink really weakms up me. I feel you!
How in the world did she give you permission to do that? You're lucky to have a friend like that!
Lactose is one of those minerals that when you don't understand, it can be really bad for your health. I see a lot of people who are really ill from not getting it right the first time. I'm sure you are more than thankful that she didn't mistake it for anything and that you got to spend time with her.
That's crazy!
Do you think she will be a good mom? Maybe you can talk to her about that.
Good luck, I'm sure you will get through it!
That's pretty funny! Have you done that a lot?
I'm glad you managed to subdue it! It'll be glad to hear it didn't take too much of your anger to subdue.
Just be yourself and you will do fine. Just take your time and don't beat yourself up when you don't do well.
I am sure you will get it. With that GPA you can do it.
I imagine that was a hurtful thing to have to do and realize was out there.
Well, yes and no. It is hard to get through that emotion. But you have to let it go. Are you still friends?
Yes, they should still be driven like professionals.
I could have hurt myself worse, did you hurt your car?
Absolutely! I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
If he is that young you better sit him down and teach him well!
No no! You should get your camera and get some stills!
I'm so sorry! I hope it doesn't happen again.
You are so talented your sister must be very proud.
That is pretty impressive. I would think that at her young age, she would already be drawing amazing art.
ala we found a common ground when we were in our 20's and it was supernect with each other
I'm so happy for you! You will have a great life with her!
cancer is very bad, unfortunately. mine is pretty normal, not cancer.
I would be so worried and stressed about this, i doubt you will ever be able to beat stage one. I'm so sorry.
Oh that's pretty spooky. Whatled scared you?
Wow, that stinks. I bet you were a mess!
I am so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that can be!
Oh I've heard that before, I am glad that it's working out for him!
that doesnt even begin to describe what is going through your head
It's tough! I hope you decide soon!
I used to play Madden when I was a kid.
I have wanted to play that since I was a kid.
Good luck. Was it for a stable paying job?
you're resilient ya will make it
Oh, man! That's awesome! Type 2 diabetes is a horrible disease. I know exactly how you feel because I've had to deal with it myself.
It's okay, you were supposed to be going to college and now you can live the dream.
Thats about average for me. I never want to go alone
That sounds like fun!
Oh, did he mean to? That would have been rude.
Pretty decent as long as he doesn't eat it.
I dont watch youtube I go online sometimes.
Oh. to be specific. What's wrong about the midterms?
Oh wow I bet you were ashamed of yourself!
Well, I would like to think that it is just the nerves of the battle.
No! that's horrible. How did they do it?
I would ask her to forgive you, but she may feel bad for a time. But you can ask to marry you both.
Right. I'm sorry you're having a tough time. Is he a good friend?
Well that's thoughtful of you. It's nice to know family can still put up with things like that. It's a great tradition to have.
I am sure he did great. Was it a difficult class?
I'm glad you've got something to work with it.
Yes! I didn't know it was possible to have a dog that can speak!
lp, philosophy seems apatered to him
Ah! I see. Well, I am only human and did things that I probably shouldn't have lol
Thats true. I served in the military for 12 years and know the true meaning of challenge.
that is awesome, i would have just lay there and uhh.. forgot about it?
That's good to hear. asthma can be a very difficult disease to deal with.
Aww, that's sweet. Did you guys get to do anything fun together?
Aww, I'm sorry you don't have any more time with her.
Did she come in while you were at work?
Well that's very nice of you. There is always a way to resolve disagreements, whether it's by telling the truth or by appealing to emotional ties that are not based on reason. I'm glad you took the stand!
That's awesome! You must be so proud of him!
Tropical Strawberry is one of the best drugs I have ever seen
That's really frustrating to hear. Have you talked to HR about it?
I agree dang. I try to be respectful even when I don't agree with someone but I'm not always perfect. What were his reasons for not approving it?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you alright?
It happens even if you approach it with positivity, it will come back in kind.
how did it happen?
What are you planning to do now?
Oh I love pies! Do you have a recipe?
I love apple pie!
Nice. These days, most people just cut their hair and go back to basics!
I agree with that. You can't live with the people around you. You better start looking for something new.
I love camping! Did you use a fire pit?
sleep is a healer.
It's storming outside!? I'm so sorry you were feeling weatherbeaten! I'm sure it was very lonely. Was the storm severe?
Ouch, I wonder how it almost started will it be worth it?
I don't blame you. The whole place is scary, the food is terrible, the water is filthy.
anyone be a bit political?
That's horrible! Did you try to call your starbucks employee?
That's good! It's a good feeling no one has ever taken it from you!
I know. My situation is no better. I make minimum wage doing online ads in places like CarMax.
What do you plan to do about it?
Where did she go? I'm sorry to hear that.
Play on what?
Do you have a hard time staying healthy?
Oh oh, I hope you feel better tomorrow! Maybe after a run or something?
I don't know what you mean by duck and cover. I've never owned a school desk.
I was thinking about that. They have desks everywhere. You can buy one anywhere
I'm sure you will do well. Is it a marketing or sales job?
I know what you mean, I've been in the same place. I'm so sorry.
Really? What are you so happy about?
That's awesome. I'm in a same-same situation now but I swear I didn't have the courage to ask for the lavatory at first, but now I'm the same! Glad you made it through unharmed!
That is impressive. How old is she
Oh, no, I've always wanted a kid. Congratulations on that!
Can you tell your neighbors? What's new?
Ugh I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Have you considered moving to another city?
Oh I bet. What prompted that? Might be best to just throw everything in a bag and move on.
That sounds amazing! It's been a lot of work but it's been amazing!
Yes, I miss my childhood as well. At least I have memories of it.
Yeah, there's always that nagging doubt that maybe things aren't going right, when all in all it's probably just a phase. That's hard to swallow. Maybe things will be better in the end.
i know that feeling, time flies and all
There's a lot you can do. Is there somewhere you can go that they can't go?
Wow! What a nice guy. You are lucky to have a person like that.
Oh, no! That's so nice of him! Deliveries are really nice. Do you mind him being disabled?
You miss her too, dangit! My nintendo was always playing Mario games.
I hope she has a good life, and you have a good life.
i love reading as well
Music is always a nice way to unwind. Both help me feel relaxed.
Wow! I bet you were very angry about that!
That does sound terrible! I felt like I needed to flee the place when I was younger!
Moving back to your parents place was once a fun activity for all of us. It was a time to go away and make new memories. Unfortunately, we have moved so many times it becomes a chore. I hope you can make new memories at least.
What is it about where you live, that can make you so hard on your feet?
Sounds like you have a good partner. It's a lot easier said than done, but it's something you want to do. How old is he?
awww. mewtwo is such a great movie. i loved the first one too.
Wow, that's a very strange thing to happen. Why did they do that to you?
That is pretty funny! You are lucky you are not deaf!
They are just like us - our community living conditions not meeting basic survival needs. Too many people on the street takes away from the overall good will we all have for one another.
That's very nice of you. I usually end up joining the charity as well.
Wow! How!
thats awesome! i hope you have fun
haha. good luck!
oh no thats a sad thing
I can feel your pain I used to play football like crazy.
Oh no! I am sorry that happened. Did you have them on the rug when it happened?
it ok, it was an accident
Yeah, but did you?
That's not too bad. I wish I won one of those things.
I love sausages. What kind of sausage did you try?
That's a shame. I always have trouble with the new credit card designs.
A lot of my friends have done and I totally understand. That's why I went when I did.
I can imagine, that must be very hard.
That's awesome! It's always nice to visit a new country. Have you been often?
oh boy
That is great! Not too many people get to go that far.
I went to Colgate University for a degree in Social Work.
That sounds like a lot of fun! The weather should be perfect.
i hate when that happens, how did the sandwich land in there?
Wow! That must have made you angry!
i bet you are, i was wondering if you could buy a campervan and let me know how i could help you
That's nice. What kind of campsite did you join?
Cool cool, what game will you be playing?
What is your favorite game to play?
Yeah, that's a good thing. You always feel like you accomplished something when you look back at your day.
oh wow! that is a long time, glad you are enjoying it
That's great! Did you have trouble with the steps?
That is too bad, but it is good to know walkers are very useful and have saved many lives.
That's terrible. How long ago did you buy the land?
That sounds very scary, but I am sure the person can't really blame you for being scared.
How much would you like to get for your ebay bid?
Oh wow! What is it about?
was it fast charging?
oh no, well I'm glad it wasn't really, you should try to find it again!
Yeah, it's pretty cool to watch people change the world with technology.
I agree, only way I've found to get them to work is to have a really good relationship with my phone.
Oh wow! What was it made of?
I'm glad you enjoyed it. I know it wasn't the most beautiful dish, but I bet you deserved a second helping.
That's a good thing. Why?
Its a little slow sometimes but sometimes with those new apps you can miss some calls
Was it The Shining?
Was it your favorite movie?
I'm so envious of you! Do you like traveling?
I'll bet that is a plus for having to drive so far!
That's pretty gross. I'd definitely get a spray bottle of dish cleaner. Or a can of dish washers.
Yeah, that can happen to the best of us. Maybe the fridge was dirty, too?
I feel the same way! I assume they never bathe?
thats really cool
Me too, that's why I don't drive while under the influence.
I agree. I get furious everytime a homeless person or person in the remotest parts of the world is care of a large corporation like McDonalds.
oh no, that's a terrible thing
I know, I've been in that boat myself.
Was it a little expensive?
Yeah it seems worth it to save so much money. dont worry!
That sounds wonderful. I love food from home. What is your favorite Indian food?
That sounds great! I wish I had a food memory like that!
You must be feeling pretty confident.
I wish you have fun!
I've heard a lot of that. It sounds like a scary movie.
I can imagine how frustrating that must have been. I'm glad you're ok.
it would be really annoying if someone did that to you
Oh wow. I would think they would at least try to make it right! I guess they don't have anyone above them. Haha
I agree. Life is never as you planned, but you still need to take control of the situation.
will you be able to catch it on tv?
I hope so too! Too bad the late 90s hits were phased out.
Awesome! I'm so happy for you, congrats!
That will be nice. I'm sure you will have fun.
Oh ok. Maybe i should move to a new home.
Oh, that is terrifying! I would have died!
I would feel the same way, golf is one of my favorite past time
Sounds like fun! Hope you have fun!
Sounds like a scary movie, but I bet it's really good in the end
That is amazing! I cannot wait to have a new computer!
They always seem to have better computers so you won't be disappointed anytime soon!
I haven't had a delivery like that in a while, I hope you don't have to pay anything money.
That's about the only thing it does for you!
yeah me too sad
Ah. You don't like the main character?
how old is he? counting to ten sounds pretty old
Yeah, it's crazy the amount of times i've needed to call in sick to do something in the past, only to get an A because he didn't have the patience.
Did you have a picnic?
Oh no! How is the toe now?
Oh wow! I bet you were a little surprised! Did you react to it?
I would be too. I don't like prank wars.
Yikes! I've never seen that before. What was it?
Oh no! Did you get rid of it?
That's awesome! Did you get a lot of travel involved? Did you get lost a lot?
Oh, those countries are beautiful! I visited them over a few years ago. I do like Spain though.
wow that's great! I love kids but I think thats the sign of a strong family
Yeah, I guess such a big life event is a "wow" for someone.
It really is a random element.
Nice! Did you enjoy it?
Oh yes, the alpine pools are beautiful! I'm so jealous.
Oh no! How did that happen?
Oh gosh, that's a shame. In fairness it's not like you didn't mean to or something. It's still just a car. A car hits you pretty hard.
im sorry to hear that.. i know what that is like, i lost my sweet seas name to cancer a few years ago, :(
i know but it will pass soon
That is great. Is there any reason you haven't been able to get it checked out yet?
I'm so sorry. I hope you get well
Moving in a new area can definitely be fun. Do you have a new job?
i bet that will be great! i hear it makes a big impression
I agree. That is a huge issue and I think the media won't talk about it.
Right, I'm sure they'll be over soon enough like yesterday.
Is there anything out there for you?
Thats sad, but nice to know an animal makes you so happy.
That's terrible. You must have played a long time.
That's cool! Collectibles are a lot of fun to look at!
thats a bummer why did they not allow you to board
That's too bad. Maybe you can bring a pet bowl and blanket?
That's awesome, I hope you get it?
It is always good when luck will fall in place.
How much are those?
Mustangs are pretty nice! What brand are you getting?
People need to move and stop bringing guns here.
But what about the animals?
Oh, that sounds lovely. I love nature. What were some of the stars you looked at?
That must have made you feel like you had lost your mind.
Oh you must have been so happy! Did you get a good time with them
I hope you get to talk to them and keep in touch!
How are they looking?
That is no good at all. Did you try to buy a new pair?
uh oh! I don't know what you are talking about. where did you find this out?
Sounds like a lot of stuff. I'm ready for you to start :)
You should be ready
hopefully you will be fine, its happened to before
oh man must've been really hungry.
That's good. You must have been very careful.
That is really cool. I actually took the SAT Advances last year and did the B and C alphabet. So cool if you ask me.
Well, you nailed it! Well played!
That is very interesting. I am afraid to look at that kind of pictures
Oh man! I'm so sorry to hear that. If I was in your position, I would try to work out and take care of your pets, just in case!
oh that's so awful! were they able to get your shopping back
I'm sorry, did they just not leave anything for it to detect?
That's so sad. Is he okay though?
Oh yes I can imagine it to be. I'm glad you're ok, it could have been a lot worse.
That's incredible, I wonder if he ate protein?
It must have been impressive, I can only imagine the work they had to put in to accomplish such a huge physique.
such a great concept, what did you see?
Magnificent! You are such a lucky guy.
Oh my! That is so scary! What did you do?
Wow, that would have scared me for sure. I am glad you are okay though.
That is so funny! I don't blame you, that pile of laundry must have smelled amazing!
That is indeed it I suppose. I doubt it would help much in the long run anyway.
aww that is so sad. Did you cry?
Cats are so much fun. My cats are over 70 and still going strong.
How old were you when you started to listen to songs so often?
Those emo songs are always so enjoyable to listen to. I bet you really enjoyed them as a kid!
Were you able to find out what it was?
Oh, I'm sorry! I assume you pet owner is responsible for the animal care?
I am so sorry to hear that. How did you get it back?
That would suck. I hope it heals well.
You should definitely go and check it out, you never know what could be waiting for you there.
Sounds delicious. What for?
That's awesome! I wish I had a boss like that!
That's great! I hope you enjoy it!
Come prepared with a solid plan for success.
That's gotta be pretty infuriating. Have you tried talking to your co-workers about it?
That must be annoying.
Have you ever talked to a therapist about it?
Oh my, is she going to be ok?
Oh no. I bet she felt bad about breathing fire that bad.
So sorry to hear that. I hope everything works out for good.
That sounds wonderful! Where are you going?
Oh yeah! Highschool ended and became a stripper pole. Highschool was so fun!
That is so nice. I love fixing my plates too. What a good roommate that you have!
Sure, What will you do when you get home after this surprise visit?
Oh no, I hate bad storms. Do you mean rain?
global warming i hope it doesnt happen anymore, it was a good thing that you had some food
Oh that's bad. I hope he's okay.
What were you doing after you finished eating?
Mmm, I love cheese. What is your favorite kind of cheese?
I have never tried it, but I've heard it's good.
Oh that sounds thoughtful. What are you going for?
Look for his name in drafts!
That sounds fustrating. Are you working to get him fixed?
Our dog got along great with other dogs, so we thought our cat would too. What happened next?
Happiness comes easily to me, that's for sure! What were you able to accomplish during the promotion?
I think you should try to keep a low profile and just be the face you want to be, even if that means you get yelled at!
Whoop Whoop! That sounds like fun!
Mine started back in November and so far he is loving it. He rides bikes all the time and football watches too. I had to teach him to skateboard because he would get in trouble for it.
What a beautiful moment! What cat do you have?
Cat videos are the best. They give you unconditional love.
You must have been so excited about it! You must be so happy about it.
That's great, it'll make the memories that much sweeter.
That's wonderful! Congrats! It's not often you get a proposal like that.
That's just the best. How long have you had him?
Well that's awful! What are you going to do if he does?
That's bad news. What division is he in?
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I love cats, Panda was a special cat
Yeah, and I'm sorry you had to go through that. Maybe, with some therapy, you can find it in you to try and move forward.
I did not know she was so talented. I am proud of her.
That sounds so cool!
oh my sorry to hear that... what happened
I'm so sorry you had to go that far.
That is so gross!
That sounds horrible
oh no! i've all been cat alone so my family has been going through a messy situation where my dogs have used my belongings like a pea to eat the cat poop and it's been hilarious watching!
Well, I'm sure it was easily divisible in your mind. I'm sure you treated her like a kitten right from the get go.
do you feel like you are prepared?
No one can prepare you for the presentation! It is so nerve racking!
Aw, that's quite a mess! Did you clean it up quickly or did it run off?
Hahaha, she is a porcelain child. Try the hairballs again, she may enjoy it more.
That is pretty embarrassing, but I bet it's wonderful that you left that much.
I had a similar situation where a teenager struck my son with a car. I blamed myself and made him stop.
indeed, its excellent and i bet you requested it - moi!
uh oh...did someone else just eat it?
Oh no! Did you find them yet? They must be having difficulties dealing with that.
I am glad you made it there. All the bad directions probably made it even worse@
haha i guess you were like wow that is really cool
Sounds like a good idea, where do you go to run?
oh wow.. nice.. did she like you doing it or did you just want to do it?
I guess thats a good thing?
Oh what happened?
I could just imagine being in that place, never having to worry about money or where to go.
Oh my god! What did you do about it?
did they catch him?
oh no! did he lick it off?
I hope the radishes and onions are good too!
why was he doing that? can you talk to him about it?
what if he said yes? thats still an option!
Oh no. Did you put a bag on him?
Are you anxious about it?
oh that's too bad.. you can try again the next time
That's the truth. I wish I could go back to that day.
I love chocolates.
I'm glad he's changed.
have you complained to them?
There is no shame in that. You would like to work there.
We all have our faults. We all need to work to get the things we want.
Yeah I do but she won't let me borrow any money, is there a reason she's refusing?
That's great. Have you found anything out about bids so far?
Well you did a great thing by getting them out of the house!
Have you tried to bribe her?
Lesson learned, hope you continue to have good memories of her in the future!
I'm so sorry! I've been there lol
You are a good person, you should feel guilty.
That sounds really exciting! I love thrill rides!
Is it too expensive for what you get?
I can understand that! I lost my cat last year. It can't be easy!
I was 22 years old and im not kidding when I say it was a horrible experience. I am really sorry you had to go through that. Do you know what caused it?
Maybe you can make time to spend time on those that are!
set aside for life? Thats awesome. I hope you have enough left over
Yeah, it's always nice to think about the good times. Makes it easier to cherish them when you're old and grey.
That is really amazing. I am glad you had such a great experience!
I only watch DVD's
Honestly I watch a lot of adult content, but I'm not really a viewer by choice. What is you favorite adult to watch?
i guess at that point in life, self-exploration becomes even more important
I can't imagine how hard that is, especially with all the blood loss.
What type of steak do you make?
yea but its all in the mind
awww how old were you then? are you still alive and well?
If you were ever worried about financial responsibility then I think you should take a look at setting up a fund as it can really help with that.
i'm sorry. that must be tough.
That is a very strong feeling
oh no, that is awful
Oh wow, that's no good at all. I hope you can find a way to get rid of them fast
what? what kinda thing happened?
True true, i can also be that way about my money.
i don't play much, if at all
It's coming out in august! It will be the last one before Fallout.
That's the unfairness of it all. I'm sorry you feel that way. Is it because you're bigger or because they have a higher pay grade?
It'll get better, friends are worth the wait!
Well I'm sure they feel great but maybe you could do with a break right now.
Yeah, that sounds like a wonderful thing to go through. It always feels good when someone makes you feel good. I hope it goes well!
I'm always prepared for anything. What did you do?
That's great! I know that can be tough but it feels good when you accomplish something. I'm sure you deserved it.
I would have been hurt too. Did you do anything to quell the swarm?
I would be mad too, you should tell them you told them prior so they don't forget.
Used to be some games we had on channel 21
If you own all of them you can rent or buy a new set.
That's good! I'm happily married.
That is great! Congratulations again on the raising of family!
dang i bet that was a little embarrassing, how did she react?
Yeah, I know how that is. I hope she knows that you have a reason to be upset over it and that you won't stand for it.
Oh no! I love Chinese food, you have a very smart girlfriend.
What did you do?
eww that is so gross! i know how that feels!
Yes, that's the whole idea with eating pork.
Oh no, I'm so sorry. I hate to hear that.
Oh I am sorry that happened to you.
That sounds interesting, how did it go?
I'm sure it was, I'm a little afraid of heights, but not as scared of heights as you are.
Do you think you did well?
I can understand. You must have been very nervous.
That is a nice thing to do. What kind of bar was it?
What did you do instead?
Were you still a bit scared of jumping?
I am sure you are thankful you did it.
That's a good thing to know. How old are they?
I don't understand why some people are so cruel.
I consider video games to be my full time job.
I played FIFA 13 a laugher and it was awesome. It is a really big game and lasts for so long!
i have been through that before
Don't worry, I am sure you guys will have a great time!
Oh that sounds so sweet! I think we all went to some sort of family reunion at some point in our lives, right? My familyreunions were always so relaxing and fun, especially when my grandparents were around.
aw what all do you do now?
Nice! What did you do with the money?
That's a good attitude. When will they close?
That was nice of the teacher to meet with you. School is hard.
mom's do tend to have more patience than dads, i know what you mean
What did he buy?
If you're happy with him, I wouldn't hesitate in asking for another cat!
Yeah! I would have, too! Who knew an hour and a half in the air would be so scary?
life is short you will surely overcome this danger
sounds super gross
Sounds like a day that will be remembered for a long time.
Dammmnn that stinks. Did you call the police?
That's good :) I don't get why people are so hateful
I'm sorry. I hope you were able to sell well and made some more money.
Oh I see, is she usually the one to embarrass?
Are you tired?
I hope you find peace with your success and find happiness in your work!
Wow! I have never taken a class online. I will definitely look into it
Weather can be such a drag. I'm sorry you had to endure that. Do you know if she or your date will be able to reschedule?
Ah well that's a good thing, at least you got out of town and stuff!
Wow! how did that make you feel?
Wow! What a nice dream come true for sure!
That sounds like a really good time. Did you guys catch up with each other?
Anyway, you can try those old toothbrushes. I did. Nothing too bad.
Oh my, that's horrible. I'm sorry to hear that.
It's very hard to say the least. My favorite game is Call of Duty.
Wait staff? That's awful! How'd she do that?
Yeah, hopefully it pays well and you're happy!
That sounds so sweet and romantic.
That's wonderful. I hope you're really happy and the other person is too.
That really sucks. Did you find it?
I hate when that happens. People need to be more aware when it is appropriate to do so.
That's pretty cool. How did it go?
That's great! It's always great when you can get together with like-minded people.
That is great to hear! You are well compensated and ideally situated to have a successful life.
You seem very well-adjusted and happy with where you're at. You sound like a model brother.
That's what I do, pretty much the same thing every day. Except I snack because Im distracted and start to feel guilty later.
Oh no! You must have been very angry about that. I hope there was some way you could have got someone to fix it.
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. I hope things look better for you!
I see. Well maybe you'll save some money from an engine standpoint
That sounds painful! Did you trip over a flower as well?
I'm sorry. Do you think it will ever heal?
That's just cool. I bet they were happy you were there to help clean up after them.
I am sure if you played it safe and used paypal its not such a big deal
I know what you mean. I do the same thing
I'm so sorry...how old was she?
She's so lucky to have had her. I hope your day went well.
that sounds like fun!
yeah would be fun! i like boats, mostly pirouettes
That must be hard for her to be honest with you.
Meatballs aren't the only bums on your shoe!
Yeah, work always pays if you stay dedicated.
That's awesome. What was the big project?
Oh. Well, I'm sure you got it all sorted out eventually.
That's the beauty of technology, stuff is never as simple as you might think!
Oh, well that's not good! If you see many different people, you're probably sick too!
That's great. Your life is completely dependant on them. You are trusting them with your life. That's a very powerful thing
Oh damn, I'm sorry to hear that. Those can be loaded words to have to say. I hope you feel better soon!
Have you lost too much weight? That's so important.
It'll be alright. It's a big city like us, the weather shouldn't be an issue.
Just think positive thoughts! Maybe it will go well!
Ctblablablablablablablablabackabackabackabbott cobalt blue japanese sky blue american sky purple ive always wanted a sky blue japanese sky blue ive never been to japan before so my expectations were a little off
better birthday gift than a heart attack lol
That's great! Health problems are never easy and nothing makes me feel more grateful than a great family!
I bet you are so happy about that!
That is so sad. I had to do that too. I hope that you are in a better place now that you have lost your pet.
That is a very sad thing
Oh, how was it?
The problem I see is reliability does not equal goodness. I bought a used car from a veterans yard a few years ago and it had major cosmetic issues.
That's so sweet. I'm lucky to have a husband like that.
You must have become fast friends with him. Its nice to have a confidant like that
That isn't a very nice thing to do. Was she mad?
That's cool. I wouldn't be able to win that thing.
Oh how exciting! I am sure you will enjoy it
I am sure you will have a great time there.
How does it work?
It is very nice. I hope he continues to grow in years to come
Oh, well that's too bad. Perhaps if you continue to take care of them you will be motivated to have children.
Your situation is not normal. Everybody with a health problem needs a family member to be close to.
Good luck. Do you feel that you are now a bit bit under-prepared for the position?
Well, congratulations! That's great! I hope you get the job!
I understand. Those days are gone.
Yeah hypothetically maybe it could have been worse. I'm glad you're out of it, too.
I used to be a person who could not let go, I crashed a car a few years ago and had a stroke. It is an amazing feeling and I learned a lot!
That is true. Convey my sentiment. You never quite understand it and it is never easy to "let go" of someone.
That's awesome. Glad you enjoyed it. I've never been much for horror, so that was pretty disappointing. I guess this is why we watch tv. It gives us time to fantasize. Hope your weekend went well!
That's cool. It's always nice to have fond, long memories.
Oh no! How did that happen?
Oh that's a cute color combination. I am sure they will have gotten a laugh out of it!
Do you know the ending yet?
Well hopefully you're ready for that. I know it's rough being the underdog in a bigoted world, but I'm sure this is nothing compared to the things that can happen in real life.
Oh no! How did you manage to manage to avoid being seen?
Was he upset about it?
What happens?
I can understand that, sometimes you have to make that choice for yourself.
What are the advantages of being in a place like that?
That is a very good thing
Those are good things to work on. Good to hear you're improving.
wow does the teacher get mad at you?
I think you will get it, just gotta grind though.
It should be illegal! Too bad they don't take common sense into their milk.
I agree. You're not a wrestler. You're an animal!
What were you doing at the gym?
Are you a woman?
I hate when that happens! Were the toys loose?
I hope he learns his lesson.
Oh, wow! Are you guys still together?
Oh okay well that's unfortunate. At least she's more pleasant and helpful.
Ugh tell me about it.. i have done that a few times in the past.. do you have a heart condition?
Dang, I'm sorry about that! I'm glad you didn't have to deal with that anymore though.
Was the cake good?
In a bad situation it's better to swallow one's pride than to let it ruin your life.
You must be very strong to be working on that.
Sounds like you deserve the job, great!
Oh! I didn't know that! Paranormal activity is terrIy good! I will definitely watch it.
Well, share this amazing experience with me!
I once gave up drinking too. Now I take Paxil
That sounds so fantasy, it's like you were living in a different world. It's so exciting to be in that place!
Was it to a pool?
That's the worst. The lack of water. It's hard to get out from under that.
I think so too, and i do all the talking in the world when im ready to do nothing.
I could never do that. I always feel like I am living in a fairy tale world.
That's awesome! Are you a gym rat?
Those are good goals to work towards! I hope you feel better!
Were you able to clean them?
at least he learned from it
Uhoh, that's no good. How did that happen?
Oh, yeah that sounds horrible. How long did it take?
Well, sometimes we become estranged from people we used to know.
May be time for a new start somewhere else.
I understand. It's like you're holding back a huge emotional storm.
I know what you mean. I'm sorry for the loss, but I hope you know that it's you who should be grateful for the time you have, and not them.
Oh no! So what did you do?
There's nothing worse than spoiling the elderly! I'm so sorry you have to deal with that!
It is, but it is a difficult thing to deal with at times. I hope your daughter becomes a bit more socialised.
Just sitting around and reading donuts will do some good. Keep it up!
It is well remembered even if somewhat controversial
what big goal are we talking about
that is so cute. what was the first puppy?
I wish I had one of those dogs, I love kids and puppies
Easier said than done, and I know that still isn't easy.
That's got to be embarrassing. I hope he's grown a bit since then.
Mustachioed psychopath.
Oh no, is it just broccoli? I've never been in my life been put in the large group that ate so much food
oh my! what a bummer! are you going to get it back?
I imagine so. The next place you look it might still be there! HOw'd up!
Oh no! Did you have to wash your hands after that?
Hopefully not, trust me. I've been in that situation before.
Oh wow! How did that make you feel?
that would be a tough one, she would probably have a hard time walking if she was having that happen
I am sorry to hear that. That is a pretty serious problem
Able to whom do you refer?
I'm glad you don't have any competition!
And the knowledge is in helping others and helping yourself also.
I hear you! I love to watch them dozing off.
Ah, that seems like a good place to be. I'm sure sleep will help you out there.
ugh that's too bad, I hope he's alright and you're able to replace him fast.
That's so sad. Guthix was a very peaceful place.
this is the worst, how did you manage
It always amuses me when people stop working so hard. It's a product of mediocracy.
that is cool, i loved looking through old photo albums
I understand. Please accept my apology for your high ride
Glad to hear that, wish I could back up.
What are you planning on majoring in?
Sounds like a great kid, what kind of car?
Well, it was still scary and awesome in a weird way.
that's the spirit!
it's the hopeful part of life that i think we should all try to keep repeating
oh no what did you eat to make that happen?
I'm so sorry! I have had that happen to me as well. It's so embarrassing and annoying and hurts your self confidence.
That's awesome. How long did you train for that?
Lol, that's awesome. I wish I looked like you!
It feels so good to relax while doing something nice.
Nice! That's very good! That's pretty uncommon for me
Oh no! How did you reacted?
I know what you mean cherie. do you think it will ever happen?
Thats a great friend you have! Have you tried playing any tournaments recently?
That is wonderful! I wish you many good things. I am sure these next few months will go very well for you.
dirty tricking you?
Oh wow! Are you over him?
I agree. I wish I could go back to those days
Sounds like a lot of fun! Sounds like a lot of fun!
How did you have surgery?
It can be a very hard adjustment, especially when you feel so confident about changing.
That's great! I wish I could go to the gym.
I think it has been the best 2 years of my life so far.
I am sorry to hear that. Do you try to talk to your parents about it?
Except where they are illegal. That doesn't always hold true.
Oh god I know how that feels. I had a dog for the same reason. It sucks losing a pet.
I am sure you will be ready in time
How did you find out that it was the other way around?
I honestly hope so too, I'm sorry that happened to you.
Wow! I am sorry to hear that, my cat was like a family member to me, and I fell in love with her due to her being so little. I hope your cat feels better soon!
I hope you get to spend time with her again soon.
oh well i am sure their first meeting will go smoothly
Well that's a relief. Hopefully your cat doesn't get any weird infections from the dirt!
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. Pregnancy is such a difficult thing, I wish you had more experience with it
I'm so glad you're holding your baby now! Are you nervous about the surgery?
I know this is a hard news for you, but I am sure you will be able to save a lot of money and have amazing accrued vacation time. I wish you the best!
yup that is awesome, i would sOTTASTY if i had to do all that while being productive
That's wonderful! Visiting is a huge expense for both the visiter and the visiting party. Did you two have a good time together?
it's obvious when he is eating, but you can tell it isn't when he is just casually talking to you haha!
What kind of dress was it?
Lol. That's funny. Well, assuming you're comfortable in party attire... I'd go for it!
it sounds like you are getting the most of it
That's fantastic! I wish I had a machine to help with that, because I don't use one. I also discovered that I can now do pushups, situps, and do the bent arms ones! Those are pretty tough ones.
That is great you have been waiting so long. I am sure you do have a great opportunity if you take it.
That's fair, there is no better feeling than receiving news like that!
That's always a plus for planning well for the long campaign. Hardwork always pays off in the end
I always say that, especially when I'm in a position of power. Anything you say could be used against you in a lawsuit!
oh no
I certainly would not want to do that. At least then I could relax and enjoy the scenery.
Oh no, that sounds bad. What was the call about?
I am glad that you have a great friend!
That sounds relaxing. What are you relaxing about?
I'm way too addicted to this show "#momtomorrow" :)
I can imagine it would be, that is terrible!
Ah, I'm sure it can be something. Try to remember that all the negative emotions are good because they keep you grounded.
Are you going to be able to afford a house?
That is terrible. That means you will have to sell.
that is good decision by you.
I watch that show too. The one with the eating of hobbits
It's always great getting to know new people from before.
That sounds wonderful! It's always good to have those memories.
what the heck is going on?
I am sorry to hear that.I hope they at least gave you a good experience
For sure. What happened?
You will I am sure get through it
I think the most important thing is that you don't make another mistake.
its good that you are aware of such people
Oh no! That is not good! Are you going to punish them for it?
thats sad
That sounds like fun! It's always exciting to take a leap of faith and climb a mountain.
Maybe you should try the trad climbing circuit and see how it goes. You never know so be very curious!
I don't sleep that well, I turn off my lights and try to stay inside.
I'm always worried about my safety in those cities, it seems. Is it because of a specific person that is bothering you, or is it something else entirely? Sorry I can't help your anxiety.
is that because you are wearing shorts all day or are you having difficulty holding your breath?
I bet it is, and I am sure your mom can really help you with that.
I'm so happy for your new born child! You must be feeling so proud!
That sounds pretty sad. I am glad you had your surgery and your pregnancy is on the right track.
thats nifty, good for you, how long have you been dancing?
What kind of feat are you talking about?
I know the feeling! I being in college myself almost made me homeless! So when I moved away, I felt homesick
i wish i could do that, especially on here, its hard to new friends
Oh no! Are you doing okay?
That would be pretty amazing, I wish you the best of luck!
that sounds very romantic
I think yes. Do you know him?
Oh yeah, I could just imagine
Oh, those pesky flying ants are the worst!
I know that feeling. How come you're feeling that way?
I hope so too, it's so nice to feel for our adversaries.
Wow thats very fortunate for you. Sounds like you have a lot of good friends.
Bah, that's a long drive! I can't imagine spending that much time in another state.
Wow! That's terrible, but thankfully it won't be a problem again.
Are you ok?
That has to be tough. I am sure she has real issues with yours, too.
You are doing a great thing! I hope you can maintain a good relationship with her.
My sister was also rat person. She'd always get out of the car to go play.
I am glad you found her! I am sure she will want you to keep petting the others.
That is awesome, how did you enjoy it?
that is awesome, its always nice to go somewhere you have had fun before
A tumor? That's termas point is when they can metastasize. Have you any idea what you can do to try and halt it?
Do you plan to get rid of her soon? You must feel very lonely considering the situation.
oh no what now
I am glad that you have time to grieve.
Oh man, that sucks. How long did that take to swim?
I'm sorry it happened that way.
Yikes! I'm sorry. Was she someone you were hoping would be better?
I believe in you. We all need to prepare for one thing only - landing a great job!
That's great. It's always liberating to be done. That's a great feeling.
Wow that is a long time to fly. Did you go to college?
That's amazing. I have never heard of Madagascar, so exciting!
wow that is interesting, what is your favorite thing to do in the kingdom?
It is. The world is a very dangerous place.
It's always wonderful to have a supportive and loving family!
That sounds pretty scary. I'm sorry you forgot about it.
I am glad it was an unpleasant one for you.
That is funny lol
Yeah I would imagine it was. I am glad nobody got sick though.
Oh how sad. What was the memory for?
wow, that is a great person
It's great that you were appreciated while at the same time being appreciated for being able to do what you loved. It's the best holidayrithmetic.
That must of been a lot of preparation. What do you have planned?
I believe you will have a lot of fun.
That's so sad.I'm sorry for your loss.
Oh my God. I don't know what I would do if I were her
I have found over the years that just talking to others has such a positive effect and I no longer be afraid to even try. It is so hard to start but I know that it will be worth it I believe.
That's awful, I have to say. That usually isn't an easy thing to do. So sorry that happened to you.
Moderation is key, I'm glad you were able to get home!
That's awesome of you! It's 2018, we've all been there. How long has it been?
I really, really do. I hope all turns out well for him.
People do that for a reason, did you still love her?
Sounds like she has a very nice personality. I am the same way
Oh man! I've had horrible situations where people are just looking and you're just like, "What the heck?!" I'm glad you're okay! Are you going to say something?
Yeah we all have our bad situations. You just have to try to be nice and understanding.
Oh no! We talk about that every year at the state fair. Was anyone around to reprimand you?
Haha I bet your classmates were laughing to no end! Not even you could have guessed what they would do with the information at that point!
oh my goodness, that is so crazy! but what will happen if he doesnt believe you?
Oh, definitely! Next up, we're gonna need a bomb to blow up the house of worship where your dad works.
Oh no. I would be jealous of her.
What was the difficulty of the trip?
That's awfully lucky, have you been to the capital before?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
I'm sure that'll be fun!
It's a wonderful time in her life. She's on the cusp of adulthood and it feels so good to be a part of her future.
Oh how fun! do you think you can nail it?
Oh wow. That really sucks. People just don't compare anymore. I really hope you fight back and get a better reputation!
Oh wow! Did you have any damage?
That is great. I am glad that you were able to stay in the game.
That's awful! I hope insurance is able to cover the damage.
That's a very interesting reason. I think you could still do without it.
Oh, you just became a vegetarian?
Oh no! Is she in school?
That is so bad. You should be able to speak to her again after that.
That's great. What kind of certification is it?
That's great to hear. I hope it works out for you guys!
Ah, the emotional disconnection is tough to overcome. I hope you're having fun with your daughter!
How so?
Nice! It's always nice when someone outside of work helps you when you need it.
That's very good that he wants to give generously
Ouch! that stinks! im sorry! i hope you get back with him soon!
i understand that. my girlfriend left me a couple months ago. i wish i could find something to replace her, but in the end i am just going to accept that this is happening to me. i hope your mood improves!
Take a chance and meet some friends in your new city
That's difficult, I'm sorry. Maybe you can go out with some friends and explore the area?
i hear you. I'm sure you did great.
That's terrible, can you retake the class?
What song is it? That is so frustrating.
Has she ever done that before?
i love the idea of having fun colors
Those things are awesome! My daughter always asks how to write in pencil so it's like, "You just learned how to write in pen today!", so I feel you.
What's wrong with it?
I am very confident about that! I think it will sell out quickly.
Oh no, were you able to suceed and see her?
Ah, still nothing - try again and I'm sure you'll make it!
sorry about that, was it ok
yuck, i'm sorry, that's one of the most gross things i've ever tasted
Oh no! that is so terrible!
Yes, i hate it when something like that happens. You might have to evacuate if someone is in your house!
I bet it does. Are they gone now?
I miss that feeling myself. I feel like I would freeze up right away.
Mints are always good
Dang I had one of those. I know it can be upsetting but it is funny sometimes!
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how that is.
That's good you were ready. I am glad it didn't hit you!
did you do it in a nice setting?
She sounds like a good person :)
I am so sorry to hear that! Have you applied for unemployment compensation already?
stocks and bonds seem to be the two that seem to work the best. that must be nice.
That's terrible. Did you have a chance to read it first?
What was the color?
Oh, have you tried contacting them?
I'm sorry to hear that. I know that can be a hard thing to swallow.
i agree with you
I get that, life is simple, right? I would love to try some of those
OH no! So embarrassing! I hope you were able to clean everything up.
I'm sure it was embarrassing for everyone, but very amusing at the same time!
Woah! I think that's a sign that the right one for you may be waiting for you on the other side. Cat like dogs, I say.
That's sad, maybe you can work together in the future.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you get any good stuff?
ooh that sounds interesting. what kind of antiques
Is he a mechanic?
That's awesome! I'm glad that you have someone that you can trust like that.
I'm sorry, that's very unfortunate. Can you come up with a reason not to believe?
Haha that's funny. I think I might have peed myself too.
That is really sweet of you. I do the same where I live. I set up standopings where the wildlife can get clean and dry food. It is a win-win for everyone!
That is wonderful. I live in a place that has some safety features too - like deep water rafting. I think you would be safe there as well.
Congratulations! We are so happy about that!
I will have to look into that, they are very cute dogs.
Im sorry to hear that. How did she cheat and how do you feel now?
No problem, honesty is a beautiful thing. You're fighting for your loved one, which is understnad
Oh wow, smoking is such a big problem in the United States. You're a real kind hearted person.
The lack of caffeine really did hamper my sleep which really sucks. I had to get up at 4am to get ready for work.
Yea guilt is a bad thing to do. Dont be too hard on yourself for it.
It happens I guess. My daughter and I used to play all the time when we were little.
What types of games
Those are great games to have in the night time!
I'm sorry to hear that, were you rejected because you're not a certain gender?
well I hope you did get it
its very similar to my story its kinda funny actually
im sorry, i know life just goes on, but i hope you find someone soon i wish you all the best
That sounds like fun! What kind of boat?
I would love to have a car like that! I don't know if I could afford that much either.
That sounds wonderful. You should take your wife to tubing if you live in a place with a lot of tubing.
That is true! I am glad it will be worth it in the end
That is true. I wouldn't lend it to anyone
Well, if she is in a better place then you should at least be happy about that. It may not happen again, but at least you have that to look forward on.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you find him?
Aww, that's so sad. I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope you guys find it in you to make sure another cat, dog, or amphibian is adopted too. It's hard to lose a cat, and it's part of the rescue business.
I bet you are a great parent to your kids! You sound like you must be having a blast.
I hope your confidence returns!
Oh no! That's a bummer. What was the reason that happened?
Sounds like she'll have a long healing process. I hope she comes back full of strength!
What a jerk! I don't like where his job went that quickly. Did your friend get the job back?
Yes, that's always the positive side of things. More money is always better. I don't want to lose that, especially after what I feel is wrongful pay.
Did you come out with them?
That is really gross and embarrassing. I wonder how the shirt got so dirty?
I'm sorry to hear that. Try and find an effective treatment plan that works for you!
which ones did you use?
Wow a remotely controlled car is a pretty cool toy. Do you car feels sturdy?
I did that when I was a kid. I was afraid of toys.
Oh, that's horrible! Did you report them to the police?
Dang. There is no excuse for that.
That's so sweet! I'm sure she loved coming to church and taking care of others!
How long ago has she passed away?
He must be a very young child! I remember the K through 5 age range.
haha that is hilarious!
Wow that's nice! Do you attend the church?
Oh really? I can't imagine why you wouldn't want to trust in the Lord. I mean, if your family is good, why wouldn't you want to trust in the Lord?
Oh, that is nostalgic. How old are they now?
That is great you have a bit of space with them.
Oh my God! What happened?
sounds very annoying
I'm so jealous I love food so much!
I prefer eating my peas and carrots raw.
Oh no, any news about it?
I'm sure with time father will get back to parenting you like it's your son.
You sound well prepared! What is the supervisor exam for?
You should feel very confident and determined!
Wow! Are you excited?
I've done that and it can backfire really badly.
I can honestly say I was bullied as well when I was younger. I hate it when that happens.
Those are good memories I am sure she will treasure them.
Dang! That's cheery! How did it work out for you?
Oh dear. Did someone find you?
Aw, poor little thing, I hope he gets better!
I am so sorry... the dogs are family
You must be so proud of him!! Farm animals are creatures of the earth and very cute!
Awwwww......but you do that while also being a good parent. Your kitten will love that. Mine grows up too fast.
cello is so hard to play, cello is so fun
Wow. You are one tough one.
Oh no! I bet that was really embarrassing!
What happened?
Wow. I really hope that you are able to work through this. I have had work out before with a personal chef and it went really well. Do you have an outside job now?
I'm sorry to hear that. Does he have a job now?
Oh.. thats is kinda odd. What was the reason behind the breakup?
Wow, that's not a job for the average joe. camels back is pretty good.
Oh no! That's terrible! Are you going to complain to the kitchen?
I'm sorry you had to endure that. It might make you sad when you think about it.
That was nice of you. I bet he did a good job.
Awwww. Mine are the same way -- they love watching them too!
5 huh? Good job, that's my favorite number!
That would really scare me haha. I hate when I go that far away from home to go fishing
That is terrible.
Oh you must be nervous, but I'm sure you'll be good at it. There are alot of ways to make money playing video games.
fine, go on
Oh, sorry to hear that, did it become a lot worse or just stop happening?
IS the other hole self explanatory?
That is a great friend. I like how you did your best to be concerned with your friend and your interests at all times. Even when you have to go against your friend, it is good to be concerned about your interests and your friend.
He has to believe in himself to lose that much!
That's cool. Where did you meet?
Making a promise is sometimes so hard to keep, but it's so worth it in the end. Sounds like she's a great person and you really should be proud of her for sticking to her end of the deal!
That was very brave of your cousin. That sure sounds like good detective work you have been doing.
Oh my gosh! I could just imagine 9 year old kids kicking butt like that. Did you get mad at them?
Awww yeah you shouldn't let them away lightly! That's so unfair of them! Are you going to keep them or are you going to sell them?
Yeah that's pretty true. But at least you have her to hold on to.
that is a great thing to hear, it must be a great feeling to have one's dreams come true!
That is true, it's a very strong image that circulates in your head time and time again. Just remember he has done something you absolutely cannot match, you could use his talent for teaching others how to do the same thing yourself, give him all the credit for being so great at what he loves and letting him do whatever he wants with it.
Oh my, that stinks. Are you repairing it?
Oh no that is not ok you should tell him right away.
Aw it's okay to feel that way sometimes! Remember you only have one lover, and that's wonderful.
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you will find someone online or in person
thats awesome! are you gonna go on a road trip in a rowre?
Thats wonderful! Enjoy it while it lasts!
Oh no! I could never get into zoos! They have horrible pens and you feel like you are witnessing abuse all the time. Did you feel anything negative while there?
That's very disturbing, especially the ones that close on windows. I would be concerned
Washington, D.C. Isn't there, any better way to say "free"?"
SS reform is very interesting. I am sure you will be meeting a lot of interesting people.
thats cool
Well that sounds exciting! I hope it turns out well for you.
Wow! It is so annoying. Maybe you should talk to him and get to know each others
Wow. What a bunch of stinking steez!
Sounds like you are feeling hopeful. What kind of job may I ask?
That sounds so exciting! I wish I had a brokerage to get my money in for realtors.
Yeah, it's crazy how stuff like that does sting a little sometimes, but I suppose all the hard work and sacrifice pays off in the end.
I live near Gatlinburg and it's not too bad. We went on a few sight seeing stews (with wings) and storks (with tails). I should of been more excited but I'm glad you're happy.
Did you try to stop him?
I bet it was! I hate when people talk during commercials. It is annoying and annoying.
Has it been a long time since you have done such a thing?
Ryzing is a good game. I hope you do win some silverware.
Oh man! I would be so annoyed! The insurance companies can be very expensive these days!
damnks
Oh yeah? What kind of dog?
I bet that was an awesome feeling
well at least he is trying to be a better person then you are.
You should definitely go and ask him. I think if you do, he will put his foot down.
That's absolutely horrible. Some people are just ungrateful and need to learn.
I know right? They don't even take no for an answer at all. They'll just shove it down your throat like no one deserves it.
what news?
i do to, what are you waiting for?
Oh no, are you sure you didn't get it?
I wish I could be happy at least doing something I like. Not sure if I can be happy at work though.
That sounds horrible! What did you do?
oh no, i can imagine, my favorite color is supposed to be when the milk runs out, but i always wait a few more minutes
Ok but I would like some time to rest andyre.
Oh you are so curious. I am sure you will like it!
Oh no! I know the feeling when a book we borrow ends up being used instead!
Don't feel bad! Every relationship starts off wrong and either one party doesn't take the other's feelings into consideration or the other isn't serious about their relationship.
Aww, that's nice. It's always nice to find old treasures.
Any type of dog. She's great though.
That's great. What kind of job did you apply for?
hey that's great! good for you!
That must be extremely difficult! But you must do well if you want to graduate with honors!
That is always a really good thing. Are you nervous about the test?
What did you do when you returned home?
Oh, no. Was he drunk or half drunk?
that's good that you stay loyal to employers like that
That sounds like a lot of work! I'm sorry. What kind of clients have you worked with so far?
That's awesome! What did you pitch?
awesome, when is it going to call?
haha good luck! I hope you do well I am sure you will.
That must have been bittersweet. Did you get to keep them?
Are you going to see them again?
That's so wonderful! I love to buy my trust from major brand and major discount. It really makes a difference. How did it make you feel when you bought it from your trust brand?
Exactly. The risks are usually too great.
sounds like an excellent strategy to me
That's what they say. I hope it is, I hope it's a nice, hot, summer's day. You can enjoy the fruits of your labor while it lasts.
I'm so sorry to hear that. You must be devastated.
How many years did you have your companion?
Is that your gear that you usually get in the event of an emergency?
There's a big gulf, dear.
That is so nice of her. It is so easy to do that.
Can you exercise more of that or is she holding back?
That's ridiculous. What are the chances that someone would think that gluten is a real thing?
I see. Well I hope it's nothing serious.
That sounds delicious! I think you'll like the new diet cola. It's better than the old stuff
That's good that you were concerned. I bet it was embarrassing.
teens are so sweet and caring
Let's say you make a mistake and it puts you in the hospital. Do you go insane from the experience?
Are you a star dish or do you prefer pancakes?
That sounds great. Is there a breakfast show you watch where she talks?
Well you've got to do what you've got to do. I'm sure your dad knows he can trust her with his baby.
That is a very good thing in my opinion!
He better! Maybe he's worried that if you told your best friend, everyone would know.
It sounds like he knows what he's doing
That's tough. She really should be, but sometimes we don't have the means or the will.
That's really what you should do. I wish you the best in handling her!
What kind of car is it?
Sweet. I want one of those.
I hope it works out for you!
That's sound. I should do it.
Oh my gosh! That's so embarrassing! I'm so sorry! Take her to preschool often and it'll be fine!
Wow. I am glad that thing grew out of it.
How did it go?
You'll be so glad you went
That's amazing! I bet you've got a lot of catching up to do!
I am sure you will get lots of shrimp cocktails and snails after refueling.
Oh, wow. I'm glad he was able to help you!
Oh, no! I hope he is okay!
I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Are you going to stay angry at God for that?
It sounds like you had a wonderful time! I hope you celebrate with family and friends on Sunday!
Oh, that's a go to habit for me! I used to eat bread, but have since switched to popcorn.
I will take that over a chocolate chaser, for the chaser taste.
awww was it amazing?
Oh, I bet. It's always nice to see old friends getting stuff for themselves!
oh thats a nice gesture of being able to help her.
I bet it was! I bet you had a blast.
oh my god thats so scary
How long did it take to get better?
I am sorry to hear that, is she going to get better?
wonderful I hope she is okay, I hope you are able to get her something to drink
That's so sweet! I love pets! You deserve this nap! What's wrong?
Excellent, I love cats. Savor every moment with your neighbor's cat
oh which one?
Don't be nervous. It's all good. Everything will work out well.
That sounds really nice. Did you enjoy yourself and not worry about them?
I imagine that you have a pool somewhere in the pool house.
Oh no that is horrible! How did they get it?
That is gross, i would recoil in horror
How was it?
That must be fun for you both. I'm sure she will be a lot of fun.
that's a great thing to do. I wish i could do that for a living
Oh no! Disability is hard! Mine started about the same time I did, and I'm still paying off about 15% of it each month right now. It's getting really old looking at the Wheel. I was hoping you got approved for that thing, but I'm not sure I could ever afford it, and I'm sure you're not alone. Maybe you can see your doctor to talk
oh really? that must've been weird
I can understand that. It can be daunting to know how to get the hang of all that.
That is wonderful to hear. It is wonderful to have such a great relationship with your kids. How old are they?
Well maybe you can go out and find some sports to keep your occupied until he comes home.
Ah that must have been stressful. Did you see them?
Yeah, it would have been better
Oh wow, that's a lot of waiting! What were you going for?
Mostly just boring store food.
How was it?
I'm glad you're okay, it's a hard thing to see.
That sounds like great fun! If your friends are really good about it I'd be going myself in a few months.
If you're in the US, make sure you visit Grandma's grave too!
Thats awesome! What kind of friends
Do you have plans for next week's meeting?
OK, that's too bad. But, as long as you guys have each other, that's something.
Oh no that is not nice!
I'm sure she has a reason and you don't want to go that route.
oh no, i am sorry to hear that, i can't stand that kind of stuff
lol. I am sorry that happened to you
I can see why that would bother you.
That's understandable, I know how hard it is to let someone else take care of you
Yeah, you definitely have to be very careful with fart neighbors, they can actually cause more damage than good though.
How do you feel about doing that?
You are so thoughtful. I'm sure your child will love having you there to protect them. You are a good parent!
Oh wow. How do you think it went?
I'm guessing it was? You chose wisely and it was nice to have some peace of mind.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. How old is he?
It's so hard to lose someone you love and it's hard enough not to lose someone you can't always trust. I hope they feel better and are doing better now!
I love watching family games. Do they play the ball similarly to you?
Absolutely! Especially the memories of the people you love.
i have never been but i am afraid to
I have no idea what that is.
Good for you! I love playing dominos
Breweries are fun places to go if you're a fan of ales.
Why are you nervous about people visiting?
Oh I know, it must be very hard! I have to follow the same routine for both kids.
Well Happy Birthday to you! What are you planning on getting?
I hope you get a good one!
Yikes! Did you find out who did it?
You have to be careful next time you go, it could be embarassing!
good luck i hope you have a good time
Then just keep positive and things will work out.
Oh, no that's scary! What could that have been?
That's so annoying, printers are so expensive these days.
Well, that's what it's like in the city, so yes. It's a good thing your family and I are safe, because that would have been a nightmare to deal with otherwise.
I am sure it will be OK
Oh no! I hate it when that happens... did you taste its recipe on some other website?
Oh that's too bad. I'm sorry you had to experience that.
How'd it go?
haha. Whatever made you feel good about yourself probably made you feel more confident about your chances, right?
Yeah, I love those too. Wish I could go back to being a kid again and just do 100 pushups a minute like you!
Oh yeah, I've always wanted a block of oatmeal, since I was a kid.
Aw, that is beautiful. I bet that was very bittersweet. How old is she now?
Awww it's incredible. I wish I had a pet like that.
It is nice to see that you have time for her. Have you given her the usual gadgets and programming tips?
I played that on the arcades. Those games remind me of when I was little. Lemmings sounds like fun!
aren't you glad you found some to go with your Dean's pie!
I may just have taste in that particular aisle. I usually end up going the opposite way around.
Congrats! That's great!
Wow that sounds amazing, hope you have a good year.
I hope you get it!
I'm sorry, I can only imagine. That's so great that you took time to restructure your life. You sound like a very grateful person.
Oh, very nice, what does your job entail?
Oh god, that sounds horrible. So many animals in cages it seems like it's an everyday occurrence at my grocery store. Do you feel any sympathy for them? I mean it's unfair that they had to work so hard to get the animals and then to have them die in there.
I'm sorry you have that problem. I hope you find a way to *resist* using that law
you were there?
You will always be remembered fondly by your teammates and your family!
I remember that feeling back then. I hated waiting for school to end up being the day!
What a nice way to end the day!
I bet they will be fine then!
I hope it wasn't too hard for you!
Yeah they're usually pretty nice. I bet it was a nice trip.
Holy cow, sounds like a sad case. What do you think happened to the other farm as a result of the charges?
I totally know the feeling. I rescue animals and have lost many in the last five years.
That is so great, the problem of hunger in American is too great.
It is insane that people are still being put in that situation! I am glad that the bond has been raised for you, and that you will be reunited with them soon.
How did that turn out?
that's pretty cool, i hope he keeps it up
I hope they had a good time!
MJ, how many kids do you have?
They're in their early 20s.
that sucks are you happy or mad are you able to laugh it off lol
I understand. It will be worse tomorrow and then it would be okay.
Those dogs are never good for a walk.
yeah its really scary when a raccoon comes into your home
Oh no, that is sad. I love stray kittens.
So sorry to hear that. That is absolutely horrible. Yes, I can imagine the devastation that must have been for the fam.
That's impressive, she's talented. What kind of game?
i agree. Kids today are so excited to explore and make new friends.
That's quite unfortunate, what will you do?
yeah that's the bad part about millennials - they will learn iThind
Well, I hope that you are able to cover the costs, although I'm sure you will be okay. Families are very important, you don't want to stress about money that's probably not going to be spent.
Definitely. I think you should try to get into the pros. You never know what kind of work is attractive though.
Oh no! I am sorry! Is everything ok?
I understand. I get nervous at traffic maybe.
Why didn't you get caught? That's very lucky of you.
I'm sorry. That must be awful.
Oh no! What movie was it?
That sounds wonderful!
Oh man that's a really expensive mistake to make. I'm sorry. Will you have to call him and tell him how wrong you were?
I hope he eventually gets the hang of admitting to himself what a worm he is! I'm sure you two will have a much better time together when he comes around.
You must really annoy them, are they organized about their shifts?
Dang, i really do agree, that is very annoying
Well, it's time to move on
Good luck.
Worm? I have never heard of that! I would be so grossed out!
You should try the kiwifruit. It should be cheaper and it has more fruit.
Awwwww, that sounds scary! What did you do?
Did you try to play it off?
That's great I am grateful for my dog as well. What breed?
Sounds like a cute dog!
ice cream man, thats terrible! i know how you feel
Whose idea was it to take a trip?
I once saw a komodo dragon on the ground! How terrifying!
It's funny how life works sometimes. You never know if things will turn out well or badly.
Yeah, I've over it by now. Enjoy the rest of summer!
What was the job?
oh thats good
Oh no, why did you all end up going?
Oh, I'm sure you'll feel better once you get some rest. Sometimes, losing a few hours can really help a lot.
I love pictures of animals, so I know what you mean. I love taking pictures of people too, especially if they are happy.
That's an awesome name, I'm sure it'll be available one day as well!
How did that go?
That is nasty, hopefully she grows out of it.
aww that is so annoying. did you try taking a nap afterwards?
Oh gosh. Thats too bad. What keeps you awake?
I hope you get it.
Don't worry too much. We'll make it up to you.
That sounds quite scary. What kind of airplane was it? I can't stand flying through the blades of trees any longer!
I bet. the first time I did a car try I passed a sobriety test but I was drunk. I didn't even realize my hand had been up. I was so drunk i didn't even realize I made a left turn. I wish i would havea had a field day and told them instantly
That would be kind of him. But how did you do it?
I'm sure they'll come back soon. You should make sure you celebrate when they do!
Oh no, did you call the police?
Okay so what did he steal?
Sorry to hear that, those kinds of things are never easy to deal with.
oh wow that is sad.. i am sorry for your loss.
Oh wow, I'm glad you found your soulmate! It'll be really fun.
Oh wow, that's kind of strange.
You must have been very well prepared for the challenges ahead.
Oh, well I'm glad to hear that. You must have been tired.
Oh no, what song is it?
Dang. I bet that is stressful.
i will go with you then
Hmm.. I don't know. Maybe you could send me a DM saying hello and I'll forgive you.
Oh no! Did they get hurt?
Oh I can see where that might be akward. I'm sure she'll let you know if she's ready for it.
Well that's understandable. What did you all do?
Oh I'm sorry. It's not easy being in a car with a crazy person like that.
What are you studying?
Oh cool, I hear you on that one, it's a tough career!
oh i see, you can feel free to do as you like.
That's great news. Good on you for having an experienced friend to help!
oh man did it
That is good. School is always close and let your stress take care of itself.
That's great that you encourage your partner to think about other things besides himself. I wish I had a partner like that!
It is good to have a partner like that
That is really rough. Are you able to go out and earn some extra money?
If I were you, I would leave a tip as well! Its so nice to have someone that you can trust.
That's got to be very hard on you. Have you ever talked to them since?
Divorce is the wrong tool for the job
That's a pain! Does he have a power tool that can do it?
What kind of errands did you run into?
That's so sad. DO you have any memories of her?
i think the blessing always comes first over beating her up over it. you can't live with yourself
I am glad you have time to enjoy your life now.
That's a great attitude!
Wow. That's amazing. Sounds like your parents must be catching up with you now.
That's horrible! They do that all the time and it's not even that bad. Ultrasounds are very useful to know what's going on. Ultrasound in general is very useful
Three years is a long time to be scared of an infant
Wow, that's amazing! I never get to play Grim Dawn because I'm too busy playing other games. I hope you get lots of play time because it sound like you deserve it.
4
That's wonderful! I bet she's happy to have a pet in her room. Did she bring him a bowl of sweet peas?
Ah, that is not good at all. I wonder if she will grow out of it?
oh that's terrible, are you ok?
Oh man! I'm glad you didn't have much to drink! So, how did it feel when you finally made it back to your room?
oh no, that's a bad breakup phase.
That's not a good thing to do. Will you be ok?
Congrats on her education! How old is she?
Yes, that's no fun! Not when your girlfriend has a lot on life and you're left to take care of it.
Wow, that's horrible, how long have you been ill?
MS is horrible! I hate hearing about others that have had it.
I'm so sorry! I know that must be tough!
Mistakes happen. Just be strong.
What kind of car is it?
I stand corrected. I am a bit apprehensive about her as well because I don't know all the nuances of driving.
What kind of test is it
That's good to hear. Nightie?
Any old reminiscing can do that to you. What was the song?
I felt the same way looking at your daughter.
Sorry to hear that. You must be going through a tough time.
The pom-poms of life are so tantalizing! How did you find yourself after you passed?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.
How long ago was this?
That sounds really great.
That sounds so good!
Yes! but you will do great! you are just 21!
It's hard to lose trust with people you don't even know.
Okay, so I think you have a problem. Maybe you can go to a weight loss class.
I understand that. I have been there more than I like to admit.
awful, i am waiting for you too, thanks goodness you got it
That's still a couple of days worth of absence. I'm sure you'll be back soon.
Oh me too! Some toys are just annoying and can ruin your child's fun!
Well, hopefully they can all find a hobby or craft and carry on that line in the future.
What is Shepard's pie?
Well that might help you right about now. I hope it doesn't cost too much or you can cut your losses and go indie?
oh yea im sure it was embarassing.
I wouldn't either if I was in your position.
That's not good! Did he get caught?
That's good. I might have to get that locked and monitored, because that sounds like a very bad idea.
I bet! How old are they?
If you know what you're doing try and hold onto them
Oh no! Do you think people forgot about it because it's not a big deal, or did you find out that you're not quite sure what the correct answer was later?
I should get to visit too, I have been a few mins over.
That must have been fun! My dad used to play in the leagues and stuff.
Well, you could always try playing at a friends house, or a cousin's house. I love those!
I dont think I could do it, its too scary for me too
make sure you don't fall
Aww, that's so sad. How did your dog react when it was released back into its pen?
I understand.
Ouch, that sounds terrible. Hope everything turned out okay?
How long will that stain?
I bet you were very happy to receive it.
I guess I should acquaint myself with it since I remember it well.
that's great! what for?
That's great!
That sounds like a lot of fun! What are you going to eat?
That's got to be frustrating. Sorry I know how you feel.
That sounds very fun
Oh no that is a little bit embarrassing but it happens to the best of us. Did she remember where the candy was?
Whats the last thing you ate?
watch in hand, what a strange thing to lose what is probably an essential part of your life.
I'm sure it will turn up Bon voyage! :)
Was she okay with that?
That's a shame, but lucky for you she's a good mechanic as well.
oh no, that is not cool, i hope she is ok
Wow how mean. I'm sorry.
Oh wow, that's very nice of her, how did you respond?
I bet you're so happy!
Oh no, I'm sorry, that must have been awful.
Oh okay. How did she handle it?
Oh, no! That is a terrible thing to happen. Hopefully she won't let you see her again anytime soon!
That's great! Happy's are always hard to come by. I'm sure you'll find someone better soon.
Oh that sounds great! I'm glad you got to do that. I haven't been able to visit my family in a couple years now. We haven't technically moved in yet but you get to spend time with your family over the summer
Aw that's so sweet. I bet that was a good time for you and your family!
Oh yeah. I know that can be expensive, but it's always good when you can.
Yeah, I have no doubt the rough places in the roads will just get worse and worse. I'm glad you have the hard places for the future.
Oh I bet that was awkward.
I hope it will be less of a mess at your house.
how did she get sick?
Aww, sounds like she is feeling better. I am sure she will be fine.
That's wonderful to hear! Do you like her recently?
oh it's good, do you have any plans as to what you're doing next?
Oh, that's quite cool! Did he adopt it for a specific reason, or just to have?
I know the feeling. You want to be able to adopt one but can't. How cute is she/him?
Oh no, how big was the storm? Did it destroy the home or the home's belongings?
That makes sense, would make a happy family!
Thats great coding is hard but so worth it
I remember when that all happened with me. I was so frustrated.
How did it go?
That's exciting! I'm sure if you apply and keep the job you'll get it. Best of luck!
Aww, that's sweet. I always think it's cool when you win a race, but I never think about how you spent it. It sounds like you spent it wisely!
That's great! I hope you have a good start, you don't want to be lonely.
That is great that you are the fun one!
She's not young anymore!
Yes, how many people are in the family? I think it's a lot!
I feel the same way! How long you been there?
how old is he?
Well, dogs are just like family. Look how much they love you!
What kind of test? I hope you know something that will make you proud.
I would be proud if I were you. I am just about to start in the fall.
that's amazing. I must be doing well in the interview! What is the job and what makes it interesting?
I'll bet your had a great time. I love doing the customer service portion of the job. I always feel so nervous, but it's so rewarding when I get right down to it.
what movie?
Do you plan on keeping the doll?
That's awful. How did that happen?
You should do cardio and strengthen your abs and hips. The work will pay off!
Oh no! Did she forget to leave us in the dark at all, or did she right in the nick of time?
That's so sweet! I bet you miss her so much.
Do you think there's a chance it will be fixed up so you can work again?
I think the faster you move, the better.
Oh, I know what you mean. I hate when that happens.
I'll bring you some friends :-)
oh no, that's awful
oh thats cool
Oh no! That's the worst! Did you get burned?
Sounds like you're in good shape. What's your goal this year?
I hate when that happens, did you ask him to clean it up?
Sounds like a trustworthy dog! Good for you putting him in such care!
Nice! It's always good to hear that your teammates are getting better as you get better, so it sounds like you're on the path to success.
I'm in the same boat! Most of my free time is spent playing video games!
Congrats! Are you happy about it?
I'm sure you'll be good then!
Sounds like fun! What beach?
I hope you have a wonderful time! It's always better to stay with friends and family.
Yea. I meant the new year, not the old year.
Aww, that's so embarrassing. Did you have to keep the stuff for a special flight?
what a pain!
Thats so good birthday gift! what did you get her?
Well, I'm sorry you had to witness that.
That's interesting. What were those issues?
Tacos are pretty good. What kind of taco was it?
That's great! Nothing is worse than having to work for someone that you like but can't quite understand. Did you get a raise at least?
ok carry on
thats a bummer, i am sure your wife would be mad
I'm sure it will. I'm guessing you have worked really hard to get to this point?
That's a great attitude to have! I'm a strong woman after all, whatever your situation may be, you needn't be ashamed.
Oh, so it was just a hobby for you?
That sounds like a great time.
Oh, no! I hope your luck has changed your life forever.
I am so sorry that happened. You must have been quite upset.
Drive safe! I am sure you got a lot of gifts.
I can understand that
That's great and I hope it continues to work for you.
You are prepared for the difficulties?
That is great, good luck with your education!
That will be fun! How old is he?
That's funny, he could have his own team and wear it around with him
Whats your favourite course in college?
I am very happy for you. I wish you all the best. Keep punching.
Oh, that's exciting! I hope you go for it!
You definitely should be optimistic. But more importantly, you should keep positive, you never know...
Oh no! What happened after?
That's sweet of the clerk too
Good luck. i hope you did well. dont be nervous. you are ready to land.
well be careful
You're welcome. When you're ready, I'm open.
I'm sorry to hear that. I just wish I could find an affordable medicine that worked for me.
I know how you feel. I'm so sorry. Maybe the trip will work itself out for you later in the week or if you pay someone enough.
That's so exciting. What position does he play?
Oh so they are legit now?
aw what happened? did she passed the torch to someone else?
I can see how that would be fun for both of you. Well I hope you do something similar for another cat when they're older!
That's awesome! Congrats!
I got my own when it was all said and done
Sounds like you are looking forward to it as much as I am! I would be excited as well.
It can be a lot worse than a bad breakup. I'm really glad you have you support.
That isn't good. Maybe you need to sleep with the head up?
seeing as how it's twilight in my state, yeah I wouldnt bother either
Jebodiah, I am sure your uncle has a lot of trust funds. Is your uncle a good uncle?
I believe in snake oil.
Aw, that's so hard, I have a pet monkey I keep around for pet bonding. I'm afraid they get stressed when their free and active. How did they bond?
oh good, that's good
Ugh that's no fun! Did you call a tow truck?
I feel you! My brother was almost run over last year while driving his truck
Yeah, that would really suck. I had to be grounded after losing my grandmother during the 2008 financial crisis.
What are some things that you have seen that you would like to see done by the astronauts?
Me too. If not now, when will it happen?
I got your point. I think it is just so much healthier if you get it fresh.
That's a pretty awesome shark to own. I would love to have one of those.
So kind of you. How's daughter in-law?
That's a tricky situation. Do you have to rush and do them in a tight space?
oh god! I would have freaked out!! that is the worst when you don't know what to do! I'm sorry! I hope it work out for you guys
how was your friend with you? is he a normal person or a madman?
No, it's ok. don't be so hard.
That's wonderful that you were able to share that. So many times I wish I had toys to play with.
I am sure that is a wonderful memory.
Oh that sounds exciting. How was it?
oh, congrats
oh yeah that's always fun. where did you go?
I bet that was fun, so happy for you!
Glass eyes can be forever. Well, it's a memory we get to cherish but remember hopefully for the next time we need to "give and take"
I met my husband years ago, we were together for 6 years. I still remember her popping out of her socket to get a laugh while she got drunk.
I love Halloween! What is your favorite part?
That sounds awesome! I can't wait to go to Universal with my friends.
That's good. You must have a good job.
Oh wow that's awful, sorry to hear that.
How did you tell it?
Dang that is a strong move, especially coming from you. But I bet it worked out good for you in the end!
That's good to hear! What made you qualified?
I hope things stay that way for you. It's good to know that even the most challenging of situations can be made bearable if you're willing to work hard.
That is awful. I hope one of you is okay.
That is scary. I would have been running from the police, too.
wow, how amazing are they that you are so accepting of them.
That is so nice!
that is amazing! you will build a career with that!
It's nice to have someone you can trust with your life's energy.
Oh no! How much longer until it turns back on?
haha i bet that is not just a random power out, i am afraid that is actually the sound that scared you the most
Oh, a chance to win a car? What for?
Wow! That's ridiculous! If i were you my response would be the same as yours. No one should have to depend on a ticket company for their money
That's great to hear!
That is a blessing. Did they offer you any sort of compensation?
That sucks. I hope you will win next time.
I'm sorry, what happened?
That is a very good game indeed!
I know, it is hard to make the transition from one to the other, only to discover that the real world is fake.
I don't think that's a good thing. Why don't they do something to stop Russia?
Yeah, I agree. The country is so messed up and the Democrats only care about themselves and keep the country bad.
oh when did that happen?
That's really good though
Really? How did that happen?
ohh i am sorry to hear that. how did they waste your time?
That's terrible. I hope you didn't lose anything important.
Thats terrible! I hate it when that happens. Did you get it fixed for free through warranty or anything?
oh no. that is terrible. your team sucks.
LOLANS! LETS CHEER THE BLOCK!!
ouch, do you apply eye drops?
I hope it is not too bad. I have a feeling I will be feeling better the next day or two.
I have never seen a magic show myself. Did you have fun?
I love tricks like that! Did the rabbit climb up the tree?
Great, I hope you do well.
Are you going to U.Va. or Virginia Tech?
That's great. How did you do?
Excellent! Such a shame to not get out and have a good time.
awwww! did she get everything right?
Aw, you guys sound like a good bunch, nothing better!
Very interesting. How has it been going?
That's really sad. At least you can keep in touch with them through e-mails and facebook
40000? That's a lot of money. Did you call her?
That's so nice of her. It's good you have family that can help out, especially if it's just temporarily.
Was it load of stuff or just drying?
it's always nice to get the feeling that everything is just fine. even if its just a temporary feeling.
That sounds like fun, what did he look like?
That's the best thing that could have happened to you!
that's amazing of them! My sister has her own car too and I am sure it is more than satisfactory!
I am very grateful for my coworkers that still give a damn
i miss my grandma
I know the feeling. Things were going well with my sister until recently.
Oh man! That's really unpleasant.
oh, well thatjas embarrassing jest. I am more than a little surprised
Congratulations on that, that is a big accomplishment!
I am sure she has a lot of work to do but I'm sure she'll make it!
What was it?
Sounds like a lot of fun! I hope you guys have a lot of healing and peace of mind during your trip!
Oh, what a wonderful surprise. I love cats, but I'm thinking about getting a dog. What kind would you recommend?
Litter or chick? I'm sorry to hear that you didn't get to see those little ones!
That is sad. You will have another place to go eventually. What kind of animals?
Ah, so it was her fault then? (I hope)
oh, that sounds fun, what did you guys see? I assume your dog was happy, a lot of people love dogs
That sounds quite scary! I'm so sorry you had to see that.
Oh no! how did that make you feel?
hahaha well glad it wasn't you
That's great! I took a year off after my sophomore year and now I am a teacher. It's paying off after all :)
it's so rewarding to see your hard work pay off i think!
That is wonderful! What type of jewelry? I bet you were happy about that!
Of course. I love those sorts of memories.
Oh man! So frustrating. You need some good mechanics to work for you.
I'm so sorry! I know that would be such a relief.
Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of work.
That's very true. There's no choice but to work with your family.
What a nice surprise! Did you ask him where he went?
What do you like about them?
That's terrible, they should be in jail.
I don't know what you are talking about. I have known a few people who have had that happen and just had to move on.
I bet you were. I was in high school when I first met you. I wish I could go back to be with you.
Definitely, I had a blast doing it.
How long has it been?
When you meet again, always try to reciprocate
That would be terrible. Did you find them?
I am sure it will be fine. The same goes for your wallet.
So your roommate is somewhat of a friend to him. And your best friend is a bit jealous of his friendship with yours. lol
Yeah, you just have to go in and out as you please.
oh thats awful, hameed you if you didnt cooperate
That's good. Sometimes bad things happen when managers are lazy.
Yeah, that's an unusual thing to say. What are you exception?
That's a lot of money! Well, it's good you got them for when you play your concerts again!
A true silver lining to a bad year.
That's great! I bet you are so proud.
Oh, so you trust them with your life information, etc. That is very trusting.
Amen. No one can teach flying. You deserve the present you received.
oh thats wonderful.. it always makes me feel nostalgic
do you still hang out with some of the same friends?
Oh my, did you ever give it a go?
I am sure it was embarrassing but I am very glad it ended well for you.
Oh you don't want to roll into a car then? That's awful, I hope you can find something else to do while you're away!
Dang.. That sounds awful. I hope you was able to get some privacy to be fine.
Oh, that hard. I bet your heart is racing. Is he alright?
I suppose going it alone is never going to be enough. You need to let your partner know how you feel so that they can go from strength to strength in your relationship.
I'm sorry you are feeling uncertain in the interview. Do you have a positive attitude about it?
I am glad you have a positive attitude.
I'm sure you'll be fine. It's been said that moving into a new place is a major life event.
That's wonderful! Do you love your hometown?
poor dog, did he survive the impact?
That will be fun to watch, I am glad it is over for you!
Why? What did you decide to do?
What inspired you to get another?
That's awesome to hear! There's nothing like a true love match- you'll always be thankful for that!
Sounds like your dad is a great dad! lol
That's really great. What has been great?
Congrats! What did you do?
It can transports me too! What kind of music do you like?
i can almost hear your heart racing am i dreaming it upright
I love stuffed animals, I could never get my hands on a real rabbit. what fun!
A lot of people don't respond well to airsickness. I know I'm not.
Oh god! Poor doggy! Hope you're hanging in there!
im sorry :( what happened?
That is such a bummer!
Yeah I would've been pretty furious as well.
Ohh good, what happened to him?
I'm glad you've found time to grieve. I hope your mother has passed away peacefully.
Video games is my escape!
I haven't seen it in years. Maybe I should give it a try.
I'm glad you made it back home.
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe try your luck at an intern or temp agency?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that! That must have been embarrassing. Can it be replaced?
im sorry to hear that. you should get it patched up instantly
oh its so hard to go through that long, i just know that he will get better, i wish you the best of luck, soup or alone
i love noodle soups it was so good
That's frustrating. Are you trying to get the blame?
That's pretty neat. You're lucky.
Do you feel confident?
That sounds exciting. I hope you do well in front of the board.
oh no! did you confront him about it?
I know how you feel. The way a dog feels about his owner.
I know it sucks when someone talks about going on dates, but it's good they let you make your own decisions! That's all we really are as a community. My ex would never do that!
That's sounds great, I'm glad you have a good relationship with him.
Wow you sure did well. you must have studied really hard.
I hope you did well. What are you most excited about?
Oh no! Did it die?
The owner of the dog knows what he's doing. I hope the owner takes responsibility for the dog.
That is kind of you. How long do you visit?
Ah, I take mine too. They're always down to visit.
I will have to try one of her recipes. My kids are always asking for cookie dough adapted to the most diet perishable food.
She is pretty talented too. I am sure she will keep getting better.
That's good it worked out well dear, I hope you have many more years of happy memories to come!
Good you should be feeling so grateful.
I can imagine. Its great that you were patient.
That's incredible! What is he going to be doing in Aerospace?
Sorry to hear that. I have lost both my parents, so I know the pain of a loved one going through something like that.
I know how that feels, I lost both of my parents in one fell swoop. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, its not easy. I'm glad you're holding on.
I know that feeling for sure. It is hard to see people you love go, but it is even harder to support them.
That's amazing, congratulations
That sounds so nice! You must have enjoyed being with your family. Do you like going on vacations?
Yea, you're right. Now you have some alone time to recharge and recharge your brain. Sounds like it!
What does he do?
That's great. You're a great mom and dad team!
Do you love him not being away from you?
Marriage is such a hard thing but so rewarding!
Oh I can just imagine that! I haven't been in 6 weeks! I feel the same way. I didn't go to college until I was 17!
He will have much older Sr. knowing what he went through. Not to mention the many memories little Michael will have with his father through his memories. Such as playing together, watching movies and games and more
That's great! Congrats! I'm sure you'll be a great manager and lead your team to success!
Very true. You should be proud of yourself.
What did you do?
Ouch that's not something I would ever try to do! I can see how that can be frustrating though!
I bet that was so exciting for her! But I am sure you were worried the whole week, too!
I'm sorry, I would've yelled at her.
It's okay if you're not good the first time. Everyone make mistakes! Take it as a lesson and keep your head up! Maybe next time!
At least the planning was fun. It's always good to get out and about.
Wow! Did you tell your friend?
Oh, thats sweet. I had one of those. She was my first girlfriend as a teen. Did you two ever cheat on it?
Did you get scared?
haha police is the last resort
Well, that's really fun of them. You probably needed that as a reminder that you are old.
Oh you are aware that it can be a happy time? Sometimes we have happy phases where we aren't responsible for other people's happiness.
tomorrow is a better day than any other but remember that we are all human and have flaws
I probably should be nicer though, to at least be courteous.
Ugh I would be scared as well, I'm sure you had your alarm on full blast.
Yeah, I hope you weren't hurt! Shadowing someone is hard!
Its hard to give in those times, I was scared you would have to sleep on the street
Its ok, you arent alone
Aww, you must have a very happy wife and a happy life with them! That's sweet and wonderful.
That is really special. I am also expecting a boy, although we don't know for sure. We just know that he is going to be a wonderful addition to the family!
It must have felt very lonely. I am glad you are happy now.
Yes, that is very true. There are some pretty good people on this planet though and I am one of them.
How come? Was it scary new?
I see, I hope it isn't too bad!
Why did you join a group?
It's wonderful to have their love!
I never think about those things so my best guess is you just didn't study hard enough?
It must have been a nerve-wracking moment. I'm glad you're fine!
Oh, what a lovely thing to do. What did you find?
Must feel more precious
I am so happy for your loss. I lost my Grandma too when she was in her forties. I still remember the pains of her passing.
I would assume so since nothing like that has ever happened to me. That is great news.
Hopefully you were not hurt
That falling objects are so annoying and hard to deal with.
Why is that?
Oh okay. I see. Well I hope it isn't too painful for her and that you both make friends again soon!
Oh? That sounds like a lot of work! Do you feel any different than usual?
Ah, that is funny. Lead's are easy to snatch back.
So how does she do it? Does she drive?
That's a nice surprise! She sounds very lucky.
That's good that you are confident, she will be a lot braver.
That's awesome. I do the salsa when I'm not studying so I can get a scholarship in the future.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on in there?
*chuckle* I guess that's a pretty good way to think about it, even if it's probably stressful.
is it in a nice area?
You are most likely referring to your brother's share. In my family, it's quite common for the older brothers to be the breadwinners in the family and so the need for help is more important.
That's really good that you can heal so easily. It's hard to find that kind of a relationship.
That's good that you don't copycats. I wish more people would be honest when it comes to relationships.
That's great. Aerospace is a pretty tough field.
That is so great! That sounds like a lot of talent!
Oh wow, I'm so sorry to hear that! I hope you're prepared!
Sounds like a great plan.
Sorry about that. My condolences to your Grandma.
I'm sorry you had to go through that. At least you have your parents to lean on.
Yup, I was shocked too...until I took all the state and took care of them
That's so unfortunate! I'm really sorry.
Awesome! What kind are you getting?
That's a lot of Halo. I've played a fair bit of other games too, but Halo has always been my favorite.
Aww, that's sad. Do you have a mom to lean on now?
I think its even harder when you are that young and don't understand the attachment more. Im sure you feel much better now that you hear this.
You are lucky! They are gonna have a party for the weekend. You can watch football or soccer or basketball or soccer lol
It's a difficult situation. You wouldn't want to live in that house anyway.
aww that is awesome! i have not come over in ages
That's great, I love to listen to podcasts.
That is so sweet and kind of you to help such a difficult situation.
That's amazing. Formula is the best when it comes to puppies. We just got a new Labrador Retriever, he's loving it so far too!
what did you do?
That is so selfish of you.
What made you waiting?
online or off?
Oh no! I'm so sorry. Do you feel embarassed?
OH. I bet you felt bad. Did you ask her to forget it?
Oh lol. Well I am sure it was ok. Sometimes we wear pajamas to parties because we don't want to expose ourselves or because we don't want to wait for our turns.
Yea! Have fun!
That's pretty terrible. Is there any way you can talk to someone about it?
I would defenitly faint. I am just a little nervous.
Yeah. I had no idea. Poor kid deserves better.
Ah, I see. I know that feeling now. How scary that could be!
Thats so good, so peaceful and meditative.
Ability to socialize and get to new clubs and events is something I have always wanted. I hope to get to like 20 clubs in 2 years.
that is great. Are you going alone?
That sounds amazing! Harry Potter is my favorite author and I've always wanted to go to Japan.
Oh I hope so too! I wish I could see it.
I hope you did get in, that is a great accomplishment!
That's exciting! I imagine that will take some time, so you can enjoy the book in moderation.
Very cool, I've always wanted to get into cooking just for the heck of it. Congrats! I think I might be on to something with my passion for music - acoustic guitars and all - I think i might like it..
how exciting! did you get in on the action?
That's funny, I'd say. Still, an awesome game to play!
I'm so sorry to hear that. I know the feeling when your babies are that small
It's good to hear that he's doing well. Keep his spirits up!
You sound like a good guy. How long have you been together?
How long ago did this happen?
Aww, that's mean! Did you respond by spraying her with Lysine?
Thats a good thing. How did you get it wrong?
How did he punish you?
That is great to hear! I'm sure it will be a great support system as he gets older.
I can see that. Sometimes it takes time.
Well glad it wasn't too expensive!
What is it about your friend that makes you love her so much?
I wish you all the best with that!
Why did you steal things from them?
those are really fun to play with
Sorry to hear that. Do you have to visit him often?
I am glad to hear that! It's a difficult thing to recover from, so sorry to hear that.
i do too
Maybe not, maybe you can have a word of advice for each other.
That was nice of you! I bet the cats are much appreciated now by you
Oh no! I hope you find them, and don't let frustration rule your life.
5
Thats always a good feeling! mine went in May. Did you get a B?
Was it not necessary to towel beach.
Yeah, and that's the best way to make someone feel at ease.
xaaah it feels so good just before bed!!
LOL! Well I bet most people would pass out from that size stomach!
That's a bit terrible. Did she confess to you?
oh sorry to hear that then
Yes, it is frustrating trying to be with people that try to micromanage you.
You both will learn to battle it together.
I know, I have had trouble with that as well. Sometimes I even have to get braces on my own to help!
Dentists aren't too bad, is she able to fix it?
Sometimes it just means something really bad happened to you.
that can be scary?
Oh I am sorry! That is never fun. I have had that happen before. Are you doing it because you are a gym rat or because of something you've done in the past?
Yes, definitely! Thank you for your advice. I really need to try to improve my LSATs.
Wow! That sounds like something I would like to do as well. You should be great!
Yeah it's like you found a new friend.
You should be proud of that
Oh that's awesome! What is the name of the album?
Sounds like you have a lot of possibilities. There's a lot of unknown ahead.
Yeah now I feel bad for you. You tried your best but the internet was not designed for that.
It is calming to think about it. I am not a fan of stress.
I am sure it is, but it makes it hard to keep your cool when it is flying around.
Yea being alone is fun, I am sorry you are going through this.
At least you were loyal to your friends.
Over your control eh - I feel that way sometimes in life. But you'll come to learn to accept it.
Exactly
Wow I am so glad to hear that. It's all about feeling comfortable!
That's really good news. I'm glad to hear that you're getting the support you need to get you on the road to recovery.
Oh nice! What are you going to do?
I'm sure it will, just stay safe!
Wow that does sound horrifying. I could imagine how you felt when you found out what happened.
I guess that means it is brand new again. Hope you feel better.
thats amazing, how lucky! Did any of your stuff get damaged?
You should buy some new carpet.
Oh no! That sounds terrible.
Everything but the knife.....that would have been a very dangerous situation.
I don't have a lot of connection to God other than my family and my pastor. Have you ever had a confession about your lack of Godness?
What are some things that are not sorted out?
That's the worst, how do you calm yourself down?
wine more enjoyable when you are able to relax
What was the name of the game?
It gets easier as you get older. I'm glad you're learning. That makes you resilient.
It must have been very difficult for you. But I think you got the hang of it.
that's too bad. i think the dirt will get all the shine from the bright lights
That's a smart move! I bet you will be ready to go with the plan shortly.
Oh, I see. I'm sorry but I didn't think garlic was that important. I mean, if you're only taking 2 tablespoons I'd still go get some good old fashioned pizza.
I'm not sure what you mean, are you talking about unscrupulous salespeople?
That's horrible, my family is the same way. We're just people we's, we want what's best for our kids. I'm sure you had a good relationship with your family.
Oh that's sweet! I love when kids help themselves.
thats hilarious! I love laughing off stupid things I've seen others do.
I have never heard of Might be Giants. I did hear of them though.
Oh, you must have heard of them.
I bet! I bet you weren't expecting to get it, either.
I've never driven a car. I'm not even sure I know what a pedal!
oh wow, that is horrible
I hope so, too. What a crazy world we live in.
I agree, how did you find out? I don't go door to door.
No kidding. What were you doing?
Ohh thats not good, Have you told him how you feel about it yet?
Aww, I'm so sorry! That must be so hard. I feel it's you who should apologise, not your daughter.
Who are you talking about? Someone selling fake services?
I used to believe all those things. Now I'm the same way. I used to hate going to the gym, now I love it.
grouchy. What is the presentation on?
That's great that you are prepared! Having employees who are happy about your work is always a bonus.
So frustrating, I hate leaving things at home!
I know. I don't want to be in your position too
Did you hitched a ride with your professor's family?
Oh wow, I can only imagine how busy that is. I hope you get good grade though.
Oh my! What are you going to do? Are you scared he's going to do something you don't want him to?
I would have texted family or someone to come over or something. Im sorry you felt that way.
we've all been there, its hard to steal in a crowd
That sounds cool. I always type with a pad and a key.
That's amazing! You must be excited ha
I am so proud of your first birth friend! I am sure with your preparation and the things you are doing right you will be fine!
Yes it was, Christmas was much simpler back then.
Won't there be something bad
That is crazy, did you say something or did he get out?
I'm sorry you went through that, thank god you don't have to worry about that anymore.
Oh that's terrible! Did you catch them?
Oh I know that feeling, getting yelled at for no reason at the worst possible time. I highly suggest you let them know that you noticed. It's their loss at that point.
What kind of candy! Was it anything new?
Oh I have never heard of that, is that a type of candy?
I am so happy for her!
Defenitly, It is ok, these things happen and can't be taken too personally.
Minecraft is a great game. I myself have never played it.
That's quite an achievement, you must be proud.
you had good reasons why? were you scared that there would be accidents?
Maybe he can ask for a grace period so that you can go after he has already cleared?
that is a very good thing. I am glad you are happy
You're very welcome
Eww, that's gross. What did you do?
I stay away from gross foody stuff too. I hate them too.
You will be fine! Your test will be a A. I am sure you will do great!
That's worrying, sleep is very important
