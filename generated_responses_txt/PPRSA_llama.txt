I am sure that must have been very frightening.
That was terrible! I hope you didn't have to go to jail for that!
ye i went to school with a girl from my home
I am fine, I just got home from work and I saw the drunk driver driving away. I was walking home with my dog. I was looking up and I saw a car that was driving very slowly and I thought it was a taxi. I got to the taxi stop and I saw another car coming towards me and I was running away when a taxi stopped and I got into it and the taxi driver called the drunk guy over and he gave him his license number. I hope that the drunk
That sucks. What happened?  Did you guys fight about something?
That sucks, what happened? Did they break up with you?
That sounds like fun! What kind concert was it?
oh wow! thats a bargin price to pay for tickets!
That's a terrible reason for a baby girl to die. I'm so sad that she died like that.
That is terrible.  I wish that was not the way it was.  I had a premature son who is still very healthy and the only issue is he has asthma.  He had to be born early and he's never had medication given to him in his whole life.
That sounds so scary! Did he need stitches?
That's really nice of you. Did the nurse do anything to treat him?
I am so sorry to hear that.  How can you help him?
I know the struggle is real. Hopefully he finds a full-time job soon too
That's so crazy! How badly did he/she hurt them?
That must have been scary! Did they catch them yet or is it still an open investigation?
That's awesome! Where do they live now?
That's really cool! What did they do while you're away?
I would not do anything like that to a co-worker.
That is very interesting how technology has made everything easier, but also more complicated. I don't know if I would have covered the co workers shift. I wouldn't know the right to do. But I know how that can happen.
That's terrible. You could have gotten it cheaper elsewhere.
Yeah, it is always like that when you really believe you are getting something for a certain price, then you are getting a different thing
Yeah, that's the way we should all be.
Yeah, sometimes it's better to let people down gently and not to hurt their feelings. But sometimes it is necessary to tell them the hard way.  It's like when you have to let them go, and then come back later with a better offer
Oh my goodness! That sounds lovely! How old are you?
Yeah, it can be very peaceful and quiet.
That's really tough. Maybe try to join a club or organization?
That sucks. I know what that feels like. I live in the same area and I have to join a group to be friends. I wish you had someone like that.
I would have just called the police on him, and also the store he bought the game from.  I think it would be a good idea to get a good insurance policy so that you can replace your game if something like happens in the future.  And maybe you could also consider talking to a lawyer about the possibility.
I hate when that happens to kids. I wish I had some advice to share with you about it.  What happened?
I'm sure it won't bite or sting you! I bet it's a bit of gross to look back on now.
that's so sweet of her.
I hope they are both doing alright.
I have one coming up! I am excited too!
I agree. I feel it's something that people forget.
That has happened.  I was at a restaurant the other day and I ordered my meal but my food was missing when I got to the counter to have them fix it for me.  I asked and they said that was just an error in their system and that I would get a new one sent to my address asap.  I got a new meal and I got my money as well.  I was so happy that they finally figured out the problem.  It couldnt have happened
Yeah, that happens a lot. I once had a credit card declined because of a technical glitch that left it on my credit card statement for 4 days after the fact, and I ended up having to pay the whole $500 billate the credit card company for the declined card.
I know what that's like. What happened?
it's always nice to see someone through hard times. I hope she gets better.
That makes sense. I've always been one who trusts her intuition.
It is very helpful, especially when dealing with people and animals.
that's so kind of them to throw a surprise.
That is really sweet of your mom.
That's nice of you to be lonely though, it means you care a lot about your girls' well be!
I understand how you might feel lonely, I've had friends like you before, where everyone else is in relationships but you're not and you're just feeling the loneliness
I love kids that way too, but my 6 month old is still a baby and my 18 year old is still a baby.
That's interesting how they turned out.
I love Chick-Fill-Up! What was it?
I know right, that's what happens sometimes, you think the craving will be gone but it comes back when you least need it.
That's a great story! What orphanage did you visit? I love kids!
that's very cool. what type was it?
i know right! it is so hard when parents don't get along. i had a parent and child relationship conflict and they both ended. it was so hard.
You're right though. I've been married to my best friend since 2003. I don't know if I'm ready to let go. I hope it works out. I just don't know if I'm ready to let her in. I'm a 50-year-old man who's been married for 45. I don't think I've ever even kissed another woman before.  I just knew I'd end up breaking up. I just knew I'd end up breaking her
That's terrible, what happened?
It's never easy to look at the mistakes you've made in the future, but I hope you can forgive yourself for those mistakes. It's easy for others to do the forgiveness, though I hope you can. I'm sorry you had to experience that as a kid though
That's terrible. I'm so sorry for you. I hope she's at peace. I know that she would have wanted you to be there. I'm so glad you were there for her.
That's a good thing to hear.
That sounds like a great leader.
That's the right kind! I'm glad to be a part of it.
That sounds so exciting. What happened?
That must have made it tough.
That's awesome! Congratulations! What was that marathon for, if you know!
Yeah! That was one awesome experience! What city was your favorite?
That's great!
That's really sad. Did they say something like that to you or do you think they did? What happened?
That's terrible. What happened? Did they say anything like that before they started dating?
I agree.  There has never been as much to fight against as there has been in recent history.  I hope we see more people standing up against bulling behavior.
It is a good question. I have found that I try to focus my energy on finding solutions.  I try to see things as a problem rather than a solution to the issue at hand.
That's terrible. I'm sorry she's missing her cat.
That is very kind of her, I'm sure she will do alright.
oh yeah thats so much better than the movies lol
I have never been there.
I bet you enjoyed it.
That's great! What kind is he looking at?
That's a really kind thing to do. I've never had my mom's house cleaned and organized. I like that kind of thing. I like my space to myself, but it's nice for my family too
It sounds like you are a neat person. I like how you mention your mom-in law because it is always good to be thankful to those people who care about you.
That is weird. I have had people do that. I guess it can be rude.
I agree.  I've got to respond to my coworkers every day to keep up.  And sometimes I have to respond to emails.  It can be a lot sometimes when people don't respond to my emails.
That is terrible, did they resolve the issue?
That's unfortunate that happened to both you and your sister, I hope that issue will be resolved.
That's terrible. What country were they in?
that's nice
It is so frustrating when people don't realize their own abilities. It can make you feel inadequate and unconfident.
That's great that they came out okay. I'm glad you were there to remind them of that.
That's a pretty typical husband situation.  You guys need to learn to be honest with each other.
I think it is always better to tell him what to do. He can't just let things go and expect them to happen. It would be better if he was happy and you didn't do that to him.
Oh my, that's awful. Did he apologize him later?
That sounds terrible.
I have been doing that for years.
I'm a little jealous, actually. I wish I could do more. I wish to be healthier, and I wish I had someone who cares to be healthy. I wish for myself to be able to help. I wish for the people I love. But sometimes life's hard, too. Sometimes we just get older, or we get older and healthier, but still. We have to try. And sometimes we just get lucky and healthy! I'm lucky, I think.
That is a bitterst feeling. I wish you guys all my happiness and that you can look back on those days with happiness. I miss those days a lot myself.
That is so true, I look at my pictures and feel old, but I know that my life was full and I'm so happy for my kids. I'm proud of them.  It's nice that you have pictures from when they were younger, though it reminds of how you used to do things when you were younger too.  I look at my kids all the time, especially the kids!
Oh, that is awesome! I have a sister and she looks amazing every day of her wedding, and every time. She's a supermodel and supermodeler!
Oh yeah, it was great. I'm sure you will get there eventually. You just have to keep working towards it. I'm sure you're a very capable and beautiful woman!
That's cool. I have never worked alone before. How did you two meet up?
It's nice. I wish you both the best. I hope your husband finds success.
That's okay, it's okay to still enjoy the relationship even if it's not working as planned.
Oh. Well that was awkward.
That is awesome. What are you and the family looking for in the condo
I bet it's nice.
I love that word.  What kind was it?  Was it French?
That is a bummer, did she respond quickly enough? I would have left without going back to her house.  What was the plan to go for brunch?
Oh, I bet that was so scary!  Did you call the grocery store police to report him to?
I would have asked the police to come
Yeah I did, what happened?
That is horrible.  I am sorry.  I hope she is okay.
I bet she saw that!  What happened?
Oh my goodness, what happened there. I hope you made it home in the same clothes as your work attire.
I did not hear.
It did, I am sorry to hear
Oh, wow! Did you guess? I bet! Did he or her?
that sounds pretty interesting. I bet you guys had some wild times! Did you end up hanging out again?
I'm happy you have gifts from your husband.
I love surprises like that.  It shows that you care and want to make an effort to do so much.
oh that sucks that happened to me last year
Oh, really good! What kind is the work they're doing here?
What happened?
That's crazy! What happened after?
That's awful. Did you let him off that easy?
I would feel the way you feel.
its normal for a few things to go out of order sometimes
That's the truth! You'd think it's easier to call and ask when things are broken or something, but people don't think that way.
That's terrible! Did you tell your friend?
I feel you, I once told a friend that her boyfriend had made a pass at me and she never told me that her boyfriend was her financial partner and that she loved him.
that's cute!
that's funny, I would have done that too
That sounds amazing! I bet you're really excited!
It should be very nice!
That's a good point. She's so smart and capable.
I remember that. You were so proud of her.  What did you do with her money?
I totally get that.  It can be frustrating.
You should have a "No Store" sign on your door.
That's really cool! What a lucky day! Did you guys already know?
that must be amazing! i wish you the best.
That's really interesting. What kind of flow are we talking?
Yeah, I am! It is a very common practice in business meetings and presentations.
Yeah! It is.  I had to leave my company recently.  I felt like I left behind my friends and colleagues.  But then I started to think about why they were so happy to leave and it wasn't so bad.  They just didn't like where the money was going and were not happy to keep working.  I am trying to do something similar now.
It really makes sense. I donot know why.
That was a fun time.
That must have been exciting.
That's really cool, what happened? Was it your first Mother's day?
That sounds wonderful! How many did you have?
It went wrong for me when my car crashed into another
I don't know.  It just happened.  I guess I'll just have to keep trying.
I am always looking over my shoulders and waiting for people to yell at me. I wish they had given me any feedback. I am a teacher and I am always worried about my students. I am always trying my way of things to make sure I am doing the right way to make them learn and not to make them feel bad about themselves.
Yeah, that's great.  What's the baby going to name them selfs?
I'm so happy for them. I'm a single mother myself and I would be so nervous. I would be too if I found out.
I was watching Netflix! I'm so lazy!
I watched it! I loved it! The atmosphere of it is so creepy. I wish I lived in Germany so badly.
I have never heard about it. I will look into it.
i hate it, when they say unemployment, it's not the best situation.
That's good news. What happened next?
Oh man. That is the worst part of traffic. I hate how congested the streets can be.
That's no good at all!
that's terrible
Yeah, I saw that one too.  I'm glad I'm not that young again!
That's cool. I have to ask though did she actually go on to get a degree in her field of study?
That's awesome! I'm glad to have friends like you that can be such supportive friends.  What kind are the two kids of?
That sucks! What are you growing there?
That must be frustrating. I hope you can figure out the issue soon.
That's so awesome! What breed is it gonna be?
That's great news! I'm sure the dog will be wonderful!
Yeah thats cool, but how did they pay bills?
I wish I had my parents.
Yeah, but sometimes they're not the right people for us.  I don't want to be around my parents all the time, so I choose when and where.  I just found that sometimes they can be a little too expensive.  So, I moved out and started a life.
That sounds like you are on the path to independence.
I can understand that.
That's great that you're thinking about the sacrifices that people make.
That sounds exciting. What are your majors in?
That sounds awesome! What major are you going for?
oh, i was thinking of doing something about it
I agree, it is. I think we should all just stand together. It is a problem that affects us and others.
That's really kind. It's always hard to get a place when you're young
That's so cool! What neighborhood are you looking at?
it's great to hear that.
That was a fun place.
I agree with that era, they have some good nostalgic memories.
That was funny. I bet you were a teenager then.
It's great how nostalgic things have become for us today
I was born 2 months ago, so I am only about to enter my teenage years
I hate bullies. They are the worst!
I agree. I don't like them either. Sometimes they are kids but other times they are adults. I like kids better because they are so innocent.
I bet you're a huge fan! What movie was it about this time around?
That's pretty weird how you feel about movies, but yeah, it was definitely a good movie. I was a little worried about the plot.
Oh that's really not something to be mad. They are just taking it for emergencies.
That's terrible, you should be able to get your money back. Do you have to go back and get it from them again.
I hate to hear people complaining.
It is not that common to clean in the business environment. I work at a hospital and my doctors wife works there too.
That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss.
That is terrible.  I am so sorry.  I am so sorry.  My friend died of cancer too.  She was  8 years old.  She was so full of love for life.
That's sad. I've lost my sister to cancer and her daughter is still trying to cope with her death.
Yeah that was hard, but that was my first.
That must have been tough. Did he get you a car for free or was it an expense you had to cover yourself.
Yeah thats awesome that someone helped you out
It really is. It really does. I feel like it's hard to find good people like them nowadays though
i dont remember any thing like this.
I haven't. I don't celebrate birthdays.
Oh, that was so bad! Did anyone call the power company to report it?
That's crazy. I hate when the power goes out and you have candles to use as fire.
That's so cool! What did you study on that exam?
That's awesome. I've always wanted to be a psychology major. I'm so impressed that you did that.
I do have a cat.  He's really sick though. I am going through his vet.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
I have never been that old before graduation day.  Congratulations!
That's a pretty accomplishment.  What year?
That sucks. I hope they were okay.
I am sorry.  That sounds awful.  I hope things get better for you.
Oh yeah, that's awesome. What is he in the business of?
That sounds amazing. He's got to have some great skills to be so successful at such a young age.
That's okay, pack rats can be a little bit.
That was such sweet of your parents. I know how packrats people can get. I think you should try to be kinder to them next time they talk about it. They are just stressed about their health and all. I'm sure they would understand.
I feel bad that she is passing on the necklace.
I love old songs on the radio. I can get a lot of nostalgia.
I totally agree, I think music has that power.
That's terrible. I'm sure he's happy and at rest.
Oh no, that's terrible.  My cat crossed the street yesterday and I'm worried he's going to do the same.
Oh, yeah. I lost mine too. I feel for you.
That is terrible. I lost a dog last year. It was a long and hard time.
That's not good, what happened after?
It was oyster season and I just wanted to try it out.
That sounds pretty funny. I bet that it was hilarious. Did you guys hang up your life?
Oh my goodness! What kind of friend is that?
That's terrible. Did he want a break? Or was it just you?
That sucks. Do you think it could work?
It's always good to consider the potential.  But, at the end of the day you have to think about yourself too. I think I will talk to my dad and see what his opinion is on this whole thing.
I can understand the feeling. I am happy my kids will be close to family
Oh, that is terrible. Why wouldn't she?  She could be anyone. I mean, she's got everything she could ever want.
I understand how you're feel. It will happen. You just need time.
Oh, that sounds good. What is she like? Have a special someone?
I love the feeling when you are really ready for a relationship.
ye,my best birthday was with my dad, and my most worst was with my friend,they got into some fight
Yeah, that does make me jealous a little.  I have never been married and have never been in love.  I think I am going to be a bachelor.  I know this is weird talking about myself like I'm a bachelor, but I feel so lonely and lonely feels.  I have a lot of great friends, though so maybe I should go out and celebrate with some guys.  I don't think that's going to work, though because they all get really drunk with
I have never heard of such thing before. How does it work?
That can be annoying, but at the end, you're both happy and you can move past the disagreement
That's scary. Did you call the police?
It sounds scary. I hope everything was fine.
It is so good
It's always nice to have some relaxation and warmth on a cold day
That's so awesome. I have a mom like that too, but mine's been deceased so I don't have to worry about money anymore
I have the feeling we all do the same.
i bet. What are you going through now?
I failed because I didn't study enough. I'm really upset about it.
That's so nice of your mother! How old was she when she bought the car for the first time?
That's very kind of your. How did she help you buy the car? Was she helping you with the money?
That's terrible. Maybe try to move on. There are plenty of other people out in there waiting to be loved by.
That is tough, I hope you get over this soon.
I do some exercise.  I am going to the gym tomorrow.
Yes I was fired from my last company. I am going to a new country to work. I am nervous about it. But I know I have to do what I have to. I am going to make a new country for the people I will be working with.
That is great! What are your plans after graduating from college?
That's cool. I've always wanted to study something environmental
That is crazy! I love a little thriller horror movie, what kind of scary things frighten you?
I hope I don't have the same problem one day.
I'm not very good with self control. I get bored with myself. I'd be out all day watching a movie
I have a weakness for the "creepy abandoned asylms" movies. I've seen them all multiple times over the years.
That is a sad time for us all.
What are his views?
That sounds pretty cool. What major are they going into?  I'm a master's myself. I'm thinking I want to be in education.
that's a great choice, you'll probably have a lot of fun in college.
That's so nice. I've been feeling that way to my girlfriend as well, but I think she is a little bit more of an idiot than me.
That sounds great! I wish you the very best and I am sure everything works out for the best for you.
I do love going through old family pictures. I love going to the old antique store and I like looking at old family pictures
That's so cool. I love looking at old family pictures. I have a lot of old family pictures from the 70's and I love to flip through them and hear about my grandparents' childhood.
I hate jealousy. How can you feel jealous of her? He's not even even in the picture.
That's tough. Have you tried talking to him and getting her perspective on the situation?
That is a long time since I last spoke.
That is quite a long sentence. I assume you are asking about how long?
I know how that feels. It must have been hard for her to deal with.
I hate when people are inconsiderate.  I hope your mom gets the rest of her money soon.
It's sad how people don't have the empathy to care about others health
That is terrible.  I hope he gets well soon.
That's awesome! What kind of car? I have always been wanting to own a Mustang!  I love Mustang!
I get it, but you should be happy for him.
That sounds like you are in love!
That sounds like you've really found someone you're serious with.  I've found someone I really care about too, but I think I'm ready to move forward and get into that level of relationship.  I'm just not ready yet though.
That's really cool. What kind family?
That's good. I'm very close to all of my family. We all love eachother.
I remember that. That was a long time ago
That's okay! It's just a card.
That would have been embarrassing. Did anyone help find your trunks?
oh no that must've been really embarrassing.  Did anyone ever make you pay back for it though?
That's awesome. What are you going to study next?
That's cool. I don't think I could handle the stress though.  How far away is your school?
Did everything go okay?
That's nice. Did you get anything?
Oh? Why is that.
Oh man, that would be boring, but on a good level? I mean, you can't go too crazy.  Do you have anything to keep you from being too lazy and bored?  Like, a hobby to keep yourself occupied?
I bet. What are the chances that you win it?
That's awesome! I have one but don't really get to play much.
That is true.  I always thought it was the kids who were the ones that ate the junk.  But now that my kids are growing up, I see that they are the ones who have to deal with the junk.
That's cool! I don't get hoarder. Do you hoarde food too, I love to hoard.
That's great. I love when people come back from time travel.
I love my mom
I would not have let you touch your face!
Oh no! That's disgusting. Did you clean it up?
That can be frustrating. What did they do?
oh man thats a tough. I have missed out. I am a little older and have a lot more experience but still I am not as confident as I was at 25.
oh man, that's tough. I'm sorry to here that. My mother passed away last year and I was really close with her. I know I'll miss her, but I think I'll be okay. Do you think your relationship will get strained with her grieving about yours? I know I would have if mine had to pass too soon.
It was sad. I hope she recovered quickly. She must have been very sad.
That sounds good. What kind was it?
I can see that you are a genius. I am a bit jealous. I am not.
Yeah, that happens. It's like they're trying to avoid each other.
That sucks.  I would have cheated.  But you never cheated.  You kept it clean and honest.  I'm glad to hear that it worked for both you.
That's really cool. It's not like you felt lonely for long, right.
That's a billy badger story!
I'm sorry to see that he's not responsible enough to take care of a car.
I think I understand. I would be jealous, and worried, too.
I don't, but I have heard of it.  I don't know if she's worth dating though.  I would hope she's good.  I think she's good.  I think she's worth it.
I have nothing to say. I think you should have something
That must have been something terrible.
yea its a pretty bad habit
I like my coffee very strong and it always comes out wrong.
That's a big accomplishment. Congrats! What degree did he get in the end of the week's?
That's awesome. I'm happy you could be there.  What's he going into? Medicine or law?
That's a bummer. Did you get it?
That must have been very frustrating
It's always something right?
That's a little bit rude. I don't get it either. They should have to get my order right. I guess they don't!
That is pretty typical.
That's a bit harsh, right there in public.
It is so gross!
Oh, I know what you mean! I have been wearing my flip flopper for the first 2 years.
its always the same. I always follow the same recipe
That makes sense, how do you do that?
I bet! That sounds so exciting!
That sounds like fun. I bet you guys were excited!
It really stings to have your child fail.
That's terrible.
That's great you were so lucky. I pray every single day.
I am very bad at math too. I'm a math teacher, I've always found that I'm the worst teacher in the math department at my university lol
That's pretty cool. Did he have any hearing aids on him as I would have been worried.
Yeah, that was a great story. He's a pretty amazing person.
It was a terrible day for us
That's awful. What were you hitching for?
That must have felt great. How long has your son been born to you?
Wow, that's crazy long labor. What kind of woman did that last labour last night with your baby boy in her?
that would be creepy.  What happens?
I am shocked.  I would be too.  I would be looking for the camera to see him.  I am shocked that it is Michael.  I thought it might have been the ghost.
That's terrible. How did he get there of all people?
That sucks.
That's very good! I bet you're very happy for your son. I bet you worked really hard too!
I am happy for you too!
yeh thats kinda cool that you are ready for his birth
That's good to hear he will be okay!
That sounds like quite an experience.  Did you run for your car?
I think Batman is a cat, so maybe you should steal from a cat instead!
I agree with you. I'd probably be homeless right now too if I was a poor single black homeless man like I am right now.
You're a very lucky person to be blessed.
I hate tripping.
That is awesome. I love it when people can just laugh at themselves and move forward.
I agree. I've been listening to his music since I was 17.
It's awesome how people are still making music
that sucks. i am sorry you had to go. i had to give away a few years old labrador a few months later
I had to buy new food for my dog. It was really expensive.
What's your income level like?
You're right, I do feel for them. I just can't understand it when someone is so selfish
Oh, that's terrible! How bad did you do it?
I don't know if I believe you can forgive you. I think it takes a long to realize you were wrong to forgive you. I would probably want to stay away from you.
That is a great idea. I like to do things to people who treat others badly. I like the feeling. I will have to do it again.
I am sorry that happened
oh no! that sucks. how old is she? 17?
That sucks, but at least she didn't have to deal with you lol
It's great that he had a supportive wife! How old are you?
that's really cool that he took only a few sick days off, he must have been tired all the time he worked there
That's amazing. What kind of work does he do.
I love Facebook, but sometimes I wish people wouldn just tell you the truth.
That's crazy! Did she apologize to you?
That was very rude. Did you tell the truth?
I know how you felt.  It was hard for you right?
That sucks. It's a lot of work to make sure that's clean. I don't think it should ever happen. It should be all girls or just girls and women's.
That's terrible! Are you still having nightmares about it?
that's awesome
That sounds like a nice way to go about education, I hope you had a good experience with her. Did you end up going to public school again?  I went for 2 years before homeschooking. It can work out, but I think some parents just can't seem to find the time or energy to get up off their couch and go.
That's a bitterspring. I'm glad he passed.
I agree with that.
Oh I understand. That must have taken courage and resilience
That sounds awesome.  What kind was that of?
I would tell them, they have a problem.
I'm sure it's not easy to deal with that kind of situation.
that's a bumpy start
That must have been scary.
It is a good achievement
That's great! What's next? Are you going to go back?
That sounds awesome! I've always wanted to go back. What made the decision to go back?  Did you want to go to school?
That's great, what made you decide on the new place
That is amazing. I hope you continue to work hard at home. You must feel proud about your new home as well
Oh no!  That was scary.  Why didn't anyone tell you it was a medical condition?
I am sure it had nothing to with you
That sounds fun! What kind music do you like?
I love that too, especially rock.
that sounds like fun
That's awesome! I hope you get FarCry 5! I hope you get your new gaming game too!  You should be able to play FarCry 5 as soon as possible, and get the new gaming game at some point soon.
I hope you keep doing great work!
I hope you keep doing well
that will be interesting to watch.
That's terrible. Did they ask why you failed?
I know right? I'm a little uncomfortable myself. I know exactly why I am not allowed to, but I am determined to get a driving test pass today.
I feel you. I get so anxious and nervous driving backwards. I think I might have gotten used enough driving backwards to be okay.
That sounds like you have had an amazing journey. What brought about all of this?
I can't believe how far you have come since then. That must be really great.
That's great news! Congrats on turning over to the right place to get help to stay on track and you're doing it!
i hope not.
oh no! that would be a creepy situation!
Oh wow, I hope so too! You're really hoping for it too. I'm sure you're going over all the possibilities in your mind to make sure you're prepared. It's a scary job losing your job, but I hope he does well in the end!
That's good! I'm glad to see he's still looking. I've been looking for a job for months. It's hard when you're working. But hopefully soon you'll both be working again. I'm a little jealous of your job! I've never really been interested in that kind of work.
That's so scary! What happened?
That's crazy! Was it scary to the extent that it scared away your work?
That's nice! What kind degree is that in?
That's great! Congratulations!
That can be really scary! I have been in a couple but not a wreck itself but I did have to deal with a bunch of other cars crashing.
Yeah, I have been in one.  I was driving with some kids in the car.
Oh yeah, I was in one.  I'm a little aggressive and I'm a little aggressive sometimes.  I got into one and it was a guy.
that's so cool
I haven't, I'm curious though.  What's it about?  I'll look into it.  Do you have a favorite EverQuest? I haven't either, I'm not really sure what to think.
Oh man I haven! I loved that. I played it a lot.
I haven't.  I haven't been there in a while but I'm always looking to go there!
Yeah, I love that one. They're the only place in Texas for me.  I haven't tried the new one, but it's just a slider. I love the one they make at home too.
yea, i once had one, but it was a few years back
i have never had that. what you saw?
I have not rode one yet, but I think I might. What is it called?
I have never. I am not sure why you would want that.
That must've been hard on your friend.
That must've been hard, but I bet it's good for you to have stood your ground like that.  How long have you been married to?
I do too.  Are you nervous?
That must be nice! I hope you can spend some time with them while you are away!
That must have been really hard for her.
Yeah she worked hard for that!
Oh man. That is a lot to deal with. I am sure you are relieved though. I bet you were for a while there.
That is nice! What is his breed?
Oh great! German Shepherd's are great dogs. I'm glad you were happy.
That sounds kinda awkward.
Oh wow, what a relief. Did you end up with her?
That's so rude.  What would you have done if you were home?
That's no good. What would you have done if she hadnt kept you waiting?
That is the only day that comes around every month for me, so I'm super stoked.
that's good you have kids. what movies
That's too bad! Snow is my favorite thing. Did you still go anyway?
That sounds scary.  I hope you are okay.  I hate driving in the snow.
That is so scary!  I hope the next time you do travel you have a safe route to follow.
I am sure. How did you cope with it?
I agree it does get easier. But it's always good to know your parents history.
It can be disappointing. I had planned out the whole day to go to the beach and it turned out it was cancelled because of the weather.
That is funny!  I have never gone to beach with rain!
That's so sweet! Did everyone like it?
That's awesome! What happened next after that party?
I know how you feel.  How did you feel guilty about it?
That's okay, it happened to the best. It was just a silly mistake.
That can be very lonely, I bet. What kind of work was she in charge? I hope you are not lonely anymore. Is there anyone else she is traveling with?
Oh that sucks. Hopefully you can make the time pass quickly. Do anything fun with it?
That sucks.  Did you find another apartment?
I have been in the same situation before.  I was moving out of state, but they had a "no dogs allowed" policy.
That's so awesome! What did she get you with your money?
oh wow! That must have been great. What kind laptop?  Was it a budget laptop or a high-end laptop?
I bet that was fun! What was your experience like?  Did you have any issues?
I am so jealous of you.. I have never gone on that ride
Oh, I'm sure she's not interested with him.
Yeah, that can happen anytime you go out. You can't help it sometimes. I guess it wasn't the best timing though..
That's the worst! What kind of dog is that?
Oh my goodness!  What did you do?
That did take long. Congraduate in what? I'm curious!
Yeah, it is nice to finally accomplish things you have been putting off
That's awful. Did you confront the other girl about it?  I would be!
That's great you realized that mistake quickly and you handled yourself.
That's pretty rad. Did you get mad at him?
That's cool. I love watching those videos online
I am so sorry. What happened to your pet?
Oh no. That is so heartbreaking. What happened to him?
Oh no!
That sounds like your dog chewed on the carpet.
I can understand that. I used to do that too. I used to feel mean to my mom and my friends, but then I realized that I needed to change. I started volunteering for my school and helping out my mom and my friends and now they love to do stuff for us.  We all just became best of friends.
That is good that the church has a confession.
That was fun! Where you in?
I love the feeling you're talking about! What was your name?
I know that feeling.
I know. It really makes you think about life.
That sucks.  I had a guy that I thought was great.  He turned out terrible.
That is true, it makes you look at people you really admire in the same light again. I have to say I have a bit more faith now that I am 38, and can look at people more objectively.
I remember that! We had a tornado last summer. I was scared too. I just ran inside the car with my mom.
That's awful.
That makes sense.
that is pretty common for adults.
That's great to hear about. You can't let yourself get too worked out over things you said, but if it's really good to talk, that's okay, it's good.
That's really cool. Where are you moving to?  Are you moving for school or just to work?
I agree that culture shock is a big thing to worry about, but it's a great opportunity to see the world and be exposed.
What kind is that? Is it something scary or not?
That's a pretty cool phone! How old were they when they gave you it?
Oh wow that must have been exciting
That's awesome. I'm so proud of you guys for being so supportive of each other and being so understanding of all things.  I'm a bit jealous, I've always wanted to be a stay-at-home-mom.
That's great that you have a good husband. How long is the baby?  6 weeks?  12 weeks?
That is a problem. Are you able to drive during daylight hours?
That is terrible!  Do you think you can still drive safely?  Do you need to ask someone else for driving assistance at all?  I hope you get your vision fixed.
I know, it's so annoying.
Oh no. I'm so sorry that happened to you. I hate when that happens too. I'm sure it was frustrating and made you want to be angry at the people around you.
That is so frustrating, but also necessary to protect your child from potential harm, I hope everything works itself and that the baby gets some rest soon. I've been there, too...it can be a little scary sometimes.
That's terrible, how old are your baby? I've had to yell a lot, but not as often, but sometimes to calm him down when he's having trouble sleeping.
I do that with my wife, we have two dogs.
Yeah, but they're all out swimming and playing around the neighborhood.  They have a pool, and a swing set.
That's so cool. What are they going to do?
It's amazing how kids can just grow up.
That's the best feeling right there, having all bills taken care for for a month!
Yeah, that's what you work for, right? You have no money to pay bills, and you're stuck.
Oh, wow. That's amazing. I wish I studied like hard for my bar, I think I would have passed if it weren't for my lack.
That's great news! Congrats on your success!
That is nice to know that the government or organization is covering the cost for a family
That's cool. I don't think I've ever heard of anything cool that you could spend the rest of the money on.
That's a little harsh. Maybe you could talk to a counselor about that?
Oh wow. Did he not realize? He can be mean sometimes. He needs to learn to apologize more often instead of being so rude
I know! I got mine when I was 16 too!
I was afraid of being in an accident, too. My dad was really hurt once, and it made me realize that driving was scary too.  I was afraid of driving too much until my husband told me about how he drove without a license, and how he drove without a license for years before getting his license.
I am not sure what to do with tomato.
That sounds cool. I bet it took a lot to expect it. I'm always trying new ways of growing plants.
I was surprised when I saw tomatoes grow!
Oh yeah. I was in the same area yesterday and it seemed like every 2 seconds someone slammed into me!
That sounds like the usual traffic jam.
What game?
I am a big fan of video games. I met him through a game.
oh man i dont know. what happened?
Yeah, I am good.  I just want people who are kind and don't judge each other. I want to be around good people.
I'm sorry, but why did you have that?
That's great! I'm glad to hear that things worked out for you.
I'm sorry, how is that possible?  She has to pay a large sum of money to attend a 4 year school?
That's awesome. I have always wanted to go back to school, but didn't think I needed it anymore with my career path set out
That's horrible! Did you clean up?
Oh man. That's the worst part.
That's awesome! What a lovely husband you must have.
I agree. I think the most important person in the world is the one you are with when you are with.
That's pretty annoying
That's the kind of thing that could happen, right?
I do too. What's going well for you?
That sounds nice! What kind of work do you do?
It is nice. I work at home.
That's awesome! I'm sure you'll have a blast.
That's so funny! I love parties that surprise people like that! Did you feel embarrassed for a second there?
i know how you feel. I'm so embarrassed about the fact that I have a 12-year-old son who's never even seen the movie he loves! I'm working on getting him to watch "The Dark Knight".
That's terrible, did she say something specific about the money?
Oh yeah? Where is San Antonio?
oh yeah it's awesome
oh wow congratulations! that's awesome
That's awesome! Congradulations!  What field of science or study did they graduate in?  I hope they have a job lined out.
That is terrible. I hate people throwing up on my floor or in my face.
Oh man, I've thrown up after drinking. What happened?
I hate lego.  What happened?
I hate stepping on my son's toys.
That's so funny!  How did she enjoy it though?
I love Qdubbos queso! I haven't had it in a while either!  I think it's time for me to go up north!
I'm glad he could speak multiple languages at 3 years old.  That's quite amazing!
That sounds like amazing abilities. I can't imagine. I hope they continue to develop and become even more skilled in languages.
That's very kind of him
That's good.  I have to admit, I was a huge football player in highschool.  I'm glad he is good enough.
That sounds amazing!  What a day!  How did he score three goals in one day of soccer practice?
Yeah! Soccer game can bring you together.
I know how you felt.
I feel for ya, dude. Sometimes you gotta try the "oldie but goodie" or a story that's been kinda told before. I guess sometimes you just gotta suck it up.
That sucks.  How old is she?
That's great that you have dogs.
Oh, wow. That must have been really nice of them! What type were they?
That's nice. I'm glad you appreciated them.
I'm sure that is annoying.
I understand, I have a dog and I know what you are talking about. My dog is so much work.
ohh that's so weird
I hope everything works out for you!
Yeah that's the way to do a wedding shot
I bet you guys are having some fun times since moving away from your hometown.  I am sure your wedding picture will be a fun conversation piece
What happened?  Did your parents get divorced?
What happened to your mom? I'm so so sorry. I'm so here with you on that. I know that's a tough time.  I'm sure she's in a good place. I know how that feels.
That can be nerve wrecking.  Did you get it?
That's good. Sometimes the wait can be stressful. I'm glad you kept your hopes up. It's good to keep your mind on what could go wrong and focus on what could go right.
That's terrible! What's wrong with her?
That must be tough.  What do you do to keep the peace of a young one?
That's great! What is it for cooking?
That's great. Good for you.
Oh that sounds great! How much money made? Was that your main source or a side?
That's great! How much money made you?
That sounds so nice. I love how He loves us.
That is really nice of God.  What kind are you and what kind of things do they do for you?  I am glad to hear you have good people.  I am 12.  What kind of things do your do?  I am not good with the computer so much but sometimes my friends will send pictures and videos.  I am a pretty good boy so I hope to get good friends too
Oh, sorry.  How did you punish him?
Oh wow, that's tough, did you talk about why he did that?
I know right. I feel you.
I know how you feel about this situation.
That sounds great! How old were you?  Did they offer you the job?
Oh, you're lucky!
Oh that must've brought back good memories. What age were you when it happened?
that sucks
I agree, I think they have a bad idea of what's best for their child.
It's a waste of money to buy all the supplies that you need to have for school.  I think they just make money by selling it
You did the kitten a favor!
I would love a pet.  Is he healthy enough to go outside now?
That can be tough.  I am a single parent myself, and I hate having to deal with teenagers!
Yeah, they have to figure out their own ways.
I love it!
That's great news!  Congrats!
I hope he got the treatment he needed.
That is awful, I hope he gets back to normal soon.
oh that is funny! did you get it from her?
I would feel the same way if someone bought me chocolate and then I ended up eating it.
I'm sure it was an honest person.
That sucks, did you try talking to them about it?
That's a beautiful country
I've had seasick spells of my own, but I think you are ready for this!
That's great. What happened?
What happened?  Was she sick?  Did something terrible happen?
That's the most exciting part of a story like this. What breed of dog was it?
That's so scary. What kind dog was it?
That is terrible.  What happened?
That is so very sad.  I am so sorry.  I am so sorry.  I lost mine recently.  He was a great husband to me and an even great father.  He was very sick for a few years before he passed.  He was a great man and I will miss him.
I bet that was fun!
That's great! I bet you guys are excited about that.
I am so sorry. What did you lose?
That's a bit excessive, but I get why. It's hard when someone you care about passes.
That's exciting! What did you get?
That's good news. What award was you looking to receive?
I agree, it sounds like you've found the perfect place to work at this stage.
I am happy, I hope it works well. I am not worried.
I feel you. It's like your body is screaming at your mind saying "YOU'RE NOT GOING THERE!
I have. I think that's the best.
That is true.  I know that I'm not perfect,  but I just want my kids to be happy.  And I know that I'm not gonna let them down.  What is perfect?
That's not good for anyone involved with children, especially toddlers.  I would make sure to teach them that they need to stay on a path or not go off a path and stay on a path that is marked with signs.  You could also teach them how to hold a leash correctly, which is a sign of responsibility and helps prevent accidents with children and pets and other animals.  You might need to also make it clear what happens when a child is off a leash.
That can happen. What happens when you try talking? Do people ignore? Do people not listen?
Yeah that sucks. You need to talk to them about how you feel. It's a big deal!
That's sad. How old is your daughter?
That sounds like fun! I used to go shopping with a girl all the time.
It is going to be fun! Where you going?  I am going to the Rockies.  Have you ever been?
It is going to be great! What national parks will you be visiting?  I am so jealous!
That must have been gross!  Did you catch her?
Oh my gosh that is ridiculous. I hope she wasnt hurt.
That is great! I am happy for you.
I hope it's not too stressful.
Oh, you did okay? Did they offer you the job?
That is a good way to go.
I'm too. What keeps you so faithful?
I like to be a faithful partner too.
That's very sweet of someone to do that.  How do you thank people like that?  Is it a habit you get into?
That was a very long text.
That sounds like you had a good day. What happened?
That was a very unusual response. What's that supposed mean?
I love gardening! What plants are you planting?
That's a great idea. I have never been one for the traditional kind of things.
That is the worst.
That's a bummer! What kind did you order?
Yeah, I think so.
I am sorry to hear that. What was distressing about that event?
i feel you. I had a really bad breakup last year and it made it hard for me.
That's awesome. That's what reps do.
It's awesome when your kids do things well.  What kind of organization was this?
I'm sorry to hear that! Have you tried calling her friends to hang out?
that is sad.
I love take out too. What city has the favorite take out?
Yeah, but it's a little too late. I have no time to wait.
Oh yeah that's cool. What kind is the gym?
That's great that you can use it for exercise. Do you have kids?
That sounds pretty sweet.  Was it a small or large one?
ohhh that's cool.  Did you know it before he threw you the surprise?
That's good to hear! What was she for?  Did you guys have a long time apart?
That's good. How was it over?
I'm sorry. What happened?
I'm so glad you're okay, that's really tough. My mom passed away when my father and I were kids, so I know that loss is something you never want to experience. I hope your experience didn be too hard for you. I know I didn't have to go through it, but I know that many did, so I know what it's like and how to help someone through it.
That's so cool! What kind was the sex of?
That's great news! Congats on the new addition! I have a little boy myself, so I'm glad you're excited!
That must be tough. I don't really understand it.
That's a nice thing to say.
That sounds pretty cool.
I would, but I'm a car enthusiast and I have a passion for cars.
That is the right attitude.  I agree today is going to be a great day.
I know how you feel about that, but sometimes things go wrong.
Did you do anything fun while looking after her?
I bet. She sounds like you care a lot.
That's very interesting! I've always been fascinated by the way that our world can go from one day of the year being sunny and the next it's completely snowing!
That's really cool. I haven't thought about God existing in that light before.
I love my daughters. What kind songs does your daughter sing?
I love my 13 year-old son singing. He's got a good range.
That's terrible, why not try to build up some self-esteem first?
Oh, that is sad to see that way things went that far down.  It takes a lot of courage to do things like that.  I think you could still try, even if you don't love him.  Maybe you're just waiting for the right person to come along.  Maybe you just need to focus more on yourself and try to get your life to get back to a point that makes it easier.
That's good! What kind are the options?
I have to start a tech business soon!
That sucks. Do you have anyone here to talk to?
I'm sure it'll be alright. You'll find a new routine soon. You don't know how hard it can be. It'll be better in time.
That's terrible. Did you tell them?
I think dinosaurs are awesome creatures
I know right?!
Oh, well I'm sure it will come back to you.  I'm sure you won't be eating any more of that stuff.
Oh that's amazing!  What kind was it?
I can understand why!
Yeah dogs can be a pain. They are always trying something new and they can wake everyone in the house.
I can understand why she wouldn be.  She's a dog.
That's frustrating. Did you find it anywhere?
That stinks. Did it smell bad or was there some stain on it?
That's awesome! How old were you when you last saw them?
Oh wow, That's great! You guys should totally take them out for dinner sometime.
That's so cool. Did you have fun together?
That is unfortunate. Did she like your place?
It can be frustrating when they do that. Do they live next to you or not?
That sucks, they probably just wanted to sleep in. Maybe they can just start smoking again?
oh thats not embarrassment, that's just honesty
That is a little embarrassing. I have fart in public too. But I think it's usually more of a small one. I'm sure she didn't think about it, though. I hope it didn't make you too sick. I would have done something else, like just get up to go to bed.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have she returned? Or is she gone on another one of her adventures?
That's terrible. You're going to call her?
That's so cool. You're talking about gratitude and how to appreciate the good things in your life. I've always thought that the key to a happy and fulfilling life was to focus on the good things.  I think you're a very introspective thinker, and I'm sure you're a lot like me. What do some people call it?  I think it's called a positive psychology.  Is that something you've heard of before?  It's like a way of looking
That makes sense. You are saying that you have learned from your experiences.
That sounds tough. What did you learn from it?
I understand what your saying.  It takes a lot of hard work and determination to take responsibility for your own life.
I'm so sorry to hear. I know how that must be so hard.
That is very brave of you. I hope it helps.
Oh that is terrible! What is wrong?
I think you might be right, and maybe you should.  It's a big move!
I agree.  What did today mean?  Was it a holiday?
That sounds wonderful. I have two of your children myself. I love them and always want to make sure they know how loved they are. I also always want to make sure they know how to be good neighbors and friends to everyone.
I am sure it will get you a girl! You just need to put yourself out ther!
That's not very good. You have to try and find people to talk to or join groups.
That sounds great! Where are you picking her up from?
I'm glad she's back. She must be happy you're coming back. How long was her trip?
That's awesome! I've been on vacation a few days ago. What's going on while you are on your vacation?
That sounds like so much of a fun trip.
That's so cool that you didn your your way and didn the caterer.  Did you end up with them or someone else?
I think you might have just had a bad experience.  I would try again and find another caterer.
I know what that means, you're talking about how you ordered it, but didn't pay for it?
That's a good girl though! I would've felt the same way about it.  It was nice of them to ask though and let me take responsibility.
I was. It went well. How was it?
i know, its been great. just working on getting out of bed
I hope it was good. I had the same thing happen yesterday.
I'm fine, thanks. How about you? How was yours?
That's hilarious! Did you ever find out who had worn the wrong shoes?  And did they get teased about it too much for you?
I hate when people can see right into you.
I went for a interview a few weeks back. It was for a job at my local park. They hired someone else. I thought they were going with me, but they hired the wrong person
I bet it went well too
Oh yeah? How are you handling the separation of time?
That is cool. I moved from my hometown for college.
I would have been upset. How long was it for
That's okay, it's just that first trip out of town by yourself can be really scary
oh thats not good, what happened in that drive-thu line up?
That's crazy. I would have just called the police to have it resolved quickly and easily.
That sounds scary! Did you have a ticket?
That is a bit embarrassing.
that's a good memory, what kind was?
I feel for that, but sometimes you just need to move forward and not dwell. I hope you find happiness.
That is awful. Did you get any help?
I would be at home right now, but I am at work right now. It's a crazy world we live in.
That's great. What did they offer you as the pay rate and work conditions?
That must be great news! I bet you are excited about it. What is it?
That's hilarious! I'm glad you were wrong. Did you call out the person?
That's hilarious, how did they respond?
I am shocked too, how could you not press for justice?
That's the mailman's job, right?
Oh that would be good news. What is it for the first time taking the test? Are they good?
That must be scary. Did it come out okay?
That's really cool. Did you go swimming in the lake near your house?
I have gone through many summers like that too. It's so nice to remember.
That's really nice of your parents! I bet you'll drive around and go to the store in no rush at all. What kind was it?  I'm a little jealous
Oh man, that's awesome. I've always wanted a car like that.
That makes a sense. I hate being in the middle of all of this and I hate the feeling that comes from having to deal with problems. It's nice to hear someone else has your back though
I agree with you about that. I am very much the same way. When things are going good and bad things start to happen, I am not as worried about what I am going through.  I just trust God to take it from there. I am a very weak person and sometimes bad news happens in a way that makes me want to go crazy, but when things start to fall, I am not as good at being mad at them.
I'm sorry that happened. I know you thought you got the job.
Oh man, I'm sorry.
You should try.
It was just so hard to get the promotion. I was not sure I had enough skills for it. I just hope I will get one day
That is terrible. What breed is it?
That sounds like fun.  I bet he gets bored.  I'm glad you let him run.  I don't want to see him.  I hate it when dogs run wild.
I know that feeling, how long have you known the law?
I have done that in the past and I have regreted it.
I'm sorry to hear that! Did they come back?
That's awful. I bet you were devastated.
Oh that must've been hard!
Yeah, it can't wait until then. I bet it was 2 long months since you saw her.
I hope you guys can figure things out.  I've been having to take on a lot more childcare responsibilities.  I'm not a mom, but I've always wanted to.  I feel like it's my time.  I just wish you guys had more luck in this area!  I've heard horror stories about how things work!
Oh, I know what you're talking to.  I've been going through my mother since her husband passed away last year, she has been in the hospital every two months for some health issue, I know what it's like!
That's right, she's been working really hard for this.  I think I might have to get her a little gift to show her appreciation
I am so happy for your mother. She must have worked hard to achieve her goal.
Oh, how sad. What made it so bad for him?
That really hits close to home for you. I used to live in a city and worked long hours and never had a problem with poverty in my area of the city.
That's terrible. Did the tree fall on anyone's house?
That's so generous of them. I hope they get some credit for it. I don't mind cutting it down myself, but I would like them to do it.
That's really interesting. Who was that person?
That's unfortunate, but also inspiring, that you are aware and care about what you see.
Yeah, life can change. But we can still try to make new memories. What is it about those times that you miss the most now?
I agree, and I think I've been living my life too slow.
oh my. that's scary. did you call the police and the sheriffs to report?
That sucks. Did you call the cops?
that's crazy! Did you take photos of it?
That's terrible. Did they hit your car?
ye, thats okay. you can get another job
That is tough, but sometimes things just happen. I'm sorry you did not get the one you wanted.
I bet that broke because of all those sweat drops you put down there
That sucks, did you go back and fix the pants?  Or wear shorts?
That's a bit of a problem, isn't it!
Yeah, that's cute.  But also, annoying because she keeps walking right past your face and you think you can swip your face away, but then she keeps walking and you're like "Oh, she's going to rub against my face.  You can do that."  And she just does it.  And then you have the cat just look at her like "What? What? Why would I be mad at you?"  And then just walk right on over and keep
That sounds like fun! What are the plans?  I love to go to the beach!
Oh wow, that's amazing! What are your plans while you are in there?
oh thats soooo funny, i bet you got in trouble for that one.
That's awful, what kind is that?
that sounds fun, did the prize come out in something like a quiz or something?
That's a pretty cool thing to win. What prize did it be for?  Was everyone there cheering?
That's no cool.  How long has this going on?
That sucks.  Maybe you should talk to HR about it.  They might be able to do something to stop him.
That's so cool! Did you open it?
That's frustrating. Are you expecting the package now or waiting for the package to arrive?
That's pretty embarrassing. Did you hit your head on anything in the fall
That must be annoying. Did you report the incident?
Oh, what happened? Did anything special happen?
That must've felt great! How old is this friend?
I would be a bit shocked too! I bet that baby's owner thought that was a great way to get the attention.
I know right? I would never leave my dog alone with my baby!
That sucks! Maybe try getting another job?
Yeah, it's tough.  Sometimes I think it would be good to just give up, but then sometimes things will turn around and you'll get back what you need.
That's awesome! Are she and the little kids going to watch the little kids' sports game?
That's awful.
That must be hard.  What kind of things are making it hard for you?
I know! I hate to do the same thing.  I want more than what I have.  I want a house, a car, and a vacation spot.  I know that's not going anywhere.
That's so true, my mom and dad have to deal with dementia.
It was not your fault, what happened?  Is there anything you can do about it?
That's terrible. I'm sure you'll get a job somewhere else. I've been there myself.
I know that you will get out of here.
Oh wow, are you a fan?
Yeah, but I am not sure.
that sounds like a great day
that sounds like she's really supportive and caring. how long you two been best friends?
Yeah that's cool. I'm not sure I'd want a skateboard, I'm afraid of falling off and getting a concussion.
I love the story! I want to try skate again. I bet I'd end up wiping it all over the sidewalk.
It does happen. What do you do?
That is interesting. What do people say about other moms?
That sucks. Do you have any idea what it might hurt? It's the first time he's got a tooth coming.
oh man, that's terrible.  Tylenol is not safe and it's not recommended to use it on kids, I would try some other options first.
I would have chased the dog!  How long have my dogs been with you?
Yeah that's terrible, I hope they are okay.
Yeah, it's a lot work.
Yeah, it's a lot of stress for the whole household.
oh wow thats tough, how long have you been having trouble with that?
That sucks. I'm sorry. Was it a dog breed thing?
Yeah, I do all that often. I just like to take time for it and enjoy the moment. It is always good to have a little peace and happiness in life
That is exactly how I like to feel. I like to look at life in small terms and appreciate the little things.  I think that can help a lot of people feel more positive about life.
I hope you got it.
That's great! What kind of lab?
I have never had to do so. I am healthy and able to work. I am 50 years old and I was never in a car wreck or got in an accident where I was injured and unable to work for an extended period of time. I am not sure I would have to file for it.
That must have been tough. How did you deal?
I do sometimes see kids that are 3 years older than their kids. That is just not something I would do
I have heard that. I have had to block out my kids talking.
That must have taken up time. How long have you been able to do that?
That's awful.
oh wow! how long did you take the test for?
It's not easy, I know that. I failed my driving test the first and last times I ever took, and I felt like I'd be driving a forklift for the rest of my life.
That must've scared you.
That must've been really grossing you out
I'm not sure if mine will start playing sports this summer. They haven't started playing yet this summer so I'm not sure they'll start.  I don't know what sports they're interested in playing.
I don't know anything about your daughter's activities, I'm not really sure she has any kids. I'm not sure where to send my questions. I'm just happy to see you have a healthy relationship.
That's hilarious! Did you wear them to work? I wear mine to work and then back on at lunch!
Oh, that must have been embarrassing, but at least it didn't cause any serious problems at work.
That's the worst part, isn't it. When you're so impatient you just yell and throw things in the trash.  That was really my experience with that.
I understand.  That sounds frustrating.  I hope it was just one bad cashier and not a pattern problem with employees.
I'm sure it was! What breed is your dog?
It sounds like a wonderful experience! I have never been an owner myself but I would like to.
I agree.  I miss those days.  I have so many memories of my childhood.
I agree. I am trying to appreciate now the good old days when I had no worries about money or bills to stress about. I am not sure I am ready to go back. I want to live now.
That's really cool. Did it happen by accident or was it planned out ahead of time?  I've always been fascinated with chemistry. Did it spark your interest in chemistry?
I can imagine! What kind was the science fair?
That sounds terrible! How are you handling the situation? Are you going back for him?
That is great that you have co-sleeping, but sometimes it is just not right for your lifestyle or preferences, and it's okay to prioritize your life.  It is your baby after all and you have to let them know that you will always be with them, no matter the location.  It just makes it easier to establish routines and to be consistent with their development and sleep schedule, which you are already doing. It might be a little harder to establish routines and sleep schedules,
That's great! What vacation did you take to the beach?
That's great! Did you go snorkling or scuba diving?
That does. What is he doing now? Is he in college?
That sounds great! I hope you have many more fun times together.
That sucks. Is there anything to do in that place you could do instead?
That is a terrible situation. What are your options?  I know a couple that went on a vacation.
That's exciting.  How many credits is he taking now that you can tell!
I bet that's awesome. I have a brother too who's going into college.
That's great. What's wrong with your kid?
That's good to know. What's going wrong with him?
Oh that was fun! What did you find there?
That sounds like so much fun! I love collecting. I love old Beanie Baby pictures. What was it about the Beaneebee that made them so popular?
That's really sweet. What age was your son? I'm sure it is nice to see your kids taking care for each other
I have a 6 year daughter too. She's a chore monster!
I would be very angry at the pet rat.  Did you get it neuter?
I think the mom rat would do it again if given a chance!
that's so good to hear about her.
That's really good news.  What happened?  Is she ok now?
I bet that cat loved the food
Yeah, it's funny how long cats take when they first trust you, I guess. I had to give it some time, too
That must've been scary. Did you find your way?
That's crazy. Did the stranger end up attacking you?
That's good. What did she do?  Did you guys like it?
I'm sorry. What happened?
That's terrible! What happened? Is she still with you? I'm sorry to hear that!
That's nice that she got to go to the beach.  I haven't been in years.
Oh no, I hope everything worked itself out in the end. It's good she went, I'm sure.
That is always fun.  How is it faring?
That will be fun.
That can help with weight gain.
I hope you like it
That's great news! Congratulations, you're going to be a proud parent!
That's great news! I am so excited!
That sounds fun!
That is nice!
That must have brought back a floodgate of emotions and nostalgia
that's great news! good luck
I am happy for your progress, keep going!
What motivated your weight loss journey?
I bet. Was it really that important to your family?
Yeah milk has been a bit weird growing up. But then you try it with different brands and it just won't taste good.
That's good. I tried whole milk for the last year of my pregnancy and was so gross. I had tried it at the hospital and thought that was fine, but once I had the kid, I hated the milk!
That's good news! What did you choose?
That is terrifying! Was it worth it?
I bet, but at least you got a break now?
That's really sad. I hope you were able to help him get help. What's your ex boyfriend like?
I'm so glad you are okay.  What happened?
I am sorry to hear that, I can't believe you drove for 5 hours and then got stopped at a 45 minute toll.
I agree that once you're past the tolls the drive is much faster and you get to see more of the area.
I love that.  How did you get the flowers for yourself?
Yeah, he said that. He always says that. He's a very romantic person.
I am sure you felt a lot of guilt
oh that's a bumpy road.
I bet that was cool.
That must have made you very excited! Did you paint a big mammoth on the wall of the cave?
I love that you have to be prepared for the worst, but also that you get excited for the best.  How long is you due to go?
Yeah that's scary and amazing all at once. I hope everything works out well.
Oh, that's terrible. Did you have a miscarce?
Yeah, it was a blessing. You can be worried about the worst-case scenario and still be happy with your baby.
that's so hard to see. I hope you get to see your other dog again.
That's really sad. I'm sorry. I can't imagine losing my dog. I had them for a lot longer than you did. I wish I could have spent more time with her.
oh that is a pretty gross thing
oh, man that's a hard thing to swallow.  I hate when that happens
that's so good of your
I feel your sentiments. My parents are struggling financially and can't save much for college, but they are trying! They can't save for college for themselves. It makes me sad that they don't. But it also makes them try! I wish them well too. I'm glad you are taking this step. It will help them financially and emotionally as well.
Oh no! I am so sad for you! What kind pups were they?
That sounds like fun!
yea? i hope you are ok. what's going on?
That sucks.  But, you got this!
That's good! You sound like a very good person and you seem to take care of your self! Keep that positivity going!
That sounds like you are doing everything right.
That's so far away! Did you finally get it?  How did you get there?
That's a bummer. Was it expensive?
Yeah, I love playing retro too!
It really is so nostalgic. I play retro games a bit too, I have the console and all the games.
oh thats creepy
That must've scared you, right?
That's nice! What kind art do they do at her school or community center?
I love art. I have three.
I have no idea, but I think it is a very ominous phrase.
oh i feel bad, what do they mean?
That must have scared the hell out of me. Did you bring it home?
Oh that sounds so sweet! Did you raise Muffie?
That's a really big job. I bet it was very lonely.
that sounds like a really long time to travel.
Oh no. Did it actually happen near you?
I'm glad you are okay. I hope it didn't affect you. Did it?
That's so cool. Congratulations to him!
That's really thoughtful of your brother, I'm glad he's thinking about what she'll be happy to have in her life. It shows he values the ring more than the ring. I'm sure she appreciates that.
I bet! What car is it? I am looking for a car myself.
I've been wanting that too. I'm looking for a new car myself.
That must have been so stressful.  What age baby?
Oh wow, you have 4 more months. I'm sure you will be ready. I know how it goes sometimes, but you have a lot of fun with it.
That's a bizzare thing.  I've ordered a lot online and never had that problem.
I feel bad that I feel this way.  I know that shipping to Canada is not a simple thing, and it's hard to get it there.
That's a bad deal. How much did she take you for?
That's a lot to pay out so fast. What happened?
I bet that sucked! Did you try anything new while you were doing that? Maybe try something new when you come out of it?
Oh wow, that's awful!  Do you think you'll be able to save up enough to buy a car again?
I bet. That was bad. Did you guys get what he promised or was he just a liar?
That sucks. I'm sorry. That sounds like a very stressful time.
Oh man, I hope it worked for you.  I hate having people do something to me without my knowledge.  Did you get it reversed?
I hope she liked it
That is great, how old was she then?
That's very brave of them
That's great. I'm sorry to hear they got sick, but I'm glad you had a backup plan.
that's awful, did you get your business trip cancelled?
Oh, that is nice! Why is she sitting with you instead?  Did you guys have a long time to get to that?
oh no what did she do
Oh wow! Did she do it willingly or against her wishes?
That's good! What happened?
that's great, you must feel so proud of yourself!
That sounds like you're doing your best you'll pay for everything yourself.  You're doing great.
oh yeah? what was it? i think we all wish we never had done it in the first place.
That's terrible, why? You did what? Why did it come out? What happened?
Oh yeah, what happened?
Oh that stank thingy you mean?
oh wow. i bet it stunk pretty bad. i showered for 30 mins the other day. and then again after work. but that is a few days. what happened after that?
I would feel the same way about cheating with a friend.
Oh wow, you cheated, that's terrible.  I hope she can handle herself and not get upset.
I'm sorry for your loss. I know that loss. My father passed away in 1974, 9 years before the Vietnam war.  He was a Navy man and was on a patrol in the jungles of Vietnam.
ye thats really hard
That's awesome! Congratulations!  I have a son myself who's into painting.
That's so cool! I have two kids and I'm pretty proud when my kids show interest in something they've been interested in. What was it that they won with in the competition?
I lie to my parents sometimes too!  What do they know about it?  Do they find it out?
That can be tough, but you did what you felt like was right in the moment.  I know you feel guilty about it, but sometimes we have to do what we have done.
I never get anxious about knowing that I'm prepared for any event. What makes you feel that way?
I think it has to have to be men that are anxious!
I feel the same about my husband and wife
Oh wow! How long have you guys known?
I'm so sorry, that's really tough. I lost my dog a few years ago.
That is too soon. I have never lost my dog.
Oh that? What happened?
That is not an excuse. If you did not drive so close to me you would not have had to react that way.
That's a very unusual one.
I know what happened, did you miss your flight?
That's exciting! Are you a law school type person?
That's awesome! I hope you do great!
Oh, that is terrible. What happened?
That's awful. How did it happen?
Oh no!  What did happen?
ohh that must have been soooooo embarrassing! did anyone laugh at that point?
That's so exciting, how do you know him so long?
Oh that sounds like so much fun. What are your grandpas like?
It was a gas station burrito? What kind? What toppings did it have?
I feel you man.
I am having an amazing day, thanks for the well done! What happened? Did something amazing?
Oh that was good. I am having the best day of my week right?
That is true, though it is a very hot summer in Brazil
I am sure it happened by accident.  I bet it was.
That's kinda gross. Did you try to cover? It's not something I'd ever done.
Oh yeah? Why's that? Did you two get together easily or was there something that made you two more trusting?
I have too. I am married, but I have been with my partner for about a year now. We met when she was on tour. I met her on tour. We stayed in touch and then met again. We got together and it turned out really good
It can't be bad. What's it about? Is it for school or work?
Oh wow, you're right in time for summer classes. I've had to deal with that situation before.
That is so cool! I love sloths! I have a big pet sloth that lives with me.
That is really cool. I have always loved animals. How long has it been since I last went to the zoo.
That's a bit rude! Did you tell your guest? I would have had to throw my trash out the door.
That's disgusting. You should definitely talk to them. I wouldnnt want anything to happen to them
I like that word! What made you happy? Was it something big like winning the lottery?
That must of been really hard work
I can understand why. The cost is just going to keep on going up.
I wish you the very best
I'm a fan of racing too! Do you watch any particular races?
I love watching racing videos online.  What kind do you watch?  Is it NASCAR, IndyCar, or Formula 1?
I bet. You like to go fishing, don't you?
That sounds great. What city is your house in?
That is awesome. How did you buy the car?
That sounds awesome! What color was it?
That's very kind of your.
that's awesome! I'm glad I got one too!
Oh wow, that's amazing! Congrats!
That's great news! Congrats on making such great of a big impact on the world.
That's good. Did you study for it?
I hope you get good grade.
That's okay! It doesn't mean you're bad. Everyone has done it.
that's terrible. why did they not make you happy?
That must have been tough on you.
Oh no, I hope she's okay.
That must've made you feel uneasy. What restaurant was it?
Oh, well, maybe you just got off on the right side of it.  Maybe you just didn't know that it was dirty and didn't smell that bad.  Maybe you just just didn't get the right food.  I mean, I would say that, but, I wouldn't go out there and eat it again just yet, just because of how dirty the place looked and smelled.  I just think about it now, maybe it was dirty, maybe you got it from
That's really cool! Did you go back to school there?
Yes, I was quite close to my grandfather. He passed away when I was just 6 years younger, so I miss him terribly.
That's cool. I have some old family pictures that I haven't seen them with the family. What age range are these kids?
That was cool. What happened next was good, too
I love how you can use the car to escape from the storm.
I was okay, but I was really concerned for the people who didn't!
That's okay! What happened during the doctor visit? Was it scary?
that's horrible. what kind?
I love your enthusiasm!  How many kids?  Is that typical for them?
I have, but I'm sure it was a lot of work. I never thought about it that much. I just built it.
That can be tough.
That must have sucked.
That's a bit of a long wait time, but at the end, the doc did make it to talk with me!
I hate waiting!
I hate those people. They think they can just take up someone's time without even saying a word.
That is normal. Are you taking it for school or work?
That is cool that you are taking a class about data science!
I am taking a vacation next week.  I love the beach!
I have not been to the beach. I have been there in the summer, but I have never gone there for a vacation. I've never been to Orange Beach.
Oh wow. That's so exciting. Did you like the Bed and Breakfast?
I love surprises.  I hope you have many.
I do. It's like, you can't explain why you don't know what you know you want to know, you know?
I do, I know exactly what you mean. I had one of my kids try to take it off and I found it so funny.
That's awful! Did you run out?
Oh that is terrible.
that's not good. are you in love or just having sex thoughts?
That's nice of him to think about you, I bet you're looking forward to the party! What a guy you are for thinking that way.
Yeah, it's like when your siblings start bragging about you.
That's not the best way to handle it. If you really wanted to talk about your feelings, you could tell them about the time you did the same for your sister. That might change their perspective.
It is good.
That's so good. What kind is it?
That is a little annoying.
I love how you're self aware of it. I think it is okay to be upset about that kind of stuff. You're not the person that's causing the baby's problem to cry, and you're not the parents that are going to leave it there. You're right, though - it's still kinda irrational to be upset. But it's also kinda hard to rationalize why it bothers us as much, I think. Maybe that baby is just so used to being held and rocking
That's good of them! What did they say?
That is good news!  How much do your new company offer you per hour worked?
I am so jealous.
I'm sorry to be rude, but I think I need some time to think about how I should respond.
That is awful! I live in Texas and it happened recently.
I agree they are a scary force of nature. I've lived in this area for most of 30 plus years and I've never really experienced a tornado, so I'm a little more aware of the potential.
That's so cool! I love plants! What's in your garden?
I have never thought of doing things like this with my garden. I just plant the plants and let them grow on their own. I don't do it like that.
I love my wife as much you love your wife.
that's really nice.
That's awesome! I'm glad you have such wonderful people around you!
That's a little better, but you should have just been honest about how you feel.
Yeah, sometimes you just don't know if you should just tell them.  Or if they're not going anywhere anyway.  But sometimes you just need to do it for the other side.  But in this case it probably wasn't worth it.  Maybe just a lesson for not lying and just being honest, even if it hurts someone you care about!  Maybe you should just just be honest and move forward and move forward and not dwell on the memory.  It's just ice
It was probably just gas or a food you ate. I have been there.  I hope your coworkers are not offended.  They have to deal with the stench every day!
That's terrible. Did you tell them about it?
That sounds disgusting. I would never go to a gas station that was that dirty. I'm glad they had a good phone charger. I wouldn't have wanted to call to ask if it was okay to stay there.
Oh my gosh, I hate when people don't know what they're talking about when it comes to bathroom maintenance. I hope they got a good tip!  :
That's cool, maybe it's for a home or something you're interested in. I'm glad you stole it.
Yeah, you're probably right. It was a nice surprise gift for my wife's birthday, but I probably should have been honest. 80kwhd TV? That's not something to steal, right! Maybe I'll get her one. Or maybe I'll just tell her it was for a good friend. Or, maybe I'll just get her a good TV for herself.
Oh wow. What kind of food do she want you read mind for?
I hate that. I have that issue with my wife too. I wish I wouldnt have gotten into this. It's hard to explain.  I think I am the more of the controlling partner. She wants me to read her mind and I am not good with it. I guess I am just a bad communicator about it.  I think I should just tell her I want to go to the other place she suggested and we'll go from then.
That's so good! Did you guys go to the same college?
That's really cool! What kind did you do?
It was a chore but it was worth the effort.
That's great that you're taking classes. How long are you in for your second class? 1 course is usually 8 weeks and another is usually 4 courses (or so I've heard from my friend who's mom is in college)
Yeah, that's good, it's always nice to be able afford the things you need and not have to beg.
Yeah that's great! What are you guys planning on?
That is true. I'm very lucky to have good people around. I feel sad when I am alone, but with them, everything is alright. They are always there for me, no matter what.
that's nice of them
that sounds like it. What did you do?
that was a horrible experience
That's terrible.  Do you have any treatments for the Lupus you have?
That sucks. Is there anything you can do to help manage it?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That is tough.  I hope you will find happiness again someday.
I hope you found the source of it.
Yeah, that's why they put filters under sinks now.
That's awful! Hopefully, things get better from here. What happened?
That sucks, but you can't control how others react to situations. You should try to make the best of future situations with her.
A lot of people are so disorganized these days. They need to get their act together. I'm a little old lady, so I've been around the block or so I thought.
I agree with you. My upstairs neighbor is one of those people who will be woken up by the soundest of noises.
It's not nice, but sometimes people don't know. I just tell them I love to be around people who don't mind noise and they just stop yelling at 6 or 6 and move on.
Oh, I see! Well, if you want me to suggest something, I'd be happy to!
That sounds scary, but hopefully it will work out!
I hope that works!
That's terrible. It's like they just don't care.
I am so angry at these creeps. I don't know what the world is coming to when some people can't get along to begining with. I just got out of a horrible surgery and I know it's a miracle if I can ever walk right out without a huge pain in the butt lawsuit hanging over my head. I hope my lawyer can't take them down. I am going to be sick to death of all these creeps. I just can't believe some of the people
That's awesome! I live near the Gulf of Mexico.
that sounds like a fun day to me too! how long have it been so warm?
That does make you nervous? What is it about that that makes you nervous?  Is it the nervousness of speaking or the nervousness of making the wrong joke?
I agree, it takes time
ohh that is okay. Kids can be very annoying.
I agree, I do enjoy those movies too
I agree, but sometimes I just like to go back and watch them again for fun
I agree, sometimes I find the more recent ones are not suitable
I'm glad to see you having more freedom.
I can imagine.  Did you have to work there?
That was my favorite, I used it for milkshrooms, burgers and more
Yeah, so most people work really hard, but there aren't many that really work hard enough. And most people don't work hard at all!
I agree. People are always doing something kind and good. I have a lot of friends that are very good at doing good for others.  I'm always trying to do good for them. I feel like people need people and sometimes that means doing good things for others.
That's a nice thing to see! I like it.
That was crazy! I love downhill!
Oh, I bet! Did you get hit?
That's not a man, that's a woman with a towel on!  I would have been a little more upset about it, but not as much as I would have been about a man taking a towel off his body and then just staring at you in the sauna like a maniac.  That's a woman with a towel!  I think I would be a little embarrassed, and also, I think I might be a man myself, and that's why I would have been upset
I agree, I'm a bit uneasy about that
That's great, congratulations! I'm glad you're one step closer. What department?
That's great news! Congrats on being one of the top performers for the district. I'm so happy that happened to you
I can relate to this situation. It's not very nice, right. I've been working there for a couple years now and sometimes when they want to let someone go it's a really bad thing to find out.
I don't think I've ever been to this place before. I am not very good at talking about myself so I don't know what I'm talking about.
That is really nice of your bank.  What happened?
That is awesome.  I have had that happen to me before too. I hope you use it wisely.
Oh, congratulations! That must be great news!
That sounds like a lot of fun!
Yeah, it is. But when it comes to gifts like that it makes you think you're getting something for something good.
Oh man.  I would have forgotten myself.
What a relief you didn't get him mad. I would have probably been upset and would have had him cry. I think I would have asked him to go to school tomorrow instead of today. I would be mad too. I would probably be like the worst parent in the world.
I think I need to work with kids a bit to understand that.  I can understand that they have their own needs and stuff they tend not to remember.
That's hilarious. I have to keep a list too, but I think I've lost it this week.
Oh well I hope he enjoys the rest he probably has to eat the leftover chips from me.
That was fun!  I have forgotten before.  I will make sure to get a bigger bag next time.
That's funny. I'm not surprised.
That is so kind of the landlady. I have a lot of trusty landlads.
That's so kind of your landlady. I'm glad she was understanding.
It's good you felt comfortable enough with the content to do well. Did you have any issues with the presentation itself?
that sounds awesome, what did they think of it?
That is terrible. What happened? Did he leave you for someone better?
It can be tough.  I hope everything works out for you.
That sounds great! Congratulations! I'm sure you're very excited about that. What district are you in?
That's awesome news to hear.
That's wonderful!  I had a boy and a girl and both babies were perfect! I feel like it makes all the hard times worth it.
That is the life.
that sucks, did you call them back?
It happens, we all make mistakes sometimes.
That does happen, right?
Yeah i think thats pretty normal to do, especially if they are older, but its always good.
Yeah, sometimes you just get those days where you're like "man, what is going on with me?!" But sometimes you're like "no way, you're just having it tough. It's okay. You're not crazy!"  And then you just go on your way with it.  You're right!  You're not crazy!
Oh, that's hilarious. Did you end the day with any purchases?
Oh? really? Why?
Oh no! That's terrible! What happened? Did you fail?
Oh wow. What kind conference was it?
I love it! I'm always looking to move to new places and I think it's always good to meet new people and learn about the world they come from
That is bad news.
I am sure everything goes well for you both then.
I hate waiting for exams. It takes forever! But, it's worth waiting for right?
That's frustrating, but you'll do great.
That must have been so exciting!
That's great! Did you do good in school before taking the test?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did everything run smoothly?
that's pretty awesome, what did they serve for lunch?
Oh, that is terrible! What happened? Did you try dating anyone?
That's great you've changed your perspective.
That's good. Change can be a stress.
That is good. I am glad you are happy. What is it?  Is it food or something?
oh, okay. Good for that. How much exercise do you plan on doing?
That's a good attitude. What kind of goals do you want to achieve?
That's terrible. Did you contact your insurance and ask about the issue?
oh no i hope they pay out asap, that must be so upsetting!
That's terrible. What did he do? Did you guys never meet?
That's awful. Did he get found out of hand?
That must be great, to catch her up
Oh, nice! What kind book is that?
That's frustrating, what did you do?
I am working from home right now, I wish I didn't.
I love babies!  What kind of toys does your baby boy like?
That sounds exciting! I've never had a baby boy. How are they progressing so quickly?
That can be stressful. I hope everything works well for you.
I hope everything works out.  It's always hard to save up for a baby.
I bet that she was.
That sounds awful! How long were they dating?
That is the problem of not having patience.
That can happen, but it sounds like you're being understanding about it
It's great that she's learning and having fun!
That must've been fun for her though! I hope she loves it and gets a lot of use!
That's really cool! I've never run a sprint race before. Did you run well at all?
Oh, wow! That is awesome! What kind school is this? Is this for the school championship or just a competition? I want to run!
I have never been there. What games? Are they on consoles?
I know what you're talking about, man. Those games are so much fun to play on my nintendo.  I wish we had more nostalgia for the old days.
I don't blame you. I'm not too fond myself. What happened?
I know right? I hate going on trains too, but they're so convenient to get around.
I bet! What kind of car do you want?
That sounds awesome. Are you going with a Toyota?
Oh that movie was good. What movie was it?
That's awesome. I haven't really thought of it in a long time since.
What makes you unhappy? Do you think it has to do anything to with your health or something?
I feel your feelings, I feel you.
I bet!  What kind of hair?
That is a gross mistake. I would never order food there.
That sounds like fun! What kind of bike did you get?
I've been waiting forever too! I think I need one now!
That sounds exciting! Congratulations on the new chapter!
Yeah, it will be nice to be a homeowner and not have to worry about rent anymore!
That's okay, you should talk to your employer about it
That sucks, but it can't be easy either.
that is terrible
That's so sad!
Oh well! That's okay! You can always ask your professor for an extension or ask your professor for a meeting!
oh thats so sad.  computer work is for some.  i work at a computer all day.  i think you should try getting an actual paper copy of the work done.
That's really cool. What's in the picture of Great Grandma?
that's really sweet of them
Oh? What was it?
That's so sweet! What did they get you?  Did you go on vacation?
Oh, what happened? Did something terrible happen?
That's good you listened to yourself and are more safe now!
I can imagine! Did you get in trouble for it?
that's terrible, I hope you learned something from it
That's terrible.
Yeah I was in the same boat. I studied hard but still failed the test.
That's scary! I would have run away from that person. I don't know what they wanted, but I don't like them!
I am sorry you had to go that way.
oh man!  That is amazing.  I had no idea I still have them.  I used to collect baseball cards and have so much of them!
I'm sure that was awesome. What kind of baseball did you collect the cards of?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? Did you get it?
That is good. What are you working on?
That's such an amazing play by Linny I have seen so many.
That's pretty amazing. Have you seen the show before or is this your first time seeing it on Broadway.
I know right! It was so relaxing!
I agree.  The calm and tranquility of the beach is very relaxing and calming
I feel you, I cheated on an English exam.
Yeah, cheating on tests is bad, but sometimes you have to do it to pass.
That's a fun way to spend time together! What kind are they going dance to?
That sounds like fun.  What are you doing with dance classes?
I'm sorry to here that.  I have lost a few dogs over time.  They always made my life so happy to have.
That is terrible. I am so so sorry. I lost a dog as well and was very devastated by it.
I feel for that. My father passed away 2 weeks before my wedding.
I'm sorry about that.  I hope he is okay now.
Oh that's so boring. What happened?
That is nice. What happened after that? Did you go swimming?
That's cool! What show was that of?  I have never seen anything like that!
Yeah, he's a genius!  He should be on Broadway!
That's always fun. What did you do?  Did you go to the beach or something fun?
Oh wow, what kind family is it with. I haven't been able to see my parents in a while, so I feel bad you had such an experience
That is crazy! What happened?
oh wow, that was scary! what dog?
That's very kind of you
That's so kind of you! I'm happy for you. How's your relationship like with your little sister?  Is she older or younger than you?  I have a little sister who's 4 years old and my 2-year-old. They're best of the best.
I hate meeting the parents.  I've had to do that for my parents and it's always a little scary.
I was at my parents house for the first time. It turned out well. What a lovely experience.
That's crazy. Did you run?
that's crazy. what did the dog look like?
I'm sorry.  What kind was your singing style?
What kind of singing do you do?
That sounds like they would have a blast playing and cleaning up around there on their own.
Oh wow! That is quite impressive. I would have loved that kind of control and authority over my kids. I bet it made them feel great to have you be the boss man of the man.
Oh no! What did you do?
I am sure it made you feel sick too.
I don not understand. why?
Oh man, I am happy for you.
That sounds so exciting! How long was it going on for?
That's so kind of your mom
That must've sucked! How long you two been friends?
I know how you're saying that, it really makes you mad.  But sometimes it's not the confrontation itself but the aftermath that makes it even. I know what it did for me and it made my best friend mad at first but it made me realize that sometimes the things that are the best for you are the things that you need to deal with first.
Oh that sucks. Did you kill it?
That must've been so annoying!
That would be stressful.
I am sure that if your work is good and consistent you will be able to make your payments on time
That's very responsible of you
Oh, did you get in trouble with the parents?
I know right? I hate Whataburgers too.
That can be so painful.
That must have been difficult for her.
that's crazy! why would you do such things?
that sucks
That must have been so nice.
oh nice! That sounds so cute. I have a 2.5 year daughter that does that every day!
That can happen. What was it for?
That must have been nerve-wracked! What did they think of?  Did everything work well?
I have never been to college.
That's terrible. Did you ever try to go back to school to get your master's?
What happened to him? Did he pass away suddenly?
I know. He passed in February.
That's understandable, dogs bring us joy
I have never run track before. How fast can kids go?
That stink, I hate running!
That's a good question!
Yes I can't dance but I try my hardest
That's crazy! Did you get rid it?
That's crazy! Did you hit the ground hard after?
I love those. What kind did you buy?
that's cool, what did you end up winning?
That's gross! Did you throw up afterwards?
oh wow, i can't stand old food
That's terrible. I've lost my own dog a few years back.
That sucks. I lost mine to a dog bite 10 years ago. I still miss her a lot to day.
Oh no. I'm so so, sorry about that. I know it's still hard. I'm thinking of my brother too and my sister who passed a 5-year battle.
That is so hard for you, I hope time helps you get to where you need to go.
I hate fake news! It makes me so angry!
I am so with you! I am tired of seeing people believe fake news over real news. It is like watching a train wreck.
That's a pretty common thing kids do.
That's cute. I have two kids too.
I'm sure that's not a good thing. I lost my job a few weeks before retirement.
That is a tough spot.
oh, aldy is it?
That's true, and I used to shop at Target.
That's cool, are you going to a Lakers game soon
That's cool. What position do they have this season?  I hope they win it all.
I am sorry for his loss. I know how it is.
I'm sorry for your loss. I know how that goes, but it's hard.
I am so jealous. Is she cheating on her ex-boyfriend?
That's so frustrating. I can see why you are trusting her though, you have known her all your life.
That's a lot of things to accomplish.
oh, great. double shift? haha, good luck!
That's really cool! I would love to see that musical someday!
that's cool you liked it
That is so nice of her.
Oh wow. That must have been a relief for you.
I bet! What was it?
That's cool, what type of crew?
That's a fun event. What are you training for specifically for it?
I am very jealous of those bodybuilders.
That's awesome. I'm not really into sports or school, I'm more of of a "work hard, play hard" type.
I'm sorry. That is tough.
I feel you. I lost a family pet, but it is a different kind of loneliness.
That's always a nervous moment, but it's always worth meeting the in-laws.  What did you guys do?
That's so exciting! What happened next?
I bet that's normal for you and your friendships.
That is understandable. I am sure you are happy for her. I know it is hard to let go of a big move.
That's a little weird, what did he/she say?  How did you react?  Did you tell them to just leave her be or what.  Did you guys break things off and stuff?
That must've hurt. What did you yell at him about?
That sounds wonderful!
oh nice
Oh yeah! What show is that?
That's a really unique production.
That's a fun day! Did she enjoy it?
That was awesome! What age?
That does, and it's usually just kids trying it.
Oh, I understand. I live near the woods so I have to be aware of the possibility of dirt bikes coming into the area at all times of night.
yea i have a son of three and i have a daughter of two, they are my favorite
that sounds nice, i am not a parent yet, but will be soon!  I think I will be happy when my kids go off to school. I'm a teacher.
That's terrible. What happened? Did you try anything?
That's awful. Did you try anything to help you relax?
That can be nerve racking. Did you end up having a safe flight?
I was too nervous about flying. I hope you have many fun times!
oh thats so good
I know you feel the way you do.
I bet that!
That's really sweet of your boyfriend.
It's so hard when you have to deal with a lot of people and a lot of noise, but it's good that you have a good group of people!
That's great! Did they come right on?
That's a tough place.
Oh, that's bad. He probably should've just saved up instead of taking on debt.  I would talk to him about why.  Maybe he can explain it to me.  I think he might have a financial literacy issue or something else going on that he's not aware of, and maybe it's a pattern.  Maybe he just needs to learn how to handle finances better.  Maybe he just needs to be more responsible and responsible.  Maybe.  Maybe he needs some
That's great! I'm sure the weight will come soon! I have to get back into shape too. What diet is it you are following?
It was challenging to follow the plan all week long.  What is the plan?  I am curious about that.  I have tried a similar plan and it was a challenge.  I think I might need some advice on that.  I would say start by getting a good nutritionist.  Then you could start with a simple diet.  I started by getting rid of the foods I liked and I started by eating a lot more vegetables and fruits.
Wow that sounds amazing. What college is she going?
That's really nice! I hope you get to experience that with someone else someday.
I hate when that. Did they do it on social media?
I understand, it is easy to see others flaws.  I once knew a man.  I thought him a good man.  But he did a terrible job on his wife.  He cheated her out.  He cheated me too.  It was very hard to accept.  I felt guilty.
That sounds great! What a nice reunion!
That's really cool! Did you go back to your hometown recently?
That's so awesome! Did you end up doing okay?  Did you study enough?
I understand the drive and competition in college. It's good to have that drive.
I love when you get to see your friends.
That's so cool! What's the plan for your visit with your friend?
That's terrible.  Have you tried any treatments yet?
That's terrible.  I hope they can find something.
That is so sad. I know that I have lost a few of my dogs in the years I've been around.
I understand. I hope you get through this. It's not easy saying it out. I have lost a few myself too. They are always hard to let go. I just hope they're in a better state than when I found out. That makes it even harder. I just try to think about the rest of the time we had with them, and the memories we have created together. I try not to think about the time they are going to be with me no more.
That is annoying, I hope you talk it over with her and get her back to normal.
I've been on a couch a lot too. I'm not sure if he is trying to escape or try to escape from something else, I hope it's the former
That sucks. I've tried that too. I'm not sure if it's better or worse that they made more weight loss. I think that they made it easier. I made it harder. I don't know how to feel better. 15 lbs. That's a lot!
oh no! i bet that's disappointing
That's cool. Did you guys have any crazy or fun experiences on your trip?
I bet that was fun! What did they do on their trip?
That's terrible.  What happened?
Oh wow, I would have demanded more money.  What kind cruise did you go on?
that's great
That is so nice!
That's understandable, what kind do you live in?
That is nice.  You are going out with friends?
That is a scary thing to have in your car!  I'm glad I was driving.
I'm sure that spider is going straight back to its spiderhole somewhere.
That's always a fun time.
I can't wait! I'm going with my family for vacation!  It's a 3 hour drive from my house!
That's not very nice of your.  Maybe you can find another roomate?
It's annoying. But I guess it's not the end world.
That sucks. I hope the cancer doesn't come back.
That sounds like a tragedy.
I understand that, but it's hard to accept rejection when you want it so badly!
I completely agree with you, it's hard to accept sometimes, but life is what it is, we should try and do our part in making the best of the life
That's exciting! What kind are you moving for?
That's awesome that you and the wife have been through it so many times. I'm sure it's going to work for them.
That is awesome! I hope you enjoy your time!  It's going to be cold
I know right!  We're really on a great economic roll right?
I'm so excited for the future!
That's awful, what can be done to change her mind?  Do she know that it's going to make her worse to not?  Has she ever tried to stop?
Yeah, I think she might have a problem with addiction, or maybe even a drinking problem, but she's too scared to seek help. I'm trying to be supportive and help her, but I wish others around me could see the potential in her that could change her life for the better, if only she'd just take a step back.
Oh wow! Congratulations. What kind was it?
That's awesome!
Oh, that's a lovely story. I bet the baby beluga was adorable!
Oh my, was it a scary movie?
I've heard that. I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.
I am so proud. That is amazing.
it's cool
I love the word "sweet!" What car did your friend get?
that is awesome news
That's such awesome news! I am sure you are very excited about it!
That sounds cool.
I would never do that to my partner, why? Because you know how much it hurt when that happens.
I understand, it's hard to admit mistakes. But you should try to be honest with yourself and with her. It is the first time you are admitting to a wrong, and you can learn a lesson from this.
That's exciting! What are they coming for?  Are you expecting a visit?
I am sure they will have some crazy story to share with you guys
oh, high school. good times
I'm sorry, I think I got the text wrong. I thought you had some good friends in high school. I thought you were a lonker kid who didn't like anyone. I was the one who always left school early.
yea horror movies are the worst
Oh no! What was it? Did you watch a horror film?
That's so sweet. Where was that place?
That's awesome! Where did you go on your last visit?
I'm so sorry to hear, I've heard about that. I've had a few of our dogs go through heart issues, it's really a tough time. I lost my first one, I was so sad. I've been trying to get my daughter involved, but it's really hard. I just don't understand it yet.
That's so nice of you. I have a 2-year old Chihuahuas and I understand the love and the loss you feel. I hope everything gets okay with you.
That was a shock.
It's going to take years for the damage to stop being noticed
that is no good.  How did they react?
Oh man, that sounds terrible.  I hope it heals correctly and you can go visit them soon!
I love my family
That's awesome! What did you do in Alabama?
It is bad when your team loses because you worked together.
It happens a lot in projects like this, but I guess that's why teamwork is so important. I hope you got it done in time for your deadline though, and hope your team is understanding.
That must have scared you? I don't like bees either
I understand the frustration, but maybe take precautions and wear gloves when mowering the yard!
that's really cool. are you safe now?
That would scare the pants out me as well, but at the end I have cash on my credit cards, and that would have been good.
That's so cool! Did you ride horses again after you left them?  Did they grow?
that's so cool
That is awesome! You must have a lot to carry around there!
That must have been frustrating.  I've never had one flat in my entire life.  I've gotten some flat tires too, so I'm glad you didn't have to deal with that.
That's so brave of them! Did you jump out of hand?
That must have been very scary!
Oh that's awesome!
That sucks, you could try to visit there and meet up with Kris and see if you can't go together. It might not be the same but it could be fun to try out your golf skills in a beautiful setting.
That is exciting! Where you moving to from?
I can't even begin to imagine moving. Are you excited or are there fears about leaving family?
I do too! I like to do a few times a day.  I feel very relaxed when that happens!  What do you meditate on?
that sounds good
That would be pretty creepy. Did you call the police?
That must have been frightening. I always lock up my house and keep the doors closed, especially in an area where there are no windows on the ground level
oh wow that sucks, did he or did he not do it at all?
That sucks. Did they explain themselves?
That is terrible. What happened? Did you fail your presentation class or did you just freak out and run away from your desk and hide under your bedspread and underpants
I feel for that. I would have probably done the same thing.
That's really nice of the man, how long was it taking?
That's awesome you're so happy to live in such a wonderful place.
I'm a golf fanatic myself!
Oh wow. What happened?
I hope so for you!
That's terrible! Did they get upset?
That's horrible. Did you apologize and try to make up for it?
It's always better to remember happy times than stressful ones, but I understand your point.
I feel you. I wish things were easier for me back.
That is very cool. I think that's what we all want. We want to be happy, we don't want to feel unhappy or unloved
That's great. I'm a trainer myself. What kind of company are you working for?  I work with a company called Team Building Games.
oh man, thats harsh. i would probably just go and find a different place to go
I feel for the friend.
That is funny. You should have him over at for dinner sometime. I'm not sure he'd like it, but I'm sure you'd like having him over for dinner sometime.
That's awesome! What lottery did they win at?
That must have been fun to wait to see if your number was on the winning ticket!  I hope she's happy though
That's great! What kind exam was it for?
That's good you studied well and that's good that a group helped. That is really smart of them.
I know that sounds exciting! I bet it's. What are you going to do with it all the limestone?
It's a big deal for your and for the environment.
That's crazy! What happened next?
That was scary!
I am sure that is hard.
I do move far away sometimes, but it's usually just a short distance.  I can usually move my things online.
I am so sorry to hear that. What happened? Was it an important presentation?
Well you will get through this thing
That can be annoying!  I don't understand why you'd get annoyed.  They just honked.  It's just a car, after all.  I honk at my car drivers all day, too.
It does make things even more dangerous. I hate it when people cut you off
That's good news. What are you going for in this field of engineering?
I have, but I was accepted into a program at my university that was for computer engineering. I was so excited to be accepted! I'm going to start in August. I've never been accepted to electrical before, so I'm a little worried.
That is so scary! Was it a tornado?
That is terrible, I hope everyone is safe. I hope you can relax now that the storm is over.
It is indeed very unfortunate. It is not like he was a bad guy, but he had his own way.
It really is a tragic disease and it seems to affect everyone differently. I'm sorry you lost a loved one
That sounds kinda weird. Did something weirdly interesting happen?
Oh! That sounds awesome! I bet you were proud!
Oh no! What happened? Did something go terribly awry?
I do! I go there every summer.
That's really smart. How long have you been saving?
that's good to hear. what kind of things happen that require an emergency fund?
That is so sweet of your sister!
that's a fun time
I would tell my dog to stop.
That sounds really upsetting.  I hope that it wasn't the first one to do so.  I hope you are okay.
I agree, I watch too much TV.
That can be so hard to get out of, but sometimes it helps to remember a different time in your life when things are not so sad.
That is a fun place to be!  Are you going on vacation or just visiting?  Where is your family from?
I went in Tampa last week. I am very excited for Busch Gardens next week.
That makes a good point.
Yeah, kids are pretty clueless.  I dropped my candy bar on the ground and it was gone in a second.  I guess I'll go buy some more candy.
I would never eat that candy bar. It's probably rotten.
Oh that's really good of them! What kind are it?
That's awesome that they let you give medicine to them, I hope they don't get worse!
That must have been scary.
its bad.  i bet it was scary
oh, you were in high school? I bet it brought back good memories.
Yeah, that's cool. It's good to have those memories from the past.
I love when family comes to visit! What city is this house located?
I bet you do! I wish you all the fun times with them! I've been away for a while so I know what you're going through.
oh my golly, what did they do?
that's so cool! I've never been much of a dance fan.
That's so cool! What kind did she do?  Was it something like a dance or something else?
That sounds like fun.  Did you guys have fun moving everything?
That's awesome that your son helped out.
that's awesome! what job?
I'm sure you'll do just great, good for you to get that job.
that stunk, hope you threw it
That's disgusting that it was in the back of the refrigerator.
That sounds like fun! I have always wanted to open up my own retail store.
Yeah, sometimes the small ones do a better business than the big ones.
That sounds fun! What store is she working at?
Oh wow. How old was baby when they first moved?
That must've been challenging! I hope everything worked out for you guys though. Did you move to a different area?
That's amazing! What was it like living abroad?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you get back to good health soon.
That sounds like you have been through some struggles.  Hopefully, you're back on the road soon.  I know you have great family watching out over you.
that they made the wrong choice is a good thing.
I agree, and it's sad to me how many people rationalize bad behavior.
That's rude. Did they meet online or in person before that long?
I would have told me.
That stunk. I have done the exact thing before and it was a nightmare.
You should have a fight back. I had a fight back the other day too. I cut off the person, but I got a ticket anyway. I felt so annoyed.
I'm sorry to hear. I've lost my brother-in-law a year after his wife passed away. He had not been feeling right for a long.
It's not easy to lose anyone, especially a sister.
That's frustrating, but it will come around.  Keep at your current pace.
I feel for that, I was there.  I was job hunting for years and never got a call. It took me 6 months to finally get the call from the company I ended up working.  I worked there for 2 months.  I'm trying to stay positive and keep trying different jobs and find something that will work for the next year.
That's really exciting!  Congratulations!  What are her plans for after graduation?
Yeah, it can be really hard.
That's so cool! What are some plans?
I can't imagine relaxing in June.
That is amazing. Did you get scared while sky diving?
I've done sky diving. I'm not sure if I did it right. I'm 20 years old and I did it for the first time this year. I think I might have done it in the right order, though!
That is so nice. I love doing my prayers. I hope to do it every single day. I think that will help me to be good and kind.  What about the prayers? How do they help?
That's really interesting. I've never tried it myself. Do you eat any fish?
That's awesome. I love to be kinder to my body and the environment. What kind are your favorite foods to eat now that you have started?  Do you eat fruits and veggies every single day?
It is so hard to deal.
That is good of you. It is always tough when someone is going through that.
I bet that was hard to watch her go through. I'm sorry. Did she have kids after her cancer was treated?
That's so kind. I wish I had someone like her.
I do. My parents divorced and I was very upset. But I know they were just stressed. They were so stressed and I felt like they didn't want to be around anymore. So I stayed with my friends and family. And then I went back to my parents. And now I visit my parents a lot.
That sounds awesome! What made you so excited about it?
Yeah that is a pretty cool.
That sucks! I have never lost my shoes. What did you get your dog to chew up instead of your shoes?
Oh, well, at least it's not the first time she's chewed up your shoes!
Wow that sounds delicious! What did she cook up for dinner for you two of?
That sounds like a very special dinner!
That was so sweet of your friend. What's the best meal of your day?
That's tough.  What do you think you're lost about.
I feel for ya, how long were you together for?
That is great. What kind dinner did you make for them?
What made you want to go over?
I get excited too
that's great, how much more will it give you?
It's amazing how fast she learns.  She can say 10 words in one minute now.  She's 2!
I do too. I think children are the best thing.
That sounds like you had everything ready for your vacation.
That sounds like a great time. Have fun!
I love going out to dinner. What did they get you for dinner?
That's awesome! What kind of sushi place did they go?
That's so right! I was at this sushi place and I ordered the most delicious thing.
That sounds wonderful! Where was the park?
That is nice.
That is nice, do you like to spend a lot of time alone?  Or do you like the family a lot but just like to chill by yourself?
That is nice that you have a great attitude about it though
That's so true! I moved from the US to the UK and was so scared of moving, and then when we got there, it was like home!
that makes a lot sense, I've been abroad for a few years and learned a lot about trusting your instincts and living life on your own terms
Oh no, that's sad. I hope you have fun.
That's awesome. I wish I could afford something like that.
That's awesome! I'm 16 soon and I'm going through so much.
That's cool. What will I do with them now that I don't have to drive them around?  Maybe I'll just let them go out to get some money!
That sounds really cool. Who did it meet up? Did you guys talk for long time?
That must be nice. Did you talk?
It's a trade-off, but I think it's worth the sacrifice.  How about you?  Do you miss your hometown?
I do. I try to get there as often as possible. I live in New England so we are like, a few hour's ride from most places.
That's weird, did she hit on you because you were interested in someone, or just because she liked guys?
Oh that's good. It can be hard when that kind of attention comes out of nowhere.
That's so cool! Did you enjoy the performance of the play?  What play was that?
That sounds like fun! Did you see his acting?
I feel the way. It is nice to be home.
That makes sense, sometimes having no one else around you makes things seem even more lonely. I'm glad you got to have your holiday with family. I've had my holiday with family and friends as well, but sometimes having too much company makes it even more stressful and uncomfortable. Maybe try to mix it up next time around?
that's really interesting. I've always just used store-b buffalo wing sauce
That's awesome! What did it taste like?
That is exciting. What kind of job is it?
I do that all time with my work too!
That sounds exciting! I wish I had that.  What do you think about the baby's appearance? Are you excited about meeting them in person?
That sounds amazing! I've been waiting so long! I'm excited for you too! I hope everything goes well!
I bet that was terrifying.
That's pretty rare to have in the age of the TV and YouTube. I'm glad you didn't get too scared. I hope you enjoyed it.
That sounds like fun! What sport is it?  I love football, and baseball too.
That is cool! I love the college football season!
Oh that's really cool. What was that?
I agree, it's amazing what people are capable.
That sounds really kind of him!
That's so cool that your car broke and that your friend helped!
That sounds like it, did you finally get an A?
oh nice! thats good
Oh no. I'm sorry to here about that. I'm sorry you're having a tough day.
Oh my, I'm so sad for you. That must be really tough. I hope they can talk about their death soon and that will make it easier for them to move forward.
Oh my! Congratulations! That's awesome! Congratulations!
Yeah that's crazy how unexpected things are, but it's great that everything is going well so far.
I hope it doesnnt get bad.
That sounds like a good preparedness plan.
I know how you feel, that happens to a lot of us.
That is terrible, what did you do after?
That's nice of them!
That sucks. Hopefully he recovers soon. Hopefully you get sick soon.
That's great! Congratulations on achieving your academic success. How long did it take you to achieve the A honor roll?
I had to work hard for it
That is a bummer!  Did anyone laugh at it?
I used to be the same. I love making people happy with my movies. I love making fun of people. It's fun.
I can't wait until my interview tomorrow!
Oh, nice! What did they offer you?
Yeah that would be awful, I would have been very upset about that.  Did you end up calling the local authorities to report the dog's owner for that?
Oh man, that's terrible that happened. Did you try to talk to her about how to avoid such situations?  I hope you were able to have that conversation. I hate to think people like smoking so much and not having a good time.
that's kinda gross, i guess it's a pizza place, but it was so funny!
I have been there. It is embarrassing. But once you see people looking at you and helping, it is funny.  I was at the mall once, and I was at the food court and someone spilled food all over me. The whole mall went to work to clean it off my clothes and clean my floor and all of the people in line behind me.
That's great!  What type spoon do you use for that age?
Oh that's great. I'm 16 months too and just starting out with my son too
That sounds like a really long time. Did things go well?
Yeah, sometimes it's nice to go slow and enjoy each other. I'm glad you two have such a good relationship.
It's hard to lose a pet.  They are like family.  How did your dog die?
That sounds really tough. I hope he died a good way
That sounds like a good memory!
I do too. I can't believe I remember it. I'm going to try that again! I'm a little nervous.
That sounds scary! Are you okay with that?
That must have been scary, did you call to complain?  I would too if it happened to my bus. How cheaply are we talking here?
I'm so sorry to hear this. How long were they with each for before you broke up with them.
I broke my girlfriend's heart too
That's a bumpy way to start a dinner. Did anyone notice? I'm pretty sure your family members saw what you did.
That must have felt so awkward. Did you guys ever talk it out about who you were sitting with?
That does happen, doesn't it. I remember my son going from middle school to high school. I feel like that's gone by in the time I've known him.
That's great news! I hope it's a good experience for him.
Yeah I can imagine!
Oh yeah? Did you end the fair?
What do you do with that money?
It sounds like you did the only thing you thought was the only right.
That's really sad. I'm sorry.
Yeah, it really was tough for us, but we tried to be as supportive as we could.
It definitely is!  I have had to work hard for mine though.
I know right, I feel like I'm just stuck on the couch a lot of days.
I love life, life is great.
That sounds interesting. What do construction jobs involve?  Do you get to work on the job?
oh no thats a bummer, how long has it happened?
Oh no! What happened? Did something happen to it?
I'm not a party poopers. How many people were?
I bet. That must've been a surprise party. Did you have any idea it was coming up on you?
I feel your. I live in a different country. My family and I haven't seen our parents in over a year now that we've been working. We can visit but we are not able to live with each one of us.  I miss them so much!
I hope you have fun!
That's not good, why not?
That show has been off for a while now. I used to watch it, but I stopped when they started making the videos longer and longer.  I stopped after a while.
That sounds like it was easy. What was easy to do?
I am a little clumsy.
That's too late. You should have booked your vacation a week in advance.
Oh yeah, I know that. I am a bit nervous about long trips too.
Oh, I am sure she was happy to go!  What kind was it?
Oh well, at least you are not letting her get on her highness high all the time.
That sounds nice. What chores?
What chores do your chores usually entail?
That's awful. I can imagine. It sounds like your yard has become like the Wild. I hope you don a have a way to stop weeds from growing.
that's cool, he seems like someone you would stay loyal to
that's awesome, I bet it's hard on him too
I think you made the best decision.
That's terrible.
I love when that happens!
Oh wow! Congratulations! I am so jealous that my son's daughter was in the program.
I would have been so upset too.
that's awful.
Oh, what kind is it?
That is awful. Are you going out of town soon?
That's really nice. I'm so happy you get to see your spouse get things you work so hard for
I am sure it will happen!  I am sure.
I know right. I hate it too.
I'm sorry you didn't have a better option. I hope the next day is better.
That is true.  Sometimes you just have to wait for the money to come.   I am just so nervous.
I hope you get that bonus soon!
that is very sad. I know you are not by yourself for long periods of time, but still it's hard sometimes
I understand how you'd miss having a family close to home but you have to work hard too.
Yeah, it's crazy how fast time is.
I love that you're thinking about the younger days like that!
That's terrifying! Did you run away?
oh god, did you find anything else?
It's normal to feel sad. I'm sorry for your pain
I'm so sorry. I hope you can find the right way to deal
That's awesome. What did you do at that firm?
That must have been bad timing for you. Did you confront her about it?  My wife has a tendency to do the opposite side of the street on a first date.
I'm sure everything worked out.
Oh that's too long ago!
I am very jealous of you.
I would be furious aswell! How could he bad mouth someone in front of everyone?
oh, wow, what did he do? Did he try out of anger?
That's cool. What was your impression of the play and movie.
It's awesome to hear you.
oh that, what happened then?
That's terrible. Did you get sick?
That's nice of your. What's your relationship like with her?
that's understandable. i hope everything works out for the best
That's terrible. What a jerk.
That can be disappointing. Did she realize her feelings?
That's a terrible situation. Did you have to go away from work?
Oh, that's great! I'm glad to hear! What a wonderful family you must have.
I would have been shocked too.
Oh wow that is amazing news! Congats on getting married
That sounds awesome. I would like to be like that.
That sounds awesome. What kind of job?
That is so cool. I love catching fireflies
What happens to the fireflies?
Yeah it happens to me all the time. I wish I had a nap after work every now and then.
I feel you, I am always trying to go for a 4hr and 5hr sleep and when I wake up I feel tired.
That's a great achievement!  I have never bought a home before.  What is it like to live there after it's all said and done.
Wow that is exciting news, you should be happy and excited
Oh, what did she do?
I'm sorry to hear about that.  I had no idea you and your mom were battling diabetes.
I understand that. I have 7 kids and work a lot. I just wish they would be older so I could take them out more.
Yeah, kids these day. They don't understand. I wish they had more time.
I've had some amazing drawings from my kids over the years too! What did she draw you?
that sounds cool.
I bet you were so proud of yourself.
I was disappointed too! It's hard to let your kids do your math for a little!
That sounds exciting.  What kind of work was it?
That's great! I'm happy for you both!
oh man. that's creepy. where was the last time you had those photos?
That's really cool. I used that to go on vacation last year.
I hate that parents! What happened?
I hate that kind. I hope he comes around soon though
Oh, wow! Congratulations! What job is it that? I'm a little jealous that you got it.
That's great you are so ready, you will definitely make it!
Oh, what kind was that?
It's always disappointing to find out that something that you were looking forward to is actually not. I hate disappointment when I am disappointed!
I'm sorry to hear that. What did she leave?
That's terrible.  What happened?
That would be a bittersweet day. What happened?
Yeah that is true, but I'm a single guy, I don't really need people's attention
That's awesome! Congratulations! How did it go down?
That is awesome!  You should be proud!
That's terrible. What happened?
That sucks. Did you call the poison control hotline?
I have had a bike before driving a bike.
I am so sorry!  That is terrible! Did he survive?
Yeah, it can't be easy to deal with. Did you have any issues figuring it out yourself?
Oh, yeah. I've had issues like this before.  I hope it went well and that it's easy to fix.
Oh, what kind idea was stolen?
Oh no, I hope she is remorseful. What a jerk. Did you get an A on the paper anyway?
That's great.
Oh wow, how old were you guys?
That's really rude. Did she have the right? I'm not a law student but I think that's a pretty common thing you hear about.
That's awful. I hope the professor understood and didn't punish the student for it. It's hard to see someone you like and care about taking advantage of you.
I bet that will bring you even more closer togeter
That sounds like a great project.  How long have you been doing house renovations before this?
That is so exciting! Did you choose your car?
Oh man that was awesome. Did you have to pay for it?  Was it worth saving up for?
i love my cat
I hate when my cat jumps on me. He jumps on my bed every time!
I hope things turn around for you. I hope you get some sunsets soon.
I hope things turn around. I miss you. I hope things turn around.
oh yeah, good, good for you. what are the chances of winning?
that sounds awesome
I'm sure that she can do it. What kind of issues have you experienced?
Yeah I remember when kids didn't say a lot and were very vocal.
Oh, that's tough. Did you have a plan, or was it a last-minute thing?
I know right? I feel that way about some of the people I meet.
That is sad. I lost two dogs in the past, both of them from the same family.
That is understandable.  I lost a few of mine last few years, and it was hard
That's so good!
Oh that's great! I'm glad you can't wait.
Oh yeah? What was it?
It can be scary to watch those
That's nice! What are your going to do on this vacation?
That's really cool. Where are you going to Alaska for?
That sounds awesome! Where are she coming from?
That's cool. I'm sure it was good for you to go. Did you learn any German?
Oh no! Did everything turn out as well planned as it should be doing?
Oh, great! I hope it goes well then.
AHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  That was so scary!
You must have been scared for sure. What movie is it? I haven't heard of it.
That's awesome. Did you keep them all?
That's really cool!
I hate horror movies. They freak me out.
i was in the same situation
That's great! What happened?
That's great. What's her name?  Is she married to anyone?
That is pretty annoying. Did he just smash the car?
That is a lot of money.  Did you take him to school?
That can happen with any job, how long is it for you?
I hate it. I hate the uncertainty. I wish you the best of the luck.
Oh. That's terrible! Did everything okay?
That sounds fine.  How long did you stay out for?
That's great! Where is your wife from originally in Germany?
I love video games, they can be so relaxing! I have to play them on breaks from playing video games.
I know it's tough but you'll get through this.  You're not alone.
That must have been tough, how are you coping?
It will be a good thing for you.
I'm sure the new city is wonderful, but you never know.  It's a risk to take new things in your life, so make sure you think about the potential risks.
Oh no. That's awful! Did you guys work together well enough?
Oh man, that's terrible. I hope nothin happened to them
Oh man, that's the kind of movie I like, what movie was it?  It's called the Dark Side of Celine Dion.
That's really interesting, I didn't know aliens had a special movie!  What movie is it?  Did you see it recently?
that's definitely true for me. I don't have the time for all the stuff I want
That's cool, what kind stuff do they get to do?  Are they rich?  I am curious about that.
That can happen when someone doesn't do their cleaning up.
That's disgusting!
It sounds like you have a very well-trained dog! How long has it taken?
That's really cool. I have always wanted a lab mix. What breed is it?
Oh wow.  That's great.  What kind is he?
that's too bad your not there yet
Yeah, it's hard when people move to where you want to live but can never.
That's terrible.  Did you call out the caterer and tell them to get off their d*** ass?
It was so stressful, but glad we found the other caterer.
I know how you mean. I used to work in retail and used to work in customer service for a bank, but now I just work in retail again.  It's so much harder to deal with them who want to complain and be rude.
That's good. You don't have to deal with difficult people. I'm not saying they are difficult people but sometimes people are.
That's so exciting. Where are you going? What country?
That's so cool. Where are you going?
That's scary. I hope you're alright.
That's creepy. Did you call the police to see if it was anyone who was trying something bad on himself.
Oh, well, that is the worst he could have done.  Maybe he was trying to avoid paying taxes on it.
That's terrible! Did he just steal from you?
That must have been good luck
That makes sense but still procrastinate sometimes, it's hard to get anything right before.
Yeah, that can be a bummer, but at the least she is aware of the fact that you were rushing and that's all.
That is awesome!
oh wow that is nice, how long have you been married?
I bet she appreciated it though!
Oh man, I'm sorry. It's not a big deal, and I'm sure she's not even going to notice!
I loved that movie.
I love horror movies. What is the worst one you've watched so far?
Yeah baby fever. It really gets on your mind a bit too
I'm a nurse midwif and I can help a woman have another baby if needed.
That's cool. Did you order it from a new website?
That's great that she got the right one! What kind is it?
That must be sad. How do they handle it when their in-laws don't like them?
I have my own in laws and they're great!
I'm sorry he's still not. Maybe try to make it harder to sleep.  He might need to learn.
I think he'll come around eventually. I have faith in him.
That sounds like fun! Did you guys like it?
That's really sweet. I'm glad she got it.
That's really sweet of her. What happened?
That's so true, she must have worked so much for us!
That is a common reaction, many people have a certain fear of roaches. They are a threat to our very way of life.
I lose it every day.
Oh no! Did you not invite anyone to the party?
That is bad, I hope everything worked out in your life.
Oh that. I miss my mom when she is away. She was the only one who took care for my kids.
That sucks! What type work was she going to be at?
I love movies. What movie are you seeing?
It's going to be a good time.
Oh wow. That is kind of you to go out of your way.
I feel the same way.  I am always feeling sorry for people who are struggling financially.  I wish I had the same luck she does.
That's really cool. I've always been curious about the puzzles our friends used to make. Did you find the puzzle?
I'm glad you framed it. I've got it framed too. It looks great. It's a picture I took. I took it to an art class to print and frame it.
That's a long road. What made you decide that?  Was there any traffic problems?  Did you see the beautiful views along the way?
That's awesome.  How long did it last?
That sounds great! Where are some of the places you went?
That is a good way to put things into words! It really is!
That's good!  What kind of renovation are we doing?  Is it a kitchen renovation or something else?
That's good, good for you to keep it that good!
It can't come fast enough right now.
That's great! Congratulations!
That's awesome. What's changed?
That sounds like a fun way to spend time.  What kind of pool is that you're talking about?
It will happen.
I agree. I feel lonely too
I have a huge collection! What album is it from?
Yeah, I was a kid when that came on. I was 8.
That's understandable. What motivated him to not do his schoolwork?
That can happen to anyone.  I'm sure he'll figure it out eventually.
It is good that the house was scary, but also that you ran back. I bet you were scared!
I think I'm going crazy.
It really does, I had one for about a year before switching to another one.
I feel for that. Sometimes it feels like we have to go out of our comfort zones and pay extra fees to get the things we want. But it's worth it, because the movies are so much fun to watch.
That's nice.
I'm glad for her, and the people around her, who care so much for her.
I know. It makes you wonder what's going on in her head, and what's going to happen next. But you have to be honest. If you want to be friends, just be yourself and see where things take it. It sounds like a good plan to me, so go for it!
You could just ask her.
that's crazy!
That sounds delicious. I love bison too. I've had bison meat a few places. It's so tender and flavorful! I think it would be great in a burger.
Oh no! That sounds like it could be quite smelly. Is it okay?
I bet that smell was gross
That's tough, how old is the toddler?
I hate it! When is he coming back?
That was the fun part! What did happen next?
That's a little creepy.
I feel for that, I've never gone to my parents' home by myself.
That is tough. I hope you can enjoy your time and not get bored. It's good for your mental health. I know how hard that can be when it comes on the family.
Oh, that's terrible!
I hope everything is better now?
I hate when I get caught with my hand tied behind back. What is the cat's name?
Oh that's so gross. Did you try putting her in a cage?
I am sorry to hear that. What kind is it that?
That sucks. Sometimes we need to ask someone for help
That must be nice. What movie is it about?
that's cool!  what did he buy it for you for?
That's terrible. Wasn't it hard for you?
That is annoying. Did you call them back to apologize for the inconvenience you had?
That's horrible! Did you get her back yet? I hope she had an easy flight!
I know the feeling. I was at a restaurant and the waiter told me my wife is getting back.
oh that must be nice.
That's great!  You're going to have a lot more time on your side!
That's so terrible. I'm really sorry to hear this. How old is the cat?
that sucks, cats are so cute and so much trouble, i have two dogs and one is a muti-cat.
I can understand why you feel that way, but there are always ways to get back up and keep moving.
That is so nice! You should volunteer more!
That sounds really cool! What happened? Did he do something you didn't expect?
That is so sweet of your.  I bet you loved it!  How long has it's been?
I have cheated. I feel like I cheated on my wife. I was tired, and I thought I was tired enough to cheat. But I didn't cheat, and I feel like I cheated my way out of my marriage.
That is so nice of saying. I think it's a matter of not having anything better to do than cheat. They seem like great partners, I think they just didn't have the best time when they met each other
that's a bummer.  did they cancel it?
That is unfortunate. I hope you can go back out tonight!
That is true, but we'll just spend more time together and just be.
I'm jealous, that's why I said baby steps
That's nice. I have a lot of respect for my mom. She's always been a good role model.
That's true, but sometimes you just gotta put up with it for love's sake
That's a long one
Oh wow. Are you going alone or with friends and kids?
I am happy for that too! Where you go next?
That's a fun trip! What are your favorite Disney things?
That's cool! What class is that for? I'm in accounting class, but I'm not that smart. Did you feel proud of your work?
That's awesome! Congratulations! How did you finish it off?
That's great. What do they like to do for you kids to be so special.
That sounds like they have great parents.
That stinks. Is he working extra hours at work or at the gym?
that is nice of you to do that for him
That's terrible! I am sorry to hear that you were let down.
That's terrible.  You will find something soon though you just have to keep looking
It should be great! How did they respond to you so fast?
I have. I applied last year. I am waiting to see if I get it.
It is nice when you have a trusted girlfriend
Oh, well you could go too, right?  I mean, you're not going there right?  It's not your girlfriend.  Maybe just ask her out?  I don't think she's that type of person to not know.  I mean, she's not going to be in a relationship right now, so why bother?
That's a great coincidence! Did you catch the train?
that's a good thing to be grateful for.
its probably just old. i had a coffee pot like this before.
I hate when you try to fix it and it doesn't fix it! You need to get it replaced.
I know how hard it can be.  Do you live in the east coast?
That must have been really stressful but you did great!
That's horrible. What happened after?
I hate that kind of people
That's terrible.  Did he have it for a while before we knew about his father?
I'm sorry. I didn't expect it to happen at my age. I hope they can help.
That must have been fun. Did they stay for a while?
That sounds so cool! Did they bring their kids with them too?
That's so smart! What type test is this?  Is it for school or work?
that's so smart of you, good for the future.
That's really sweet. I bet they must have some funny drawings in it.
That sounds like some fun. What kind were those?
That must've made you very happy! What happened that day was pretty cool. What did he say to make you remember?
That's great! I love when that kind of surprise happens
that would have scared me.
What a scary situation. It's always good that people are prepared. I hope everything is alright down here.
That's so sweet! What breed is she?
oh my, bassets can be a bit gruff
That sounds adorable! What kind is it
That is very rude.
Oh, oh, that's bad! Did you call the insurance?
That's pretty wild. Were you okay?
yea thunderstorm scares me
oh great good luck with that
That's awesome! Congrats! What's the school going for tuition?  Do you think you'll get it?
That must have felt great! How was the day going?  Did you do something fun?
That sounds lovely! Do you have a big yard?
That was nice of your neighbor. Did he help you with your repairs or your roof?
That sounds really kind of your neighbor!  What city did the windstorm hit in?
That's really cool. Congratulations!
That's great. I'm happy to hear!
That's so cool! Where is Disney?
That's awesome. I'm not a Disney person. I'm more of of a Star Wars guy.
Oh that's horrible! Are you alright? Did anyone help you up or anything like that?
oh man that's disgusting, what a gross experience.
That sounds like they really messed up. I have been with Comcast for 6 months now and they have been doing a great job.
Oh man! I hate waiting on the phone.
I am so fed with the state of society today. People are so lazy.
I completely get why you feel that way about queue jumppping, but I think people are often oblivious to the fact that they're doing it to an already overloaded person in a stressful situation.
That's so right! I remember that. We were all in the same boat
Yeah I saw that. I hope the storm goes away quickly.  It's so sad that so much damage went to.
That's nice. What did you get him for Mother's day?
That's awesome! I've gotten my partner a lot, especially my husband.
I love that place. What are they doing on their 4th annivarsry?
I would have called to see what they have for you.  I hope they can accommodate you.
That sounds like you and your wife are a very loving and family orientated family
I'm sure you're very excited. You're going to be a great grandma! I have three grandbabies myself and I love spending time with them.
That's terrible.  My dad is 75 and is in early stage dementia.  I wish I had a son like you.
That must have be tough for you.  I hope he is happy and healthy and happy to go to sleep every night knowing he is loved.  I would try to make him happy as much as you can.  I know how hard that must have be for you.
That's so sweet!
it was, it really was.
Oh, what test did they ask? Did you study hard for it?
It's good that you took the test!
That's awesome! What are you all doing together?
That's great! What test was it for?
Oh that is great! Is it coming soon?
Yeah, but if it happens, man will he be so proud of himself. He's always talking about it and bragging it out to his coworkers.
That's okay. Did he leave on his own?
That's unfortunate, maybe he'll be more interested next time he comes over
oh really? why is that?
Yeah, it's the little things like that make me realize it, right before bed.
I am sorry to hear that.
That's really unfortunate that your partner left. Have you considered therapy to work on your trusting nature and the trust of your relationship with your partner?
I know, right?
That's good to know, especially since there are so many travel advisories in place now.
That is terrible, what do you do to cope?
I'm sure it's not your friends who are the ones who are avoiding.
That's so nice of them.  What a wonderful parent they were.
That's pretty awesome. I have never been good at graphic design myself. What kind did your mom get you one of?
That sounds like fun! What was the tournament for?  Was it a big one?
That's awesome! What type was it? Was it online or offline?
That is one of the worst things I can think of too. I hate spiders.
I know right? they look so harmless but they're not. They're so creepy.
I'm not really a video gamer. I just play a few games. What about you? Do video games interest you at least? I don't know why I even play them, but my friend told me about this game called Overwatch and I'm curious. Do they interest you at all?
I am an old-schooler gamer myself. I am so jealous of all those youngblood gamers out here. I used to play all the oldies and they old-schoolies. I can play a good ol' fashioned NESiD game on my iPhone.
I hate when restaurants get our orders wrong too. Did they offer you a refund?
I know! I felt the same. It's just hard to believe they messed it so up so badly for a great restaurant like that.
I love flying! What was the trip for you?  How is it going home now?
that is sad.  What happened?  Was everything good?
I'm glad he is doing well. What sport?  What age?
That's so cool.  What age did he turn?
That sucks. Did she get the treatment?
That is bad, I hope she gets better
I am sure that moment was great!
That sounds nice. I graduated a little earlier. It does go by fast.
Oh wow. Did the insurance company send someone over to fix the damage?
That's terrible!
I am so ready for the tornado.  I am so ready for it.
That sounds very scary. Are the neighbors safe too?
Oh, nice mom, what made her decide to help out?  I've heard some good moms will do that just out of the goodness of the heart, and not for any other reason.
Oh, that's nice of your mom, she's probably worried that she's going to get in trouble if you don't.
That's very kind of you to be so supportive of him.
That's very sweet of you.  I'm glad to hear.  What kind health problems?
Oh, I'm sorry! Was anything stolen?
That's awful.
That is so weird. Do you know of someone else with the fear? I do. I have a cousin with the same fear.
That's a scary feeling. I hate when that happens.
I'm sure that happens to many couples.  What happened?
That's terrible.  Why did you leave your wife for another woman?
That was creepy. What did happen?
I bet! How did you end? Did you enjoy it though?
That's really cool. I've been married for 30 years myself.
That's a good point.
That's so sweet of you. Are they able?  What party is this?
That's really sweet of you.  I'm sure he would love to be there.  What is your party about, exactly?
That sounds like you are taking care of yourself. I have never been one for a gym, but my wife and I have gotten a treadmill and exercise together.
That sounds great!  What exercise is it you are doing?
That's awesome! What kind is it?
That's great news for you! I'm happy for you guys as well
That's not bad. Did the scratch off win in a lottery or something else like that.
That's great news! What kind was it of course but I'm sure that was exciting for you
That's very kind of grandma. What did she give her?
Yeah thats a bugging feeling. I think its just because of a lack of communication or something like that. I'm not a big believer of my sister being so mean.
I know, I was really bumming out about it. I had to wait so I could go. I'm hoping the rain will go away soon. It's been so long since I've been to the beach. I hope the sand is not all messed up yet!
I agree, it was still fun.
That's great! What job? Did they hire someone else?
That's great! What is the new job that is? I'm curious.
Oh, oh, oh! I hope noone saw that.
Oh, wow, that is hilarious! Did anyone laugh or something like that?  That would make my stomach do flips!
That can be tough. Are you okay?
I understand that. It can be hard.
It can be scary. Do you live in a big house or a condo?
That's awesome! I'm sure it'll work great out!
I agree.  Why do you want to hit someone on a date?
I understand your perspective.  It's just sad to hear.  I don't hit anyone either because of that reason.  I think people hit others out of fear.  They're trying to find a friend in a lonely life.  But they usually end up making the wrong kind and end up hurting their own lives.
I love that movie! What is it about this time around?
I am excited for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.  It is going to be a huge one.
I do it too!
I can understand that. But sometimes we have no choice, right?
That sounds awesome! I am jealous of you! What did it cost him to make it so special for you?
Wow, I love your enthusiasm for life's gifts.
I understand. People have become so lazy.
i feel the same way about trash and littering
That's normal. What heights? Is that the kind of fear you have?
That is hilarious! I bet you were so nervous.
That can happen. It was me who interviewed. What job were you interviewing for?
That's nice. I'm glad to hear. What position was it?
That's going to sound like a blast. Where did you want to go?  California or the Bahamas. I've always loved the Bahamas.
That's so cool!  What do they do there at Disneyland?
Oh, cool! Congratulations! How much is it?
What color is it?
Oh, wow! That must be a wonderful thing for the kids to have
It does.
I agree with that philosophy.  It is great that people can be so selfless and help others.  It helps to have people around us.
Oh wow. That must've been frustrating. How'd she react to you pointing that out to her?
That's awful. Did she get caught up in anything?
I feel you. Sometimes people have no reason for it and it can make us very irritable.
That's so rude. Did you tell her?
That's really hard. What are you going to do?  Do you have another friend to hang with?
Oh that sucks. I had to move my family to another country a few years back and i miss my family. I miss the people. I hope they will come to visit you.
I've never tried, do you walk a lot? I walk every day.
Yeah goals are good but dont forget about your own goals!  What goals do you want to achieve?
That's really interesting. What do people often mistreating? I know some people donkey kick dogs.
That's really true. I think we're all on the same side of things when we think of animals. I think most people do.
I am sure. How did you feel about graduating?
That sounds like it was worth it. What was it for again?
I love online shopping.  How much is it?
That's cool. What brand?
Oh wow. How tragic. I hope she's doing all right.
That sounds nice. What kind things?
I agree.  It's been a tough road for us in the US, and I think we've all got a lot to be proud.  We are a unique country.
I agree with you, but I think we need a strong voice for those of us with differing views. We need a strong voice to stand for our views. I agree though. We need to come together.
That's cool! Where was the lab?
That is so cool that it was a project for work.
That's sad. What kind is it.
I had to look at some pictures of my dog, she was such an important part of our lives
I hope he keeps up his good work.  I am always happy to hear that.
That's good to hear. It's a lot to ask of a manager. I'm happy to hear he's doing well. What division is he working?  Is it finance or business?  Is he working in an office or out of the house.
that's a terrible.
Oh that must be so. What happened?
That's cool, did you meet people?
That must have been scary! What happened next was good though that they helped you.
I am sorry to hear this happened. I hope you can get your puppy.
that's so kind of you!
Oh my gosh, how old is he? Is he in pain or anything like that? I hope he gets over this soon
That stinks, I know he was that way with his last tooth
I know, it can be.  But it will be easier.
oh thats a bummer
I bet that sounds like a really fun vacation! Where is Italy?
that is cool! where are they?
I agree.  I love Italy.  My family has been to there a few times.  I have not been but I am planning a trip there.  I am not sure I will go.
That sounds nice. What kind of lunch did you get?
Oh wow! That is a great treat.
Oh yeah. I get that feeling sometimes too. I hate when drivers do it, and people do the opposite. I get in my lane.
What an annoyance. I have a similar experience at the intersection.
That must be so scary. What makes it worse? Is it really dark outside?  Do you have to go outside at night?
i know that feeling. what keeps you calm in such dark and scary places?
I love animals. Do you have any dogs at home that need walking or play time with?
Oh wow! That is really cool to do!
I hate when the power goes out. Was it just your neighborhood or the whole area?
That would be scary, especially if it was just for a few minutes.
That sounds very sad. I bet that was very upsetting for her.
I have had that problem, it's a bummer
That's terrible. What did you do?
That sucks. I'm sure that milk must of gone bad.
I love rain!
I know. I was on the phone the other day and my phone just rang and rang and ringing ringringing ringing ringringringing ringringringingring ring!
That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear about that. What happened exactly happened?
That's terrible.  Did you talk to your employer about possibly getting a loan or something?
That's a bad time to be playing video games. I don't gamble, but I do gamble sometimes. I usually gamble in the sports betting pool. It's a lot of fun, especially on Sundays after a big week of work.
That was awesome. I love that place you go to. I bet I would go there and lose my money.  I can't believe you did that!
Yeah, New Orleans is so unique! It has such an incredible music scene.
Yeah, New Orleans has that laid-back vibe that makes it so fun.
You have to be very careful with that, you want to make a mistake like that one and only and not the other way.
Oh, man. I know that feeling. I hate when people don't keep their promises.
That's a pretty unusual way to start the day! What happened? Did you get a ticket?
i know. i made one too. sorry about that
Oh, that's quite interesting. I would probably stay there with my girlfriend.
That's not good, I hope everything works fine now
Oh that sounds nerve wreckring. Did you practice it?
Yeah that's good that.
ye,its so hard when you know you know better than they dont
Yeah, sometimes that happens with friends. It's like, they just aren't interested anymore, or they just got tired and moved on with their life. It's frustrating because sometimes it's the last person in the room!
That was so cool. I've always been impressed by those who are financially independent early.
That's awesome! It's always good to be surprised!
It was. I broke my own finger a week or two back and was stuck in the same place for a while.
That must have been painful!
Oh that sounds good! How old are they?
Yeah, that happens, I did once and had to rush.
That is frustrating.  I am a big fan, but not enough people to go to the store!  It is like trying to get a cat!
That happens sometimes. Did something specific cause it?
I know right right there
Oh that sounds amazing! What school were they shopping at?
That is awesome that you fought so hard for everyone.
I bet that you're right though.
I love shopping online, but sometimes I feel bad ordering stuff that might go to waste
oh that's no fun at all!
That's so cool! I bet that was so scary!
that sucks, what was it about?
I think you mean eating chocolate mints from a box. That's what I did at the play I went.  I don't think I could've been blindfolded while eating.
Yeah, it's hard. I hope you guys get that big bonus!
It's hard. I wish him well!
That's really generous of your friend.
that is pretty cool
That's a pretty embarrassing memory, but I'm sure it's one of your favorite memories.  What party was it?
I can understand why.
Yeah, I can get a lot of nervous.
That's really cool! I hope you do too well!
That's really frustrating. What happened? Did she just not sleep?
I bet she had you laughing! What a sweet cat!
That would have been an interesting story.
Oh wow, you are really smart then.
That's so sad! Did you apply again?
That's good news though. What college was you accepted in?
oh that's horrible.  why would he do that?
It is annoying when people choose their friends over others they care for.
It has definitely changed the way people play video games. I remember when I was a teenager playing Mario on the Super Mario Bros, I was really just playing the game and not really paying attention to the story.
I know what you're talking about.
That is terrible. Are you from the south? I live up north and I love roller coasters!
I love rollercoaster rides and I know just where to find them.
It's exciting, but be prepared, it's going to be hard
That is awesome news! What field do you work?
Oh yeah! I feel the same way about my life.
That must be so special!
That's pretty cool. What kind is the name of his bowling ball? I don't recall the names of the different bowling ball weights. I love bowling!
I do, but I'm a bowser fan so I have a bit of a bias. I've been bowling since I was a teenager and I still have my favorite bowling ball set. I'm a bit old and my joints get clogged up when I'm trying out a new ball, but I'm still a bowser! I've never been good enough at bowling to make it into high school, so I'm not sure if I'll make the team.
I hope it's nothing bad. Have you called police? I would hate to hear about something.
That sucks. Are you thinking of moving out of the house?
What happened?
I've never heard that before, but I would love it if you could tell me more about it.  How did it feel to be pro bowling when it's just you and a few balls in your hands?
That can be tough, but it's good that you feel like you're telling your true self.  How long ago was this?
Yeah, you could've left it out too, she might not have known how you really feel, she might not be aware. But you know what, sometimes when someone makes such advances, you feel guilty, because then you think they might have some kind of issue. But sometimes if someone is making advances like that, and if the relationship is going to end or if there's something going on, maybe sometimes they're trying to get close to something that's going on, and sometimes if you
That sucks! What place is it in? Was it fun to stay close to them?
I am glad for you to have that kind family that you can always come back to. You deserve to be safe and sound with people that care
That is normal.  You will get back to school routine after graduation
That's great, you're smart enough to handle that.
that's the best thing ever.  college is so excit.
Yeah, I procrastinate a lot.  Do you like to procrastuate?
I bet! What did you have?
Yeah bowling alley pizza?  That's a weird thing.  I love pizza but I'm picky and don't go out of town without getting a slice.  I'm going there tomorrow to get a slice and maybe another slice of pizza.
I hope he starts to calm down soon.
that is horrible to see, how old are your boys?
That's exciting! Are you playing it with friends or solo? I love playing games, what is the game you are playing?
that's awesome
That is frustrating, what do they argue about the worst of?
That's awful! Are they arguing a lot in front of the kids?
I agree.  I love the storm.  The thunderstorms.  The lightning.
oh my, that must have been scary for you
That sounds great!
That's good.
Oh no! What kind is it?
I can imagine! I love going back and looking back on my own life experiences as well. I hope it brought you some nostalgia and happiness!
That's cool. I have never tried to play any sports, but my wife and I played some golf last year. She's a really talented golfer. I think we should play some together.
It really stings! Did he practice a lot?
I have had nerves about starting my new job too. How about it?
that sucks.  what job is it.
That is a bad customer.
I know.  I just hate messing with the wrong forms.  I'll just go back to using the old fashioned way, paper.  I know it's a hassle, but it's better than the wrong stuff.
I love road trips! What a fun trip! Did you have any issues on it?
That's cool! I've been there once. What a great spot for hiking and sightseeing
oh that is so sweet of him!  What did it be?  Was it a Honda Civic or a Mustang?
Yeah that's cool, I wish I had a car like that.
Yeah, I was too once, and then bought one.
I hope you don't end up breaking the bank on it.
That's a crazy story. What a jerk.
That sounds crazy. I don't like gas can thieves either.
I'm sorry to hear that! Did you try calling the company to see if they would fix the car or not? I'm sure they have your best interest in mind!
I hope it starts up tomorrow!
I agree.
I hate presentations too
That's gross! Did you have to wash your shoes afterwards?
That's disgusting. I would hate to do the job myself.
oh thats so bad
I can imagine. Did you talk to them about it afterwards?
Oh, how much do textbooks usually cost in college?
Oh wow! That is so cool! Did you have to buy them or get a loan to pay for them?
I love that you get money for your service
I am glad you did your service for the country.
It's always nice when you get what you pay for.
That's really cool! Did you find it at an good deal?
I feel your sadness.
Oh yeah, that makes it a habit.
I know right?  It is like it's mocking you.  Do you have any pants that are stain resistant?
That's awful. Do you wash them frequently?
I am so sorry. That was so devastating.
Oh wow, that's really scary.  Did you lose anything?
I'm one of them. How does that make people unhappy? Do they not know the importance of water?
I have never thought about that.
I can't wait for this weekend!
That sounds great! Congratulations!
Oh wow. Why would you want me not ride the thing?
It's good to get some exercise and be active every day. I'm glad you made time to go.
I was surprised too. What did you do? Did you have a party?
That is so sweet of them. It's not like you would have known about it.
oh that is so scary
That is so scary. I was sure something terrible was going on.  I am so worried I will never see her again.
That does seem like they are a bit sketchy, but what is wrong with them if they won't do anything?
That sucks, but they might have issues verifying your bank account. It's a security issue.
That's so cool! Are you sleeping right?
That is so frustrating when that is the one time you wanted to sleep
That's scary! Was it a dog or something? Did you call the police or anything?
That's creepy. Did it happen at all again?
That's terrible! Did you do okay on the test?
It is okay to feel nervous when giving presentations. It shows that you are concerned about presenting well.
That's so tragic. I'm sorry for your loss.
That's terrible.  I hope she is at peace.
That's good to have people believe you can get a date!
that's awesome news!
That is awesome you always have the right tool for anything. I am always carrying a small first aid kit and a small flashlight.
That sounds like you would be a handyman/ handy-woman. What kind multi tool does it have on it
That's exciting! What position is it?
That's awesome!  What kind of law do they handle?
that sucks. how old was it?
that's nice.  I've always liked my old ford truck.  I had one of the new fusions trucks and I think they did them cars justice!
I went back myself. It's a lot easier than it used to be.
That's a lot of hard work. I'm glad you're taking the initiative. What school are you in now?
That's great. What did you eat for your break?
That's awesome! What kind pancakes are they making for?
i feel good about saving money
I feel you on the safety net.
That's great! How many kids do you hope?
Yeah, having a baby changed a lot of people's perspective of life.
That is so cool! What cruise is going on?
That is so cool!  How much did they book for?
I don't know why, is it a big sister or small sister?
Oh that's a pretty cool thing to do
That's so sweet! What kind was it?  Did she get you one too?
That's not fair! What happened? Did they have a problem?
That is sad.  Why not?  Is everything fine with them?  Did they not like the idea of coming?  Do you really need a lot of attention?  It is just one day.  Maybe they just need to spend the day with you instead.
Oh wow that's nice that you had time to relax with your family. I'm so glad to hear.
That is nice, I am glad you had the chance to do so. I hope you both enjoyed it. Did you have fun watching tv with dogs?
That's a bums up. Did you end up going?
That is terrible.  I would hate that too.  It is always hard to find people who care.  I hope you can find them again next time.  I hate being disappointed by friends and family as much.  I hope you have fun and enjoy yourself at the party.  It will be even better next time.
I bet they loved that.  Did you guys watch TV?
That's pretty funny. I've got dogs too. They are fun to watch.
It will get better soon!
That sucks.  I hope your wait doesn it out.
Wow thats so interesting, where is the attic located of your house?
That must've be very sentimental.  What did he find?
That is sad, did she say anything to make it worse?
That's really kind of her. I hope she had good luck.
That's so scary. What happened exactly happened?  Did you get into it over anything specific, or over nothing at all
That is crazy. I would have reacted in the same situation. I'm not sure why some people get more tolerance from it than I do. I would not let anyone get in my way. I would have said I don't know why you are doing this, but I will not let you get in front of my friends. I was so scared.
That is terrible. Did he recover quickly enough to get back on track with us?
That sucks. Did he get back on his feet?
That can be annoying, what makes you get anxious about it
Yeah, that happens a lot!  Do you ever call out the person that doesnnt respond to see when they are going to get you a text?
That's so true! I love my little puppy!
that's so true dogs have no concept about humans suffering
That's terrible.  What kind surgery?
That sounds scary. I bet.
That's really sad. Did the people who were there safe themselves?
I am so sorry to hear. That sounds so scary. Are you safe now?
That is sad.  What happened to your dog?  Why did it die.
That's so sad. I can imagine how hard that was for you
That's okay. You can join a gym or a book store or a library.
That is nice.  I hope you find some friends soon.
That must've looked awesome!
That's too bad! I've always been jealous when I had a new car and now I've got one too! What made you jealous of your neighbor?
I am sad too.
I feel you, I live far away from my family so I feel that,
That's okay! What did you want it to be?
That sucks. Did you try again?
I hit my daughter with a car on the parking lot and did not say a thing.
I know that experience. It was my son's birthday party and I was late. He was upset because I didn't tell his momma
That's so cool!  What were you sick with?
That's so nice of your.
That sounds like it might have come from a stray dog. Did you call the cops?
I hate how dogs howl.  They should not be allowed!
That must have made her very proud. What did she buy for it?
oh, nice, nice mom
I don't think that's what happened. Why would you be ashamed?
oh man, what happened? did they not call? did they not invite?
Oh that's not good. What kind pranks?
That's terrible. Did they make fun of your clothes or something like that?
I'm glad you were okay! Did you see a movie recently that scared you like the one did you see?
I'm afraid of that kind too! I usually go out at least a hour or so to be sure.
That's great! How far is it from your home to your destination.
That must have made you feel a bit sad
That would be terrible, what do you think happened? Did she leave?
That is a bad thing!  What's she doing?
I don't get why that is sad?
I'm sure there are plenty of other movies you could watch instead!
That's awesome! Did you guys go to the Outer Banks or somewhere else near home base of yours?
It's always nice when the weather is good.  I hope you had fun!
That's really exciting. Where and for how much?
That sounds like fun, I'm going on a honeymoon in Italy in December.  We'll have the place to ourselves.
That is pretty common. I had candy and ate the whole thing in about 2 minutes.
I know right! I love candy too but sometimes I just need to control my cravings and not let it get out. I was a little bit disappointed with myself for letting my craving win. I guess I just needed a little discipline to stop eating it.
I am sorry to hear.  Is your wife's health back to normal now?
I am sorry to here about that. That must have beent so tough on you.
oh no that stunk
That sucks. Have you called the plumber he hired?
It will go okay?
Oh no, that must be nerve wracking.
I understand how that can affect you. What do they usually argue about?
It is frustrating. I would just like them to get it through their heads. They should just get over their childish behavior and move forward.
You had a bad experience?
That sounds awful. What happened?
Yeah, I do. I was a little worried when my son was born but now that I am an older mom, I feel like I'm in my prime. I'm 50 now and I've been a single mother for about 5 years now, so I'm in my prime in my mind!
I do, I have a 2nd son.
I'm sorry for losing your dad.
That is very sad. I hope you find peace.
Oh, what happened? Did something scary or weird occur?
Oh man I was laughing thinking it would be a normal glass door.  That sounds like a pretty crazy experience.  I hope the prize money helps out.
That is awful.
I agree, it's always a good thing to apologize to the kids in the house when it happens.
That is true. People are not what they appear.
That's nice! Did you get him a good cab?
that was awesome
that was awesome to hear!  I hope you all can go again soon
Oh my gosh, how scary that must of felt. I have never fallen at a carnival before, I hope it wasnt too bad.
It's always good that people are there.  They are always there to help.
It's normal to be upset. It can be hard. Did you lose it or it was adopted out of you care of?
that is very sad, I lost my cat once and it was a real blow.
That is very frustrating.
That sounds pretty annoying. I bet you had a tantrum about returning it though.
That's so sweet! What kind do you like best?  My favorite is a chocolate cake.
I am sure everyone loves ice cream! Did it help make you happy?
That's awful, are the dogs okay or have they gotten away from you?
That's awful. Is it a dog or toddler issue or something?
That's so cool! I'm a nursing student and I'm pretty proud that my niece is done! Congratulations!
oh that's amazing, congratulations to your niece! Nursing must have a lot to do with her personality! What kind did she major in, was she going to be a nurse?
i would be so happy
That's so sweet! I wish you guys were going out for dinner!
I would love that. Did you enjoy looking through them?
Oh, wow! That must have brought tears of joy to our faces! Did you have them on a computer or in a book?
Oh I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you call the repair service?
I can understand why that would be annoying.
I bet! What state? I love new places! What new places are you moving to? I love Texas. I live there!
Oh, I know. It's going to be nice. I am so ready to leave all of my stress behind and move to a better state of mind!
it's so good for you
I run 3 miles every Sunday.  I'm 29 years old and I run to keep up the stress of working.
That's great. What made you be able to sleep in?
That sounds like a great husband you got there
That's always great to have good news! What's your family doing to celebrate?
that sounds good, good for him
That is good.  How are you doing?
That's awesome. How old was your daughter when she started pre-school?
I have no idea what Central TX is. Is it near where Austin is in?
I live in the same area.  I hope the family is alright.  I'm so sorry!
That's very sweet of you.
That's the worst part, right after you think you're safe and relaxed, your life is turned around and then suddenly, BAM. Your life is disrupted. I hope your day goes better!
I do that sometimes too. Maybe try cutting back on some of those foods.
I know, I hate myself when that happens to me too lol
I know how you feel! What's going on?
That's terrible. Is he willing to work for a lower salary or a different position at the company?
Oh, what a fun day! I bet they were excited. What were they doing?
That's awesome.  I've never gone.  How was it?
That's amazing! Congrats on the puppy!
That sounds amazing. I have a dog that is 12 months. I'm trying my dog training to get her potty trained. I don't know if I did a bad thing by getting her. I love her to death! I just don't want her to be a poop on my carpet. I'm not sure I did a bad thing. I don't get to do it right away though. She's been peeing on the rug for a month now. I am not a
That's always tough. Did you move in a hurry?
That's really cool. What house was it at?
I love it!
That is awesome! What's your position on your soccer team?  Are you a forward or midfielder?
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's terrible.
That's sad. I'm sorry for his passing. I hope he is in a better place.
That's very kind of you to share. I think people often don't think about how old their parents were before passing away, and they often just think about their parents being older when that happened. It's a good point that you don't want to minimize their age, but it's also a good point.
That's great that you are motivated to do the same.
I think you need to focus on eating healthier, it sounds like she's a superfood junk food kind!
That sucks.  You should get the mailman to keep a closer eye on it.
that is terrible, did you report them to the postmaster?
I love my cat
oh that sucks
Oh wow! That's awesome. How old is he now?
that's amazing
That can be. I've been in that situation.
I know the feeling. Sometimes it's hard not having a refund, especially when it comes to concert prices.
That was my brother's first trip.  He stopped there a few days ago.  I was so worried he was going to get in an accident.
Oh wow. What a gross thing to say about them?
That is crazy. What happened after?
Yeah, that's crazy how fast a time accidents happen.
That's crazy. I can imagine that you were stressed out about those. I have had to work on that a couple of times.
I understand. It is difficult, I am sure.
What kind of computer part is needed?
That's good that you got it done in time.
That has happened to me a lot of the times I go to restaurants. It happens because of dehydration and eating too much or not drinking enough
That's crazy! I bet it was embarrassing
That's awesome! What kind was it?
Oh no, I'm sorry.  I've heard of people staying with eachother at those festivals.  That's very brave.  How did you end up?
I've been in that place before. I know, I know.
that sounds like a bumpy ride, but sounds fun too, I've watched that movie a few times!
That's terrible. Did they say anything to you?
That's terrible. I'm sorry.  Is he in heaven?
Yeah I know right?!
I can understand that, but I'm not sure if I can handle it anymore, haha.
That's so typical, how was your date?
That's pretty sweet. I'm sure it helped to break the ice. Did you hit the hole in one game?
That's so cool! What did you do to learn tricks on the tableta?  What's your favorite place?
That sounds very sad. What a terrible loss. I hope time helps you get over the pain of that.
That's really sweet. I bet it's really sentimental.
That is true, but sometimes you have to take risks if you want someone. I mean, if you are not in it, why even bother having them back in your thoughts right now.  But sometimes you have to go back for them, even if you don't want to. It just depends on you and your relationship with the person you want back with you.
Oh, wow.  You're in a relationship.
I don't know. I am a scaredy cat.
Oh, you are a brave person.
That's cool! What are you doing at the rave?
That's great! Did anything bad happen during the rave?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? Did she have to end up dating someone she met online? Or was there something else going on that made her decide?
Oh no. That sucks. I hope everything works out for her though.
Oh, that's weird! What kind haunted house was it in?
Oh man, that's a scary thing! Are you scared of ghosts or haunted houses in general, or is this specifically a ghostly issue you're afraid of?  Do you think you'd go back out to go to another haunted house if you did? I'd go for sure!
That's no fun.
That's anoying.  What do she do?  Does it make noise that can't be stopped?
that's really cool!
That's great. I love mini golf.
It is!
That is exciting.  I have a niece who is due in two days and I'm getting a headcount for my party.
Oh wow.  What are your vacation plans?
I'm going to Universal Studios Hollywood this year.
I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a vacation?
Oh, did you have anyone over?
oh no, that must of been scary
That's awesome. What kind math do they cover in the test? I am curious.
That's too bad she left for that long time. I know how that feels
I am sure, that was tough.
That is always a relief.
that is awesome. how many people are you and 3 pools is quite a lot.
That's great! What kind was it about the new job? Was it related or was you looking to move?
it's good you got it, I'm sure you're thrilled
that is pretty impressive
That's pretty cool. I like the way you guys can be friends at the end of the night but be like, "You can't beat that" when they're at the bar the rest night.
That's unfortunate. Was there another scholarship you could apply?
That's frustrating, but you can't be disappointed with what you don't get
I agree.  I have been waiting 30 days for something, but so far nothing.
That's true
That's a big accomplishment. I'm proud.
Wow, congratulations. That's awesome. What field will she be working in?
That makes sense. I like my alone time too, it allows my mind time.
Oh, that's interesting. I think people who like to be alone more often than people who like to be in groups do so for reasons like that, and maybe also because they're not afraid of hurting someone's feelings by talking. I mean I like it too sometimes, but I don't want people talking to my face or something, or even looking me up in the eye.
I bet that dog was sooo stoked about eating grass. Did you have a dog too?
Oh wow, what breed is she?
Oh wow! Congrats! What kind is your boy's age in months and what's the sex of the boy.
That sounds great!  I am a little jealous.  I am an only baby and I have no baby gear.  I wish I could get a crib!
That is really kind of them.  I appreciate people doing that.
Yeah, sometimes you just need someone to help you out.
That's really adventurous. Did you enjoy yourself?
I hope you had a wonderful trip!  What country was it?
That's very impressive. Did you fly with her?
That must've been so exciting! What did she fly?
That is okay. People can be untrustible.
That's weird, why did you leave? Did you go to school?
That sounds like a pretty high price. Are you sure it's worth that?  I don't know what your Jeep is worth, but $2000?  That's a lot!  Did you not tell him about that before he said it?
that sucks, I once had someone do my car for $1000 and it was a clunker
I have one daughter.
That's great news! Congratulations! How many weeks now until you meet the baby?
Oh wow! That's pretty cool! What made you do that? Did you have any friends who were going?
I have done it twice. I was so nervous on the flight but once it was on the ground everything went smoothly.
That's awful. I'm sorry.
Yeah, that's terrible. How old is she now? Did you guys break up recently too?
That's exciting! Are you having any complications during the delivery process?
That's exciting! Congratulations! What type baby is it?
oh man thats so sweet. what happened next after that?
That is a lot to do in 4 hours. What was it like then?
That sounds like a sad story.  Did she pass?
That's so sad. Did he have a good life?
That's not right. What was she doing?
Oh wow, you must be very happy that you're together then. That's not very healthy to do.
Oh that is quite a shock! Did someone break in?
Oh no. That must've been frustrating.
That sounds exciting! Congratulations!
that's so exciting
That is horrible news.  I am so sorry.  I am so heartless.
I'm so sorry. That is terrible. I have lost so many friends to drugs and addiction.
That sounds fun!
That's cool!  I've never been into bands.  I bet it was cool.
That must have scared the wits outta you!
That's not good, I don't have much in the way to do but sit.
That must be nice.  What kind of house is it?
Oh wow! Congratulations on your home sweethears!
That's nice.  Did everything work out okay for you?
Yeah, it was scary. I think the window might have been open, and a bird flew out and started banging. Then it flew back up and down and up again and I was screaming and trying to close the thing. I think the window was open for a minute or two and I think the whole thing might have been a bird trying to get back to the window and get back to its nest.
Oh no. What happened?
that's great, how long have they been studying the bible for?
That happens to the worst of us!
i hate that about me
That's so much fun! What is your favorite type of food to get at a movie theater?
That's a fun way to spend time together.
That must have felt good. You must be proud of yourself.
That sounds great! Congratulations!
I hate rejection.
That's terrible. Did you try again?
That's terrible! What was wrong?
Oh man, did you find out who did it? Or did you just have a bad experience? I've never had one either
That's terrible! Did you crack it on purpose?
Oh, that was a tough situation. Did you two end up fixing things?
I know how that feels
That sounds great, where you go?
That's really cool. How much did you have saved?
Yeah that's good to hear. It's good to be able handle emergencies like this. I hope you get more money in return!
oh man, that is terrible, what did you do after?
That happens to a lot of people, but at the end, it can be good to laugh.
That's really cool. Congratulations!
I can relate to that. College is a big transition for anyone, but especially for the parents of high school kids.
That's frustrating. I hope you were able to resolve it.
It sounds like someone else did yell back though. I hate when people do that! It makes me feel so angry! I wouldn probably have gotten fired too. That sounds like someone is trying to get a rise outta you. I would definitely go and get a manager!
That's a little strange. What happens when people don't notice you?
That's great.  I wish you had more people to hang with.  You should try to meet new friends through work, hobbies or classes you could take to get to meet more people.
That's fun! What do you like most about it?
Oh that's nice. What pool do you go to most often at that.
That sounds nice.  What kind of illness is she in?
Yeah, that's nice.
Oh yeah, that must make life so great! How long will they last?
That's so true. Family is so precious.
That's really sweet of them! What year was that party for you?
That sounds nice. What kind of party?
Yeah that was scary. Did you lose anything else in your yard?
I'm glad it was just a tree. I would have been so upset.
That sounds awesome! What breed is she? I'm so jealous!
That's so cool! How big of dog is she then?
That is very sad. What happened? Did they divorce?
That's tough. Did they leave for a new job?
That is unfortunate.
I feel you bro. He needs to get a grip and not get too caught off by a surprise.
That would have made you sick?  What kind food was it?
I hate when that happens.  What kind was the hair in?
That's okay! What was wrong? Was it the park?
I know right. I went there once when I was little and I was terrified of anything that moved.
Oh, I bet that was uncomfortable.
That's awful, did they not know you were watching your back? I hope they're watching yours now.  Maybe try to be more considerious next time?  It's not easy being around people like that, I would say.
I feel you.  I used to be part of the school.  Now everyone moved away to a new school.
That's okay, you can always try to make friends, but you might be lonely. Maybe you should look online and join online communities or something. I'm sure you'll make friends!
That can be very hurtful
Oh, that is understandable.
oh yeah that one was scary.
oh wow that was scary! did you see what movie it was about?
Oh no. I'm so so sorry. I'm really going to miss you.
I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you can find some comfort in the memories you made with your father. I lost my father at the same time and still miss talking about him and his life.
What happened?  Was she cheating?
I was in the same situation.  She left me after 3 months of us being married.  We were married in 3 months.  I think she had a miscarriage.  I thought we would work through it and she came to her senses.  I thought I would get a divorce and move on with my life.  But I guess I was just wrong.
Oh that's a nice thing to do! I haven't been to one of these in a while, but I've been thinking about it lately.
That is a lot of time you spent. I wish you had gotten burnt.
I know that. It makes me sad too. What happened to them?
I think everyone feels like this, even though you don't want to admit it. I think you just want to fit in and be accepted. I wish you would just speak up for once. It can make you more accepted by everyone.
That's always so special for me.
That sounds like a great way to bond as a group.
That's awesome! Did you enjoy it
I bet! That sounds like a lot of work for a party.
I am sorry.
that is so true
That is understandable. I get it.  It's hard when your parents don't care about what you're going on about
I feel you bro, I have parents who never pay me any attention, and they always seem to be on the phone or on their phone
That's not the worst part. What were the wires for anyway?
That is awful. I hate when dogs do that. What happened?
Oh my goodness. Are you a little annoyed at your downstairs roommate?
That's awesome you stood up for it! I wish you would do it
oh no i am the same way too lol what are some things that you trust more?
I am sorry. I hope you can find a way out of that situation. It's hard to be trusting with people who are mean or just generally mean-spirited. It makes it harder to find trust in people who don't have it to offer.  I know how you feel.
That's a big accomplishment to reach.
That's great! I am sure you will do well.
That's the worst. I don't like it when you have to go back in there every 6-12 months.
Oh, yeah. I don't like going either, but sometimes you just have to.
that's awesome! good job
I am so inspired right about now. I have a dream too and I will work very hard for that. I am going to college in the next  two months and I am going to apply!
You think they would even notice you? lol
That's awesome! What a game!
That's great! What was so special?
That sounds great! What kind is it?
That sounds good!  I'm not too good with cars.  I don't want to spend too much either.  I've been thinking of a Honda.  Is it reliable?
That is crazy! Did you try opening a window to get rid of him?
That's gross. I hate when that happens. I'm glad you ran into your bedroom and locked it. I hope the bug didn't bite you too.
that sounds nice, how did you like the cheese?
That is nice of your neighbor.
That sounds deliciously unique!
I have tried Cabots before, but it's not my favorite.
That's too bad. I'm sorry about the loss of your brother. I know how much you miss them.
I'm so so sorry, I know how much he meant to you.
It does sound a bit rainy.  Do you think you're going to go anyway or are just going to stay home and stay dry inside the house.
That sucks.  Why are they going anyway in the first place.
Oh, that's nice. What did you do over the weekend?
That is nice. I wish you a relaxing weekend too. I bet it felt good to be with them
That sounds like fun. Did you have fun?
That is awesome. What kind food did you eat?
I agree.  We need to work together.
I agree with you on that, it really seems like the country is becoming very polarized
I'm sorry for the loss.  I have family too.  I wish I had more time to spend with mine.
I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry you lost both parents. I hope you can get back to normal life.
That can be really frustrating
Oh man.  Why didn't you visit them?
Oh man! What kind concert is that going to be of?
That's really cool. What kind of music do they make.
That's great.  How long have they been in charge of property management for?
That's good that she's being efficient.
I am so excited for summer!
I feel the same way about my kids. They go to school every day.
Oh no! What happened?
That's so awesome! Did you guys have fun?
That's great! Where is Virginia Beach?
That's awesome! Did you win the lottery?
Oh, that's sad. I don't even get why people do it though. I mean, I know a lot of friends of mine have done well off lottery winnings, and they're always happy to help them out financially.
That's wonderful news! Congratulations! How much will it pay you both?  *big smile *  I am a huge football fan.  How much will you be paid in total bonuses per month for you?
oh thats nice, how much will he be making in that month?
Oh that must have made a great trip. I'm sure he was excited to see you!
That's really cool! I've never bought anything that expensive, so I'm glad you had the opportunity!
I feel your pain! Maybe try ordering takeout from home? That usually works well.
I have that same feeling, I'm going to go out and eat by myself tonight and then I can be mad.  I'm going to the Olive Garden and order the chicken parmesi. I haven't had it in ages.
I love PB & Jelly.
That will be soon. I am happy that the week is almost over.
Oh man, you must be a little tired of the off days!
I'm sure it's just a normal part of friendship.
That's nice of your to love your friend so much.  What do they fight about?  Is it a personal issue or a misunderstanding.  I have some friends like that, but mine is a family issue.  Maybe you should just keep a level head on and try to understand where they're coming from.  I think it might be the stress they're feeling under.  I don't know, I hope it's not a serious family issue though.  I have a family
That can help. What diet have you found helpful for Lupus?
I hope it helps you!
i hope it never happens to you and to everyone else in your city
I know right! It was like the whole world was against us. I was so scared. I was not sure how my family was going. But my mom and dad kept me safe and calm.
I bet that made him very proud
That sounds nice.
I love that holiday season.
yea thats my favorite also.
That's so great! What do you guys usually do together?
I have a sister inlaw too. She's a bit of an oddball, but I think I can handle it
That sucks.
That sucks.
I hope you're not too happy, promotions are so stressful
That's awesome.  I wish I could work hard like that.  I hope he enjoys his new job.
That must have been hard for you.
That is very responsible of them. They really care for animals. It's good they made sure pets were not left alone for long periods of time without checking on them. I think people don't always care about the welfare of animals as well.
That's very brave of her.
Yeah that happened to you too.
That's creepy! What did you see? Was there anything in there with you guys
That must've been frightening!
That's nice. What movie did they show?
That is nice!
Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear. I lost my my lab, Luna, and I know how much she meant to you. I'm so sad for you. I know how you're feeling right about now
that must of been so sad to go through that
That is very unkind
I think it would! You should tell him! He should be honest about it and offer to help her. I'm sorry she didn't take it. Maybe you should talk about how you would handle it in the future. I hope she will forgive you. She probably will, but it will take a little time to figure things out.  I would just try to make sure she feels like you are there to help. She probably feels like you are not a good fit for her grand child
I've had Lupus for a few years now and it can be tough.
I hope it works. I've heard it's hard. You have my support.
it sucks when people don't follow instructions, it can cause problems with safety
Yeah! It's like she has no sense of logic or reason.
I have had cats die on my floor. I can't have another cat.
I am sorry.  That is terrible. I hope she is not too long.
I bet you were so excited! What numbers did you choose?
That's good. Did you buy it all out?
that's good to be able to catch up
It was really scary. What did you do?
That's so rude. I would have cut them off and called the police.
That's horrible! Did she end up hurting herself or anyone else?
Yeah, it is hard seeing how we can change our behavior, and help others, but at least we can try. It is good to try.
oh, what happened? Was something wrong with it?
That's pretty gross. Did you call the police?
That is ridiculous!  I would love a mailbox like that.  Did the mail go missing?
That sounds like it could work.
That sounds like a great time! Did you have fun?
Oh, that's too sad!  I hope she was able to have some time with her family.
That is awesome. You must feel very nervous.
That sounds awesome! I love science class!
That's really cool! What did you think of it?
I used to play ice hockey too!
It's always sad when animals run off.  Did the dog come home safe though.
That is a little concerning, I'm sure. I live up here too so I know what you mean. I hope the dog turned out alright though
I'm so sorry. I'm really sad to have heard that. I'm glad that you're not feeling too overwhelmed by it. I know how hard that is to do
That is bad, I hope you can get through that.
That's nice. Do you guys like quiet time together?
What do the noises sound?  Is there anything you think is up?
I am happy for you.  What is that job offer for?
You should be happy about his new job!
That's so cool!  I have never taken a college course.  I think I will.
I'm sure you did. What kind of sweets?
Yeah, but I think you should have eaten them.
Oh that is so annoying
hsits called " pepper spray"?  thats not going in the bag though?
yeep i know that show. its a good show.  why did he die?
I have seen it before, and I can tell you will enjoy it!
That's always the way. Relaxing and happy at home!
that's good, kids need their sleep too
That's crazy! How do you like Arkansas so far though?
Yeah, that's great that he has some job opportunities! I'm sure it's hard for you, but you'll get to see new places too!
That is so exciting! Where are they from originally?
That must be a fun neighborhood.
I had an appointment a few months back.  How was everything?
oh no thats so annoying
Oh that sounds terrible. Did he pass out?
That sounds so sweet. Did he grow?
Oh that sucks. Was it scary?
that's the worst part
That's great! Congratulations on having 3 and now another one!
That is great. I am happy for that.
That does seem like a fun time of year. What costumes did people wear?
I'm more interested in Halloween costumes myself, but it seems people like it.
That is terrible. I am so sorry. That is terrible.
It's good you were safe though
That is not good. Were they okay?
That's nice. I've never been camping with friends before.
I hope she likes you. What's she like?
That sounds great! I bet your daughters loved it too! How old are they?
ye thats so bad. how many saws are there?
I know right? The gore in that one is just awful. I hate watching movies that have that much.
Did you look at them while alone or did you go through them while looking at your friends?
That can be nice to reminisce about old times
I have friends from my old school. I miss those days.
I bet that was hard
That's very kind of you to do that! How'd you get that guy to stop and flag you down?
oh wow thats soildy
Oh, really! Congratulations! That must have felt great!
That's awesome! I wish you all the best for the rest of her life.
I hate to leave home!
that's going to sound like a lot. are you going to Daytona Beach or Daytona USA parkway trail?
That is fun. Where are Daytona and orlando?
That is fun. What type of casino is that?
I love blackjack too, I wish you both the best of luck! I am not a big casino game, but I love the atmosphere.
That's a lot of crap. What do you want him to stop hitting you with.
That's a bit of a problem. Did you tell them no thanks?
Oh, I love vacations. Where was it?
I'm sorry.  You guys have some great vacations.
oh wow! That must have been such an excitement!
I'm happy you did well on that one ticket!
That's very kind of him.  What kind of work?
That's awesome, congratulations on that achievement.  How long have it been since it's been given?
That's awesome! Congratulations to yourself on receiving such an honor
Yeah, that would be so rude.
That must have been frustrating.  Did she apologize for doing that to you?
Oh that must have been a hard time for your family. I bet it was tough to see
That is really nice. What kind was Santa getting?
That is crazy! Did anyone see what you tripped on?
It happens to the best of people.  You just have better timing.  I tripped on a wire once.  I ended up falling into a dumpster!
I wish I was in a relationship where I didn't have to worry so much!
That's great news about you. I wish I had that kind of situation.
That sounds like it. What kind were hurt?
That sounds terrifying! Did anyone help me?
That is sad, but you have to keep going. You'll always have each other.
I am sorry, but it is just life sometimes.
I feel you. It is hard to watch them grow.
I can understand that. But, they are your babies now and you need to get through it so they can move in the right time when they are older.
That's cool! What kind did you take it with?
That's awesome! What was the subject you scored well in on?
That sounds like a lot of work.  I hope you enjoyed yourself.
That is great! What casino did you stay in at Tunique?
That's bad, but you can always try again. It's not the end.
That was a bad idea. You should be honest with your mom. She will forgive you.
I'm sure it was worth it, you're a smart shopper!
i love Florida.
That sounds pretty exciting!  How do they work?
That's a good luck, did you spend the money well or was it saved up?
I know. I miss talking.  I hope we still be friends.  I think I can do better if we stay friends even without seeing.
That's nice. I'm sure you will be able.
That sucks.  I would have loved to have been there for the person.  I hope they are alright!  I hope they learn from their actions!  That is the most frustrating thing about people driving like that.
Oh my, that is terrible. I'm sorry.
Oh wow. That must have been scary. How did he do?
That's good! You can't let friends watch your dogs, I think.
Oh really? That's a good sign. I'm happy for that. What happened?
That sounds like things going good for you then
That is so exciting! Did you open it up and find something amazing inside?
That sounds so beautiful! Who sent it to you? I love getting new and unique things.
Oh that's too bad. Did you yell?
That was not the biggest deal? Why not?
I hope that wasnt your child being admitted to the hospital!
I hope everything turns out well for your daughter!
I haven't seen it yet, but I think I'll have to check it out.  I'm always curious about shows that I've never heard of before.
I have, I've watched it multiple times. It's so cool to see people so talented at making things and bringing them to life like you described it
I agree. I am sad.
What happened to it? Was it a store closing or something?
That's the worst! What happened? Did you forget it by chance or did she tell you about the day she was born?
That happens, I guess.  Maybe you can plan something for the next week?
I love my wife! She's the best
I am the same way. I wouldn't dream about cheating with anyone. I love the people I'm with too much. I am a cheapskate and a liar but only if they catch on.  I would rather hurt someone else and save myself.
Oh man, how did it go?
I can relate to this. Sometimes when my kids have games they are so engrossed that they forget about me.
I know that one is coming up.
I wish him luck.  I hope you have a good time.
I love Christmas too. I always go home for Christmas dinner. What is your family's tradition like?
Yeah, that's what holidays bring. Memories of being so young and care free.
Oh I am so scared. What is the weather looking for in the town where you are in the town?
oh no, that sucks, hope it passes quickly and not last night or tomorrow morning
Oh I love that game!  What game?  What expansion pack?  What's in it?
I'm not a big fan. Is that one of the most popular ones?
oh wow congratulations, that sounds good,
That's great news! Congratulations!
That is a very specific thing.  What type shelves?
It's a little thing, but it's just annoying to me. I wish people were more mindful.
That's terrible. How long have they cheating been going?
That sucks.  I hope you are able to work things out.
I'm glad to hear that. What kind was she potty training?
that's a great day
that's the idea.
That's great! What breed?
That sounds interesting! Do you know what degree you're going for yet?
That is good that you are doing research.
oh man, i feel bad now.
That happened with me a while back. I feel bad. I was thinking about what I could get for him and realized, no I don't need to get him.  I was thinking he had a gift in mind. I just donated. It was a gift card to a coffee shop and I know how much coffee he drinks. I figured it was better than nothing!
I love that movie too. It reminds of my childhood as well.
Oh wow! That was your first time watching? I loved The Lion King movie, I've watched it at the park
I have never been a fan. I find it so boring. I wish people had more interesting things to talk about.
I know what you mean. Sometimes friends move away.
Oh yeah, I know how you feel.  I was feeling the same.  I wish she the best though.  I know how you feel about her.  It is hard to let go.  I hope you can find happiness.  I know it is hard.
I know the struggles. How is going right?
That's terrible. How did it start?
That can be frustrating.  How is that going?
I agree.  It is hard to see.
Oh no! That must have felt lonely! How did you keep yourself entertained?  Did you have friends over to play?
That's a long way away. I live right on my doorstep so I'm used it
That's so gross! Did he see what happened?
oh no thats no good
Oh no. I'm so sorry. My dog passed last month. I know it's hard but I thought about the same.
Yeah that is tough. I lost a pet of my own two years ago.
That can be annoying, I live near the mountains so it's a lot worse there.
I do too! I hate it too.
That is an awesome find!  I love when that kind of luck strikes out of the blue.  Did the person come by and thank you in particular for finding the bill?
That's awesome.  I have never seen a dollar before I was 5. I had never found one either.  I bet you're happy.
That's gross. I would have killed it if it was on my wall
I think it's probably a wolf spider, but they do have a pretty long lifespan so I think it's possible that it ran out before I could get to kill it
That's nerve wringing me! What subject?
that's awesome
Oh, I'm sure it's not too scary.
I am sure you'll do well.
That is a bummer. Did you sell it for something in good price or something?
I bet you had a great weekend anyway!
That sounds nice, I don't really understand faith, I just have trust that things happen. I have a lot of faith in my husband too.
I agree, but I think that's just not possible for a couple of long-term relationships like ours. I mean, I'm happy with him.
That's crazy! Did you guys have any damage?
Oh that sounds scary.  Did you guys have any insurance?
That's terrible. Did you get to where you were going?
That sucks. I once had a similar experience with a airline and they were rude too.  Did they try to offer a refund or anything like?
I love writing, what kind of work do you plan on writing?
I can imagine how that would be a surprise. I am glad for the bond and the learning experience though.
That sounds like a lot of fun!
that's awesome! what kind of fish you catch?
I would feel like yelling
That's a bummer.  I dropped my lunch the other time.  People always staring at me.
That's great that someone showed up to your rescue!
That's great news about being grateful, but you did have to deal with feeling a little embarrassed.
That sounds like fun! What teams will be playing in the Superbowl this year?
That sounds exciting. I'm a huge fan myself!
oh thats no fun. did it happen recently or recently this past weekend
That's a pretty gross thing to have done at the grocery store.
That was nice of him.
That's great news! Congrats!
That's so generous of him. I would do that for him if I was in a situation like that.  Did he get the DJ equipment he was trying to? He should be rewarded with some kind words. I was in a rush the other night I was in London and missed my flight, I ended up walking all the way from Heath to the airport I ended up at a small shop in London. It was  a long way from home, and a lot more trouble walking all the
I'm glad you were okay!
That's a little rude of them. Did they not have enough to worry about?
Oh my goodness, that's terrible.  I hope you feel better.  I hope you got to go to the hospital if you were hurt.
That would be terrible. Are you driving a car that you own?
Oh, okay, well, maybe just save up a little bit longer then.  I hope your transmission works again soon!
That's awful. Did the person return?
I'm sorry, but what happened to your car? Was it broken in any way?
That's so cool. Did you see anything interesting?
That's awesome! I'm happy to have scouts that taught you about camping and trekking too.
That is awesome! I love live concerts! What was your name?
that is awesome that they were able to do it without any equipment!
that sounds like a good skill to learn
Oh, that's awesome! What kind is that traditional style bowling? I have never learned to bowl that. I would have loved that game!
oh wow, that's a bumpy road for you and me to walk on
I hate when that. Did you clean up the mess?
That must be exciting! I bet you are excited to be debt-free. What phase are you starting?
that's good news, you must be happy about that. how old are u?
I'm sure you will do well!
Yeah, it can be tough to deal with failure.  It takes guts to admit it though, so it's hard to thank myself.  But you've got the guts to keep moving!
I bet. What are you going for in school?
That is good!
That must be nice for you, but also very expensive to live. What town is this?
That must be frustrating for you, you wish it was your luck as well
Yeah that sounds kinda funny.
Oh my gosh that's so weird that happened.
I hate being mad, but at least it's for his first car.
that sucks!
That's awesome! How long have you been with it?
It's great to hear that. I have been looking at buying one of my friends cars.
that was a nice trip back
I love listening to throw back music, it always takes me right to where I was in my youth
oh wow. thats so sad.
Well that's awful!  I hope they get some good news by tomorrow!  I hope you and your grandson are okay!  I am sorry for your loss!
That's good news! What apartment are you moving into? I've had that apartment problem myself for a long time.
That sounds wonderful!
oh that would be so unkind of me
that's the worst
Yeah, family reunions are so nice.
It's great that they have a chance to catch up.
That's great! Congrats!
That's awesome, you should be super proud of yourself!
I do the same. I feel like the more exercise you do the healthier your mind will become.
that's good to see you working on your health.  how much weight you lifting?
That's really cool. Did he buy it himself or get it from someone else?
I bet you are a proud sibling
Oh my, did anything good come of that decision?
Oh my, that's awful, but good for you that you took care of yourself and didn't have anyone bothering you while they were being rude and disturbing!
That's terrible, but it's been going on for over a year, so it's not like it's something new that you can't fix.  Maybe you can try talking it over with them and see if they're willing to talk about why they're not talking anymore?
That would be pretty awesome if classical could shut people up
Oh wow! I hope everything turned out okay.
That sounds scary. Did you find out what the noise was?
That's so exciting! What country are they in?
That's cool! I hope you have a blast!
I love that time of year too! What do people do?
You're welcome, I'm sure it's okay.
That's awesome! How long have been you looking to work there?
Yeah, sometimes you need to go back out and try again.
That's so scary! Did you run inside?  Did it attack?
I can imagine! I hope everything turned out alright in the end.
oh wow that is good! what kind sweets do you eat?
I stress too much on my work. I think you should try it. It might work out.
That's pretty cool. Did you buy a new car?
That's awesome. I've been driving for over 20 years.  I don't even know what my mileage is anymore, but my car has 150,000 miles on the odometer.
that's kinda scary. I don't like Craigslist.
That sucks.  What are your phones worth?
Oh man! That sounds like a great move!
That's awesome that your new apartment will be quieter!
Oh wow! That is very unfortunate. Did you ever realize who it was until too late?
Oh that's terrible. Have you contacted your bank or credit union yet?
That's amazing. I'm so thankful too. I feel like I can do a lot more when I'm not living on ramen. I've got my life. I've got my health, I'm not worried. I don't know anyone who is struggling with poverty, homelessness, or addiction.
I agree with you there, people are lucky to take the things for which they should, and to take them for granted, which makes them think they are entitled to them. I think that people should appreciate the things they have and be thankful for. I am glad you appreciate your things, it makes me appreciate them more.
I love making things, it's such a great way to express yourself.  What did the blankets make you think of?
That sounds great. I love making things for friends and babies. It's such thoughtful gifts!
that sounds like a fun trip!
I'm so jealous that you got to be together again after that long separation.
That sounds so important.
I agree with you.  My family has been very good to me.  I am very lucky to have them.  I think everyone needs to remember the value that family and friends bring us in our lives
That's so sweet! How old is your dog?
I do have a dog, I have 2 cats too. I have been thinking of another golden retrieever. Maybe I will. They are so cute.  I have never had a dog.
That's exciting! What school? Are you nervous about your performance?
I know the feeling. You can't wait to go back to school. I am going back to work full time this year.  It's been a few months.
That is a good point.  I think we can all be judgmental to some extent, but not in a bad way, just to be aware of our own actions and to try not hurt others.
It is normal to judge others. Everyone is unique and special. I judge people based on what they have to say and do, not based on how they make people think about them or themselves
Oh wow! That's awesome! What subject are you studying?
That's good news! What part time job? I hope you get to relax a lot.
That's a pretty big milestone.  What kind is he thinking of getting?
That's awesome. I have an older car that I'm pretty proud of.
That sounds exciting! What kind are you looking for?
It's nice to be able save for the things you really really really really need
That's not very nice.
That must have scared you to death!  What did they do?
That's great! What is it for them to celebrate?
I feel you, but I am happy. My youngest is 28 now and is all done. I wish her the best birthday ever though.
That sounds like you had some tough days lately?
That's good. What kind workout are you doing?
That's great! What was it like to go for grocery shopping?
aliens
It's really interesting how you describe things. You sound like a science teacher. What are you studying?
It's really interesting to learn about all of these things, it makes food taste different.
That sounds scary! Was he yelling? I hope he wasn't trying to kid you! I hate when that kind of situation happens!
Oh no! What did you do? Did you get upset with him?
That is awesome! Did you ask him where did you go?
That was gross.  You should get stitches.  You should get stitches right away!
I agree, he was a true original thinker and a very unique individual. I am so sorry he did not get the closure he deserved.
I know that he was a bit of a narcissist, but I still think he was a bit of a pain sometimes. I hope more people can see the importance in taking his pain seriously and work on their own mental health.
That is so sad that there are not more resources to support this country's mental health.
That's sad, what state or city are they in your grandparents' area?
That sounds great! I have never met my grandmother, so it's nice you got that chance!
That is so cool!
You are kidding right.  I am so jealous.  What was your name?
I'm not sure what kind teacher kids have in 1st and they have in 2nd.  What is the difference?
it makes sense, I guess
I thought that was so good of a friend.
That's a good idea. I never really had to think that about myself.
That's so cool.  What did he learn?
That's a pretty impressive achievement!  How old is he?
Oh, that is terrible. How did you cope with all the noise?
Oh my goodness, how did it go away for you for the week you mentioned?  Was it too loud or did they just go to sleep early? I hope you didn't have any issues.
What!?! That sounds creepy! What happened?
That sounds scary. Did they get away?
That's so nice! I'm glad to hear that she's found someone new to love her.
that sounds amazing! What community is she involved with?
That sounds like a great service! What kind of TV shows does Hulu Live offer?
You should check it out! I have been meaning to get it for a long time but I've been waiting for my cable bill to go down first.
That must've been really scary. Did the animal survive or did it die from the accident?
That's terrible. I hope it wasn't someone. I hope the cat is okay.
Oh no! That is horrible. I am sorry to hear that.
I hope everyone is safe and sound.  I hope everyone is okay.  I am so scared of fire and death and destruction.
That sounds like a lot of fun!
That was awesome! I'm so glad they remembered you. I forgot about you too.
That sounds exciting! What are you waiting on?
That's great, where do you live?
I know right, it really is a big deal.
It is really hard to understand that some humans do not understand the animals. I know a dog owner who was very mean to the dog and the dog ended up biting a little puppy that had been left on the owner.
I love Christmas, it's my favorite time. What's your favorite time?
I can relate to that. I still think about my childhood and feel a little nostalgic for it.
I donot have anyone who eats out every week.
I don't spend much but when I do eat out, I like it so much! I think they should just eat at home all the time. That way you'll be saving money and eating healthier.
That's good news! What city or country? I've always liked moving.
that's great news. what are you moving for?  are you moving to the south or north of the big lake. i'm from texas and moved a few years back. i've been enjoying the heat but it does get a lot of rain. it's not as dry though.
Oh wow. Did it come in?
that's good news!  I live in hurricane prone countries too.  I'm so glad your safe.
That sounds like a fun reunion! What did they have to say about you?
That's really nice. It's great that family is important to keep in life
Oh that's terrible! What kind was it?
That sucks, but at least she is small and they should know what to expect
That must be very sad. I hope you were able to be supportive of her.
That must have been so sad.  How did she pass?
That's so cool. I have a big family reunion this year and we're all going on the road in a 1978 van with a full kitchen, fridge, and 2 bathrooms!
I am glad to hear!
I know how you feel
That's terrible. Are you moving to a new place?
that sounds great, I've been married 30 years and still feel like a kid! I'm glad to be with someone like that. What made it easy?
That's awesome. I'm 25 years old and married for about 20 years and have been divorced twice already. I don't have any children. I just moved back home to my parents and I feel very comfortable. I have never been divorced before either.
That's cool! Which station? I'm sure they were playing your local music.
that's awesome! I don't listen music either but I have heard of all of them.
Oh, did you pass it?
Yeah, the wait is killing you too right now, but at the end of the day, you studied and did your best you could.
It is good you are a fan. I like golf, especially Scottish golf.
I bet he was thrilled to win!  I would be.
I love watching sports too!
I do that every time I teach a group.
that's great that you are interested in teaching people how to do that.
That is so annoying!
I like routine too.
I have done this before and have had the owners beat me out of luck.
That's terrible, but I would hope you could find something else. I hope you found another place that fit the bill
I'm sorry. That's really tough. Did you find out what happened to him?
Oh, that must have hurt.  I am so sorry.  I am sure it was a hard day for you.  I have never heard of cancer in horses.  I am glad the vet told it to your doctor.  I hope they do the best they can for him.
I bet, that's why I would leave early.
Oh no! What are you worried about? Is it the house catching a bug or something else?
That's a big accomplishment. Congratulations! What was it in?
That's awesome! What did you do after finishing your doctorate?  Are you happy with your career?
I hope everything works out well for you both!
That's cool! I hope you have fun with her! I'm a language learner myself.
That's awesome!  How are they?  Did everything go smoothly?  Did they miss you?
That's so true, I've been away for 2 months myself and I'm doing some cleaning myself before I come back home
It happens to the best of people, but it does not make it any worse. You should just go to a hairdresser to fix it up.
That's terrible, did it work for you?
That is terrible. Did you get your food back?
Yeah, I've been to that one restaurant before and had the same issues. It's a bit of the same old thing.
oh no! That's terrible!
oh, i hate grocery shopping.  it's like they always seem to have stuff out.  what happened to you?
I hope you have plenty of time together then. I love you!
That's terrible. Did you guys plan ahead of time? Did she have a plan for when she comes back?
Oh that's terrible! Have you moved to the city where you live or just a new town?
That's funny! You must have felt lonely at first. Did it get easier as you settled in and made friends with people?
I'm so glad you were able to stay with your friend, and that's all you can really ask, I know mine had to leave for a short time.
I live in San Francisco, I've always loved the city.
I've done the California coast highway from San Yesternberg to the coast of the Oregon. It's a long way.
That sounds like fun! Did it rain a few times along?
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I hope she recovers.
I know right? It is the only time of year where you have a lot to do, like plan your day and night in
I am the opposite. I hate school. It's boring, long, and hard work. I'd love to stay home.
That must have made you nervous about it?
That must be nerve wracking for you too
That's the worst. What kind?
I hate losing more than I hate winning.  How do you stay positive?
It's been a good week for me.
That's a great way to look forward to Christmas time. I love to look forward for it too!
That is terrible.  I hope they were okay.  I love animals.
Oh, I know, I would have lost them all. I hope they get them!
That's terrible! What a dog! Did you get him?
That's a long wait. Did you ask the vet if you could bring your dog home?
oh thats really tough.
I'm glad it is over for you.  How are things now?
That sounds very tough.  What school was your kids in?
Oh wow! That's quite generous of your family.
I feel you! I miss my family so much.
I do not get to visit either.
Oh yeah. I don't know why people can't handle a little spider.
Yeah, they're creepy. I hate when you see pictures of them.
That's sweet. What did you do?
that is cool. What happened?
That's a little brother for you!  Did he throw food on your mother as well?
That's kind of him. He likes to throw stuff on the floor. He's a little troublemaker
That was so mean. Did she hit your car?
That is crazy.  I would have stopped and talked to her.  She would probably apologize.  I hope she is okay.
That sounds gross. What did you do?
Oh wow that's pretty disgusting. Did you tell anyone about it?
That's a bummer.
That stinks of betrayal.
What happened? Did something surprise you?
I feel surprised my boyfriend give you a birthday gift surprisingly.  How sweet. Did he know you needed one?
It's sad when we lose our pets.  I have a dog and she is so sweet.
That's really sad. I'm sorry. I hope they had a nice rest. Did he have any good days? Did he have any good walks? I used to have a dog too. He was really sweet and gentle too.
That is true!  I have a few.  But they are so nice and calm.
I actually prefer them too. I have a dog named Luna and she's really good at taking care of her own things.
I know right! I'm always a bit hesitant about cooking for myself.
I bet that was gross. Did you guys end it there?
That must have made it a really good day. Did he do it by himself?
That's nice! I bet he's proud!
Oh nice! Congratulations!
oh wow, congrula on that
I used to playdates my kid and now play with my wife's kid. It gets better. I playdate my friend kids and then playdate my wife's.
That is so kind of your friends.
oh that was cool
That was a scary ride though.  How did you feel when it finally stopped?  Did you feel like you were safe?
Yeah, it's normal to have some self doubt when trying something for the first time, especially if you're not as strong as you think you should be
that's cool. did you feel okay afterwards?
oh yes, i was in one last week
Yeah I have. I was in high school and we were on the way to the prom.  I'm not sure what happened, but the car was hit by a van. It was a huge crash. We all were pretty lucky. I was fine, but I heard the engine was blown out of the van and the car was completely wrecked.
Oh. Sorry to hear that. What did she cry over?  Is she okay?
Oh my. How are she and your family doing now? Are you guys able to talk to her about what's going on?
That's horrible. I would call the police. They should have your number and send the police to your bank to shut off their activity.
That's awful! You should call them up and express your feelings.  They probably won you nothing but a nice apology phone call.  I hope they understand that.  How about you just get back on track? You've been here for 10 years, you can get back on track!
I have heard of it happening before. It's really sad.
I'm so sorry to hear. I hope he is at peace.
That is the most exciting thing I've ever heard.
That's a good dog though. I bet it keeps his bladder from going to the bathroom in the middle of the night.
that sounds good
That's terrible! Did you have chocolate?  I have been known for being the chocolate thief. I love chocolate. What kind did you store it with to keep it solid?
That would've been nice of him. Did you tell them about the mailbox?
That sounds like such bad manners. What were they going for it for?
its normal. you can talk to your employer and ask if you can work from home.
That's a lot to deal, what are your options?
That's so cool! What kind is it?
That's nice. I've made scrapbook for my kids. I'm hoping they like them.
I am so upset. What a horrible time.
That's awesome! I hope you have many happy memories.
That sounds great. What did happen?
Oh no. That can make me so grumpy
I'm sorry to hear! That's frustrating when plans fall apart like this
I bet he was! What kind rockstar was?
Oh that is cool! I can see him being the rockstar of rock!
I can imagine, what kind was that?  Were you doing it yourself or was it for hire?
That sounds pretty gross. I hate to think someone had to deal that.
I can understand. It can make me feel like I am a dirty person too!
I can understand it is hard to keep clean.
That's cool! How do you feel now?
I've been wanting to cut it myself. What kind is it?
That's a bumpy day. Did you fix the hole?
That's awful! Did anyone laugh or tease you about it?
It was really fun to buy it, I'm a little bummed that it wasn't what I got. I would have been the envy of my friends.  I got the Lego Star Wars Death Star Death Star.  That's what it said on it.  It said "Lego Death Stars".  I think that was a joke, so I just got the Lego Star War Death Stars.  It says it on the packaging.  It said "Lego Star Wars Death Stars
You are so right.
It can't get any bigger than this exam! I bet you studied hard for that!
I bet you did! You must be so proud!
You mean like when you have a problem?
I feel you, I used to talk to my friends family, but I am going to talk to my parents
It sounds like you are doing well with her.
That's really good of you.  What kind are the requirements for the job?  I used to work a 50 hour work. week.
Oh wow! That's really cool. Are you going anywhere exciting for Christmas this time around?
That's awesome! What kind things are on your shopping list this time of the year
That is crazy.  What kind machine did it play out to?
Oh, that is hilarious. I would be laughing at that if I were in that position. I would also be very upset that I had not won any money.
I'm sure it was quite scary.
Yeah, that was my worst fear
That is exciting! Where are they meeting at?
Oh man, that's scary. What are the chances?
I bet that's exciting! What kind of proposal is it?
Oh man, you're nervous about that, huh.
It's so sad when we can no longer care for our pets.
That sounds like my cat, too...she wakes me every morning too. I think I'm going crazy.
That's great. What are you studying?
Yeah, that's great news! You're on a roll now, good luck!
That can be so frustrating, but at least you have something to do!
Oh no! That sounds horrible! I've always loved the old days and I can imagine you would be upset. I've had those kinds of hoolies happen in my workplace, and sometimes in my home too. It's hard to see. But at the end of the day we have to deal it.
That is nice. I like going to a hotel room sometimes, just alone, to get some time for myself.
I know the feeling!  How did that make you?
That can happen.
That can be tough. Did you think about what to tell your girl friend first, or just go talk to the girl friend first?
I haven't watched that movie for years, do you like the movie?
That's not a bad idea! What's it about again?
That's terrible! Did you have any idea what happened?
That is crazy! What did happen next?
Oh, really! What kind change was it?
that sucks.  Did you tell them that?
I am shocked! What was he going to use it for?
That's horrible, how did he take items?
That sounds good. What habits are you working with?
Yeah, that was a good one. What habit have you changed?  I changed my eating habits.
oh no what kind are you on?
Yeah, it
That sounds like fun.  What kind of things do you do when you're at the park?
Oh man that is awesome. Did you guys go to the festival to get some food?
oh, I understand.
I'm shy too, and sometimes I just wish I could avoid having to confront people about it. I try not to, but it's hard sometimes.
That's a pretty harsh way to look at people.
Yeah, they should be more responsible with the tellers and not letting the teller do that stuff!
Oh that's a good memory! Did you and she play games?  I've seen those before.
That's cool! What kind of games do they have at that place now?
That is awful! Do you have insurance that covers dental care for you if so?  I hope it clears things!
I hope it's not something serious.
that's a long shot
I can understand that. I would be too.
That's awful! Was she okay?
That sucks.  I hope she recovers well.
oh wow, how old was she? I love cats
That must have been so frightening!
That's great! What weight were we lifting for the exercise of the week challenge?
That's great you had fun, it's good to test your limits sometimes
That sounds stressful! What are some things to think about that are bothering you?
Yeah, what am I doing?
That's awesome. What kind of money?
I love scratch lotteries
That's cool. What play was that?
That's cool. I haven't seen that before.
That's so cute! I'm a dog myself. How did you meet?  Do you play with her?  Do you feed her?
That sounds like a fun time. What breed?
That's really cool! What kind concert are you referring to.
That's awesome! I hope they played some of their old stuff!
oh no. how is he going?
that sounds interesting
Oh, wow. What happened? Did she notice it?
It was probably a goose.
Oh no!  I've never seen a roach crawl out of the dishwasher before, that's quite an unusual thing to do.  What did it look and sound like?
I hope you crushed that roach!
That would freak you out! Did something happen?
That is terrifying! What was happening?
Oh, what happened? Did you feel nervous?
That's tough. What happened? Wasn't it for the reason you thought?
That's gross. What happened? Was it your air conditioning?
That is disgusting. I bet you were upset. Did you report it to the authorities?
that's terrible. Did you get hurt?
That is unfortunate, I've had that happen to me before. I hope the driver gets the help of insurance and a tow. Hopefully no damage to your vehicle. Hopefully no damage to the vehicle of the other. I hate when this happens to other drivers.
I love your enthusiasm for speechwriting. What's it for you to write a speech for?
That was pretty intense. What are you working on with your speech about?  Is it for a job, or something else?  I am curious about it.
That would be so unfair of them.  How did you find the experience of itting them out at the store
That's nice of the store to do so! I hope you get there soon!
That's awesome! You must have studied hard!
Yeah, sometimes we don't even remember the steps.
That must have brought a tear in your eye!
That always brings up memories.
That's pretty cool. What did you see?
that's awesome! what stadium was it?
That's terrible. What happened?
That is disgusting. I hope they found something good. I hate cleaning. It is always dirt and grunge. I am glad you were there to see it.
Oh no! Did he hurt himself?
That sucks.  I hope it was just a minor accident.  I hate when people don't take care to their responsibility to their vehicle.  I hope your premiums are going to go up.  I don't like to have to pay more for insurance just in case of a minor accident.
I love driving! What car do you buy? I have one that I just purchased.
oh, nice car
I study for exams too, but I haven't studied in so long that I had forgotten a few important concepts.
That must have felt great!
That's awesome! Congrats!
oh man i have been stuck studying all night for finals too many years in school and have a lot of stress and anxiety about passing
oh no! What happened next? Did they find your wallet?
I'm sorry that you had to go to the movies to get your money back. I hope you were able to do that without issue though. I'm sorry too that my words caused you to feel that you were in trouble.
They should just leave and never come back.
I totally understand why.  It makes you think that there's still some goodness out there in the world, you know what? There probably are people like that!  I just hope that people keep showing up.
I am so proud for all of you. How did she do? What happened?
That must have made her very confident.  I've never danced before but I've been taking a class and it sounds like fun.
Oh yeah, that's the thing I always get to work.
It can be hard to find time off, especially when you have a family.  Do you ever consider asking your employer if you could work remotely?
That sounds great. What clubs are you in?  Is this college your third time here.  How long will college last?
That's great! What two clubs are they?
That's the worst. I've never had to haul it.
That's terrible. Is it going anywhere?
oh no, i hate when food is a conversation starter. did you find the experience okay though?
That does sound disgusting. I can't believe they would serve something with bugs.
That sounds scary. Is it a medical test?
I am so sorry to hear!  That sounds terrifying.  I hope she makes a full recovery.  I've been battling lymphed bone myself for a few years now and am still in remission thanks to treatment and support from my wife and daughter and their son-in law and their two kids.  It really helps.
That's bad. Did something happen to him?  I hope everything worked itself out.
Yeah, that's awful.
That sucks, I hope someone takes you up on your concerns. Have you been talking about this to anyone else in the house?
That's a heavy statement. Are there other family members that help out?
That is a fun way to pass time. I love playing old school games like Super Mario 2.  I used it on the Super Famicom and it is still my favorite game.
Yeah, I love them. There's nothing like playing a Mario Kart game for the N64.  I used the game on the original Nintendo console.
Yeah, it's a great sign for our future!
That sounds great! What kind of brews are you hoping for?  Is it a craft beer newbie, or a brew expert looking to try some of the more exotic stuff?
I can understand why. Is it a problem with them or her?
that sucks! i bet you'd kill him
It's really hard to work in the industry when so much is taken. It's hard when everyone seems to be getting older and less passionate. I hope people continue reading his books though. It is good for the soul!
I was sad when I heard the news, but I think it brought attention to the work people like Anthony Bourhill work. He was a very talented chef and had a passion to help people.
That's really cool! I'm sure it was a surprise you didn't know about! What did you think when you got the news that your friends had planned?
That was cool! I'm glad they thought of it for me, but also a little sad because they didn't let me know beforehand.
It sounds like you are taking care of a new pet!
I love helping out the wildlife.
That's really long time apart, hope you're excited
I hope you have fun in Germany!
That's so rude! Did you tell your wife?
That's nice. I hope he's happy about it.
That's terrible. Did you get paid for overtime hours worked?
oh that is a terrible boss, what did he do?
That would be gross. What did you do?
That must've been a bit of a stressful situation for you
That sounds exciting! I'm glad you guys got good offers!
That sounds great! What kind of job offers did you hear about his potential employers giving out of all the people?
That sounds great! What made today great for you?  Did you do anything exciting or fun?
That sounds delicious and delicious. I hope you enjoy it.
It's okay.  It happens.  It was my first time applying.  It takes a little longer.  It's not like I'm applying to anything
That can be stressful, but it sounds like it worked in the end.
That's really a nice thing to do.
That sounds amazing!
I can imagine that would hurt a lot!
That's so cool! I wish my wife did that.
I hope so too.  I hope she had fun.  I'm a single parent now so I'm happy when I have the time to myself
That's terrible. What job was it? Maybe you should get it back! I mean, it's just one interview. You're not going to let that job slip away, are you?
That's really frustrating. It makes you want to scream!  What job were you looking for?
It is nice to be alone sometimes.  How long was the trip?
That's terrible.  How are the dogs doing?
That's good, you did good! What job was it?
Oh wow! That is cool! How long will it last for you to work?
That sucks. I got the old iPhone once too and now everyone in school is one step older than me.  It's like I am 5. I wish my dad got me one.
Oh wow, that sounds frustrating.  I hope you're happy.
That's tough, do you guys live in different countries or cities far from each other?
That's terrible, what is she doing?
That's no fun. What kind of wasp?
Oh that was bad! Did you get it out of the house?
i have never been a fan of them
It's like mosquitoes but they're even worse in some ways.
Oh, what was that monster spider like? Was it a giant tarantula?
I was so terrified that I was going to scream all day long
That's a pretty crazy thing to be nervous about!
That's awesome. What is sky diving?
I know that's awful. Did you get it back?
That's disgusting.  What kind bugs did you see?  I usually don't notice any bugs in my yard, except sometimes I will see a few of them flying in through the window.  Do you think you should have put the bug spray out?
its good you have someone to talk about your problems.
I hate when doctors are wrong and then correct you.
That sounds like a lot to handle! How did you feel when you were packing? Was it stressful? Did she do it too fast for your comfort?
That's great! What are they doing while you are away?  Are they in school or working?
ye i got a bad cell phone, and sometimes it's so loud i can hear the wind blowing through it, and sometimes the wind blows right through it, making the sound of the cell phone sound super loud and annoying!
Oh my goodness. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that was what was going to happen on Youtube.
I'm so sorry. That's really tough.
That sucks. I'm so sorry. I know she was dying soon so I know it. My dog passed too a little over a year ago.
That's sad. What did she do there?
That's so cool. What did they do there?
That's exciting! What neighborhood are you moving into in the new city in the new city?
That's annoying. What are your plans now that you move?  Where will you go?
I love it.  What is she up for when you get her back?
Yeah, it is nice to see your family when they come back.
That does make sense. I am applying for a job right now.
That's disgusting. I don't think I could even apply right now after seeing it. Did you try to wash your hands?
Oh yeah? Do tell. I love watching those professional sports games on ESPN.
That's great! What position?
Oh wow, what did you end up doing?
That sucks.  I hope things get better for you and your wife.
I love India! What kind of trip is it?  Are you traveling for a vacation or working and traveling at work?  Is there a lot to see?
I love India. What are you planning to do there?
that's so true, having neighbors can make you so grumpy sometimes!
I bet! That must've been fun! Did anything crazy happen to the neighbors?
I know the pain of a week off work.
that blessed time! how did you find them?
Did you have to change your pants?
Oh wow, that must've been embarrassing!
I know right?  It's always a bit of an underwhelming experience.  But at the same, it is nice that it's less crowded.
That's weird. I've never been empty at that time of day.
It has. What a wonderful reunion! Did you guys live together for long time or did you just see eachother for a minute or two?
I'm glad you can't wait to see him too!
That's awesome! What's he going into kindergarten for the year.
I feel you.  I have two kids and they go to daycare every day.  They are always talking about their friends and what they're doing.  I wish they could go to kindergarten!
that sounds like fun.  how did everything work out?
that's awesome! Congrats on the marriage! What made you decide on a small wedding?
It's not like he's a pet owner, he probably has no yard to keep it away.
I know, I hate having my neighbors dog poop all on their lawn and mine on their yard and mine is in mine.
that's good. what's he do now?
That's wonderful. I hope you guys enjoy it together.
Oh, that is quite a mess!
I am so sorry about that!
That sounds interesting. What did it serve?
that is awful to have to experience.
I used to work in a church. I was always being asked what day of the week was.
I agree with you on this one, but I think it's okay if they had a disagreement over something small like religion or politics.
That's so sweet!  How did he do that?  Was it hard labor or did he have any help?
That is so awesome of him. I bet you two can work on anything.
I'm sorry. That's a terrible loss. How old was it?
it sucks, but it makes you realize how short life really is
That's too bad!  Did you get to hang out?
That sucks. I hope he finds the job he wants soon.
That's a sad story. I am sorry for that.
That's really sad. Did you get to know her before she passed away?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you find her?
That sucks. Did anyone find out what happened to them?
yea, but i bet you miss it
You should really just stop playing altogether if your hip is injured.
That is! It's like a rush of adrenaline.
That's pretty scary. But it sounds like a fun experience.
oh man, that's awesome! how did it work out?
that is awesome! what brand is it?
Oh no! That's so gross
Oh my goodness. I would have screamed even if it was my kid.
That must be nerve racking.
I feel you brotha
oh wow thats nice
I hope they all are doing well too!
That must have felt so good to talk to her! I hope you guys stay close.
Oh wow. How cute is that! How do puppies behave at home?
That's so cool! I have a new pup coming home tomorrow!
I know how that feels.
I understand how frustrating that can be.
That is terrible!  What happened after that?
That was pretty greedy. Did they taste okay?  I love them. I could never resist them!
That sucks. Does he have any other symptoms?
Oh wow I've heard of it before, but I've never had a child with it before. I hope it doesn't last long either.
That is cool. I bet you guys were a lot fun to watch. I bet you were a lot fun to watch
I'm sorry to be the one telling you this, but you're an adult now. If you want to go dance again you should go to the club that has a dance team or find someone to dance with you
That is awesome! What is Ryder?  Is Ryder Ryder Cup a nickname?
The Ryder cup is going on this weekend in Spain.
Yeah, that's why you want kids who can keep secrets
I love my family. I bet they love theirs too
That's weird! Did you call the local coroner?
That must have been very disturbing.  I would never find it out!
I know what you mean.  It's like people think that they can do anything they want with animals and that they are above the laws that protect animals from cruelty and neglect.
that's horrible
oh no! What did it sound like? Was anything broken outside of that noise
It's scary! I hope it won't happen again.
That's so kind.  What kind was it?
that makes sense, thanks
Oh that is so creepy!
oh wow that's really cool
It does look so spooky.
I agree, it's like a ghost flying around the neighborhood.  I think I would be too freaked if I had one of my own.
That can get annoying sometimes.
Oh no! That's a lot. Did she just not realize?
Oh no! That must be so hard! What kind was it?
That's terrible. Did the vet find anything wrong?
I am sure it wasn't a problem.
That's scary. I've heard the xray is like a test for kids.
That's disgusting.  Did you call the police?
I hope the truck is not a commercial one, if it was, that would explain a lot!
That sounds like you were prepared for the weather!
That must have been stressful. I'm glad that you had it.
I hope you get through your work quickly. What are the requirements for your major?
That's awesome! You're doing so well!
Oh, I am sorry. Was it scary?
That was pretty intimidating. I don't think I'll ride it this year either. It's always so scary!
It is snowboarding in the mountains, right
oh well, well that's your problem then.  You should have thought of something.  It's not every day that your friends go to a different location for the day.  You are lucky that they are in a place where they have stuff for the whole weekend to make up for it, so don't be too hard on them.  Maybe just do some work from home?
Yeah, I've had to take my dog to the vet, and he was just so happy to see me, but then I had to give him away and take my dog home with me...
Yeah, that's why I'm so attached to my little dogies Luna. I know how much they can bring you joy.
Oh wow! What is it like on cruise?
The cruise was worth it. I hope it's worth it for you!
That's terrible. Did she go?
That must have made us worried a lot. I hope it turned out well.
That is terrible. I am so cold.
That is terrible. I hope the weather clears soon. I'm always cold!
That movie was so scary! I hate going to haunted house. I always run away.
Oh my god that is scary
That sounds like you're trying to get the best price.
I know right. It's so expensive, but I don't know if I'm going to save any money by not buying it now.  I think I'll wait until I have more money saved before I start.
That's okay. You had one cake by yourself?
I would never eat a whole cake by myself, I'd invite myself.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you were alright. What happened to you?
It can be stressful, I'm sorry you had one.  I've had a panic attack or two.
that is terrible!  what happened?!
That's terrible.  Did you find out where he is?
It can be very frustrating when someone ghostes, I'm sorry you felt like that happened
That sucks. I'm glad you are okay though.
I know right. It was a small coffee but it really made me think about the people who do pay for things like my mom.
I know, I was in the middle of a fight last week and a nice lady stopped me and offered to help.
That's cool. What's college?
That's good! I'm glad to hear. How many years are he away from home for?
I know how that goes
I bet.  What restaurant is that?
oh that's a funny story. What happened?
oh that's funny, did you clean it off?
Oh yeah? What was scary about?
Yeah, that's why we need to be careful with that.
That's a problem. Maybe ask them if you can have them to keep watch?
Yeah, it gets annoying every day too. They should be quieter.
oh that is a lot of calories
That's not bad. Did you eat a lot?
That's awesome! Congratulations! How long have you been working? What kind was it?  Did you buy a house or a car?
That's great news! You should have saved up for a long time before now!
That's exciting! How long are you teaching? What subjects do the kids typically study in school?
That's awesome!  How do you know this job is right for them though?
That's terrible. I'm sorry. Did your dog get adopted out of a local shelter?
That sucks. I hope you can forgive him in time. It will take time.
That's frustrating, how long have you been getting it?
It can be frustrating, I wish companies would just do autopay for you!
Oh that's nice. How long until she takes her on the job interview list?
That's awesome! I wish I could get a promotion at my current school!
Wow, I bet that was exciting.
That's awesome. It's good that she was open to feedback and willing to share it with others. I'm glad for you.
That must have be scary for you too.
I can understand. It must be scary to not be with your kids. I hope everything works out well for your son.
I totally understand what you mean. I'm glad you're okay with it. I just wish I could have been there with you. I hope you do well for him though.
That's so true. It is hard, though to let someone go that fast.
that sucks, what year was it?
I love Nintendo 64 games, I have all the games. I bet it was so exciting to play. What did you play first with it
That is terrible! What is it?
I'm sorry.  That's tough.  What major is this?
I love dinner. What kind of dinner? Did he make something new or use a recipe you had given?
Oh, nice. I bet she loves that. I love that my partner plays video games with her when the kids go to school.
I have never thought about that. I will definitely have coffee for sure!
Oh my god, that is horrible. I love my coffee filters, I have them right on the fridge at home too, but no coffee without them.
What happened?
It sounds so cute!
I am sure it was hard to let go of the job, but you made some good money. Did the job change or anything?  I hope you found something new
That is good to not have to work, but what about a job that you like? What do you want?
Oh wow, that must have made a great impression.
That's awesome! What do you love most in life?
That's disgusting. Did you take care yourself while being so sick?
I am sorry to hear about that, but maybe you should try drinking some ginger to get rid of the stuff you are throwing up!
That's the worst. Did you guys fight about it?
I'm sorry she ate it.
ks, good luck
I am sure everything works out okay.
I understand how worried you must feel.  You should try having the baby.  You might be a good parent.  It's hard to be worried all the time, but if you're worried enough to go see your therapist about it, then you might be ready to take the next steps.  It's a big responsibility but also really the best time to start learning.  I'm glad you're going to try to do this baby thing right by you're doing.  Maybe you
That's really funny. Did you stop walking to admire it?
That's so funny! Did you hit the cat hard?
Oh, well I hope for you you do well!
Yeah, that sounds tough.
I feel you man! I would be so upset.
I understand how hard it is to be in a relationship and how hard moving out of it is. It's hard to move on, but it's even harder to let past feelings get stuck. I hope it's not you, and you've moved on and are happier.
It would be so much safer
What call did they respond to?
I'm sure.  You should get out of the way.
I agree.  I would have yelled at him.
Oh that's a scary thing. Did you get hurt?
I hope it's gone for now
I love drawing too. I'm not sure why but I just love it.
I have never met anyone who is more talented. I have a sister and brother too and we all love them but we have to learn from each other sometimes. I have no idea about drawing. Maybe I should.
that is really nice
I'm glad to know you have someone like that.
It is bad news. I am so sorry. I am thinking of some things you can do to cope with it. I am sure you are going to be okay though.
I'm so sorry. What are the chances, exactly, of you beating it?
Oh that sounds scary! Did you go out to check it?
I am sorry.
Oh, that's terrible! Did he make it through the surgery okay?
that's good to hear!  Is it going well?
That's a terrible diagnosis.  What are your options?
I don't know. I'm a 50-year-old guy, so the risk is there, but it's just...it's a long way to go before you're positive.
that sounds like so many fun times. What was some game you are thinking of playing now?
Oh, yes! I played those games all night long.
I had too! What happened?
That's unfortunate, but you can improve with practice.
That's cool. What kind is it?
Yeah, that's why you need to work really well in your career and be prepared to do what you have to to get ahead.
That's a bit disappointing, I wish you could go with them!
oh, i see. that was nice of them to do that for you. are you a fan of movies or not really a big deal for you?
I would have asked you for the last one! Did it taste bad to him?
That's a bit gross, but at least he didn't steal my phone.
That was really a bad move. I don't understand why they would ban him. He was right on the issue of vaccines.
That is so wrong, I agree with Alex on this. He is right on the issue
Oh that must have been so embarrassing! How old were you when you did this for real life?
That's funny! Did you find anyone to tell you?
That sucks. How long have you two been together for.
That sucks. What do you do? You might want to consider a divorce. It's not worth staying if you know you're going through with something.  Or maybe you should try to figure out what's going on and see if you can't work on that relationship.
I bet. What country did they end up in?
ali gosh that was so nice to see you helped your uncle out of trouble
That's great! He's a smart one too, I bet he's going to get good things.
That's great! I hope it continues! I hope he will keep up his good work.
oh thats so cool, did you train your dog?
I love it when you tell a story like this and you can't stop. I'm listening. What's happening next in this story?
Yeah, that was the first competition I ever won. I was a little nervous but I'm a confident competitor.
That is cool. I hope you continue to win championships
I love my girlfriends! They are the only people who can make my day brighter.
I bet you felt terrible while being in pain.
Oh, I bet that was fun.
I love going to nudist colonies! They really do a lot for society.
That's not good! Did you punish her?
oh wow thats a bummer!
that is cool, what did he do to do that?
What is that? Is he going to use it to make ice or what? I'm curious now
that's awful.
That's terrible. What can be done to prevent this kind of situation?
I'm sorry about that.  That sounds really sad.  I hope your roommates is okay.
That's terrible!  I hope the house gets back to normal soon.
its hard when we have something going well
I'm sorry.  I've been there, it's hard.  I hope you can find someone that you can live happily with.
That is a really nice treat to look forward to.  What kind of pie is it, I am a pie lover
That is a very good pie. What was your name?
That is so cool! What brand is that yeezy's for haircuts?
That's true, but you have got to try and keep a positive attitude.
I'm so jealous. I love camping.
That's awesome! What kind campsite is that?
Oh, I bet. Did you have any flashlight?
Oh wow! That's terrifying
Oh yea? What's the concern?
That is true. They are known to have some strict laws and customs. I don't know if I would feel very comfortable traveling to Dubai if I didn't know the country.
It is a crime, right?
I'm so paranoid. I would have gone and looked all over for it. I'm going back to pick up my phone.
I feel you, I'm feeling the same way. How much money are we talking here?  I hope you find the right way to deal.  I'm feeling bad that I'm not a better money person.  How much is it?
That's a bummer.
Oh no! That's awful! What happened? Why you feel alone?
I love xbox games, what type of game did you play?
I'm so sorry to hear this. What health problems are they?
I hope everything stays well.
I love that kinda thinking!
I can't believe that. You bought it at a school auction? That seems so silly
That's normal, do you think you are a better fit?
That is exciting! How old you? What field you applying for? What kind of work is it in your field of choice of interest?
That is so exciting!
That does make my dust bunnys look funny, lol.
That must have been a tough adjustment for her parents.
That's really cool. What kind was it?
ye, are u going alone or with someone?
That's horrible. I hate living next door to a noisy family with kids.
That must've been a real challenge. I've heard it was fun though
that's great! I wish i could travel full time. where did yall live?
I do. It's hard to believe that life goes by so fast.
I do. Sometimes I wish I could go back to high school or be a kid again. I don't know. It's good to know others too, though. It's good that you don't wish for everyone else to have those things.
I bet you did.  How often do people look back on their youth?
That's the thing. Some memories are good, but others are just painful.
That sounds like he was very kind of himself.
Wow, that's nice of someone. What complex do you live in?
I'm sorry to be rude, I know you miss her, but you have to take care and not to fall in love with her. I'm sorry!
I used to play nintendos too
I can understand that.
Yeah, I'm more into sci-fi, and romance.  I like to think I'm a good person, so I'm always looking for something to make the world a little bit a a better place.  I love your book choice too!
Did he move away?
Yeah that was a rough one, how could something like that go down?
That sounds like the north of scottish isles
Oh man, I've heard that phrase from friends. It's so cliched, though.
I love dogs. How big is he? I have a little Chihuahuas named Rocky and Bella
That's so sweet! What's he lookin like?
That sounds like a fun surprise. What happened? Did they take you to the beach?
That's so funny!  I'm glad you got to experience it.  How did you feel blindfold?  Did they not hurt?
I know how you do, it is sad to see people in need.
oh man thats a lot. I dont even see people like them every day. What charity do you go there?
I've never won that. What kind was the prize?
It's great that you're taking the time to enjoy the thrill.
That sounds pretty cool! What game was it in?
That was pretty weird. What kind was that?
That was a funny idea!
That must be soooo frustrating. Did you have to wash the shoes out of her hair?
Oh, that's cute! Did you chase the cat away?
That's great! What was it? Was it an important award?
That sucks. Did you enter again next time?  I've entered 6 times now and only one has won. I hope next time it's your year to win!
That's so expensive! What kind is it
That is so great to have such a wide variety to try different saucys!  What did they have?  Was it a sausage or not sausage?  What type?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is she in good?
That can be tough.  I hope she is okay.
That's exciting! Where are you staying?
That must have been tough.  What are you doing when you go back?
That's very nice of them! How old were they when they finished college?
That's so cool, I love seeing people go through that process
That's always fun, what are you doing camping?  Do you like the woods?
Oh wow, how clumsy of him to be. I would have been quite mad if I had my dog do that to.
oh my, thats nasty
yea she made us have a great time on the trip
that sounds like they are very responsible and resourceful
Oh really? What kind game is it for?
That is a fun tournament.
That is such an exhilaring feeling, right when taking that first step!
That sounds like a fun time!  Did they all do well?
That sounds like you did well! What kind physical therapy treatment were you doing?
That sounds like a challenge you took head-on and you did great!
oh man, that is a boulder road, isn't it?
That's really frustrating, did you contact the government?
That's really exciting! What are the items you are bidding on?
That sounds awesome! Are you a collector of rare comics?
That is really cool. What did you do about it?
That must have been really frightening
It's true, I mean I can't believe I used to play with a brick phone and it's now a smartphone! It's a whole different animal!
That sounds like my 2003 phone, lol.
That was quite an appetite you have there! Did you have to go to the bathroom?
Oh wow. I can understand why you would want the whole cake then.
That is very kind of of yours.
That sounds like you're a good family member.
its a horror film, its not scary at all
That's a scary movie! Did it really scare you?
That sounds like you are in a great city.
Yeah thats cool. I wish I had that. I live in the middle of a small area.
Oh yeah, that can be gross too.
I hate when I get food poisoning. It makes my stomach turn.
That's a common problem, but it's not fun to deal with it
It can be annoying! Maybe you can tell them to put the clothes in the bin?
I agree.  It's frustrating and makes you mad.
That's no ones problem. People are just following their own path and dont care. Its the same in traffic.
That must have been so scary! Did it bite?
That's a terrible feeling.  I've had to clean up a raccoons trash can a lot of times, but this rabbit was a whole different ball game.  I was really scared that I was going to have another animal come out and get into the yard.  But thanks to my quick action, there was no animal in my yard.  That's a good feeling.  But sometimes you have no choice and have to clean up a dead animal, which can be a whole
That is so frustrating. What restaurant is it at this point?
That's a good idea to read some reviews! What's it? A restaurant or something?
oh man that's so awesome, what kind of Indian food is she making?
That sounds like you have a good thing going on!
It is great to hear that you are working on your jump shot
That is awesome! I bet you're going hard! What are you working with to practice your jump shot?
Yeah. I love talking radio, it helps me get my day going.
Ahh, talk radio can be quite...loud.
I know right. People can get so annoyed with the littlest things. It's like they're expecting everyone to have everything and everything is against them.
I understand your feeling, it is so annoying when people are rude to the people you try and help.  I've called management a lot over the past 2 years and nothin. I've also called the company about things that aren't really their fault. I've also called a friend a bad person and they didn't call the company to get ahold of me.
You're right.  I just lost my job, my wife left and now I'm having to pay for all of my expenses.  I just feel like life has been taken out from under my control.  I'm just trying not to let that happen.
That's pretty cool. I love Britneys.
That is awesome! I love Britney Spears too. I saw the video for "I Will Never Love You" on YouTube and was so sad! I didn't want it to end! I felt bad watching her cry.  I wish I could go to the show. I love Britney too!
oh wow. what are you renting the place for?
That sounds great!  What city are you moving in to?
I don't, I live with my husband in the city. I do love my husband, but it's not for me. I live in a small city. It's good to have your own, but I don't have the same stress.
I hate roach bugs!  What did you have to do to catch it?
Oh, that is a scary situation.  Did you call the exterminator?
That's great! Are you going somewhere exciting?  I'm going on a road trip with friends next week.
Awwww that sucks. I wish you the best.
That's cool. Did you have to go through a long line to get it?
That sounds awesome! I wish you the best! What computer does it come in?
I love the delivery service too!
that's great, how do they deliver?
Oh, yeah. I was just thinking about that too, actually just a few days after the release.
I watched it, too. I know it's a sad movie.
I love kids learning stuff like that! They are the future!
That's a pretty impressive achievement. What's he learning in terms of learning how to count? I think I learned that myself when I was around that young. It seems you're ahead on the counting game. Are you his teachers or parents or both?
I went there today.
That's so frustrating! Did you get any pictures taken of you?
Oh, oh wow! What happened? Did he spill it on you?
I hate being woke to water.
I hope it wasn a stray. Did you see any paw prints?
That is hilarious! I bet!
That's a pretty amazing experience. Did you travel solo or with a group of people?
That is cool!
That must've been fun! What vacation did you go on?
That's always exciting. I hope you had a great time. I can never go to the store and come back and forget what I bought. I always forget. That must have been fun. Did you have fun at all while the kids did things and played?
Oh yep, that's exactly what I thought too lol! It's funny how you never realize it's the opposite of the same until years go by!
I love ziplines! Where was it?
Yeah ziplineing is pretty fun but also kinda scary
Oh, that sounds scary! Did you call the ambulance?
That's terrible! Did anyone help you out?  I know someone once told me they smashed a finger on a glass door.
It's sad when that happens. I lost mine a few years back.
I hope she lives a few more years. She's such a sweetie and I know she's not going to let anything get her. I hope she's okay. I just miss having her around. I wish I could give her a big big big hug.
I've been lucky too.  I've had it since I was a child.  It's really hard to deal.
I am really lucky as well.  I have been through the cancer and chemo too.  It's not easy.
I move too. Where are you moving? I moved to a new city a month or two ago
Yeah that's great.  I've moved a couple of kids to new school districts in the past few months, and it can't have been easy for them to get along with their new teachers and get good grades.
yeah thats my point, its our trash thats is the problem,
It really sucks when they throw trash. I hate seeing it too.
That sounds scary. Do you have any pets?
That's great. How long do you spend alone?
That's terrible. I hate losing money too. What were you going to do?
I know that sounds like magic, but honestly it is a game I play to try and make money online
That is terrible!  You should stay home with your dog!
That stinks. You should just get a dog.
I do that sometimes. What kind is it?
I wish you the best of the luck. I have applied myself
I love the fair! What are the prizes?
Oh, you want a Mustang. That is a nice thing to want.  I have never had the opportunity to own one.
Oh. That's not very safe, right?
That is scary, I hope you can find a better neighborhood to move to.
Oh, I know that sounds cool! What did you see?
That is pretty cool!
That sounds like a lot of work. I'm glad they made it.
Oh my goodness. I can imagine you were nervous about having them over so far, not sure how to handle it.
I bought two pairs of shoes recently too, I'm so bored.
That must have been frustrating to see that they were right footed
It's so simple, isn't that weird?
That's awesome.  How far do you think you can go in it?
I love being able to express my thoughts. What are your thoughts for that speech?
I hope you do not!
I would have checked it. Did they find it?
That would've been so frustrating!
I love that! What a unique achievement!
That's awesome! What kind of dare was that for?
That's crazy. Are you looking for anything? Or are you just looking back. I can't stand car accidents.
That sucks, I hope you can get some car training classes soon.
Did anyone see what happened?
I know that is frustrating, but sometimes these kinds of things happen.
I've been there! That's terrifying! Did they get any treatment for it?
I would have wanted him dead, he was nasty!
Oh my that's impressive.  I've never lifted weights myself, so I wouldn't be dead lift  even a pound or two.  What gym is he at, and what's his size and weight like?
I love deadlifts myself. I have a lot of deadlifts in the gym.
Oh wow! That sounds like so fun. Did you get to pet all the cats there as well as the cats that are in your home?
That's so sweet! Did you get to hold any cats?
That's scary! I hope nothing happened.
That's a spider! Did you run inside?
That's a bit of a stink. Did you clean it?
That's annoying, but you could have just tossed it out and cleaned up.
I'm sorry about that. I know how you can miss your pets.
I know, I miss her as well, but I'm glad to hear she passed peacefully
that always happens to you
I know that. I remember listening "Love Song" by My Little Pony when I was little
That's terrible! Did you see who was making it sound?
Yeah armados can look like a dog, but they are much bigger and more aggressive!
I bet that bird was really sick. I would be too sad if that was my yard.
I love birds too!  I hope it's okay.  I hope you don't get it back.  They can be a pain.
That's nice. Are you guys having fun hanging out together?
That's great to hear your having a good food.
That's amazing! Congratulations. What kind pay raise?
I bet! That's a good thing!
oh thats bad. what do you do to meet that deadline?
Oh, you need to be careful.
I hate when you leave without a plan!
I am sorry.
Oh no. That's terrible.
You're going through this?
Oh no!  Is she okay?
That's always fun. I've never done one.
Oh, that is awesome! What are you and the kids going on the cruise?
That sounds like a good time.
oh yeah thats a good thing.
That sucks! Is there any chance that you guys have any idea how bad this storm is going be like 50 feet per minute wind and 30 miles an hour winds?
That would be bad. Do you have any plans in place?
That's terrible. Did he say why he got called back? Was it something unexpected or did you ask?
That is very sad news. I can't imagine losing gear that important. I'm so happy for him that he got called back in.
That's a classic comfort food dish! What kind cheese did you use?
Oh man! That sounds delicious. How long did you cook it for?
That sounds so good! What brand is it?
Yeah you need to put up a show!
That's the worst thing that could happen to me.
Yeah that's a good reason to do it.
That's awesome! Congratulations!
I love promotions at work, especially when you get to be in a position where you are in charge and help set the direction.
That's so much fun!
That's so great! What kind is it?
Yeah, that is what life is. A good candle, and a good cat, and you're happy?
Yeah my cat is just sleeping on my pillow.
Oh wow! What toy was it?
That's really cool. It's nice that she has a mom like that.
That's great!  Congratulations on your wedding day!
I can imagine how happy he is. I am also happy.
That's terrible. How often do you see his work colleagues?
Oh, wow.  I hope so.  I hope so too.  I hope so because I really hope he gets the news he gets.
I am sorry, how sad are things like that. I have lost my own pets a lot over the years, but that's just the way of life.
That must have hurt.  I had a cat that passed away last year.  It was heartbreaking.
Yeah! She's a 3rd gronder kid, she has a very unique way of painting.
That's so nice of your daughter! I wish her the best of luck!
That's terrible! Did you have your license revoked for that?
That's really scary! Did you end up buying the car?
That's so annoying.  What kind was it? I love to kill a fly.  I always have a bug spray bottle on my nightstand.  Is it the one kind fly?
That's the worst. Did you throw it away or try something to stop the fly?
That's so gross! Did you find out who did that to your dog?
That must've been disgusting.  Did you clean up the cat poop?
That's awesome! Did you get nervous about it?
I hope so! What subject is you speaking on about?
Oh no! That's disgusting. I'm sure it was worth it to see your cat's face. How old was it when it did this?
That stinks! Did you have to take her to a vet to get it out of you fur and anything like? I hope it's okay.
That's quite an image. Did anyone ever notice?
I know right, I felt like I was going crazy.
Oh? Was it good? Did you eat all night long to get it all?
Oh no, that sucks. I hope it was just the pizza place and not the food you like in general.
That's too funny. I have never had an AirBnB before.
Oh, that's too bad. What did you do eventually?
What kind race? Was it at a track?
emy hope you had fun otherwise running isn't for you
I bet that was a lot more uncomfortable! Did you guys fight?
That's okay. How did she feel?
That's so sweet of your husband.
Oh wow that is nice to have. I bet that it was very relaxing for you
What! That's scary! Was it a surprise?
That's crazy. I can understand how scared you'd be.
That's disgusting. Did your dog like to eat it?
Oh wow, that sounds like a disaster. How did she react to the food?
oh, i know, that's why people call it a noise disturbance
I hate it when my brothers music plays too loud!
I am sure that was a surprise.
That sounds like it.  What did you do?
I hope someone found it! I have lost my keys and I had left my book on the porch!
Oh no. Did you see it get lost or damaged in some way?
That is a nice gift, how did he get it for you?  Was it his birthday or just for no particular reason.  I would have loved some of it too!
That sounds like he is a nice husband.
Oh, that's not good at all... How long before you get a new city?
That's horrible that's taxes are so out the roof in some places.
It is.
I do too, I have been married 32 years.  We are perfect
That's awesome! Congratulations!
That's good to hear.  I have to do that with my house too.  I'm excited to see where the mortgage rates are right now though I don't know the last rate was.
That can be annoying
That's a shame. Hopefully she comes back soon.
That's a bit scary. What happened? Did something bad?
Oh, wow.  Why would you do that?
I am so jealous! What is that?
It's hard when you love your children, but sometimes you just don't want to ride it with you
It's very hard to lose our pets.  I lost mine about a year ago.  How was it?
i lost him in a accident 1993... It was a traumatic experience.. He was hit by another car. He didn't survive.. It was a very dark day in our lives.. He was such an amazing dog..
I think we're all just too busy being stressed about things we don't have
That's not uncommon. People often spend more money than they realize and then have to worry about paying it all back. I try not think that about myself, but I have to deal with the fact that I'm a grown adult.
That is really cool. What kind?
It's funny how those memories come back.
What is it about?
It's pretty much everything. I have a lot of music channels. I also watch a lot of educational videos and tutorials on YouTube. I also have a lot of gaming channels on my channel.
I bet! Was it chocolate? I love chocolate!
Oh my! That was funny. I bet it tasted good too.
I bet that was hot!
That was scary! What happened? Did it burn you?
That's really cool! What kind are those photos of?
That's really interesting, what was easier for you?
That sucks. What kind of work do you do?
I am sure it works out, you must have faith.
That would be terrible!
That's good to hear.  What are they going to do then?
I hope you're feeling okay! Did you break it?
I hope you are okay now
I do love playing games.  I'm always up for a good one.  I'm not sure about any particular games though.  Do you play any?
You sound like a hardcore fan.  I'm more of an Halo and Starcraft fan.  I like the idea though.
You should just be more grateful for the money.  You're not the one working twice hard to earn it!  I am just being jealous and being jealous.  Why should I be jealous?  I am just happy for the money!  I am just jealous.  I wish I could work just twice as hard as my friends.  I wish I was just more successful.
I know, I know. But I just have so much in common with my friends. I'm not jealous at all.
that sounds great, what did you take
It sounds like everything has worked well. What are some of your plans?
That's good. What made your good day?
That sounds good. I wish you well.
I am sorry to hear that! What did happen?
oh wow, that sounds scary. What did you do to protect yourself?
I do remember. My older kids would always bring out their old consoles and play.
I agree, my brother has an old NES. I have not played it in a while but have just started again.
That's so rare. I've never been that happy.
That's great! I'm good too! I've got a few friends who are going on a vacation to Europe, and I'm really excited for that.
Oh wow, that was awkward. What happened?
That's pretty gross. I can't blame her for asking for it, but I should be worried I'm not sure I can afford to lose my house.
That sucks. What a mess. Did you order food?
That's a bummer. Did you guys talk it over the phone?
That is pretty gross! Did your dog do it again?
That's not good! Did you have a pet?
that sucks
that is so sad. I hope your cat was just really tired.
That's really brave of them. What was your first time?
Yeah, that was scary.  What was the worst part?
That's always nerve wreckingly exciting! Did anything unexpected happen?
That's good that you were nervous. It's always better than to be anxious than anxious and miss the interview
Yeah thats no fun to have someone steal your food.  How are they taking your food?
Yeah i know how that goes.
That's okay! It was a lot of work and it's a lot to be nervous about, so I'm glad you did end to do it!
That must have scared you, did you get scared?  Did you do the jump again?
That is a very good point.  I would have told them to just ignore them if they were being a pain.
that is such true.  I have been a teacher at a high school for a few months now and I see bulling and bullying behavior from kids.  They try to push kids that are different.  They need a teacher to be like a parent.  I always try to teach them that kindness goes a long way to solve problems in life.  But sometimes they just do it out of fear or to get attention.  I hope more parents would take the time to do the same
I do know that there's a lot of work that goes into creating them. It's not just graphics, you know? It's a whole lot of story, music, sound effects. It's a whole lot more than you'd think!
That's a lot. I don't play video games anymore. I'm happy playing with friends or on my own computer games.
That's so rude.
That's cool, you have to do what you want.
That's always fun. Did you enjoy the reunion?
That must have brought up some nostalgia.
That sounds like fun! Did you end up selling it?
That is awesome. I have a stake in a few different companies. I think about it a lot.
That's a big change. What is the teacher like?
oh wow i have no idea what that is. i am just getting into social work
I bet that was fun to watch
I have never lent or given money to someone.
I can see why.  That's such a cool thing.
I am sure you felt great about it though. I have had sky diving and I can see how exciting that must be. I'm not sure I would do that again though, but I do know that it's not for everyone and everyone has different experiences.
That's so cool! Did anyone notice? I love socks on their shirt!
Oh wow! Did you get it off when you got home?
Oh my god. That sounds so terrifying. Did you call the police and insurance company right after it happened?
oh wow thats soooild
That's terrible. I'm sorry.  Is it tomorrow?
I hope you do great at it.  I bet you will.  You seem so confident in yourself.
It is great that you are still working!
That's awesome. I wish you the very best of success. You deserve every bit.
That's cool. I have a friend that's the sky diving instructor.
Oh I understand.
oh wow!  that is awesome that they didnnt cancel.  you got lucky.  i have been there.  been on flights that were canceled.
That was good! I love Chinese food. How many people were at the buffet with you?
Oh that sounds gross! I bet you felt pretty sick to your tummy afterwards though.
That's so sweet! Did you guys have any fun?
I agree, I like going back and reminiscing about the past. I hope we go back there again soon!
oh my god, that is terrible.  What happened?
Oh my goodness, that is so sad. I'm so sorry you went through that.
That's so cool. Did you like the song?
That sounds awesome! I have had that happen too. I just hope you didn't have too embarrassing of yourself.
That's awesome. I am married too. I met my wife on a blind online dating site.
I have a similar relationship. I love my husband. We met in college and he moved here and we met at work.
That is terrible. Did they recover it for you?
It's okay, you can always get a replacement.
Oh that sounds great.  How much did you get to do to them.
That's great.  I'm trying to do the right by my community.
That is really the key to life. I am so tired all the time
That's good news. What do your unstable times mean in terms of your life right now.  Did you have any problems with addiction or financial stability issues?
That's good, what made those times bad?
that's awful
I'm sorry to you, but, no, you didn't. You just need a new set of oil, and you can get that.
I'm sorry to say, but you might be better off just selling it to someone else. It might make you a little richer in the long run.
Oh my goodness!  Was it painful?
that's awful! did it hurt you?
That is true, but I hope you got to talk some trash about some people who you really don't.
I can imagine!  Sometimes I order things too quickly, but other people I order take forever.  I wish I had more time to wait!
Yeah, that happens to the best of people too lol
I'm sorry. That must have been tough.
Oh no. That's awful. I'm so sorry you lost her. I hope you were able to cherish the time that was.
Oh cool! I love boats!  I bet you'll all have a blast.  I used to have one too!
I love the sound and smell of a lake.
I am not jealous of loaded parents, they must be nice people. I don't want any part of that.
That is tough. I hope you and your friend can understand each other a little bit. That would make a lot of difference
I feel you, I work hard to provide for my family and sometimes I feel like I can do more with what they have than I can do for what I have
I have to learn a lot too.
That is good that you were willing to learn and improve.
Oh, great! That must have been difficult. Did you have to learn the software yourself?
It can be stressful to deal with those problems
It is good that they are willing to help.
that is a shame
It's okay to make mistakes.  I do too sometimes.  Don't beat yourself up about them though.
What subject is teaching?
I hope you do okay!
I know, but at least you got the project.  That is all you can do.
That's great! What happened on the project?
That's great. I'm so happy for that.
That's so sweet! It's great that you're not letting your health issues get you too caught up in worrying and letting them affect you.
I'm so sorry! I've lost so many pets. I have a 3-month old Labrador.  It's been hard. Do you have a dog as a pet or a child? I'm always thinking of someone I care about who is no longer alive.
That's so hard. I have a dog too. She is 10 years old and she passed away a month ago. I miss having a dog. They make life feel short.
That is good! What made you hesitate?
What kind car is it?
that sounds great. What is he like?  Is he kind?
That sounds so nice! I'm glad to hear.
That's crazy! Did you guys laugh about it afterwards though? I always do the opposite of what I'm told to, and I'm pretty sure your friend did the opposite of what I told.
I would never go to someone home without knowing if it's locked or not.
that's a lot, i've been wanting a weekend to get out of the cold
That's awesome. You can't go wrong in DC.
Oh, that must be very comforting. What kind is that knife?
That must have been tough.
That's terrible! What health problems do they mean you have? I had a sister with diabetes. She was so young when it first came. She had it when she was 5. And then at 5 years old, she had a brain injury.
I hope you get better health. I have some myself, and sometimes feel sad about not having kids.
That is good to hear that it went well, did it go better?
That's great! What job did you get?
I bet it was hard to do that
That's terrible.  How did it end?
I know that feeling. It was so scary at first, but then you started to feel at peace with it.
That was my experience as a skydiving instructor.  I was scared, but once I realized how it all worked, I was in charge.
I love his work! I am a huge actor myself. I loved watching his work too.
That's pretty cool. Which were your favorites of his movies?
That would have looked like you put two reds on.  Did you get home okay?
that's kinda embarrassing
I love dance moves. What style is it you're working with?  Hip Hop, Salsa?
It is a fun thing to work on
Yeah, I had that happen. What did you do next?
That can happen, especially in public places like malls or stores.  You'd have to be really drunk to not be embarrassed by such situations.
that's always nerve wring
That can happen to anyone.
I bet that is true.  What city?
That sounds great.
That's really cool! What kind track are that for?
That's great you've been working on it!
Yeah, it's not like I'd expect from a 50-year-old dude. But I guess that's the point right? Age?
That would be a lot!
That's so weird, what is it about the gallon milk? I love it myself
That must have felt easy. Did anything happen afterwards?  Did you get in trouble for it?  Did you get in trouble?
I've never done that exercise before, what muscle do it target?
I am sure that was just an unfortunate accident!
That is awful!
Oh, what kind? What kind?
That must have been awkward. What happened?
I know how that feels.
its funny how sometimes we can't control what happens to our bodies and sometimes we have no control at all!
I love the taste! How is your taste buds right now?
That's a waste of good money, though.
That sounds amazing.  What's bench press about?  I haven't had the chance to work out much myself.  I've been a bit out of the gym.
I am glad you have been working on your fitness goals.
You hate scary movies!
I think you might have it wrong. I'm pretty old, I think I know what you're talking about.
I quit smoking a while back as well, but I have to say, it's harder than it was when I first quit!
I feel for that struggle
That is so brave of you, what was the dare?
oh wow that is crazy! i bet it was not easy! did he have to dig his head out from under a tree to get out?
That's great. What kind of tasks do you like to complete?
That's nice, I crochet a bit myself.  What's your favorite thing to crochet.
That sounds awesome! What was your workout like?
Oh, nice! Did anything interesting happen during your workout?
That sounds terrible. Did your roommate not notice it?
That must've been gross! Did you apologize to him in a funny voice?
That must've hurt. Was it bad?
Yeah, you should tell them about it.
I'm sure you miss him, but it's time for you to move on.
That sucks, but you'll meet again. I hope so. I hope so too.
that's a good point
Yeah, sometimes I just need a good cry fest
That's terrible! Did you see it?
Oh man, I had that happen last week too. It was so bad that my neighbor asked me to pick it out for them because of the smell.
oh that's a bad thing
Yeah, I have to do that too.  It takes a while to get the hang of.
I have never seen that, what is it about? I am curious. Is he a president?
I agree, I think we will go far
i love puppies. what breed?
That sounds amazing.  I would love puppies!
That must have been fun! I bet. Did anyone get in trouble?
That must have made for some pretty weird childhood.
That's an interesting food! What's in them?  Do they make you smell like a garroter or what's that?
That's a pretty weird one. Did you end up enjoying it?
I bet that was frustrating. Did you find a way back?
I am sure it was just an unfortunate accident. Did it happen recently?
I bet that was frustrating
I would hope so!
I know that feeling when you're at the ball and everyone's dress makes you feel like a queen.  That's why it's great you went!
I agree, diamonds are the ultimate fashion statement.
That is scary. Hopefully you don't need to go!
That was scary. Hopefully, your appointment went okay and now your tooth is taken care of!
That's true, I use the same router and internet connection as my phone.
That's true, I use it all day
That's great. I haven't seen any animals in my life
That's okay, you can just go to the animal sanctuary and watch them.
It's so sad.
I'm sorry for you.  I have a dog too.  She was a sweet girl, so it was hard to let her go.
That is true. I don't think I was responsible at all as I grew up in foster care.
I'm a grown up now
I love looking at old photos.
that is a good point
that is good to be pleased with the results
That's good to have some relief after that! I had a pretty tough semester too, but I just had to keep my head above water and try to focus.  Good for you! I'm glad you're happy about it too! It's good for everyone when people are able to focus and not worry so much about the next semester!  I'm just glad I didn't fail!
That can lead to problems, but sometimes teenagers are more prone than older kids.
that's nice of her to let you take the car
That sounds great! How many reps and what's the weight?
That sounds awesome! I have never done any gym workout, how does that work?
That's terrible. Did you tell anyone in class? Maybe they helped you calm it down.
I hope it's something other than a stomach issue.  Hopefully just a nervous tick in there.
That's a pretty impressive PR. What kind of weight were you lifting? I'm not sure what that means, though.
That sounds awesome. Did you try any new workouts this week as a way of challenging yourself?
I do meditations every morning
I do the same meditation every day too. I feel like I can handle 50 minute meditaiton.
Oh that? What? Why would that happen to him?
Oh god, why would he?  You should just be happy he chose to stay!
I bet you guys are having some fun! Tennis is my sport. How long is it been for you to play?
Yeah tennis is pretty hard work out there
Oh that sounds bad. Was she lying about what she did?
Oh my goodness, that's terrible.
You're right, high school can be overwhelming sometimes.
I'm a little old school myself but I can't imagine living in the city without it.
that is terrible. I am sure you are still recovering from it.
That's terrible!
I know how you can build your strength!
That's awesome. I'm not much of the gym scene myself, I do enjoy it though.
Yeah, family is tough. What are they like?  Do you like them or not so well?
I understand, I have had issues talking to my parents about certain issues.
Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear that. My dog passed away last summer. I know how much you care for your dog, and I'm sure you'll always cherish the memories of your time with your furry best friend.
that sounds really tough. I hope you get to bring another dog soon.
That's terrible, what happened?  How long have they been there?  How bad are they?
That sucks.  Did you ever forgive them?
That's so sad. I'm sorry.
That sucks! I'm sorry for losing my pet, but I know she was doing the best she was. I have lost 3 so it doesn't matter.  I hope she was doing something fun and having fun in her last few days.
That must have been scary. Did it go well?
That must've been scary. I hope your cat was fine too. How did they meet his roommate cat first of all.
its good that its over now. how did it turn out?
That is amazing you are so lucky
It can't be long until fall classes then.  I am so happy summer is finally coming to an end.
That's great you get the summer off.
That sounds great. Where is she from out of state of?
I am sorry to hear.  I can imagine it would be embarrassing.  Did they like eachother?  Did he make an effort to be quiet?  Did he eat a little?
It's always so much fun!
I hope everyone has their eyes in you.
that makes sense
That's great! You're an inspiration to me! Keep it up!
It is good that you are prepared.
That is good! What kind is it?
That's good. Did you pass?
That's great! I'm glad you prepared well. I'm sure you got an easy time in it.  What subject is your exam in?
I bet that hurt! Did you guys break anything?
That sucks! Did you get to buy it back?
Oh no. What did they want? I hate to call and talk.
I've been missing my friends too, and I'm glad they called.
That's cool. What are you doing for relaxation?
I love when people talk like that.
That's the worst. What do people normally do then? Do people freak out?
That is awful.
I know the struggles we face in life.  I am sure that one day you will be a successful homeowner.
I know right, I wish I had a friend like you, I am so jealous.
I did that last year. It's so nice, but it's hard to let go of family.
that sounds so nice of you.
That is awesome! What happened?
Oh yeah? What year was that?
Oh, that's so frustrating. I would have been so grumpy about that.
I understand how you can get so upset.  I had waited for my doctor for over an hour last time and was so upset when I got there that I ended up going home early to take care of things at home and get ready.
oh no i'm sorry to hear that
It's not always nice, but it's not like you have anything better to do, right.
I agree. I think people should always take responsibility for their own lives and decisions.
I can't agree with that. People should always be responsible with the consequences. If you do wrong, you do it yourself. If you do wrong and can't handle the guilt, it's better to just move on. It doesn't have anything to do with your worth as a person. It's about your integrity. You need integrity. I don't know why I even said this, because I don't know how you do things. But I know I would do the same. You
I hope it didnnt say "hey" or "i saw your post" or any of those.  Was it mean-spirting?
That's terrible. How long ago was this?
Oh that's really cool!  I love climbing!
Yeah, that sounds cool.  I've never been rock climbing, but my friends have been for years and it's always a blast with friends
That is terrible! What kind? Are you having them because of your sleep?
That is awful.
That's great! What kind workout do you like?
That's good to have the discipline and motivation to stay committed to it though. You must believe in your own hard work!
That's great! What did your baby name be?
That's great you had that experience.
That's pretty cool! I love ice skating too.
I am happy for you. You have worked hard.
it's normal.
Yeah, online classes can make it hard.
that's cool, i took 5 classes at once and passed. are they in different classes of each subject? or the same subject
Yeah, it's a lot to juggle right now. I hope you'll be okay with it
That sounds awesome.  What kind of girlfriend is that?
I have no romantic feelings for other people. I have a girlfriend of my choice that I love for life
I am from Canada, but I live near Florida, and it gets pretty bad there in August.
That's right! They're a real nuisance. I've had to take out bug sprays every few days.
Yeah, single mom life is tough sometimes, but at the same time it's a chance to grow up my kids and teach them the importance of taking care of others.  I'm proud of myself
Yeah, you guys need to work on your self esteem.
ohhh! That is nice of them to do.
It sounds like a long drive! I love going on road trips with friends.
I am sorry.  Did you have insurance?
I'm sorry. Were you driving?  Did you hit another vehicle?
I'm sure. Sometimes mothers just want what's best for their kids. I've heard that.
That's very kind of you to say. It really is. I hope that it works out for us.
That can be frustrating! What's your strategy? Is she getting bullied by another rat? Or is she just being too fey to get along with others rats around her age and age?
That sounds so cute! What kind is it, I think it's a rat?
I am a big fan of Six Flags! What is your favorite ride?
I haven't been there since I moved. I haven't been to an amusement park in a while! I'm jealous!
That's awful! What is it?
Yeah that's terrible.  I hope she makes a full recovery and stays healthy.
I am so heartbroken right about you.  What happened?
What happened?
That's a bummer. Was it ruined? I hate when that happens to my suit.
That stinks. Did you try to get a replacement suit?
That's terrible! What happened?
That sucks.  I hope you're able to move on.
That's awesome! Congratulations on the album!
Oh wow! What kind album is it about?
Oh wow! That's a great destination! Where are you going?
That's really cool! I have a cousin who's going to be a tour guide for a while.
That sounds scary.  I don't like guns.  I think everyone has a dark side.  I hope everyone tries hard to do the good.
I agree with you.
That's so scary! What was there that scared you?
That sounds creepy. Did anything happen?  Was there any signs?
That's a little gross. Did you scold him?
I bet that dog thought that you loved him.  I'm sure that dog will never do that to you again.
It's a sad thing that happens to us. It's great that you remembered her.
That must've been very sad for you.  Did she have any special talents?
Oh, wow. That's amazing. I bet the people really appreciated the effort. I don't do much holiday cheer. I'm not sure I can afford to.
It is the holidays, right around the time of year.  It's going to be a fun trip!
Yeah, that's great!  What are they coming from?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wow, that's really tough. I'm sure she's a wonderful person, though, and I'm sorry for having to deal with it.
I hope she's okay and happy.
That's so annoying. Did you drive on? I don't think that's a thing these day.
That's a good thing that was driving on the right lane.
That sounds very kind of you. I bet he appreciates you for that!
I bet he will appreciate you when he's not busy
That's interesting. I don't think I've ever met a friend who married someone who's that wealthy, so I would have expected you to be a little jealous.
I agree, I feel like I am stuck.
I hate when that happens
That is bad. What happened after?
Oh that's terrible. Was anyone able to help you?
I had that same experience. I was so afraid I would be ridiculously in front of the class
That's so cool! What's the prize if you get lucky enough?
I love how people love to play games like that.  It's like they enjoy the feeling of being the target of a joke.
That's great! Did you go?
I understand that. Sometimes people are busy doing their own thing and forget about others who want to do things with their own kids
I love Washington D. What do you do in D.C?
I wish you could of been here, it's a great city. What was the best thing about winning?
I do love surprises.
Yeah! I wish I had some friends like that.
That's really cool.  How many friends do you have?
That sucks. What happened?
Oh no!  That's terrible!  Did the people in your city do okay in that situation?
That's crazy. I hope everyone in the affected area is safe.
I am sure that must have been scary!  Did you all lose water?
i too, its very hard to go back
That is very true, it is good you are committed to your beliefs, it shows a lot
That's not bad. What time was she out? Did she get a warning?
that sucks.  Did you have her home alone?
That's great! What kind certification is it?
Yeah that's awesome. I bet you will do very good.
That sucks.  What's wrong?
That's nice, what is she sick?
that would be a good surprise.  What position is your manager?
That's great!  What are you doing now?
I'm sorry. What happened? Did you fight about something specific?
I understand how you feel. I feel the same way when my partner left. I hope things work themselves out.
I hate moving cities, but it's a great time to start over.
That is normal to move to a new city, it takes time.  You might want to go to the park, meet people walking by, and then go out.  It will get better with time
That is terrible. Why? What happened?
That's terrible. What class were you taking? Did anyone tell you why?
Yeah, that happens a lot!
I hate when someone does that.
That's awesome. I bet you are very happy.
I agree they are great pens now, they have improved a whole lot over time
That would certainly be great.
That sounds good! Are there any more buyers coming next weekend?
I'm sorry! Did you end up seeing her then?
That sucks.  I hope everything works out for her.
It was a mess
Yeah that happens sometimes, especially if it was a long pasta and she was eating it while she was still in it.
Oh my. What happened?
That must've been scary! Did you find any money or anything?
It really does make you feel so young again! I'm so ready to be back in high school right now.  I love the summer break.
I know exactly what you are talking about. I have two kids and I feel like I've only really started to understand what school life has to be like when my kids are 20 and I'm 40.
I bet that sounds really good!
That's funny. I bet you felt guilty afterwards.
That's awful. I'm sorry to hear about your loss.
That's sad. Did he leave anything to you to remember him?
that sounds nice
that's sweet of you
I have been through it too.  It's tough, but you have nothing to be ashamed about for that.
I know right, it can be hard to let that happen though
That happens. Did you borrow it recently?  I lost mine last year.  I had to replace it.
That's not good at all! Do you feel like you can borrow from another?
That is pretty cool that they didn't do that.  Did they have to work out of some reason or was just forgot?
That can be frustrating when that doesn't work out the way you hoped.  I've been married long enough to learn to not expect anything from my siblings or my parents, so I try to be more understanding.
That sounds wonderful. I used to be that way too.
That's awesome, keep enjoying life and all the simple pleasures
Oh my.
That's disgusting, did you try anything?
Oh wow! What kind cat is he?
Yeah cats love to be on their owners' lap.
I bet that must have brought back memories.
I bet that was a fun day. Did you get to keep any?
That was very kind of your part.
That's really kind of you. I appreciate that. My car is really old and it was so needed!
Oh, what happened? Did your friends do anything weird or creepy to scare or fright you away from them?
I hope you had a good dream.
That sounds nice! What kind animals do you have there?
That sounds wonderful! I love helping the animals too, especially the ones that are in need of food.
That's so sweet! What's his breed and name?
Wow! That's a really cute breed. I have two chihuahuawhose puppies I've had. My first one was a little girl and my first male one is a big ol boy named Max. He's 10 years young and he's 25 pounds!
That's terrible.
That was quite a tough situation.  I hope everything works out for you.
That's great. I bet he was very proud.
Yeah that sounds terrible
Yeah that's terrible.  Did you guys have to talk about it afterwards?
Yeah, I just feel bad that I set a bad example for her.
Yeah, that's the best part about growing older - looking back. It's nice to have that perspective.
I know what you are thinking...I hate being told I played an old computer! But I just found those old games and I am happy to go back to my childhood gaming days.
That's terrible. Did you ask why they didn't choose you for the job?
That's terrible. Did you ask for feedback on why they rejected you?  That is the only way to get to know why. I hope they told something that makes you realize why they rejected you.
I am sorry for leaving.
I understand how people feel. It's hard when things go through your head like this. I'm glad you have been able to start a positive journey now. That's a good start. You're on the path to happiness and that's all you really need. I'm sure you'll be happy. I just wish people like you more often.  It's hard to say, but I just wish they'd stop being so selfish and self-centered.
That's really exciting. I've never been one for boats. What kind is it?
ali, what's that boat for?
It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions. It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy.<|endoftext|><|eot_id|>
That is great news about it being your first time!
I do too, I just make it up as soon.
that makes you a good friend. i hope your relationship stays strong
That sucks!  I lost my dog last year and found out it's a dog show. I found the most beautiful dog!
I'm sorry to say that, that is terrible. What happened to the dog?
That's awesome! I skateboard with my son and daughter all the time!
That's awesome!
That's unfortunate, what happened? Did they just forget to show up or were they having financial troubles and couldn't make it happen
That is so sad, I hope they come to visit you soon
That sucks. I hope you can get a job soon.
Oh well, I'm sure you will try harder next time. I'm sure you are very capable and you'll do well
Oh wow, I hope no accidents happened! What did you wear to get out the door?
I can imagine you would have felt embarrassed about that. Did it ruin it?
I never knew that existed.  Is it common?
oh wow thats interesting
It's cool to have a remote control, I've always wanted one. What kind car is it? I've seen them. They're really cool.
I'm glad he's older enough to appreciate it! What car does he like?
I have had that problem before. It's so annoying.
That sucks.  What happened to your keys?
It sounds like she was in a lot of need. I'm glad they were able to provide her with some support.
That's really kind of you. Did she have any kids?
It must have made you happy to see him.  I had him at that for the first 3.4 years.
oh wow that's awesome.
That's really nice, what kind church is it?
That sounds like you are very happy!  How did you and the rest of the family feel when it first happened?
That's really cool. What did they look like back in the day?
Oh, wow, that's nice, you guys must be very lucky to be in the same school. How are you managing the different ages and the grades?
I know right. She was so talented. I hope her legacy lives. I was sad.
What a legend. I am so going to listen to her album "Respect" on repeat.
Oh that sounds pretty delicious. I love it when you eat and then you eat again.
That's true. The waiting part is a lot of fun.
That's terrible. What happened?
That's terrible.  Did the father of the kids lose custody?
That's awesome. What kind exam is it for?
That's great. What was your supervisor exam about?
Oh that's so exciting! What grade are you sending them off for?  Do you have twins?
Oh wow. That is so nice of you. I don't know if I am ready for school tomorrow. I don't like school that early.  I like to wait.
Oh no! That's so sad.
Yeah that's awful. I'm sorry. I wish she wouldn be bullied. I wish it was harder for kids that get bullied. I have a daughter who bullied me when she was in high school.
oh, what happened?
That must be hard.
I bet. What did happen to him?
I am sorry your dog got sick. I hope she is better now.
That sounds like fun. What kind is it?
That's nice! I have a cat, Luna, who likes to sleep on the couch.
That's great! Did you win?
That must have been so awesome! How long have you been playing cello for?
That's awful! Did anyone help?
That is terrible!
I hate it when people work too hard to get where they want to go but can't afford it. I hope he finds something better.
That sucks.  Did he ever apologize or apologize afterwards and try to make it work?
That's good! You should give them space and see if things work out between them. I would not want to rush back into an old relationship.
I hope he gets over working himself and starts to move on from his bad habits. I think he's got some work on himself to do.
That sucks, did it happen by the time you came home?
That sucks, hope it was worth the hassle.
I'm sure it went very well. What kid are they? Mine's been sick lately and I had to work long hours.
Yeah, sometimes parents don't let kids babysat because they don't want their parents around. But they seem fine.
That's really sweet. I've had that problem before too. Sometimes I have a hard time trusting people.
Oh no! I would have been so grossed out! What a disgusting sight!
That sounds awful. I hope the water quality is improving soon.
That must be scary. I hope you have faith in your abilities.
I hope you play great and you will be able to overcome that fear
I am so glad that happened.  That would have been a very scary situation!
Yeah, I can imagine you were in the hospital.  Did you end up okay?
That was so nice of him!
I would love a Nintendo switch
I'm sure it was a lot of fun. What kind of fun?
That's so sweet of you. What are you planning?
Yeah that must have felt so scared and embarrassed. What did they say to you?
Oh boy, did he have fun? Did he get to go home early and get to make up with you? Did he ever do anything bad?
That's very thoughtful of your grandmother. What kind is it of?
I think it would be nice to have it but I understand why it would be hard to let go.
I love that.  That's a pretty good deal.  I wish I had been able to do that.
I love how life works. You should really try to do it.
That sucks. Did anyone take any pictures of the mess?
That's awful.
that's kinda sad, did you get back together with her?
That's terrible. Did you guys talk recently or was it just a thing where you missed each other?
That's so great! I'm sure you're happy to see you both are still together!
I love that! My wife and I are celebrating our 5 years.  We just started getting married.
I bet the animals were happy for that.
That's terrible. I feel for you.
that sounds awesome
its a boring place lol.
That's so exciting! What are your new adventures?
That sounds fun! What's the state of?
That's kind of creepy.
Yeah, I would just get up and walk away from him.
That's very good news! What field? I'm a teacher and writer. I love it!
I would be very excited for that opportunity!
That's okay. You didn't win. I didn't win either time!
I've entered those myself a few times. I wish you luck.
That is a scary thing to see.
Oh wow! Was it scary or did you like watching?
That's great! What are you packing for the trip?
Oh wow! You moving to a new place? Where?
It sounds like you were shopping at a store. Did you take a picture to post?
That's really awful! Did the police or the store call the police to report the hit and the hit?
That was fun. How did you do?
Oh wow! That's funny! How old was she then?
I know that feeling all too well.  What did he do?
That's very kind of you to do that.  I do the opposite with friends and family all the time.  I think everyone deserves it sometimes.
I don't think that homeless person deserved to get yelled at. I think the person who did should get some discipline for their behavior.
That's awful. I hope she gets a job soon so people like that don't bother them anymore.
I feel your pain.  I am in the same boat.
I hate waiting as much!
Oh no. I'm sorry. What kind is it?
That's tough. Maybe you should look for another opportunity.
that would be a grossly grossed-up moment
I hate the feeling of that smell and I would be sick.
Oh that sounds exciting! What kind of move is this? Are they taking us across country?
I love moving places!  Where you moving to sounds like it's going to be an exciting adventure!  Where are they sending us to?
I have been there. It happened to me.
that's terrible. Did you lose anything?
Oh, really old toy?
That is sad.  I would like to have found her old toy.  I had almost lost her too.  She had gotten loose and i was so sad.  It took us almost two years to find it.  I was so sorry.  I loved that dog.
That's great! Congrats on perseverance
That's great! Congratulations!
Oh that's exciting! What subject is it in?
That's good. I always study hard for finals too.
Oh, I bet that was frustrating! Did your car work again after that was done with it?
Oh no! That is terrible! What happened next
oh well, good luck then.
oh, public relations sounds interesting
that sounds cool, how did it work out for them?
I am so nervous.
oh, great luck
Oh. Well that's pretty tough to leave behind good people. Did you move for work?  I moved from school to work, and I moved from a small city to a bigger city.
That's true, but it's hard to let them down sometimes. It'll just take some time. I hope you do okay in your new city.
That's nice of them to make a product like body wash!
I have been using that same brand body wash since the day I was born!
That's understandable, you don't want the weather to ruin your day.
It's always rainy in the city I'm in. I wish you better luck!
I'm so sorry. I was expecting him today as well.
Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear. I have had my own dog pass away, and I miss them so much.
Oh, hurricane season?
That must be so scary, especially in Florida.
That's very sweet of your wife.  Did she make it from scratch, though or did she buy a bagged mix of chicken?
oh that's great
I'm so sorry you're going to go through that again.  I used to think I wasn't going to react that way.
It is scary, I know.
That's weird. Did you taste anything unusual in the cokes?
That's so cool! What did you end up ordering?
That must have been fun making those things!
I know right, I'm the same way. I don't want to get rid of any of them items, even if they're not used.
oh wow. what kind pancakes were they?
That sounds like a great morning
I hope you get together soon
I can't complain about anything.  I am a huge fan.
That's so cool! Did you two guys or boys?
I am so excited for this, i bet.
That's very good of you. I would do anything for someone.  I have a friend that has a business and she has had it for many years, but recently she had to close. She has been working on a new business, but it's taking a lot of her.
I can totally relate to this.  I have been there too many times.  I hope she gets through this and comes out the stronger wiser and more confident!  I hope she gets a good job and makes good decisions.  I know she has what she's got to do to do that.
That's pretty cool. Are you thinking about asking them if you could borrow it for a year to see if you could afford one?
I can imagine. I've always wanted a Subaru but never thought I had the money. I have always wanted to get a Honda but never thought it was worth it
It's like, a car, and you need a truck.  I would have to get a car, and then I would have a truck, I would never have a car and truck.
Oh wow that is so cool, what kind of gas station is that at, that sounds so easy
That's not fun at church? That's a little too close to the front of the pew for comfort! I'd have to get her diaper changed quickly to avoid a big commotion! I would have just let her go sit down for the service and get her diaper changed at the end.  That would have been the best part of church!
I know right. She's only 8 months old so diaper rash is just around the corner. I am trying my best to not be too upset about the diaper rash. She's just learning to sit in the potty seat now. She's a smart girl.
I bet it's very exciting for you. How does that work?
That sounds fun! What kind toy is it?
that's so exciting! i love cruoses
I hope so too too. Are they going with you or with a different group? I'm excited to see you too!  I have been on a cruise before and it was amazing.
I hate when that happens.
that's terrible.  What happened?
I feel for that. I was there once and just couldnt. I was trying to get it out of my system
I love when you feel like praising and worshiping and then just being yourself again.
That is a common thing that I do.  I usually eat at the mall after work.
I'm the same way. I like to eat healthy but sometimes I do not.
oh, what kind of party?
Oh boy, that's great! What did his presents look at first
That's cool! I bet you had to be very patient.
That's awesome. I'm glad to hear that you and the kids can do things together again.
That's terrible.  How is it treating?
That must've been scary
I have been sick a few days, and it's a virus. I feel for you, friend! I am praying for you!
That must be terrible for her. Hopefully she will get better soon.
Ohh that's so sweet! What cat do u have?
That sounds nice.  Do your cat's have personalities?
Oh wow! How did that go out for you?
That's okay, you'll know for next time.
I love lake house.
Oh, what a trip that sounds like! Where was it in particular that you went?
ohh, ohh, oh! that was so gross.
That is awful. I would have been so upset.
That's always fun. What did she do?
Oh wow that's awesome. I bet you're so proud. What age did she start skating at?
That must have helped you a lot, how long you work there?
That's great that your dads willing to help you out in that way
I am sure was a bit of an intimidating experience.
Oh I know right. I had to meet my new physical therapist this week too, and I was a little worried.
That must have been fun to hear. What school are they in?
That's awesome! What are they doing in school?
It was so disorganized. They really need to organize their trip
I feel bad. Did you find the experience helpful in the end?
That's the worst part, just standing around waiting.
That's the worst part. You're the only person in the store!
That's so sad. What happened? Did he pass?
Oh man, I'm so sorry. I can only imagine how hard it must be to go through that kind of thing. I hope you can find some comfort.
That's a really cool trip. I've always wanted to visit some European countries.
I love Europe. Where you think you would go first.
That is so cool! Did they do much together?
Oh man. What happened to you all these days ago.
That is nice that you have a group that stays together. I'm glad that my group of friends stays close as well
I love when she does that.
I know, I know. It really gets under your skin. I just wish that would go to her. I know I know, I'm being selfish, but I think she should have to tell the kids about the lie. I mean, kids don't understand the context of what they're talking about. I just know I would have told the kids. They're always getting on my case about how much they spend.
That's terrible.
Yeah, people need guidance. I hope they learn from it.
Oh, man. I feel you, girl. I don't know what's wrong with her. I'm not even sure I care anymore than to get in trouble. She's always been good to me, I'm happy to pay it off.
Yeah, it's tough when stuff like this happens, and you don't get to see your family.
that sucks that is a bittersnap moment
That's good to hear that school went well.
That's great to hear your shopping paid for you being home!
I bet, did they call back to ask how long it took?
I'm glad everything worked out well for you!
That's really not cool.  Did you tell them to calm down?
It is unfortunate. It's like they're just trying to show him they're the most important person. It's like they're trying to take advantage of him right now that they can't even get along with each other themselves. It's really sad. I hope they can work things out. They'll never know what could happen to them. They're too caught in that kind of childishness right now to even think of doing anything else other than arguing and fighting.
That is great. What a fun activity.
What's volleyball?
I love to go fishing too! What kind are you going for, lures or something more traditional like bait?  I used to like to go to the lake near where I grew up and catch all sorts of fish.
That's awesome! What's the recipe for?
That's a fun activity. What time do they play?
Oh that's a fun game! I love to eat while I'm drinking.  What time is your game going?
I bet.  How did you handle it?
That is good you take so care of the house.
That's awesome! What gift are you hoping for?
What a great goal! What kind of camera are looking forward to?
Oh, that's a nasty thing. What did you do? Did you scold your dog?
That's terrible, I hope he doesn't chew on anything else
Yeah camping sounds like fun. What kind? I love it.
Oh cool, that's awesome. I bet you are excited.
That's creepy! Did anything break?
That is pretty scary. I don't even have the power!
How long do they last?
That's scary, I hope the storm clears out quickly. Is it going to affect your power grid?
oh no, did the store make it themselves?
I guess that's the price you pay for buying a cake from the grocery store.
that makes sense, you want to feel good about the way you come in front of the interview
I totally get that, it makes you feel good about the situation.
That's nice! Did you ever eat them when she passed?
What do your grams bake? I love baking.
That is so cool! Did she like it? Did she like going back to that school?
That's a cute story. Did she like kindergarten?
That's really nice of you. She's going through that age where she thinks it's cool to play video games.
That's really cool. I've always been a bit of an avid video game player.
I love that dip! What happened?
That's awful.  I hope you were happy before it happened though.
That must have been exciting news! Congratulations on getting what you deserve
that sounds awesome!
That's good. What did you do?
I hope it goes well.
Yeah, sometimes you gotta just let things happen and see what happens

That is so disturbing. I am shocked that it happened. I would have never even known. I would hate if that was my dog.
I don't know much about sports, do England have a national team? I don't know much about the sports world.  I don't know much sports. I don know very little about sports
I have faith that my country's national football team will do the same.
Oh, yeah. It takes a while to wake them up, you know?
Yeah, school started for my kids today and I am feeling the withdrawal symptoms.
I'm sorry to ask, are you going to take them to grandma and great aunt mabel?
youuou think that was gross! i dont even have to clean under desks lol
That's gross! Did you call in an expert to clean it out?
What animal?
I know. It is heartbreaking to hear about. I hope they are safe now.
that is so right for rescue shelters to help animals. I hope that those animals find good homes. I am glad there is help.
i agree that they did not do their job and left us to deal with it
It's so cool!
That is great to see. Hopefully, it will work for your kids.
That is always such an excited day for parents.
I love ice cream too.  Do they make ice cream sandwiches now?
It seems like that would take away my favorite part of the morning!
Oh man. What are they going on?
I think you mean boring.
That's crazy! Was you able to catch him?
Oh that must've been intense. I hope you were safe.
I'm so sorry. That's so heartbreaking.

That sounds like a great story.  What video did she play?
That's really cool. Kids are always learning new stuff.
That's awful! How will you pay now?
That stinks. You should talk to the band director about it. Maybe they can help out.
I have had to go that route myself.  It was hard
That's great to have a mom who looks after things for you like that.
I know what that feels like
I'm sure! I used a lot of noise makers myself when my wife and kids came. It was hard. I think we all need some quiet time sometimes. I hope your quiet time is good. I need some too!
That sounds like a fun memory. What did our parents say about that incident?
That's funny, we would do it to get attention from our parents.
Oh man, what was it? Was it a new movie or a re-release of a classic? I hate when that happens.
That movie was terrible. I loved it though, and it's one I'll be re-wantching.
That sucks. Did you talk with your coworkers about what happened. Maybe they didnnt know how to do the job right?
That's awful. Did you confront him about it?
That can get frustrating at times but sometimes you just have to accept that people like to social. You can't get work done at the same time as social.
I understand. Sometimes they just need a break from you and a chance to do their own thing.
That's great! Are you feeling pretty nervous about it?  I have been nervous about my first big date for years.
That's great news! I hope you have a fantastic date and you both have a great time.
Oh wow. That's a worm?
That sounds unpleasant
I would be so scared
i was scared too, but i did not want to harm her. i was able to run.
I have a new dog!  She's a pug.  She is so sweet.  She's so cute!
That's great! I bet he's super smart and athletic. Australian Shepherds are my favorite. What's he doing right now? Is he chasing squirrels or playing with his food bowl.  Do you play with him or do anything with him?
That's not good, why did you eat it?
I would too feel bad about. I have never eaten pie before but now I want to try it.
I hate it so much when that happen.
I bet! Did it move away?
That would be bad. I hope that you are okay!
That's great! Congratulations! That must have been exciting!
oh wow. that's awesome, congrats! how does your job work out to you?
That's a bums up.  What are you going to do?
I am sure you will have a good time, you will meet new friends soon enough
I'm sure you are! What was the butterfly doing in that amazing photo?
That's awesome! What camera do you have?
Oh that was so gross. What did you do? Did your do it?
Yeah, it was pretty gross. I didn't let her lick my face. I had her lick my ears first.
That is so annoying. Did you yell?
That's so annoying. Did you yell?
I have been there! It's scary.
Oh yeah? Why did they reject you?
oh thats no good
What happened to the plane?  Did it get hit by an ICBM?  I was on that plane too and I'm terrified of flying again!
That sounds like a very stressful time! Did you end up winning?
That is terrible. I hope he is okay. Did he think he won?
oh that would be so bad, I can't believe that would have to have happened.
That's terrible.
Oh no. That's so terrible. I'm so so so sorry. I'm sorry he didn. I hope he was happy.
that's really hard to do. I lost two dogs and cats. They were so cute, and I was so sad.
Oh, wow! What did you think of? Did you have fun?
That sounds fun! I hope you enjoyed it. I love karoke
that's good! i'm happy for you
That's good news! Congratulations on your success! I bet you got an A+.
That's so annoying, why do people keep playing that song over?
That sucks, do you talk to her about it or try to ignore it?
I know that feeling when you're trying to remember a password to your account
That's great!  I am going to a concert tonight.  How about where you going?
That's not cool!
Oh wow, that sounds awful!
That must have been scary! Did he return it?
That's terrible.  I hope he didn't hurt yourself.
oh wow that's exciting, which one are you thinking about?
that is awesome that you are interested in graphic design.
That sounds smart. What's Christmas shopping this time of the year?
that's good to hear. you're really taking care of yourself this time of year. you deserve some time off.
That sucks! What happened? Did you cancel?
Yeah that's good. I'm glad everything is good now.
That's really sweet of him to do.
That is very wise of you.
Oh man, I bet it's tough right now. I hope things start up to look up for you.
I completely agree with that. Money is a blessing that we all get to have one time or the other in life.
I'm sorry to hear about that. What kind are his family acting like?
That's horrible, how long ago did it pass away?
that sounds annoying. are they close to the time?
I bet that's gonna be a lot!  Hopefully everything gets along okay.
It's hard when we have to grow up and move away, even if we love our family.
That's nice. I hope she is at rest.
That makes sense. I think about it too. I wish you could tell her how much I care for her. I would tell you anything.
Oh.  That is true.  I had 7 and then had to let go.  My first was 6 years old and I had to let him go to another country to be with his mother.
That's sad. You can give advice and support to them as long as you don't let go of your children completely.
That's terrible! Did they?
That's scary, I hope the baby is healthy now
I love that game. What is it about it? Is it a puzzle game?
That sounds like fun. What made you start playing it?
I would have thrown it in the washing. It was so cute.
That's disgusting.
That is pretty rare. Did you call for help?
That is terrible!  Did you have anything in you besides water?
I hate being embarrassed.  How embarrassed were your friends?
Oh no, I'm sure it happened to you. It's always embarrassing when that happens.
I am so proud! Congrats! That's so exciting!
That's great! Congrats! What college did she attend at college.
That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.
That's awful! Did you start treatment?
That's great! What age? Are you going crazy yet or is it just me moving out of my house? I moved out when I was a teenager and now I'm moving in with my daughter.
I know! It makes you think you're going to miss her even more!
That must have been scary! Did she get lost?
That sounds pretty scary. I would have been worried. I have been there myself.
That's good news!  What are the tests about?
That's good. I studied hard too.
ohh yeah, what song was it?
it does! what a great time to be young
I'm so so sorry to hear that.
That sucks.  Did he leave you a will?
I am sorry to hear that.  Are you taking her to the doctor?
That sounds awful. Did she end up in the hospital to be stabilized?
I love food and drink
I like skirt steaks.
That can be scary. Did everything turn out well?
Oh, that can happen for anyone.  I hope you found what you needed.
That sucks. Do you think if you quit drinking soda you can get used to the taste of it and stop craving after a few days?
I have heard that headaches can happen even when you quit, but I understand.
It should come back soon.
I've had that happen before too.
That's gross. Did you find any poop?
That sounds like a lot of toys.  I had to tell them about how many toys they had gotten.  I explained that we don't buy that many.  I also told that they got too old for some of those toys.
That was quite unhealthy of me.  I love eating but I know I should not eat that much.  I hope you sleep better.
That's crazy! I hope you get better sleep tomorrow.
That's kind of rude, right?
That is understandable, everyone has their crushes and you just have to move on.
That must've been terrifying. Did you tell the authorities?
Oh wow, you must be pretty smart and safe to go shopping without a buddy. I hope you're right safe and no one bothers you.
I have never held my kids.
That is very exciting! I am a mother and I feel the way you do when my kids are with their grandparents
Oh that, is it coming up soon?
Oh that sounds kind! I forgot about my own grandmas birthday a couple years back too. I called her and made her proud of course.
Oh no. Did you use it recently?
That's awesome! What kind paintball are they playing?
I would never do that. I'm scared of heights. How did you feel about that when it was done with your partner by your side?  Did you feel the rush of adrenaline at all?
That's awesome! What was it like up up?
oh wow i had no dogs, how old was it
That's too bad. It's not too hard though. You can adopt another.
I hate when people do this, it makes me so mad!
Oh no.  What happened?
That's really sweet. What did she give it to?
I love when that happens. You can never know too many things, but it brings back so many memories.
I've won many for my yard.
oh that's good! I've never won an award for my yard before. That's awesome you're the first! I'm so impressed. How did they decide who to give the award to? Was there a contest or a competition for the best?
That's awesome! What time? Are they going early morning or late?
It's good for us to get up off the ground, right?
that is awesome
That's okay, kids are kids.
That's awesome! I bet your daughter loves that. I hope you have fun together about that.
That's a sad thing. Have you found another watch?
That's awful.  It's never good when people give gifts to friends who haven the tendency to lose them.
That's pretty brave of her!
Oh that was a scary thing. I let her walk across a street by herself once. I didn't have to. She's 3 years old.
Yeah, it's a terrible accident.  She should be okay.  I hope she never has another.
I am so angry about that! I hope you can get your car back soon.
That sounds nice. Did she stay with you for a few nights?
That sounds like she really cared for you.
I am sure that was terrifying!
I hate it! I always get nervous too. I hope the worst! Did you feel it too badly?
That's terrible.  Was there something wrong that happened that day that prevented you from going on?
That is bad. Why did you screw it up.
That's really cool! Where was home?
that's really sweet of them to have you around.
Oh boy! What kind of skateboard is it for and are they for a street, transition or freestyle?
That's a good idea, I've got some rough pavement on the way to the skate park so I don't have a rough ride either.  It will be a lot easier for me too!
Yeah that was a bit awkward. She was so nice, but she didn the like me.
I think you should not take her to meet that person.
Oh that stinks. Did you find out why she is sickly now
oh, wow. that's nice of you. how long has she been ill for now though?
I am sorry to hear that.  Is it a friend of your?
Yeah, I heard that too! I have family too!
Oh that must have been a great gift. How old is it now
What a sweet story. I've been trying for years to adopt a cat, my family has one. I'm starting to think I'll be the first cat parent to go to jail for animal welfare.
oh thats no good at all.
What kind of car is it?
that sounds cool!  I love programming too
that sounds amazing
That's pretty cool. Did you feel nervous about that?
Oh, congratulations on the promotion, I'm happy for you!
that sounds awesome, what is the charity for?
that's nice of you to think that about that shelter.
That sounds like fun! Did you guys go on a cruise?  I'm not really a cruise type, but I'm sure you guys had a blast!
Yeah that's cool. What was the best trip experience for you?
That's so cool!
That's so cool! Where did you grow up in Alabama?
oh wow that is awesome
That is cool. How old are you?
It is hard to study for tests.
That's great. I hope you do well.
I'm happy for you! How old are you?  What kind of job was it?
Oh man I hate phone interviews, but glad it went well
It sounds fun. What movie was that of?
That's really interesting.
That's terrible! What are you going do now?
I hope you get it together
I am sorry to hear that.  How long were they left?
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you had fun on your girls' weekend.
It might have been a glitch.  I'm not sure why they won't just reinstall the OS!
I can't help it when it's slow and slow down.  It's slow enough that I don't want to do it anyway
That's really cool. I have never been to grandma's house.
That's cool, I wish I had more time to spend with grandma's too
Oh no! That is terrible. I hope you are taking care and not letting the illness affect you negatively. Is there anyone you are taking care of?
That is terrible, I've heard of that disease before.  I didn't realize it could be genetic.  Hopefully some research will find a way to prevent it.
I know the feeling!
That's okay. You did what you did because of your research and research says that. I don't put in money to lose. I put it in stocks to make money to spend on things I like.  I just lost some money, but it was a small amount of my overall investment and I don't do it for the money, but I do it because I am smart.  I will put it back and I will be back.
i bet you were very disappointed. did you get him back out there?
That must have been gross.  I'm glad he didn't do it on you.  Did you get him a diaper or something?
That's great! What language is it in your case. I'm learning Spanish right now.
That's awesome. I wish you the best of success in your new venture. I'm sure you'll do well.
That must've been fun!
oh man, i love skateboarding! I used to do it all the time, but now I am so lazy and not sure I want it back lol. I'm not sure I'll even want it again. I'm just going to stick with walking! I love walking, I can get anywhere I want!
That sounds like a great time to me!
That sounds fun!  What beach do you all go to?
That is good, good luck!
That is so frustrating. Did you get your suitcase back?
That's terrible.
That's awesome. I've been thinking I need an Apple Watch myself, but haven't gotten around to getting it yet
That sounds cool. I bet that it will make it easier to keep track of things.
I love talking about life with my boss
Yeah, sometimes it just happens in these kinds types of conversations.
That sounds good! Congratulations on getting a raise! What trip did you go?
That sounds good! What country did you go to?
I hate being in a tight spot.  Do you have a plan in place for finding another car?
That is awful, I hope that it goes for less than the price.
I understand that.  I am trying to save money for my future and I am okay to take help.  It is okay.  We are not in a bad financial situation at all.
oh, nice.  what kind of doll's did you find?
Yeah, those are pretty cool toys for kids to play around with
I have had those before, I have a MacBook Pro.
That must be frustrating. I hope your laptop can be saved.
That's nice. Did you have a fun day out?
That's so weird.
That sounds nice. Did you do anything special to celebrate?
That's great! What kind is the job in terms of what you'll do every day?  Is there something you like to do there?
That's awesome. What are your plans for tomorrow?
That's fun. I have two sons. I'm a big sports fan!
That is a good time to be a kid
that's great to hear! good for you!
that's good to have faith in your skills, good for you.
I hope you got it! What is the job about?
Oh yeah that's great! What do they offer?
Oh I'm so sorry! What a terrible thing for a pet store. Did anyone help clean up?
That is nice of the pet store owner. I would be a little scared if I saw my dog in such a sad state.
oh that was bad, what happened next?
That can be. What do you think happened in your mind when this happened to you?
yeah that's a good way of put it.  I guess it was stressful.
That's terrible, but I'm glad you're trying to get your doctor's advice on what's safe for you to do. I have arthritis and I have to be careful to not overexercice, and my doctor has told me to stop taking my meds if my doctor says I can.
I hope things change for you!
That's so great! I'm so proud!
that's great news!
Yeah that's pretty cool.  I bet she was a pretty good teacher.
Oh wow. That must've been very embarrassing.  I have heard that 3yrs olds can be a bit of a mystery box.
Oh that is a good kid. She is a very intelligent one too
I'm a Sega Dreamcast fan
That's pretty cool. I have never seen a console before. Did you play any games?
Yeah, I know, what happened?
Oh, wow, you're a little young, huh?
That's terrible, you should definitely talk to a therapist.  Maybe there's something going wrong that you're not aware of.
I've never heard of such a concoct. Was he joking about that one too?
You should thank him for that miracle!
That is a scary thought. What happened? Was it a cat bite?
That sounds scary. What kind of minor issue did it have?
That's horrible! Did you call for help?
That must've been scary. I hate being stranded on the side road. It's like they say, the closer to home the closer you get to the highway, the less likely you are to be in an emergency. But you never really think of it until something like this happens. I always thought it would be on the side of the road.
I am so mad about this. I am not going to miss a single day of work!
You're right, but if I don't get the money to clear my flight clearance, I'm going into jail!
I bet. Why?
That sounds like a lot to deal.
I've heard those are nasty.  How did she recover?
My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer. She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.<|endoftext|><|eot_id|>
Oh, that's terrible! How did you feel?
Oh, that is so sweet. You made it right back.
I know that feeling. I had to explain that to a group of college students. I think I could have explained it to my 2-year-old.
Oh man, I can't even. I would just tell them, "Hey, he's a politician, he's going to tweet."
oh, wow! what were those toys? i love to look through boxes of old toys
That's great! Did you remember where the box came from?
That's a long flight, but worth seeing the sights!
that was a long flight, but you were feeling unwell. i'm sorry.  What happened?  Was it bad food or something?
That sounds like fun! Where were they moving from?
That is cool! I have a degree and went to study abroad in Germany.
oh wow. that sounds amazing! did you win it?
Yeah, and I'm glad you won!
That is awesome! What kind are your plans?
That's awesome! I have friends coming over next year and we're going to be so excited to go!  I'm so jealous!
That is really impressive. What was the company?  What kind was it?
it sucks
That can be very hurtful. I'm sorry you had that to do. How did you handle it?
That happened to you as a kid?
That's great! What did you do to prepare?
that's good to have. unemployment can be tough.
Oh no. Did you have insurance?
That's horrible! What happened?
It sounds nice. What did they do?
That's so sweet of them! Did they plan a fun activity for you to celebrate your birthday as well?  I hope they had fun time with you!
That sounds awesome. What did he do?
That must have been exciting!
It is so annoying when that happens!  Did anyone call to see what happened to the breaker box?
That's terrible! Did you see anyone?
That is awesome! I bet you were super excited! What was the prize?
That's great. I don't win much.
I did that today.
Yeah that was nice of you.
That is unfortunate. I did not win either time I bought one either.
Oh well, I'm sure it was just a bad luck. I have never won anything in my life either.
I am not really into online games. What kind is that one?
I'm a Lord of the Rings Online player. It's a good time of day for a lot of my friends and I to hang out online.
I know right, it's like they just let it go on for so long! I am so sick and tired of how corrupt our politics is!  I think they are more concerned with lining up with their rich friends than with helping America!
Oh, that is a good reason to be mad, and the worst politicians in the world! I hope you will vote them all out next election
It happens to everyone. I lost a goldfish last year.
That's too long. Did you get a replacement one?
ohh thats no fun
That's awful. Did you get the interview?
That's terrible. Did you lose any data on it?
That's terrible. Did you save anything important before?
I know right! I'm not sure what they did.
Yeah, that can be frustrating.
I hope it wasn’t an infection! Do you have an eye doctor?
That sucks, maybe you should go to see a doctor
It was pretty cool! What was it about magic?
It's so cool!
That's great! What's the job about for you? I've been in the same job for over a year.
That's good news. What kind is it for you to interview about?
That's awesome! What did you get on it? Did it match up?
ohh wow that's good, good to hear.
That sounds like she is very kind.
That's nice of your mother. I have a very loving mother who always puts others' needs before my own.
That's crazy. How long did you live there? How old are your parents now?  How do you miss moving away from them?
Oh that sucks. What are you moving to?
I am sorry to hear that.  That is a terrible thing.  Hopefully, they found something else to cover the cost.
That sounds so sad. I am so proud that your child has an aunt who is so generous and caring. I am sure she was very sad too.
That sounds like a stressful day. Did you get any rest at all that day?
That is nice to hear. I hope everything stays that way
I bet. How long did he stay away? Did you stay busy while he was away?
I bet that makes it a lot better.
That must've been really hard.
That must have been a really tough day for them! I bet! But I'm glad they could see that and help out.  Did they have a car again after a few days? I hope they have a good relationship with their kids now!
I'm sorry for your grandma. I'm sorry for you.
That's nice. I hope you enjoyed driving by her old house.
Oh, that must've been annoying.
Oh that sucks.  Did you report it to the police?
That's so awesome. What kind is the story?
That's great! What kind was the big story?
I love that! How big?
oh wow. that's nice of your.
Oh that's so cute. I've always wanted to adopt. What kind of breed of cat is it?
That is so cool! I hope you have lots of cute cats!
oh wow that is very sad
Oh no! I'm so glad she was your sister. I hope she'll take you up for a drink soon to make up for it though. I'm a sister myself and I can get a little jealous when I think someone took care of us better than I did. I feel your way. It was a lot of an easy way to repay her, and it made me realize I've been so focused on my own family that I forgot I need to be taking good care of mine.
I love dog park days!
I hope he didn't get into trouble at the park!
I remember you forgetting things.
That was funny. It's always hard to remember when you agreed to do something but you don't follow up on it. I think we all do that sometimes.
I did that a year ago. I'm glad you're doing it. What school are you attending?
That's great. I hope you learn as you teach. What school are you going back for
That's really sweet. What kind was it?
that was so sweet, how old were they when you found it?
oh wow thats so fast
That's so awesome! It's always good when someone does that for you!
That's tough.  Do you think he will succeed?
I'm sorry.  How long have they both been dealing?
oh that stunk. what time was it?
That's good! Are they good drivers too?
That sucks.  I can see why you are so upset.  Was there a reason for it?
You must feel betrayed. It is so wrong of people to cheat others.
oh yeah high school is a nightmare
What did you do in high school
I'm sorry! How long have you been apart for? Did they move away?
That's so kind of you to be thinking of her. I'm sure it made your heart happy to think about.
Oh no! What happened? Did someone take your keys?
Yeah, you'd think it was funny but losing something you own like that would scare the heck outta me.
I'm sorry, did your roommate invite the friend over or did it by accident?
Oh, I see.  That is good.  He seems to be in a good place.
That's weird, did you tell her about the supervisor?
That's good that you played dumb and let your supervisor know. It was probably just an innocent misunderstanding, so it's possible that it was just an innocent mistake by your coworker.
Yeah, there are so many people out here who are struggling financially.
That's a lot. I'd want that too! What was it like selling them?
That's awesome! What kind of racing was that for you to be talking like gold!
that's great news, keep it up!
That's awesome! What was it?
that's really generous of them! did you have fun?
That's so cool! Did you show your kids those?
I am sure it was a good time back in your childhood days.
that's awesome, you're a brave person!
Yeah, that was really embarrassing. I would have just laughed it off and said something like "Mommy, you're so crazy!" but instead she just yelled at me for like an hour. It's like she thought she was the only one who could ride a horse or something.
I know right! It's like you're a rollerblading baby again
I love rollerblading but I understand why it might be scary.
I bet, how often
That sucks. I have to go to a lot of work functions myself. But I understand the sacrifices your making. I just wish he didn't go so much. It's hard.
I know how you're doing, but you should really work hard on this interview
That can be nerve wrecking, especially when interviewing.
That is exciting! Where are you moving to in this state?
That must be scary to start over, but it can also be a chance to start fresh and do new things!
I am so mad right.
Yeah that's terrible. I can't believe people are driving so fast and they don't see animals in their way.
That must have felt bad
Yeah tattooing sounds terrifying!
I bet! What's he done recently?  I love when that type thing happens!
That's so kind of your spouse, it's so nice that you appreciate him for that! I'm so lucky that my spouse loves me back!
I love Fridays. What's the reason?
That's great! Congratulations! What did they offer you in terms of pay?
I agree, music has the power of transporting us. It is so unique
I am sure he will be in good hands. I hope so too. I know it can be tough. I hope so for you too. It will take time.  I remember my grandma passing away. I hope so too. It was a tough time for me.
That's nice, I like to have a stuffed animal around sometimes too.
Oh man, I love those old stuffed animals! I used mine all the time when I was a little girl
That's terrible. I hope he's okay. I've been in some terrible accidents.
That sucks. I'm sorry for your loss.
That's crazy! Was he there to do anything?
Oh, that's a little too much to ask for permission, right.  I mean, I understand that you were busy, but maybe he could have just asked you first.  Maybe he was just a little too aggressive about his cable installation and thought that you didn't care.  I mean, I don't think I would have wanted to ask permission to enter my yard either, but that's not really what he did, right?
It's hard when people have to say their last words while they're still suffering from illness
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's been two years and I hope it's been a while.
That's great news! What shows are you binge-walking?
What shows is that about?
Oh wow. What kind were you in grad school in?
Yeah, it is tough.
That's awful. Did anyone laugh?
That's terrible! Did you trip again on your way back?
That sounds great.  Did he like it?
That is kind of gross.  I would rather he eat something else.  How long will it last him for?
That's a bumpy start to the meeting. I bet the boss was not pleased.
That's frustrating, did they apologize to anyone?
that's good!
That is awesome! Are you nervous about this meeting?
oh, i see. I thought you said you caught him?
That's a good point, but also, maybe he was trying to get back together or something. I hope so!
that's weird. I know it's weird when exes talk about other people. I think that's why.
That is good.  You guys are good friends.
It's good that you worked hard.
That's a good thing. You should get them on Monday. You deserve it after all you've been through!  You're going to treat yourself and go get some cake!
It is always sad when you find out something has happened that you thought was safe.
I am sorry. I hope he is okay.
I bet you do. Nursing homes can be fun places to visit.
it's a good experience. I used to be a bit of a shy kid but now I'm a big deal.
That's so cool.
That sounds like you guys like her baking a lot!
That's really sweet of you.  I'm glad you confided in your mom.  I have a secret too, but I'm too scared.
Oh wow! That must've been very special for you. What was it?
oh man that's so cool. what is he going for admission to?
Wow that's great news! I hope he has a long career ahead of himself.  What major is he interested in?
That must've been really tough.
I'm sorry you had to deal through such a difficult situation.  It's always good for you though to go into a depression and then come out stronger.  You'll get through it.  It's not the end.  I know that.
That's great! How old was he?
That's great! I'm glad to hear. I'm happy you're so happy for him. He's going to do great things! I'm proud too! He's always been so focused on his studies. He's a smart one too! I wish I had been more supportive when he first came to college, but I'm happy I could be more supportive now when I can see the impact.
Oh that's so nice! Where did you go?
I'm sure you did, you deserve it too. I'm happy I could remind myself of the importance. I'm going to go back this weekend and spend time on the beach again!
That's exciting! What is he doing?
That's so cool! I hope you two make up next weekend!
That's really sweet of him. What are you having planned?
I hope you both have a wonderful night and enjoy each other! I've been married 24 years and have to be careful not to spoil things!  I like to surprise the husband. It keeps him young at heart!  I love my wife, we've always been so good about keeping things fun and exciting.
Oh yeah, time flies. I'm not sure I'm ready yet. I'm a bit of an old schooler myself. But yes, time really goes fast. It's nice to reminisce about the past.
It's great that he's grown. I remember going back. I was so young.
I wish you were successful, that sounds good.
That's good to hear that! Congratulations!
That must have been scary! Did you call back the police?
Oh man, that sounds terrible. I hope it was just an innocent mistake, and not something more sinister going on there
That's so exciting. What's your granddaughter like?
It's okay, kids are worried all the time too. They're excited to go.
That can be frustrating.
Yeah i feel your pain, i always forget something and then have to scramble to buy it.  I once left my wedding rings in the car while we were driving to the wedding venue and they ended up getting stolen. I'm a little jealous of the rings. I'm going on a cruise in a few days so I will be sure to do everything in advance to avoid any mistakes
That's weird, did you guys not feel uncomfortable with it?
I bet she felt betrayed.
That's so scary! Did you call 911 or call the police?
That's a bit scary, did you ever see anyone else?
That's awesome. What a surprise. Did you get the gift you asked for?
That is awesome! Did anyone bring cake or balloons?
That's terrible, did you both work out of it?
That's terrible, did he say anything?
That would have scared you, right?
I am sorry but I think you might have had something else there instead. I would have noticed it.
That was very honest.
That's very kind of you, to think that.
That's awesome. What were their ages when they were born?
That's great to have two children. I hope you are enjoying them.
its tough
I agree completely with you there.
That's crazy! What kind was that car?
Yeah, traffic in LA can be pretty bad. But, at the end of the day, you're gonna drive anyway.  It's your job.
that sounds great. What did they do to help you lose weight?
That sounds like it is really helpful to have support, especially when you are trying to change your body.  Do you have any tips on how they help with losing weight?
I would be too.
I'm glad you were successful.
That's great! Christmas memories can bring back such wonderful times. What kind did the old cards hold special for?
I don't know, but I like throwing cards away, but then I think about the people.
That sounds like a lot!
Yeah, they were like a bunch of wild animals.
I know that. It was a bit icy.
I bet that hurt! Did you hurt yourself too bad?
I do, what's it about?
I understand.  You should probably call her.
Oh. I hope everything goes okay.
Oh no, that's terrible.
That's really cool!
that makes sense.  i used to be the nervous type when it comes driving.  but over the years, it gets easier and easier.  the important thing is to stay safe and follow the rules of the road.
That's nice that you're taking care of her and trying to help her. I'm glad to hear!
Yeah that's great news! You and her are going to be great driving together soon
That can happen to us too.
I hope everything gets cleaned.  I hope everything gets put back.  I hate mess
That's so kind of him. He's really good at that. He always looks out for me.
that sounds good
it's so nice that they've been friends for that long.
I completely understand that. I've been there too. But, at the same time, sometimes it takes a while. I'm happy for you. I wish you and your friend well.
That's great! I'm glad to hear that. I've always been proud to be the parent of a smart kid.  I'm glad he's going where he wants. It's not every kid who is going on a good path. You must be so happy to hear this.  I'm sure it's going well for you.
I'm sure they do. They're smart and talented young kids. It's good to appreciate them when they're young.
That sounds like fun! Where are you going? Are there new foods you are trying out on the job?
That's great! Are you nervous?
It is very sad.  I have heard stories of people losing their family in different countries.
I'm sorry to tell. I hope you were able to cope with your grief. I know I did. I hope you too.
It really isn, not. We had to get her to the church early and get her to the funeral.
emy grandparents helped me get to the US airport and to New York airport
That's awesome! What game are it?
that's cool, I bet you can play it on the go now!
That must be tough.  I have a few family that live close by me and it's hard.  It seems like everyone has their own.
that is such nice of you to think that. I know it's hard. I'm just trying to be there for her as much as possible. I'm not sure she knows I know, but I think she knows. I know how hard this life can be. I know how much I miss my mom.
I know how you feel. My neighbor's dog is getting a new dog walker!
What video games do they have up there?
That's so cool! Where did he or she come from and when was the visitation period?  Did you have any good time together?
That's pretty rare! Did you guys hang out for a long time or just for an hour or so? What kind of things do you guys do in your free time?
That must've been scary. Did you try to save it?
kes of doubt, i was scared!
I bet that felt very lonely.
Oh wow that's really sad.  What happened to the baby bird?
It's normal to have some anxiety about graduation, though.
oh thats so bad, how old are u?
I forgot a few times too.  What did you tell your mother in?
Yeah, that's why you have to make it a habit to remind each of them every month or something.
That's okay, you did what everyone else did.  It is what you wear to the party that matters, not what you wore to the party.
That is so cool. I wish you could go on more of these.
I bet they were creepy. Do you remember what they said?
Oh, that's cool, I used to have nightmares about being chased by animals
That's terrible! How long were they stealing from?
that's good to know that you know what's right and what's wrong with stealing
Oh wow! What was the theme of your trip?
That's really interesting. I think meditation is one thing you have to try out for yourself to believe it. It takes a lot of willpower to try to mediate.
It's always fun to get a break from school/work/etc
I love the parky too!
I bet! Are you a college major?
That's great news! I'm so happy for you!
That sounds exciting! What kind is it about cooking?  Do they have any tips for beginners or do you already cook a lot of dishes yourself?  I'm always looking to try new things out!
I am not much of Chinese food either. I do know that I have a lot of different cultures to explore, and I am eager to try out the new cookery.
That's pretty cool, what kind did you witness?
Wow that is a great way of putting it.  Did you feel like a rockstar watching?
That must be so exciting!  What's he looking like?
That's great!  I'm sorry his mom and baby are going to have to go back to the hospital soon.  I've heard those are the worst.  I hope he stays healthy!
That's so true. She's always there for you, and that's what matters.
That is a very optimistic view of the world. I think a lot of people are very pessimistic about love and relationships nowadays.
That's the worst. Did you go back for it? I don't think that's the right way to handle it
Oh, that was funny.
I would have called and spoken to someone.
I know that feels good to not pay rent
That must've saved you a lot of money.
That is so lucky you caught it right on the way you did it.
Oh wow. What kind is she driving?
Yeah, that would be so kind of your bestestestest friend
Oh, that is terrible! What did they take from you for it?
Oh, that is terrible. I would have done something the other night if I was in a similar situation. I hope your friendship is stronger than your actions. I would say that is the most regretful part of life, the regret over your actions.
I'm sorry, I hope everything worked well for him.  I know how much I wish my dad would still with us.
That's great to hear.  I'm sorry for your family.  I know you can handle tough times.
That was the good old days. When people actually talked to each other.
Oh, yes, life was better then. I miss the good times.
That must have been hard for you to deal with. How did they do once you got back them?
What cats?
i had never thought of having a 5.5 5.5 inch penis. i was shocked. i wasnt sure what that was
oh, nice! congratulations on that
That's terrible! Did someone steal them?
That's funny, do you still swim?
I did that last week. It made my milk go bad faster!
oh that was gross!  I hate drinking a whole gallon of milk at one time
I would too! What kind was it? A girl or a girl with long hair?
That sucks.  I would tell you to go talk to him.  Let's talk it through.
I know exactly how you mean. They think they are in charge of everything and can't even leave me to make my decisions on my own.
I can understand that, but I think you should be grateful for the work! You're probably doing great for the company!  Don't be afraid of a good manager! I used one like this last month, and he was terrible! I asked her what I had done wrong, and she said I didn't do anything!
I had teeth that got cavities and had a dentist fix it.
I had them for the first two years of my marriage and had them for the rest and now they are so thin and weak. I wish they were stronger
That happens to a lot of us. What triggers them?  Do you ever think you have something paranormal?  I have a pet shiverbug and I have a bad case of them sometimes.
That's a weird feeling, did you check with someone about it or try anything to help?  I hope it was just your imagination running away!
That can happen to you too, but it's easy just to not work on it and just keep up the good habit
That's great to hear you are doing well!
that's pretty cool, what was it like?
Yeah, it's always a thrill.
That's great! Life is full of challenges, but it's great to be happy about it!  I'm happy right now too! I've been working hard for the last 50+ days and am on the verge of getting a promotion at work!  What a great feeling that is going on!
That's cool. What kind is your album about?
That sounds good. What are you excited about?  Do anything in particular?
That's a really cool idea. What are you interested in learning more about?
That is really interesting. I like to play music while I medate
That's really interesting. How do you find time for meditation?  I'm new at meditation myself, but I've heard it's not about finding time, it's about making time.
That's cool, I used to be lonely all the time when my parents passed away.
I am sorry that you are going through that.  You will find happiness and peace
I like to let things happen.
Yeah, things happen and you've just got to trust that everything is okay. I'm still trying, to be honest!
That's awesome! How much muscle mass?
Yeah, it takes time and patience, you can see progress in 6 months
That's exciting. Where you going to go?
It is nice here in Florida. I am not too bad with camping either. I have gone camping many times with my kids.
oh wow thats a lot, what happened?
I hope it didn't burn down too bad. Was there fire damage?
It is good that the tire place was there to fix the tire.
that's so lucky. how long did it take to get replaced?
That sounds very sad.  I have never seen that before.  How did you help the cat?
That sounds like quite an ordeal.  I would have been very grumpy about it.  I'm glad you were able to get it unstuck.
That makes sense. I don't know if I believe, though. I am not sure I am.
That is very good point you have. I am trying to deepen my connection with God right now.
ohh man, how often do u take a breather in the day?
Yeah, that is what happens when I am feeling suffociated
You were popular?  That's interesting.
Oh I understand that. I think everyone has their own way.
That was really scary.  I bet it was hard to get used too
That's awesome! Ice bath sounds like a great exercise for a tough workout. Did you feel cold afterwards?
that's so true! I'm trying my best too!
Yeah, I eat a lot of yogurt too.  I'm trying to cut, and it seems like the more I eat, the more muscle growth I can do.  But, it can also make me fat!
I agree. It's like they are just trying to make a quick buck. I don't like to shop from places like Best Buy or any other. They always charge a ton more.
That is true. It is like they are a parasite.
That sounds kinda funny. Did she laugh?
That's terrible.
Yeah, I love them too.
I love their songs! They are so fun and silly!
Oh wow! Congratulations! I bet you felt so proud! What state is it?
Oh man. I got mine about a month before I went off on a road tour with some of the other drivers on the road with the big trucks.
That stuns, how could they do that?
That sounds awful. Did you report the theft to the bank?
That can get so boring.
I used to like those types of things.
that's a lot
I can't believe it either! It is so rude of him
Yeah I'm a bit disgusted. I don't know much about it but I know some friends have been taken advantage by some fake religious organizations
I agree completely.  It's so easy for people who want to take money and property and do harm others to get people in line and do their dirty work.
Oh yeah! Do you think you can do good on that one?
I hope you do well!
That's terrible! I would have looked for you right then and there!
That's too bad. I've had my car keys stolen before and had them stolen again, and I don't like that one bit at all
that's awesome
That's crazy! You should really get it all done!
i hope your roomie is okay.
Oh, that's so scary!
That is a bad habit to have, how did you stop?
That's a good one. Did you get caught or not get in trouble about it?
I am so excited! How long are your due?
That sounds great!  I am so excited!  How old were you when you were born?
I agree. What do people do to celebrate Christmas these days though. It's just not the Christmas I grew up on.
I agree. Christmas is the best time of year.
That sounds really wild. What happened next?
ohh thats weird
That sucks. I have hit cars before.
That is so sad. I don't know if I would be so upset about that if I didn't know how to fix my car and get to my job. I don't know what the consequences of hitting my own car could have. I'm just really worried.
Oh wow! What was the candy?
Oh my god, I've always loved that candy!
It's good to hear she's getting better, that's always good news!
Oh my, that must have been a long time. I bet.
ye that would be fun. What did he show me?
That is pretty impressive.  How long has it been?
That's too bad.  Did you have plans?
It's always best to be honest and let your employer know you're not available for that time.
I agree.  Life is always a gift.
I do think so too!  I have been so good lately.
Oh wow, that's creepy.  How big was it?  Did you kill it or leave it alone?
I know what that means! I had one once in my apartment, and it was a real doozeray thing! I donkey know, maybe I'll go out to get some food for dinner tonight, and just leave it at home for the cockroach to go and eat all the food for.
Oh, good luck! What are the most important questions on the exam?
That's good. You're going to do just fine.
