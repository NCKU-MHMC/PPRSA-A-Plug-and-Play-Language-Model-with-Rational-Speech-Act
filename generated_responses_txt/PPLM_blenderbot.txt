oh my god that sounds so scary , how old were you then ?
i feel so sorry for you and tell you how sad it is .
that ' s awesome ! i ' m really hoping so . i want to know how that went .
my car was very shaky and it almost rained all night but i am okay thankfully no one was hurt and i got a cab so i was able to drive home but that night i didn ' t have anyone to drive with . thank you so diligence
do whatever you can , and get over it . you both will always be together together no matter what
thats wonderful to hear . you both must have been strong with each other . maybe you can get away to see each other soon ?
whar is happening to be there ? will you be having an enjoyable time in the event ?
what a wonderful first date ! i ' m happy for you !
that ' s very sad ! but it ' s hard not to worry about it . your parents are probably just like me and it will be fine .
i feel like this kind of thing shouldn ' t happen , but in this day and age we have to go through all kinds of these treatments for babies .
are you a doctor ? or a nurse ? how sad . please be so kind for him up- - and what did you do ?
oh poor thing ! how long did it take you to sing ?
how sounds like he has a good position to fill , hopefully he ' ll find one soon ! hopefully his husband has a good - full time job .
that ' s so sad to hear , i ' m sure he will find one soon ! it sucks not having a side job , but i hope he gets a good one soon !
oh my goodness ! how exciting ! do you know who that was ?
oh boy . . . maybe you should start by teaching yourself first
you seem very excited ! are they coming back to visit soon ?
congratulations , i ' m happy for you . when are you headed back ?
oh no , was he okay ? or is he just being lazy ? i ' m sorry that was very bad of him , i hope you guys learned from it
i ' m sorry to hear that . that sounds terrible . there are ways to get in trouble if you dont want to tell the truth .
i better go back and return it lol , that is a rip off
i ' m sorry , i ' m still looking for the tv myself . maybe you can buy a side hustle from a friend . or get a lemon or something .
you ' re a loyal and honest friend , and still a good friend . you know how that goes , and it ' s not a reason to be scared or hesitant about changing your partner ' s over the years . as long as he ' s a good friend , i ' m sure he ' ll let you guys know what ' s going on . you probably should work on it as it is , but i say stay confident in your relationship .
well , that was very thoughtful of you . was she honest with you about it ? i am sure if you tell her , she will feel better about the situation .
i am sure it will be a lot of fun . have you tried to feed it diet and exercise ?
yes oh baby sleeping ! that must be so awesome ! i bet ! that sounds like a dream to have a baby !
awww that really stinks . what are your default friends@ ?
that ' s interesting . do you have a good friend group group ?
it ' s very frustrating when children seem to refuse to learn , especially when they act so imresponsible . parents can really drive you insane when they get so mad .
they just want to get what they cant in order . . . no matter how bad they do . . they dont care
oh no ! i would have been terrified ! what was it
oh that ' s cool . what happened ? did everything work out ?
i ' m glad it went well and it reminded you of your past experiences ! what happened next ?
oh yes ! did you cry , cry , laugh , cry , cry ?
i have been there my friend . you will always love your child . i have 3 and only one on my hands .
my wallet has been through been through . i know how you feel
oh i actually know what you mean ! when in the nick of time is the last day of payday . .
what was the incident ? i am so glad to hear that .
that ' s so great , i can ' t imagine how thankful you are for her . what is your favorite thing about the incident ?
wow , how interesting . you must be very multi faceted
i agree , it is great how you can listen to your feelings , mine is always very directly opposite
very nice , how old are you ? before you know it , you ' ll be on your final destination .
i am still so happy for you ! it is such a wonderful surprise .
yeah that does sound lonely . do you try to hang out with other girls ?
oh boy , it is just like losing a mate . it is only when they see you that you are lonely , does it make you feel better ? i would try not to think about it too much
not silly at all ! i bet that is a good time of the year haha
as a still student of git- can you tell me a bit about this experience ?
is it your first time reading any of your new documents ?
wow . . . i am so sorry how did that happen ? i would have been really annoyed . sorry about that .
i bet it was ! where did you visit ? how far away was it ?
i ' ve i know that feeling , although i ' m an outtie .
oh my gosh , have you used your full force from this conversation ? have you two been friends for long ?
she got us all together with video cameras and video chatting . but for me , it was different as she was very young . i ' m older , i don ' t really have that experience , but i have my own parents to blame
do oh well , sometimes we all do stupid things in life . it is still a good thing to look back on
have you felt awkward about it since then ? or has it changed your life ?
that is so sad . : ( but you are very fortunate that you found out when facebook first came out .
oh congratulations on your new worker ! i bet you are a great uncle or aunt
what do you write about ? i never read an english book before .
honestly , i don ' t know anyone in my life . i ' m just a pretty introvert , trying to break the habit of setting myself in a good place . i ' m thinking about becoming a pianist , hopefully with good practice .
do how big is the baby ? how many has it grown ?
that ' s strange . . . maybe it ' s because she ' s moving
oh how long did you run for ? did you train for it ?
have you been running a marathon since before your first one ?
well done nice story ! i must admit that i do not know what a shame shame that would be ! i know that sounds amazing but what a great achievement , too ! is there a eta in darvanese marathon ?
where oh how cool ! was it a famous person ? if you don ' t mind me asking .
oh , that is so sad , i hate when that happens . what happened ?
bullying is a horrible thing to have happen on the side of the kids
i agree . sometimes bullying can be very emotionally and physically tense . however , i feel that sometimes kids are just exposed to a lot of trauma from childhood and need therapy to cope with it . that ' s why some parents make it a point to avoid bullied kids
oh no that is so sad . was the cat okay ?
good on you ! how is your daughter now ? i could use a little cat guy to belonged to me .
oh how exciting ! how long have your kids been married ?
what i love it ! tucson has a lot of cool hills and things to do there , so that ' s fun ! but you ' re right , it was so beautiful !
oh thats nice . did you guys have good conversation ?
oh my goodness ! i hope you guys were able to go somewhere and meet up then ! is he happy ?
i actually really like it . it makes it organized and i love it
i love to organize my house ! i ' m kind of a messy person , but i find myself very few episodes of my shows . i can ' t stand the idea of having to change all that stuff .
that ' s not a good habit . have you ever sent an email to them ?
do you send nudes to your husband or girlfriends ? i send them to my husband , and he does the same thing .
oh , how come i hope you two didn ' t fight for too long
oh no , why were you guys mad ? i ' ve never had an argument with a temper before .
that ' s pretty neat ! what makes you so lonely when you first moved out of the country ?
oh wow ! well that sounds like a wonderful adventure ! i ' m happy you got to travel with the baby , and congratulations on your well wishes !
oh , i know ! that is so annoying ! i never know what to expect when it comes to people being knowledgeable about developing a skill 3 " . is it because it ' s too tough for them to use their skills ?
i am just a homebody . i am afraid i will fail again , i am just so disappointed in the past .
you don ' t see it like that , they are human and if you treat them the way they treat you , they will eventually adapt i believe .
that ' s great that you guessss . your husband must have felt sorry for you . sometimes he has to make his own mistakes , i understand . i hope you have something in mind for his appointment
oh man . that ' s very sweet . i bet your son is beautiful !
really well done . i hope i can be trusted someday when my son ' s going to be a man , he will learn to look for those better looking girls .
that ' s a good point ! i wish i would be more careful with my health , i always get too scared .
yeah , that ' s so true . no one can take care of you while in a situation like that ! it ' s good you are reaching out to others so you can try to be there for them !
that must be a bittersweet feeling . i love the time mine was little lol
oh yes . i understand what you mean . they are adults , but they are getting old . i try to remember how they grow up with each new phase .
i know what that means , i am sure you looked great !
sometimes you just have to start with a simple solution , keep at it ! but don ' t let too much confidence stop you from trying !
what do you guys do for ourselves ? do you enjoy it ?
congratulation , that is really great news . i also work for myself and i ' m glad to hear you ' re able to secure secure money . not too many people do so now

what is kasep ? i ' m not familiar with well explaining just answered supply of space . how did you do ?
do did you know how you felt hearing blind people play guitar or being able to read music ?
thats really cool . i love the blind man story .
oh no ! i am so sorry to hear that . i hope it gets better soon . are you able to get it fixed ?
do you have a car ? what are you waiting for the car to start ?
how on earth did you find out that ? that ' s crazy .
wow that is an amazing achievement ! congratulations on your son ! i also heard if you have twins you can play for them in the halloween parks at your house after they grow up !
what are you saying ? ! ? ! are you afraid ? !
you better believe it ! ! ! you might be dreaming ! ! !
wow , you have a really good friend then ! any idea what they will be doing in prison ?
the oh my lord . . that is a terrible do or do not situation . that makes me scared to death ! did you ever find him ?
golf ely what an exciting event ! if i ever lived to be into that kind of activity , i would be a player at every age . what did he want to do after he finished ?
omg congratulations to you both . how did he make it big ?
that ' s exciting ! i am sure he will get ready for it in the next 4 months
that ' s awesome ! where is he going to come here ?
you are a brave where you stay , how have you been ?
oh my goodness . . . i ' m so glad you escaped the opportunity you said the word diamond , man . diamond is nothing to steal ! diamond is more than just a material object . give it back to the man !
oh , my goodness , what has omar zhao done for you ?
it ' s always nice to thank god , we all have moments of kindness . we can also use them to give back to him
oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that . did anyone do anything to get yourself hurt ?
oh my , i bet it wasnt too funny to read . i can see why it was
lol ! i used to listen to old but good old days music .
i hear you . i was an hippebox kid , but i ' m kinda broke now : ( what ' s your secret ?
that is good for you for being honest with the customers and keeping the food healthy !
what a beautiful story ! thank you for your thoughtful and useful response . i am sure your dog was proud of you .
have you recently started saving up to be qualified to give free stuff to anyone ?
i do i agree , i try to do as much as i can . i get that you are very fortunate to have someone like that
do you have a baby in the future ? if you ' re ready , you can ask .
replace it with voilent- without him you will never know . maybe replace it with another sung sung sung sung good boy
lol , that is hilarious ! i bet it did not end well for the kid .
oh my god that is amazing , i have only seen that before but it sounds like it is a really long story
i ' m sure that means she was pregnant ! ! !
dont worry , your not alone , my friend . i know how you feel
hm . . . . odd , maybe it ' s because he doesn ' t have a strong backwater job like your dad ?
wow , that ' s very impressive . he must be doing pretty well then . my parents did not homeschool too , i was so sad . but i guess most parents do it because they have no one to support them , so they just assume they ' re alone . it ' s kind of sad that parents are so limited in their ability to raise their kids . i don ' t blame them for that .
i was home schooled too , but i was not told to get out of the home . it was so sad and i now live paycheck to paycheck and the stress of a home school education is very consumerist
oh , that ' s very interesting . did you find out the lied ?
how come the ex didn ' t come forward ? was it a big deal ?
oh , yeah i can see that , kids these days seem to always take everything into their parents hands and make it seem like they do something wrong - like cringe at first sight ! they are so quick are unbefore and sixth sense for their abilities ! it ' s really hard not to feel jealous , i had to tell my parents when i failed a drug test , my basketball team was not in the playoffs , i felt like i was the worst player ever . . .
oh , that is awful . i am sorry you had to leave . are you going back ?
ugh . i can relate . i ' m a mom so i used to be the original owner of the school : (
that stinks . well i am sure you will be able to make it up to them soon .
thats really good of them ! i actually homeschooled my little kids too . at least you are older . how did it go for you ?
that stinks . if it wasn ' t available you can ' t have it . at least public schools don ' t leave kids with home school like they used to .
i am so sorry that he passed . that is so sad . i have always loved her husband and him , both of which both passed away in 2008 .
i ' m sorry to hear that . it ' s nice that he was of his old age , though . he was an awesome movie guy . i do hope they will make it into a movie .
what happened to survive ? why do you feel better ? i don ' t even know what that means .
that ' s so cool . you sound like an amazing person to buy you something like that !
oh my god ! that is terrible ! you must be so disappointed . what did you do to make your friend feel better eachother from this news ?
oh my goodness . i hate to hear that . if she is going to cheat on him then she should broken up with him first .
that is so sad . did he get hurt at all ?
that is terrible , no punishment . i ' m sorry that happened to you , maybe you can try and explain it to him .
thats great ! you must have worked really hard . do you know what you want to do after your degree is done ?
oh man , that is amazing ! ! congrats again ! you are so lucky ! that must be such a huge accomplishment . it is good to hear that you worked so hard !
that is great . i ' m sure your new job is amazing , but that job is a real doofus !
yay ! congratulations ! ! ! what are you excited about ?
that ' s great ! that determination and sacrifice is a lifesaver ! congratulations !
how what did you do ? did you end up trusting her again ?
haha that sounds like a cute name . i can relate . i was always scared to swim when i was little so i don ' t blame you ! i ' m also blame myself when my kids do that .
wow that is very brave of you ! what kind of music are you listening to ?
yeah , i ' m an introvert , sometimes i just miss the good old days .
what game is it ? i need to know ! i want to get some of that money !

hey that ' s great . that ' s great news . what do you do now ?
sounds like you really did a great job . i am sure you will get that job
hey , you can always start again , am hoping you will fool around with the at least
oh no ! i ' m sorry , i hope you do have a good friend that can help you out . just relax and you will do fine !
hey have you gone to an chat ? maybe you can set up a disclaiming age for me ?
that is so awesome , be happy for me ! i am still in college and am barely starting my master ' s exam .
thats great . good for you . and congratulations on becoming independent ! its all about strength .
congratulations ! that ' s amazing ! you must have worked hard . what about yourself changed ?
oh man , what did you do ? ! did you tell him ?
that sounds like a little awkward ! did you ask him how it was going ?
oh wow , how do you feel about that ? i hope he gets it !
i bet he will . has he lost it a while ?
you should be , and don ' t drink too much and stay alone next summer
oh goodness . i would have been too . i am glad that you are ok
that ' s pretty great ! congratulations . i ' m sure you ' ve been it feels great .

i ' ve never played that one , but i heard of it , is it like other and runescape ?
oh yeah ! that game was so good ! i remember spending so much time on it . i loved it .
i have never been there . are you talking about the one near me ?
no i haven ' t been to that place before . i do like my own eating there at least once a year though . what is it that you eat there that much ?
yes ! i would imagine it would be like having a dream about somebody rescue you . is it like that ?
i have not , i ' ve never had one but i want to ! what was it about ?
no , i haven ' t . but i hope to some day !
i haven ' t rode a roller coaster . i am familiar with the movement of the fingers tho . and also when i was a kid . you give me more thoughts on it .
what was his response to that ? did you say something ?
o wow . . . . i don ' t know what you ' re quite on the road . so much to learn in this delicate balance of relationship and online onship . and you seem very confident in your abilities . have you taught him to respect you ?
are you going on vacation ? i ' m sure you will be fine . just bring everything you need in case you need to go somewhere .
oh that sounds beautiful , but i ' m sure they will enjoy kazakhstan would be a nice place to go once you ' re back . but it ' s good that you have parents there , you can start saving up for these next few weeks .
how did she find the new job ? how do you know ?
what a wonderful life for her , good for her . it ' s excellent that she found a new job !
you i can ' t wait it is not as sad as how much more room for teachers next year . i see more charter schools and public eluget schools around the corner !

you made the right move . most people don ' t realize how much it hurts at first .

what happened next , may i ask ? is it a big deal ?

she was probably busy trying to fool you , like the one you just asked for !
oh man , how ' d you get it ? did you have a good feeling ?
domino ' s is a great restaurant ! i ' m a huge fan of their food !
it was pretty great . im feeling pretty good about it nyu . . how about you ?

i hope you got the job : ) go on . .
what kind of job are you hoping for ? just one ?
did she graduate up studying ? i bet you miss them a lot .
it sounds like it has gotten easier as you get older . maybe you can start a new chapter in your life that is normal for you and move forward with it .

what happened ? did anyone see it ? did you say anything to them ?
they should not though , its a shopkeeper and dangerous to do that and its 100% on them
oh no , that is bad , why don ' t you just tell them you have a heavy list ?
i hope so , good luck . have you gone in for a test yet ?
i am so very sorry that you had to go through that . you must be so worried !

i ' m sorry to hear that , i have to imagine you really don ' t want to hear that !
i am so sorry that you were so nervous ! i know you will get another job soon !
yeah , i hope so . it ' s really hard to keep my head up though . i know i should really make it up to them , but i feel like it just adds to the longer term relationship i have .
i am just sad that my coworker is one of the worse working people around . he is the best one and i wish he was in charge .
awww . i hope you will have time to teach him a lesson .
aww , that ' s kind of sad . what is his name ?
i stole from the store as well as the owner . it ' s a big difference .
the problem is , that the magazine said it was not his doing it . it was his , and the magazine said it was his . i ' m not sure what would qualify as wrong .
where did your dog go ? did you find him ? i have a friend who 100 dogs we have each and he would love to know where he went
that ' s terrible . did you find it ? did you have to take it to the vet or did someone take it ?
oh that ' s so exciting ! how exciting for you . what is she doing there ?
do that is exciting , is it your first child ? if not , what will she be doing after she returns ?
oh ok , i understand now . thank you ! but it ' s still very inspiring that you have done this . i am sure it will go over very well
i think you just need to go to a pray away doctor and quit this ship .
yes , i ' m very proud of her . it ' s my first years in school and i already love the job not too long ago !
it is a big accomplishment . my mom has already had her medical school starting in late in her life . she will be starting her own family soon .
that ' s so great . it must have made you appreciate the compassion and sense of security
i feel how you feel i have been there before , you can tell your self as a result of your hard work to help others
sounds pretty scary , hope it was nothing too bad ? and i ' m sure the weather was just fine ?
what a nice neighbor you have ! he sounds like he has all the right amount of confidence in you !
oh wow , how did he reach out ? ! what did he do ?
did she ever have a song to her song that she release that you could really tell you ?
oh , what happened to your time ? how long ago did you try to buy something exciting ?
it does . it ' s a wonderful time . it is nice to have a time to spend with family and friends . what did you love the most ?
oh , you ' ll probably think that soon . do you think they are still in the class ?
oh my god . that ' s awful . i am so sorry that you have been through that . do you have a security camera ?
oh no ! did you ask them to replace it ? i think they should have called the police .
who knows , perhaps they will . it ' s quite late find they will surely find them !
oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that . did something go wrong with the interview ?
oh no . i am sorry to hear that . keep trying though .
that must have been painful to see , but remember how cute it seemed to look
i cried for weeks ! but that is ok because i am sure you are not a fat little guy now !
that is so annoying ! have you talked to your doctor about that ?
my cat does the same thing to my face too . have you tried talking to her ?
oh really , what will you be doing on vacation ? !
i hope you have a good time ! i ' ve never been before .
oh boy , did you have to go back to your friend ' s house ?
oh my gosh , that is really unfortunate . why do you feel ashamed for doing that ?
congrats ! what was the prize ? if you don ' t mind me asking .
that is great . congratulations ! you must be really good at it .
that is annoying . can you say anything about it ? have you told him to stop ?

oh that ' s fantastic ! i bet that was really exciting !
oh gross ! i ' ve never seen that before ! what did the baby do ?
woah ! how odd ! that must have been pretty wild .
its always tough to get confident . its better to have confidence in your work and put forth the work
i ' m sure you ' ll find someone soon enough .
what are you worried about ? is it something that you are worried about ?
whats the special occasion for this game ? have you played before ?
you can always become rich ! just get on the right time and commit to it ! just keep your fingers crossed .
i guess its good to try and find ways to be able to pay your bills as soon as possible , to live a healthy life . its the best way to learn if you can .
i agree . i try to not give up on the fact that i ' m male because i have not had anyone else to lean on . and that makes me a little bit sad .
what ? ! you must be pretty young to be in that predicament .
oh that is sad . maybe you could still call up a friend or family to come buy you out ?
you must be so lonely . i ' m sure it must be hard to be stuck at no mine site .
they sound like you are very helpful , i ' m glad you had a pleasant experience .

when yeah , sometimes . i see them now and then . i used to be able 2 years old . now they ' re like 2 1year old and one wants to go fly off the bus
yes , they start talking about video games which throws me off . is that as bad ?
what did you do ? did you graduate with masters in welding ?
it ' s important to take care of others but at the same time don ' t be discount . don ' t feel too down about your luck . they have to feel that when they are little and need it .

oh , what subject ? sounds pretty exciting , what are you studying ?
oh my god ! it sounds like you are going for a masters degree in shed development ? i wish you the best of luck !
wow , that sounds exciting ! i ' ve never been to the zoo .
that sounds really cool . i ' ve never been to the zoo .
wow , thats rude ! do you think you ' ll be okay ?
i don ' t think it is the best idea . there ' s no need to put yourself in their position .
me then ? which one will you give the most spoons please ?
that is awesome ! it is always good to work on that because once you have a place to live and your kids are in school or after school you are more productive as a whole and it can feel like you are finished too .
i know , right ! it ' s really tough to see how much something can be paid now . and how much the beans have cost since yesterday
that ' s great that you had a person to help you out ! prices have steadily increased a lot since the old days and it ' s even harder to find your own clothes nowadays .
how many you have ? which ones do you watch ? a bike through a mud is always fun .
cool ! i have never been a street racerer myself but would love to try it out .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ? i ' m sorry to hear that .
that ' s amazing ! congrats ! i have a family member who ' s gone through a similar struggle and i can see how it will make you feel great .

oh wow , do you think you did well ? or will you be unable to retake it ?
do haven ' t you thought it ' s probably going to be fine ?
oh , no . what happened ? do you know anyone that you hate ?
have you been friends with any of his friends ever ? it happens to all of us .
im really sorry to hear that , i hope you feel better now ! it sucks not being able to see them often .
oh man that ' s terrible . why did you have to move away ?
i understand , when i go to a restaurant to eat its always the worst , i bet i will never go back .
well can ' t you return the favor . you are such a naughty boy . what do you think you will do this year ?
oh how fun ! i have been there before too , it is so nice to see old memories come back .
yes i am close with them yes . i just had a little surprise meeting them on the spot during the summer but other than that they are not in the picture .
that must ' ve been exciting to look through ! did you find any children ' s pictures ?
man i know so many memories like that have made me so nostalgic . memories are very nice to have
wow , that ' s pretty scary . where were you when it happened ?
i was okay . it was a little bit dangerous though . my family went through a complete guess as to how we would ' ve gotten there . we put things back together eventually
oh no ! is it for a future surgery ? how was it went ?
are you ok ? was it fine ? how did the results go ?
what are they doing now ? did they finish ? how long is they working on it ?
i have never built one ! but i ' ve heard of it but never to disclose myself !
oh no , do you think you ' ll be ok ?
awww that is such a sad loss . . . . i am sorry . i have always wanted to go through something like that .
what was the person doing there ? were they just sitting there watching you ?
that sounds very frustrating ! i hate waiting for medical supplies . i feel like a chicken there . they say the patient should be by themselves , if they want to do the patient .
that is so annoying . hopefully he learned his lesson and isn ' t a jerk now .
oh no ! hopefully you will know what you ' re ready for ?
good luck for you . you are confident and excited , but your hard work will pay off . you sound prepared !
that ' s so sweet , orange beach is really fun to visit !
no i haven ' t ! is it really that awesome ?
oh wow , that ' s adorable ! were you happy ?

not much i can do really , i dont really have an app for that . i guess just have to be abide by my neighbors rules . i do love to tell them to get out and i don ' t really get around to that yet .
i yell with them until they want to go outside and then come up with their excuse
oh i ' m sure you can move . maybe ask them to tone down the traffic light and also get a down light on . that way you won ' t be trying to influence them any more defensively and wont get used to their noise .
have you been heard anything about the suspense ? i have a friend who has done hydrochillax and operate and she heard nothing but good things !
