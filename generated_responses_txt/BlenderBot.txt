oh , that is so sad , i am so sorry to hear that .
that was a long time ago ago , when my aunt was pregnant . i was an only child . i had no idea what she meant when she said she was pregnant . she said she was excited to be a father , but i had no idea . i think it was a good experience for her , i guess .
i was walking home from the store and some guy in my neighborhood pulled out of the parking lot and sped right off . i was so disgusted by his behavior that i stopped to ask him to leave . he was drinking and driving too .
oh my god , i feel bad . i feel for you . i hope you have a good relationship now !
aww that is so nice , i am so happy for you , i hope you have a long and happy life
what concert is it ? ? ? ? i ' ll gladly wait for you !
that ' s so cool ! u2 is a music band right ?
i feel the exact same as you do , i hate to hear that .
i feel for the poor child ' s parents . i am so sad too because i read about a woman who was once pregnant with a boy and died when they were pregnant . they said she would never have an experience like her again .
oh , that is so sweet . is the baby feeling okay now ?
oh no . did he recover ok ? was he okay ?
what will he be doing now ? i ' m sorry to hear about your loss .
oh , i am so sorry to hear that . i hope he finds a new one soon as well !

that ' s so cool . . i ' m happy for you
that ' s not very nice . how did you handle it ?
oh my god , i hope you were able to get your friend to pay the news . i would have been furious .
what ! that ' s the worst , man ! i hope you can at least save money for the next one so you can buy the one you want !
i am sorry to hear that ! maybe you can find another one soon !
what was the reason that he made a pass at you ?

that is sad ! have you tried to talk to them about it ?
aww that ' s too bad . did you try and get out did you ?
that is terrible . i am so sorry that happened to you .
some people just don ' t understand that not everybody has the same ability to do so themselves .
what did you do with it ? i ' m so sorry !
oh really ? what happened ? how did it go ? !
i ' m sorry you had to leave her , i ' m sure she ' ll come back around .

oh yes , that ' s exactly how it goes . i always feel so grateful for people who help me .
what happened ? i ' m not too familiar with that , tell me more !
what happened ? i am so sorry to hear that . that must have been very devastating . what happened ?
thanks , i appreciate that , i hope i will always have that set of belief in myself

what a wonderful memory ! what an awesome surprise ! i bet you had a great time .
i feel you . i ' m in the same boat , and i feel the same way . you just have to find the right group to hang out with and i think you will start to feel better . i ' m sure you will feel better too when you do .
oh no , i ' m sorry that happened to you , it must be terrible . have you thought about talking to your friends about it ?

i understand that , that ' s annoying too . i have a lot of friends that do that , so i know what you mean .
it ' s hard to say exactly how you ' d ensure communication since there ' s not really a set up for it but i do think we should do something about it !

i am like that , but i am also very envious of people who can do nothing at all , it ' s not healthy

you should have told him he should get his mind off of it and get back to work . he sounds like he really needs it !

awww ! that ' s a very nice thing you do for him . you ' re lucky to have him so you can have the tv on for him when he gets bored .
i am ashamed of myself as well for stealing but i am ashamed that i did it .
i agree . i think if you have to steal something then you should definitely do it . but i just feel like they did it out of necessity , and i am not sure they deserved it .
oh no ! how long was he gone ? did you find him ?
oh no ! that is so sad . did you ever find it ?
that ' s exciting , did she move ? how exciting . is she coming ?
oh wow ! that ' s awesome . is it going to be hard for you two to visit her ?
oh no , don ' t forget about it> ! you can always start now !

that is amazing that you have a friend like that . i ' m so happy for you !
oh wow ! that ' s incredible ! he must be incredible ! i ' d love to see that !
oh wow , did you get any practice in doing that ?
its hard when they dont even apologize for what they do to you , and then make you feel like you did nothing wrong by doing that .
exactly i know . . but it can ' t be helped , all moms are like that
oh that ' s wonderful ! is he first time ? !
awww . . i can aww . . . poor thing . . you can definitely give him a few things you can do to help him , if i ' m sure you will be able to give him more than just a few things .

what type of puppy did you get ? what was the puppy ' s name ?
i hear you there . i used to be on that class , i loved it .
oh yeah , i ' m sorry to hear that . i think the simpler times are the best . but the older generation is getting a lot more afraid of the younger generation and the younger ones don ' t like to think about what they are going through . i ' m sure it ' s because of the worry about what they can afford , and it makes it worse for the older generation .

that is so funny , i have heard that too , when i was young i once went to a gas station that looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom . i felt bad but didn ' t want to go because i had to walk home to a restroom .
oh man , i ' m sorry . stealing is not the same as stealing . stealing can be a very tough thing to do . but , i feel you on the guilty part . i have done it before , and stealing before . i feel guilty sometimes too . but stealing is one of those things that i can ' t help but feel bad about , and i just want to make sure you feel bad about it . i hope you can resolve that guilt somehow .
give it to your family . steal it or buy it .
that ' s very annoying and not a good way to start a relationship .
i totally understand . i love going to the best restaurant i can afford but i hate when someone tells me to do it !
what did you do on your weekend ? do tell ! what did you do ?
that ' s so nice , did you guys get to talk ?
congratulations ! that ' s awesome ! you must be very proud of yourself and excited to have accomplished that .
wow that ' s awesome . that is a pretty crazy teacher . he must be pretty crazy !
that is a wonderful thing , i am glad you are happy for that .
how i what are your plans ? that ' s a good way to think of it .
i thank god for that too . i need friends like that .
how do do they scold you when necessary ? that is very kind of them !
oh wow ! that must have been frightening ! do you still have any family that lives in the area ?
oh wow . i hope you did not have to stay in that long . sounds like it was a scary experience . i can imagine how you felt .
i am so sorry that you have that . you should not give up on your life because of this . i ' m sure your friends will understand .
i am so sorry you have that . i am very glad you can get through this .
i am so sorry to hear that , you must feel very lonely and alone .
oh , i am so sorry that you are desolate . i am sure you will be fine , though . just stay strong !
oh that is really terrible ! is there something wrong with the smell ?
oh man , that sounds so gross ! i ' m sorry you had to experience that !
oh , that is no fun , i ' m sorry to hear that ! did you try to go with her again ?
did the trip ended okay ? i am sorry to hear that . how did things end ?
i think it ' s because she doesn ' t want to be up all morning by 3am . i ' m sorry , that must be frustrating .
i usually just tell them to get to bed before 6am and go to bed then . i don ' t know , it ' s hard for me to be organized . my apartment is big , so it ' s pretty easy to get into trouble .
you yell at them until they shut up , but you don ' t have to yell .
yeah , definitely not my place to be either . i think if you ' re not going to give in , you might as well move somewhere else .
i have always heard that the suspense is quite strong for that , it would probably work fine . i am sure you will have an operation done soon .
wow , you must be really proud of yourself , are you going to tell him the promise of please , yes ?
i ' m sorry to hear that . i have no idea why i didn ' t know about this . i am a very clumsy i promise . i had to rely on a walkers help for my son . he is very young so i was worried that he would be out of work if it wasn ' t for a walkers .
yeah , i ' m just going to try and get it over with and hope that it isn ' t the doctor who does it . i ' m not sure if i ' ll be able to win anything .
