That sounds pretty scary. What happened?
i bet you did!
That's what happened. I was at the beach and my neighbor was at the pool
It's always scary when that happens. I'm glad you're alright!
i bet that sucks
That is terrible. I hope everything works out for you.
That sounds like fun!
Oh, I'm sorry to be rude. I know it's a concert, and it is expensive.
That's so tragic. What did happen?
I am so sorry for that. I am not sure if you are just being a little dramatic.
That's so nice of you.
That's so sweet of you!  I bet your friend was a little sad, but happy to have someone to take care of his baby and make sure he doesn't hurt.
That sucks. What is he doing now?
That's a tough spot. I hope you're all staying positive!
Oh no! Did they run away?
That's terrible. I would do the same thing.
That's great! What city are you going to?
That's really nice, how long have you lived in the US?
That's really bad, you're right though. You could have just let it go
That sounds like a pretty crappy situation.  Did you ever see him again after that?
I'm sure that was frustrating, but at least they are trying to keep the prices in check.
That's the worst. I hate when they do that.
That sounds awful. What did you end up saying to him?
I bet she was hurt. But she's probably better off with him now.
I'm happy for you.
I know, it is so peaceful.
That's a tough one, but I'm sure they will come back around.
I feel that way too. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one out of all my friends who live out in the country.
It's hard to discipline kids these days.
I know the feeling! I was at the park with my kids the other day and they were running around, playing and laughing, when a little girl started yelling and crying. She was throwing a ball and it was being thrown back and forth, and then she got it and threw it right back at her friend. She then picked up the ball and started to throw it back and forth again and again and again and again and again until it was being thrown right at her friend's face and then
I'm sure it was not a good experience. What kind of bug was it?
That sounds nice. Did she call you?
Yeah, it was good to hear from her.
I have two kids myself.  How old is your first child?
I have had two children so far. I think it's the first time for me to have a child, so I am really looking forward to this new experience.
That is the most amazing feeling. I once had a payment come in on time and I had just moved to a new city and had just gotten a new job. I was so excited to start my first week, but my new boss had already moved into the office and was already setting up the office. I was in the middle of moving and didn't even have time to unpack. I was so nervous and worried. I was sitting at my desk when I got the call that I had to
Yeah, it happens a lot in life.  But I have a friend that is always good to me, and I'm grateful every day that I'm in his life.
I bet. What happened?
That's really sad. I hope she is okay.
That's really interesting. I don't know what my intuition is leading me but I think I should follow it. I'm not sure I trust myself, though. I'm a little afraid to go with my gut feeling.
That's great! I have to listen more to my intuition too. I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately so I'm taking a step back and doing some self care and meditation.
That's so nice of them. What year did you turn 18?
That's awesome! I bet that made the day even better.
That's a lot of girls.
I understand that feeling, but it is a normal part of life.
I agree, I remember mine being the same age but they're so different. I'm so proud of them.
I can't imagine how different they were. I had twins.
It is so hard to resist their chicken nuggets!  I had them once for a few years and I was so addicted that my husband had to take the kids away from me and go to the store to get them.  He had to come home and get me because I was in such a bad state!
I am sure it wasn't that empty, I would probably be in there too if they were empty
That's a good point, it really made me appreciate my family even more.
I love kids.  What kind of orphanage did you go to?
I am sorry to hear about your relationship. I hope that it will improve.
It is a hard thing to navigate. I've been there myself.  But I think I can handle myself.  I just want my family to be happy and at peace.
I know the feeling.  I was in sixth grade.  I did the same thing to a girl.  I didn't realize what I was doing until I saw her in a different light.  She was in the school's cheerleading squad and I wanted to join.
I can relate to this. I was a bit of a mean guy as well. I was always looking at the "other" kids to tease and try to get a rise out of them.
That's really sad. I hope you can find some comfort.
Oh man! What a leader! How cool!  What kind of work does he do?
You are an inspiration!
I don't really have time to think about that stuff. I'm a busy dad, and my kids are always getting in the way. I'm trying to do the right thing, but I'm just a little overwhelmed and I don't know where to start.
It's great to see kids grow.  How big is the baby now?
Yeah, that's the life of being a friend, right?
Oh wow! Congratulations! What did you run for?
That is so cool!  What did it feel like? Was it hard?
I bet that was a lot of fun!  I love the Venice Marathon!
That's a bummer. What did you do?
That's a tough situation, I'm sorry to hear that.
I know the feeling.  It is so hard when it happens.
It is very difficult for me to understand how some people can be so cruel and hateful towards others.  It's hard for me to understand the point they are trying to make.
Oh no! That's terrible! Did she get the best care possible?
I am sorry to hear that, I hope she does well.
It is such a fun place to visit. I've always wanted to go. What are you planning on doing?
That is so cool! I wish you had the opportunity to take your kids!
That is so sweet. What did you guys talk about?
That's great. I'm sure that is a big change for you.
I do!
It is so helpful, but sometimes I am so lazy.
Yeah, that can be annoying, but I think most people don't even check email that often.
I agree.  It's hard to get anyone to respond to an email, even with the internet.  It's like, it's not like you have to send a letter in the mail to someone.
Oh no! Did it get resolved?
I'm sorry to say but I've been in a situation like that.
Oh that is so sad! How old are the kids?
Yeah, that's true. I feel lonely when I am away from my family too often.
Oh yeah, that is a common problem. People often underestimate themselves, and it's a problem that I've had to deal with many times in my life.
I'm not one of those people. I think the more you know, the less likely you are to be wrong. That's why you should always trust people, even when they're wrong.
That's not cool. Did he get over it eventually?
That's so nice of you.  He probably would have just gotten it out of his system later.  He probably didn't think about how it could be perceived.
Yeah I can't stand that. I'd give him a good kick in the pants and tell him to get off my kid's lawn
That's so rude.
That's great, you're so positive and healthy!
I am always looking for a new way to help others.
I love looking back at old pictures! What were they doing?
You have to admit, that's a good feeling to have, but at the same time, I don't think I'd want to go through those photos again. I'd probably have to cry.
It's a feeling that you've never experienced before, but it's also one that can be very fleeting. I'm not saying it's not something to be proud of, but at the end of the day, confidence in yourself is something that's hard to maintain, especially in the early days of a relationship.
I can relate to that. I had my wedding done the same way 6 months later.
It can be tough, but it's nice to work for yourself.
That is great! I love the idea of doing something you love and making money off of it.
That's unfortunate, did it go well?
Yeah, I would hate that too, especially after all the time you've spent together.
It sounds like a great time! What's your favorite thing to do?
That sounds amazing! I love the beach!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that!  What happened?
Oh no! Did she have any excuse?
I'm sorry, but what happened?
Oh wow! That's crazy! What did you do?
That's so funny. What happened?
That is crazy. I'm sorry she didn't make it to dinner.
I bet it was embarrassing!  Did you talk to anyone about it?
Yeah, that's the worst!
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to find a replacement concert.
I'm not sure if you were kidding or not but I'm not sure if I believe you.
That's a good one. Who was on the couch?
I am so sorry, did he hurt?
Oh, I bet. I love when that happens.
It sounds like he really cares about you.  What gifts did he give you for Mother's Day?
That sounds exciting! What kind of job was it?
That sounds awesome.  I'm a freelancer myself.  You're doing a good job.
I have never been taken "hostage"
That's crazy! Did you guys ever catch up with DiDi again?
That's so rude of him!
That must have been a bit shocking and embarrassing.
That sounds like a nightmare. I bet you were soooo annoyed!
That is awful, how did you get rid of the food?
I bet that was awkward.
That's terrible, she has to be so worried.
Oh that's so sweet! Did you guys get to spend time together?
Yeah, it's pretty funny. I bet you felt like the most awkward person on earth.
I hope you have a great time!
That sounds amazing! I've never been, but I've heard it's great.
Yeah she's a smart kid, I'm sure she will be a fine adult
I do, and I'm glad she found it! I'm proud of her too, she's doing well!
I know right, I'm always frustrated when people leave their cars and trash on the side of the road.
It's not that big of a deal to me but it really is a big deal to me. I'm always trying to help the store employees with their carts.
That's amazing! How old are you?
That is so sweet.  I hope you have a baby soon.
That's awesome!  What kind of flow are you talking about?
You're an interesting guy.  I've never really been in that type of work, but I'm sure you're a very skilled one.  I'm glad you're doing something meaningful and helpful.  I'm a bit envious that you get to be involved with so many different organizations.  What do you do for work?
It makes sense.  I think it's good for a leader to be surrounded by people that are better than themselves.  It makes them look good in front of others.
It's so hard to be in a position of power and still not be able to motivate others to do their best work. I wish there was more people out there who are more willing to put in effort to be better than they already are.
I love the way you put your words together!  That was a fun experience to have.
That sounds like a fun day.
I'm glad you got something you wanted. What was your favorite gift?
I am glad you had a great mother's Day. What were you giving to?
I think it was a car accident. The driver didn't follow traffic rules and crashed into a pole.
That's too bad, I hope it all worked out.
I am always looking for feedback. I am trying to improve my performance at work. I am trying to improve my performance at school as well.
That's awesome! I've always wanted to have kids.
That's awesome!  What's the baby's gender?  I hope she's healthy.
Oh no, what did you do instead? I didn't watch Netflix either.
Oh no, what did you do instead?  Did you watch Netflix? Yes, I do. I recently watched the series "Dark." It's the German one.
I have not heard of it. I would love to watch it.
Did you get the job you applied for?
That is great news! You must be so proud of yourself!
I know right? It's so frustrating when you have to wait so long to get to work!
That sounds awful.  What are you driving?
Oh wow.  That's pretty scary.  Did you get away?
Yeah, that's what I thought. I mean, I'm sure the sequels are fine. I'm sure it's not like the first one was bad.
That's really cool. I'm glad she did well.
I am so happy for your best friend!
I bet that was disappointing.
I hope it works out.
I am sure you got one! I am sure you are very happy!
I'm glad to hear! I have a dog and it was fun.
That's awesome that your parents were there for you.
Yeah, I'm glad they helped out, I would have struggled to get my first house.
That's good to hear. It is good to be independant.
That sounds like you will be ready for a long time
Oh wow. That must be tough. I hope you can find something similar.
That's a good point. I guess that is why some of the best surgeons are also the best paid.
Oh, that sounds interesting. What kind of adviser is that?
that's great. what kind of job is it?
Oh man! What is it that can you do about it?
I agree, that's disgusting. What kind of situation?
That's very kind of her!  I'm sure she was worried about you.
That is very kind of her, I hope you are able to get your own apartment and be independent.
Oh wow. I bet you are excited about it.
I agree, it was a good time, and I have some good memories of it too
Oh wow, that's great that you are keeping that connection alive. I hope you can keep it going!
Oh wow, that was a blast from the past!
Oh my gosh, I remember when Facebook first came out and how excited everyone was about it! I was so excited to try it out, but it was so overwhelming! I ended up deleting it after a few weeks
That's cool. I'm 35, and I grew up in the 80s and the 90s. I'm a 20s, and I grew up in the 2000s.
I agree.  I had to fight a bullie in high school.  He was really tough.  I won.
That is the truth! I used to have to fight all the time in school.
It's a pretty fun movie. I'm a big kid so I love it
That's a shame, but I guess it's a great movie. It was released a few years ago.
I am sure they do. They are old people and they need the money.
Yeah I can't even save anything because they take it. I am so mad!
That is a good point. I am not sure why that has happened.
I think it is a matter of personal preference. I don't have any ants around. I like to keep my home tidy and organized.
I am sorry to hear that.  That was a tough time.
I'm sorry for your loss.  I'm sure it was very difficult.  I'm sorry.
I am so sorry to hear that, but I am sure she is okay. I hope she never has to deal with something like that again.
It's a great way to cope. It really helped me heal when I was able to do that. I had my daughter named after her. It was a tough decision.
That is a tough situation, but you made it. Did you get a car?
That is so cool! I wish that was possible for me.
That is awesome. I hope that happens to me soon.
That's nice. What happened?
Oh my gosh, yeah, I've had those before too, but it's not as common for me to ask for one. I think I might be the only one in my household who has ever asked for one.
I am sorry to hear that!  Are you safe?  Did you have to wait for the storm to pass?
That's crazy! I hate when the power goes out and you have to be so careful. Did you have to use a candle wick?
That's really smart. How did you do?
Yeah, you should be proud of that!
I do!
That's so cute. I have a dog and he's so lazy.
That's awesome. What high school is it?
Oh wow! Congratulations. How old is your son?
That must've been hard.  I hope everything worked out for you.
That's really tough. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have a support group or a counselor to help you through it?
I know, it is so cool.
That is so cool, what kind of business does he have?
I'm sorry.
That sounds terrible. You could just tell her it's a family heirloom and you can't let her get rid of it.
That's really nice of your auntie. I bet she would be proud of you too
I love that. It's like you're transported to the past.
Yeah, I have heard it a lot too. It's like you can hear yourself singing along and remembering the good times you had.
Oh no. What happened to the cat?
It was so sad. I lost my dog too.
That is so sad. What happened to the dog?
That's terrible. I lost my dog last week. She was only 4 months old.
It sounds like a pretty gross experience. Did you end up getting sick enough to have to stay in the bathroom for a few hours?
I have never tried raw oysters.  Is it really that bad?
I have never been one for the prank life.  That is pretty funny though.  What kind of prank was it?
I would be upset, that's not a good prank
That sucks! Do you feel like going on a date?
That sucks, but you should try to focus on the positive, and also think about what you can do to improve your life.  I'm sorry.
Yeah, it is scary, but you can do anything you want to.
It's hard, but I know you will be fine, and you're not alone.
That's terrible! What are you going to do?
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure it will work out.
That's great! What's she like?
That is great! I have been there.
That is so true! I have had some of the best birthdays ever! I was a little scared, but my friends made it a party!
That's a pretty great gift! What's a great gift?
I am so angry at my wife, I don't know what to do.
That is unfortunate. Did they ever talk it over?
Oh no! Did you ever figure out what it was?
I'm glad you're safe.  That's scary.
i do, i love marshmallows on hot chocolate
That is so nice.  I love the marshmallas.
She does. I am very thankful to her for everything she does.
I bet she loves that
That's true, I'm not the best person, but I'm not the worst. I've made plenty of mistakes, and I'm working to fix them.
I failed because my friend gave me a cheat sheet.
I bet that was a good moment.
I do! I'm so thankful for her.
I hate when that happens. I'm sure it will work out for her.
That's a tough situation. I hope she comes back soon.
That is tough. I have been through that.
That's a tough one. It is hard work. I hope you are paid well.
Oh, I'm glad you feel hopeful. What are you majoring in?
That sounds interesting! I've always thought about that field but haven't pursued it. Do you plan on studying environmental engineering after college?
That is a terrible thing. What movies are you watching?
Oh, that's a little too much. I think you should get a new job and get away.
It really depends on what you're in the mood for.
I'm a fan of horror movies, especially the old-school ones.
Oh, I know!  I was so excited when Obama was elected!
That is a good thing. I am glad real conservatives are not the only ones that don't agree with him.
That is a great achievement! What are you going for a master's degree in?
I am glad you get to be a master's student. What are you studying for?
That's great.  I have been feeling the same way.  I have been feeling very lucky.
I am happy for you.
I love that! I like to go through them every now and then and see how I've grown and changed.
I love going through old family pictures.  Its a great way to see what life was like in the past.
Oh, that's a tough thing to deal with.
That's really tough to deal with jealousy, but you can't let it control you.
That's so weird.  How long?
That sounds like a long story.
It is always a great feeling to have someone you can count on!
Yeah that's the truth, I love my mom so much!
That is terrible, I am so sorry. What was the condition of his health?
That is terrible!  I hope he recovers soon.
That's awesome! Did it come out of your budget?
Oh no! I hope it works out. I'm sorry you feel that way!
Oh, that's nice. I hope she likes the same things you do.
I do. My wife left me 2 months ago and I've been trying to find someone else ever since. I'm just trying to focus on my job right now. I don't have the time to find someone right now. I don't want to get into a relationship until I've found someone I really care about. I just want to find the right person. I just really don't know who I can go to right now. I'm just not very good with people.
I'm glad you have a good family.  How old are you?
Yeah I am. We are close. We are close.
I know, I'm the same. It was a stupid thing to do, but I was young and stupid
It's a little bit of guilt, but at least you're acknowledging it.
That sounds like a terrible experience.
That's a pretty crazy story. What did you do?
That's awesome. Congratulations on graduating.
That is awesome. I love the West Coast.
That's good. What was the doctor's diagnosis?
I can imagine.  That must have been frustrating.  Did you end up buying anything?
It can be! I have my whole house to myself and it is super quiet!
I know right?
I'm so jealous. That's a really cool game. I've only ever played Halo.
Oh wow, that sounds amazing! I hope you win!
It is good for him to learn healthy habits now
That's nice that your wife gets them on deals, but I can see why it's not a good idea.
Oh, I bet that's nice, but also very boring, right?
That must be so sad for you. How long has she been gone?
Oh no! That's a bit of a shock! Did you clean it off?
Yeah that's awful. Did you wash it?
Yeah, I've been in the workforce for about 20 years.
Oh no! I haven't, but I do have friends who have. I feel bad.
Yeah, I'm sorry she's going through this. I've been there myself.
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I hope you were able to comfort her.
I bet you are. What position are you applying for?
Oh that sounds awesome. What kind of job is it?
Oh, I understand. It's hard when kids get older.
That's good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
Yeah, that's the best way to put it.
I hate that!  Did you get the car back?
I'm sure he did it just to see what he could do.  He's a wild one!
I know how you feel about those things.
I've heard of her. I've also heard she's a total diva.
That sounds pretty ominous. What happened?
Oh wow, I can imagine. How old was it?
That's terrible. What happens next time?
That is a terrible experience. I have never had any of the drinks at Starbucks before.
I am glad for him as well.
That's awesome! I hope he gets a good job and is able to pay for college one day.
Oh no! Did you clean it up?
That's terrible! Did you get the pizza?
That is terrible! I am not a big fan of McDonald's either, I always have the same order and it always gets wrong
It's not the management. It's the cooks.
That's a good thing.
I would have felt the same way, but I would have been more honest and told her.
Oh no! Did you clean it up?
Oh no. I would hate to step in dog poop.
Oh yeah, I know. I was cooking for my wife the other day and I got the recipe from her book. I didn't get it right. I ended up having to throw it all out. I guess I should have read it before I started cooking it!
I love chicken and rice.  What kind of seasoning do you like to use on your chicken?
That's awesome! Did you get a picture?
That is so cool.  Did he have any funny comments or jokes?
I am sorry to hear that! Did he fail because he didn't study hard enough?
Yeah I know how that is. I'm sure he will get the hang out of it soon.
Oh, that's sad. Did you pass the test?
It is so easy to forget the things we are grateful for, but sometimes it's hard to remember to thank the Lord.
Oh, that's cool. I'm not sure how to play a guitar, but I do know how to play a violin.
I've never been to a blind man play a guitar.
Oh that's terrible! Did you have a plan in place for that situation?
Oh, well, I'm glad you made it.
I have a boy.  I was so excited to have a boy.
That's crazy!  I had 3 girls.  Did you have any boys?
That is creepy, what happens?
It's a ghost. It's just a movie character. I don't believe that.
That's terrible. How is he doing?
I'm so sorry that happened to your friend.  I'm sorry that you have to go through this.  How long will you have to stay there before you get out?
I'm happy for you. What position does he play?
That's awesome! I'm a huge football fan and I've always dreamed of playing for the big clubs like Juventus
that's so nice, you must be excited
I'm so excited for you.  How many babies do you have already?
oh wow that's scary!  What were you doing on your way home from work?
I think I know where the diamond mine was.
That is a good way to think.
That is very nice. I am thankful for everything that has happened in my life.
Yeah I've tripped too many times.
Oh my god I remember that!  That sounds like such a disaster!  But you are so right that people are just trying to make light of it!  It is just one of those things that happens and you have to just laugh.  I bet that was a great school experience!  I hope you can still look back and laugh about it!  I can just imagine you tripping and falling and the crowd going "oh no, did that happen?"  haha
Oh yeah, I love his songs too.
Yeah I know exactly how you feel. I used to watch all of the Beatles.
That's terrible, I'm sorry for your loss
That is terrible. I am so sad for your loss.
You are very blessed.  You must feel very good about yourself.
That is so true. I am very grateful for what I have.
I don't know what that is, but it seems like something you did wrong.
I understand, I'm not sure if I would admit to that one either, but I'm trying to help.
That's pretty funny. I bet the other kids were shocked.
Oh wow, that's crazy! I'm sorry that happened to you. Did you get in trouble?
That's not good. I hope she's aware of what she's doing.
That is pretty gross. I would feel that way if I had my girlfriend doing that with another guy while I was sleeping.
Yeah, my parents always worked a lot too.
That is awesome that you had your mom homeschooing your brother and you, that is a great thing!
I would like to see that. I think that's a great way to do it.
I hate when that happens
That's a bit rude. Did you confront her?
That is very sad.  Did you guys ever get in trouble for it?
I know how that feels. It is very difficult to do something and not get caught.
I know what you mean. I was always the same gender and was forced to use the boys shower and I was so disgusted by the whole idea. It was such a weird concept.
That is awful!
Yeah, that is a good idea.
Yeah, but that's a good thing. It's good you had the chance to learn and grow in a way.
That's so tragic. It's so hard to imagine that something that beautiful can be so devastating.
I'm sorry to hear that.
That is very wise of you.
I'm glad you are feeling better. What happened to you?
I am so shocked and sad. How could someone do something like that?
That's really bad.  How long has this been going on?
Oh no, that must have been scary. Did you get in touch with the police?
That must have been scary.  Did he get in trouble?
That's awesome! What kind of job will you be doing?
It's a great accomplishment.  What are you going to do now?
Yeah, I'm glad to have that opportunity too.
That is great news!  Are you moving soon?
I am happy for you, it takes a lot of courage to start a new business and work from home. What is the business you are doing?
That's good to have that kind of support.
That is really nice of you.
Yeah, I can get a little too into my music too.
Oh, that's true.  I agree.  I used to love my music from my youth, but it just doesn't hold up to the modern world anymore.
That's great! Which game?
That's awesome. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
Did you enjoy your new job?
Oh wow, congratulations. What position did they give you?
Oh wow, that is awesome! I bet you are a great manager!
I'm sorry to hear that, but you should try again.
That's okay. You'll get your license eventually.
I can imagine how you feel when you're driving backwards and you can't avoid that cone.
Oh that's a great story, what did you do to get so lucky?
That's great to hear!
Oh wow! Congratulations! That is awesome. What are you studying?
Oh my god, that was so gross. Did he do it again?
I would have been really mad!  Did you tell him to keep his mouth shut?
I hope so too. I hope it works out for him.
I hope so too!  I'm so proud of him.  You guys are so lucky to have each other!
That's a bit scary. Was it a scary place?
I am sorry you had to stay alone.
I love that.  That is very nice of you.
That's great! Congratulations!
i have been. it was scary
That is a scary thing. I have never been in one. I am always driving around with my kids. I am sure it was very scary.
I have, and I have no regrets about it.
Oh man, what happened? Did he beat you?
I haven't, I'm a gamer but I haven't played one in years. I think I would be really interested in it. What's it like?
That sounds like a fun game! I've played a lot of MMORPGs over the years, and I'm always looking to try out new ones. What did you play the most recently?
I haven't but I've heard it's pretty good.
I love hardees. I have never had any problems with the sliders.
I have. It is so creepy.
I have. It's the most terrifying thing.
It is a very exciting experience.
Yeah, I have. It's really fun. I've always been fascinated by the idea of how it works, but I'm not sure I'd ride one again.
That must've been difficult for him.
That's terrible. What happened to him after you said no?
It is good to have a backup.  I have never left the US before.
Oh wow, that sounds amazing! I've never been to a foreign country before, so I can't wait to hear about all the things you see and experience! What are you planning on seeing?
That's really cool, I bet she was happy.
That's great! I'm so happy for you and your girlfriend. I bet she's very happy to have found the right job for her!
I agree, I think schools need to hire more people. I am a teacher and I am not getting any younger.
That is so cool!  Did you know she was going to get one?
Oh wow. That is nice. I have a German Shepherd too, and a Poodle, and a Bearded Collie, and a Beagle.
That's a bit weird, but I guess it's okay if you're not interested.
Oh wow, what happened after that?
Oh no. That's awful.
That's a bit of an unusual reason for waiting, but at least she was trying.
That is awesome!
That's nice. I have to work. I don't get to sleep in.
That's too bad. Snow is the worst.
That is terrible. You should have stayed home.
I'm glad you went home.  It is not safe to drive in deep snow.  I would not go out in that kind of snow either.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things have worked out for them in the end.
I'm sorry you had to go through that. I know it was tough for me.
That is so not cool. I'm sure you're both disappointed.
That is so cool, did you get wet?
That's awesome. What was the surprise?
I'm glad you were surprised. What did you do?
I hate doing that, but sometimes you have to do what you have to.
I'm glad it was your friend. What did he do?
I bet it was lonely! Did you stay in touch?
I can't imagine being that lonely.
I'm so sorry! That's terrible. I hope she is okay!
I understand, it is hard to find a place with pets.
That's very nice of her!
That's awesome! I'm glad she was so excited about it.
Oh that sounds like fun. I love the thrill of it.
It's so fun to do!
It's always a little awkward after the bathroom, but it's nothing to worry about!
That's a good thing you didn't go home that night, you can always go back there the next time.
Oh my gosh. Did you try to get him back up?
That is so gross! I have had to get rid of dogs before.
That is great! I graduated a few years ago and it took forever. What did you study?
It's nice that you made it, I'm sure you will have many more adventures in the future!
I bet you felt bad for her.  What did you do?
That is so bad. What happened next?
Yeah that sounds like fun! Did you stop and try to catch him?
Yeah, I love watching that type of video. It's so cool to watch! I think it's time for me to learn how to ride a sports bike first.. I don't think my car is safe enough for that haha!
That is terrible! What happened?
That's so sad. What happened to him?
Oh no! That's terrible. Did you have to call a carpet cleaning service?
That's so gross!  I've never had to deal with anything like that before.  Did it happen to your dog too or did it happen to a different dog?
Yeah, I think it is okay to have a few flaws and not be perfect. But I can see why you would be upset.
That is so understandable. You can't be mean to your mom.  I'm sure she is a good person and you are going to make things up to her.  I am sure she will forgive you.
I love ice cream!
Oh wow! What a lovely day it was!  Did you go on a picnic?
It really is.  I have a lot of friends from my hometown and it brings me back to my childhood.
I agree with you. I am so tired of the people who don't appreciate the beauty of the world around them.
That's a good way to put it. It's like when someone you admire is a politician and they turn out to be corrupt and greedy. I can't believe that they would be able to do such things.
It's hard to deal with that. I hate when people do that. I wish they would just be honest and tell you how they feel.
Yeah, I'm sure it was the same with you. I was too young to know the difference.
It's so scary, but I hope it never happens to you!
That is very kind of her. I hope that she's happy.
That is the worst.  I hate when I get angry.  I am so bad.
That's really great. You have to be patient and understanding.
That's awesome. I bet it was fun!
I'm so glad to see you're not afraid to be honest.
I am so jealous! What is it?
That is very interesting. What did your partner give you?
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I was really happy when she gave me an iPad.
That's awesome. I have a husband too. I'm so jealous of the life you have.
That is so cool that he's in the armed guard! What kind of work does he do?
I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm sure you can drive safely at night.
I am sorry to hear that, you should get a pair with a better lens and get a new prescription, you will feel much better.
I know, I felt like I was going crazy trying to get my groceries and the kids were running around like crazy. I was so stressed!
I agree, it is so frustrating when people are so in a rush they can't even notice you. I hope they will learn to slow down soon!
That is the worst.  I feel bad when my kids are playing and I'm trying to sleep.
That's awful. You have to get your sleep back. You need to start taking care of yourself.
I love the holiday season.
I do get company in the summer, I have 2 dogs that go on walks with me.
I bet. What are your kids doing in 7th and 8th grade?
It is so cool to see how kids are growing up
That is so great! I have a lot of debt myself but it's always good to pay it all in one day. What bills did you pay?
That's awesome. I've never paid all my bills at once. I'm jealous. What kind of bills did you pay?
That's great! What's it for?
I hope you passed and got your license.
That's so cool. I have a friend who had to do that.
That is great news! I hope everything goes smoothly.
That's not very nice of him!
I can understand how that would hurt.  I hope you can talk things out with him.
Oh yeah, that's a pretty common problem for a lot of people. I'm not sure I'm ready to drive yet, but I'm hoping to get my permit soon.
I know that feeling! It's like you are always looking around and waiting for something bad to happen!
Oh, that's really cool. I've always wanted to try that. How's it going so far?
I am so proud of myself.
I would be amazed! I never thought about growing tomatoes in water. What kind of tomatoes did you have?
That's a bummer. Do you drive or do you walk?
Oh man. I hate it when people cut me off. It always makes me feel like I'm a little kid again!
That's really cool! I've never really played video games before, but my kids play a lot. I bet it was fun to meet up and play video games with someone in person!
It's nice. I am sure you two are very close. I have a close friend too.
I love that phrase.
That is nice of you to say
That's good, how was the experience?
Oh, that's a good idea. I'm sure she would love that.
That is really impressive. She must be really smart. I am not very smart.
That is awesome! I wish you both a wonderful future together!
Oh, that's terrible. Did you have to clean up?
Oh, I'm so glad you have a dog. I'm a dog person, I have two of them.
I think so as well.
I agree. He's always there for me and I am grateful for him.
That's a good reason! What happens when noone is home?
Yeah it's pretty weird how sometimes you have no one in the house for 2-3 hours and stuff just starts to fall. I mean I know dogs are cute but they are pretty much a menace when you let them roam free.
I know, right.  You're doing pretty good for yourself.
I am glad you can do that.
I agree, but sometimes I wish I had more time for myself.
Oh that would be embarrassing!
Yeah, that's pretty funny. I hope you were happy for a moment and then the realization hit you.
That is very true, I forgot what day it was last week.
That's not fun, I hope you can get some help from a lawyer.  I hope you guys are okay.
That sounds like a great place to visit.
Yeah, it's really nice.  I love San Antonio.
I'm so proud you did it! Congratulations!
That is awesome! Congratulations! I hope that was a really hard class to take.
I can't imagine.  I have to go get a glass of water.  I don't know what I would do.
Yeah, that's what I do when I eat too much sugar.
It's just a little lego, but it was still gross.
That's not good, did you have to apologize to them?
Oh, I love their guac too.
Oh, that sounds delicious!  I love Qdoba!  It's my favorite Mexican restaurant. I can't wait until I can get there.
That's pretty rare. Did he learn it that easily?
That is amazing. I am not sure if it is true or not, I just like hearing about kids like those.
It's great when people appreciate each other
That is awesome! I am glad to see him succeed.
Oh wow! That is a good day! I bet you were beaming with pride.
That is awesome.  How old is he?
I know how you felt, I had a presentation where I tried to tell a joke and the whole room was silent
That sucks. Did you try to make it more funny?
That sucks.  Did you try to find anyone to hang out with?
That's good that you have dogs.
That's so nice of your neighbor. What did he give?
Yeah, that's nice. I hope it's not a sign of things to come
Yeah, I don't even know how to get rid of dogs that bark.  They're like dogs in a box.  They're just not right for the house.
It sounds like you're not a fan of dogs.
Oh that's so bad! I'm sorry. What did he do?
That's so weird! I hope it wasn't anything serious. Did he call you back?
It's nice to remember those days, when we were young and carefree
I bet you guys are having some fun now?
I am sorry to hear about that.  I hope you are able to find peace and comfort.
I'm sorry to hear that. How did she pass away?
That's terrible, but you can always apply for other jobs.
That is great news.  I hope you got the job!
That is terrible! What did she do that you scolded her for?
I know the feeling, my 5 year old son can be very hard on me
That's great. I bet you'll do well.
I hope so too. I am sure you will do well!
That's good! How much did you make?
I'm happy for you!
It's nice to have some good friends in life
That's great, what kind of friends are you talking about?
I would have been angry too!  Why did your son behave so poorly?
I'm sure you were just trying to teach him a lesson.
That is a shame.  You have to do something with your life.  It is hard to find the motivation to do anything.  I am sorry.
I understand how you feel. I'm sure it is frustrating.
It was good. I'm glad you got the job.
Yeah, I would hope that you got it!
I bet that was fun!
That's nice you have it.
Yeah, I think so too.
I completely agree. I think parents should focus on their child's educational well-being, rather than trying to look good for themselves.
I bet that kitten was happy to have a loving owner!
Oh that is so sweet! I love kittens. Did you find out where the kitten was originally?
It's hard when they are so young, I feel for you!
It's hard. I'm in a similar situation with my daughter and son.
Yeah, that's awesome. What kind of job does she have?
Wow that's great news. What job did she get?
I hope he is ok.
That's terrible. I hope he is okay.
That's okay! It happens to everyone.
I bet she was mad at you.
That sucks. Did you tell your boss what actually happened?
That is terrible. I hope you got the job back and got your money back
That's a fun vacation, I've always wanted to see the Northern Lights!  How long is the cruise going on?
That sounds like a great time, I've never been either.  What are you planning on doing on the cruise?
That sounds lovely. What is her name?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm really sorry to hear that.
That sounds very terrifying. Did you manage to get your bird out of there safely?
I was in the park and I saw it happen.
That's so sad! What is she doing to cope?
That is so sad.  I hope that she is okay.
That is awesome. I hope he is well taken care of.
Yeah that is awesome. I would love that!  Are you guys divorced?
Oh no! What happened?
That's so sweet of you. I bet she's really upset about it.
I am sorry, what was that award for?
that is awesome, good luck
I am not sure I understand what you are saying.
I am very excited for my new job! It will be a challenge, but I'm ready to take it on!
I know, right? It's like, you're just so anxious and you can't stop thinking about it, but at the end of the day, you just know you did everything you could to be prepared, and that's all you can do. I was pretty calm, and I think my nerves were more from just my anxiety about the interview itself, and how I was going to come off in front of all those people.
I've had them! It's usually nice, though. I was a bit worried, but I'm glad I went.
Yeah, parenting is a lot of work. It's hard to be patient when things aren't going right.
I would have been so upset! I know my kids can be a handful sometimes, and sometimes it's not even the little things.
I understand how that feels. I'm always a little nervous when I speak, because I don't want to say something wrong or say something stupid.
I am so sorry to hear that.
That's sad. What is she into now?
I'm glad you had fun with your daughter! I have a daughter too and sometimes we don't get together. I wish we did more together though.
Oh, nice! Where are you going?
That sounds like a lot of fun! I hope you have a great time!
I bet that was disgusting!  What did you do?
I can imagine. I'm sure she was very uncomfortable too! I would have just let her out of the house to go find a better spot to clean herself.
That's great! You have a nice cat too. What is your cat's name?
You should do that. You're so lazy.
That's good. What happened?
That's cool. Did you get the job?
I'm sure it's a good feeling to be that way.
That's great, how many people do you have in your life?
I am glad you said thank you
That is nice of you to thank someone.
i appreciate that.
Oh, that's so sweet. What's going on?
That's cool! I have a garden.
I bet that will be a lot of work.
Oh, what happened? Did they say sorry?
I am so angry right?  What kind of appliance was it?
That's not good. Did they give you the new one?
I know the feeling! What happened?
I feel you, it's hard when you are alone.
That is awesome! I bet he felt proud of himself.
I am glad he was your rep! What was he doing there?
That's good, it's nice when everyone gets some time to themselves
That can be a real bummer. Do you have any plans for your vacation?
I love take out too. I love the food.
That is so good! I love take out too. What's your favorite?
I like swimming pools! I've never been swimming. What kind of pools do you have?
That's awesome!  You have a good view of the ocean?
Oh my god. What happened?
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was so happy that I was going to be surprised!
That's nice! I'm glad you guys were able to get back to normal.
That's great to hear. How long were you apart?
I'm sorry, what happened to your mom?
I'm sorry to hear that. Losing someone is hard. I hope you can heal.
That must have been so exciting!
That's great! I bet you are excited!
That is a very good thing to do.
I understand, but I don't think you are being too hard on yourself.  It's a lot to keep a long term relationship going, and I know you love her.
That is awesome!
I know how you feel. I'm trying to get a truck, but my money's not going to it.
I love your enthusiasm!  What are you doing today?
That's true, it's always better than feeling down.
That sounds awful! I hope she recovers.
That's great that you are looking after her.
Oh that is really nice.
That's really cool. I'm glad to see that people have a positive outlook on the world.
I love to watch my son sing.  He's a good singer.
Oh I see. She is 9 years old? That's a lot of years for a kid to learn to sing.
I would tell him, but he may not take you seriously.
Oh wow, I am so glad you have realized. What happened that made you feel this way?
Oh no! What are your options?
I have a friend who works for a tech company.
Yeah that sucks. You can try to make friends.
Yeah, it can be a little stressful.  But I'm sure she's going to have a great experience.  I hope she does!
That is a terrible thing to hear. I would have told them to go and get a new teacher.
That's terrible. Did he not understand the context?
That's bad. What kind of chocolates are they?
Oh no.  I hope you can control your self-control.  I've been there.  I had to get a new stomach stapled because I was eating so much.  It was painful but worth it to get off the diet and get healthy.  Good luck!
That's great news!  What kind of job is it?
That's so awesome! I bet you're so proud of him! I'm sure he's going to make it big soon!
That is so rude.
It can be so annoying. Did you get to take a nap?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you lose it in a store?
That's crazy.
That is exciting!  What are you going to do with them?
Oh wow, that's great! What are your parents like?
That's so sweet of you!
That's so nice of you.  Did you have fun?
That sucks. Do you think they're just having a bad day?
Yeah, they're always a pain.  I've never been to their house but they've been to mine.  They're not very considerate.
Oh man. Did everyone catch it?
That was so embarrassing. I would have said something.
That's awful. Did she have to work or something?
That is sad. I hope you can get through this and make some new friends.
I can relate! Sometimes I just want to say thank you for the good things and let the bad things go!
I am glad that you are able to assimilate your struggles and grow from them.
I know that feeling.  I had a similar experience.  I had a friend of mine who was in prison for armed robbery and he had to serve time.  He told me that he had to be responsible and not do anything stupid.  He had to be in control of himself.  I learned it from him.  I realized that I was responsible and I had to do things the right way.  I had no money, no car and no friends.  He had everything
Yeah, it's all about the mind, you know?
That must have been tough.
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's a very tough time. I'm glad you have your mother with you.
That sounds like it would be a long move!
It's not going to be better.  You're going to be cold.  You're going to be bored.  I'm starting to get cold feet too.
Oh, yes! I think that is true too! I had a friend that was going through a tough time, but we were going on vacation. I just went up to visit her and we had a great day.
Yeah I know how it feels to be the one being the parent.
Oh, that is terrible. What are you doing to try to meet new people?
I feel you, but you are not alone.  There are a lot of people out there.  If you don't have friends, then maybe it's not a problem.  You might need to look for someone to hang out with.  You might need to get a job or a way to pay for things.  You could just need a break or something to do.  Maybe you should try to meet new people.  Maybe you should try to get a job or a way
That's a good idea.  You can't go to the airport without a good wife!
I'm glad you got cut off. You're welcome. I hope you get to see her soon!
That is awesome! What are you going to do?
That sounds like so much fun!
That's a bit rude, I guess. I would have just gone online and found a caterer.
Yeah that's a sexist thing, and it's weird because I've never heard of that kind of reaction before.
That's not a big deal, you can still enjoy it and not feel bad about it!
That's so cool. I'm glad you were honest.
That is a good one. How was it?
i am good. i am happy to be alive.
I am having a great day.
i had a good day.
I know, I feel so bad!
Yeah, I'm glad it's over.
Oh, what kind of job were you interviewing for?
Oh, I'm so sorry! You must be very excited!
I know, it's hard, but it's worth it in the end.  You'll be glad when you see your friends again!
Oh no. I am sorry to hear that. I am sure it is not easy for you to meet new friends. I hope you will be able to meet new people.
It's okay.  She's going for work and you're just worried about the distance?
Oh no!  That's a bummer.  Did you make it to the airport?
That's crazy. What happened?
I bet he was shocked when you called him out
That is so crazy. What did you do?
Oh that is pretty bad. Did you have to pay to go back on the boat?
Oh, what did you do there?
Yeah, I've had that feeling before too. It's like, you can't go back, but it's also like, "Hey, I remember how good that was, and I wish I could be there again."
That is crazy.  What did you do?  Did you go home?  Did you go back to work?  I'm curious, what happened?  I hope you are fine.
Oh, that is so sad.  I hope it gets better.  I hate when that happens in my house.
That is great, how did it go?
That is good news.  What is the job?
That's a funny story. What dog was it?
Yeah, I know, but it just happened, and I didn't want to mess it up further.
That's terrible. I would have called the FBI if I had to.
That's pretty weird. Did you report the mailman?
That's great! I hope you get good results!
I'm glad you got a chance to talk to them and get your results. Hopefully everything is alright.
That is awesome. What kind of memories did you have?
I love the summer time. I have a pool that is always a blast to hang out in.
Oh, nice. I'm glad they did that for you.
That's awesome. I'm glad they could help you out like that.
That is really true. When I was in the military, we were going through a really tough time and things were very bad, but when we arrived at the base we were all so happy and at peace that everything worked out.
It is so hard to deal with bad stuff. I just take a deep breath and try to stay positive.
That's a bummer! I hope they didn't think you were uninterested or unprepared.
I can't imagine being embarrassed about that, especially if the job is something that would make you happy! What were you doing before the interview?
I agree with you. I have been jealous of my coworker for years.
I am jealous of him because I am not.
Oh, I'm so sure you'll be able to get by fine. You're not going to leave him alone!
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I hope he gets bored and gets out of there!
I understand that.
I am sorry, I was thinking about a different context. It's a situation that is very hard to deal with.
I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a long time ago?
That's terrible. What did you do to try to find her?
That is awesome! I have 2 nieces, 1 is 4 and the other 1 is 6!
That sounds so exciting. I'm sure you can't wait!
I can understand why you'd want to leave that to them! I hope everything works out for you.
Yeah! They're going to put me in the hospital.
I know.  She is a very smart and athletic young woman.
That is amazing. I am so proud of her too! She has worked hard to get where she is. I hope she will be the first of her family to go to college.
Oh, I see what happened.  How did that make you think?
I am sorry to hear about your situation, but I would like to remind you that life is short.  If you are unhappy in life, it is only temporary.  It's not always about the job you have, it's about what you do with it.  If you are happy in life, that means you are doing what makes you happy and what you're passionate about.  You can make your own happiness.  If it's hard for you, maybe you should look into
It was so scary! What did the tree do after that?
That is very kind of him. I hope the rest of the tree is okay!
That's a nice memory.  What happened to that person?
Yeah I feel you.  She's always talking about herself and her music.  It's so annoying.
That sounds like a great time. I'm glad to hear that you have some good memories from the past.
That's so true. I miss it all so much now that I'm older and have more responsibilities and bills and stuff.
Oh no! That must have been scary! Are they looking to steal something?
It's so sad, I'm sorry. Did you report it to the police?
oh no that is so sad
That is terrible! I hope the mailman is not hurt.
I am sorry, but that is the way it is sometimes.  What kind of job did you interview for?
That is unfortunate. I hope you get the chance you deserve in the future.
I bet that was embarrassing!
That is terrible! I bet everyone was laughing at you. Did you run away?
Oh wow, I have a cat too, and she is so cute.
I know right, she can be so annoying.
Oh yea? What are you planning?
That's cool! Where in Somalia are you going to go?
That is a bummer.  Did you tell them about it?
That must have been frustrating. Did you tell them after you had cleaned it up?
It's good to see people taking pride in themselves
That's cool, did you play chess in college?
That's terrible. How often does he talk about himself?
I have had that problem with coworkers too.  I would just try to be friendly and not give him a hard time.  Sometimes people need a little space to talk about themselves.  I'm sure you can be friendly without giving him too much space.  Maybe try to have a talk with him to see if you can find out why he talks so much.  Sometimes people talk a lot because they have a lot to say.  Maybe you can talk about work and see if he
That is so cool! What is it?
That's frustrating.
That's pretty embarrassing! Did you get hurt badly?
Yeah, I was pretty embarrassed at the time. But I've been walking around since then with a bit of confidence.
I bet that was fun to see! How long has it been since you all met?
I am glad you were happy about seeing that friend!
That is quite crazy!  What was it doing?
I am not sure what to think, it is quite an unusual thing to see.
Oh no! That's terrible. What did you do to fix things?
It is. I am sure it was not easy to do, especially since you put your best work in.
That's a good plan. I bet she's going to answer it.
That's terrible.
Oh, you are not happy with what you have?
I agree, but we are not going to be rich.  We are lucky to be here.
That's right.
Oh I am sorry. Did you move to another city or state?
Oh man. That's terrible. I hope you get out of there eventually.
Oh, that sucks! I'm sorry you have to live in a mine site. I don't think I could live in a mine site. I don't know if I would want to even be honest. I'm just glad you're alive!
I'm glad they're good for you!
I am a very loyal guy, I will do everything in my power to be that way
Oh, that's great! I have a few good friends who are always there for me. What kind of friend are you?
That's great! What a nice friend she is. I bet that made you feel better.
Oh my, that's so cool.  How old is the kid?
That's cool, I used to love watching skateboarding videos online and it always amazed me how talented they are
I am so angry!  Why do people do that?
I agree.  I have seen that.  It's not always easy to be kind to people you don't know.
That is a tough time for you.
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hope he is not too cranky. Is he okay?
Oh my, I would have been very angry.
That's crazy.  I'm glad that they weren't hurt.  I'm glad that the dog was not.  I'm glad that the dog was not.
Yeah, I can imagine.  It was a lot of work, but worth it to have a dog.
I am sure it was.  It's always a little stressful.  But it's good that it's over and he's finally done.
Oh that's terrible. What kind of dog did you have?
I hope he's fine now.
I do, it's a great feeling to be in the right place at the right time.
I've had a few of those moments in my life. It is a very peaceful thing, to be in nature. I'm glad you had that experience.
That is good! What kind of job is it?
That's great! I'm sure you did great! What was the position for?
I have, it was very difficult and stressful, I was in the military and was injured in a car accident, had to go to the VA and file.
It can be very tough.
I think I do, but I don't have kids yet so I don't know.
I know what you mean! I love when kids do that. I have two and they love to talk about the latest video games they play.
That must be hard, how did you do?
That's tough, but you should be proud. It's not easy.
It sounds like you are a determined person.
It is good you were persistent, I am sure it will work out for you
Oh wow! That must've been scary.
Oh my god! That must have been disgusting to see! How long had the restaurant been in business?
I do not know what you are talking about!
I have a son who plays baseball. He is 12. I was worried that he would break his arm. But nope not that day.  I'm so glad she's not interested in that.
I can relate, it's like the worst.
I would have been so embarrassed!
oh that sounds so frustrating
That's so rude of them.  I would have been mad.  I would have yelled at them.  I'm glad you didn't get mad.  I would be a little mad if I had been in their shoes.  I would be a little angry, but I'm not sure I would do anything more than call the store to see if they are hiring more people.  Maybe they will get the hint and start to change their behavior!
Oh that sounds so cute! What kind of breed is he/she?
It's so wonderful when you see your puppy grow and be the best version it can be.
I agree. I remember when I was a kid, my father would take me to the movies.
I agree, I would love to be a kid again
I'm glad you had that experience. I had to work really hard for it too, and it was a great motivator for me to keep working hard.
That sounds like fun! Did you get any awards for it?
Oh wow, that's a tough thing to do. Did you try anything to get him back into the crib?
Oh, that is so hard to cope. I had a hard time with my older one. It's like your brain just gets used to it and you forget about the pain. It takes a long time to adjust to.
Oh wow, I love the beach! Did you do anything exciting?
Oh wow, that's great! Where did you go?
I know what you mean.  It's hard to believe how fast kids go.
That is true. I am sure that is how a lot of people feel about their children.
That sucks.  Is it a vacation from work?
I am sure you will get to go on that vacation!
That's great, how many years of college is that for him?
That's awesome. I hope you all have a lot of time together and enjoy it.
That's great! What is wrong with him?
Oh that's good, I do have a kid, but he has a serious medical condition. I'm so worried about him!
I love flea markets. What did you buy?
That's fun. I've never had one before. I've had a few of Beanie Pusheu's.
Oh my!  That is a lot of work.  What age is she?
It's good that she has some responsibility!
I am so mad!  That sounds so scary!
I hope the baby rat is okay.
I'm sorry you had to deal with that, but it's great that your mom is now recovering. It can be tough on the family, but it's great that she's feeling better.
Oh, my goodness, that's so terrible. I'm sorry to hear about your mother.
That sounds very nice.  How was it?  Did you have to clean out your yard?
That's great that you helped the cat.
Yeah I would've been scared!  How long was you out?
I can only imagine how scared that must have been.
That's good. You're a good person!
Yeah it's so hard when you know you should've done something about it.
That's terrible. Did you guys have any problems?
That's too bad, but I'm sure you're glad she got to have some fun time with you!
That is so sad.
It's always a girl!
That's exciting. Do you have any plans for the holidays this year?
I'm trying keto myself. It is quite difficult, but it seems to work.
That's awesome. How long are you planning to stay on the diet for?
That's great. I bet you're excited?
Yeah, I'm happy for you. You must have been so excited.
That's awesome. What was it like?
I bet you had a great time! What kind of car did you get?
That's great. What made you want to go back?
Oh wow, I bet you're really proud of yourself! I'm sure you're not the only one, though.
That's amazing! How did you do it?
That's awesome, I've struggled with that myself. What was the hardest part for you?
That makes sense. I used to drink skim milk.
I used to hate milk growing up as well. I think it's okay for kids, but for adults it can be gross
Yeah I like 2% too
I can understand that.
Oh no! Did you get there in one piece?
It was so frustrating, but also so necessary to make sure we got to our destination on time.
That is very sad. What did he do?
I am so sorry to hear that.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have to pay for the time?
That's crazy. I would be so frustrated. 45 minutes is an eternity.
That's nice. I have to get flowers for my mom.
That's so sweet.  I would love a bouquet of flowers.
That's so gross. I would never even think to do that. Did you get in trouble?
That's a terrible thing for your dad to do. I'm so sorry you had to experience that.
yea thats pretty rare to find one. what was inside?
That's awesome.  How did she paint it?
Yeah I know that feeling. I had a miscarriage, and it was very hard to get through.
I am so happy for you. That's such a big change
That's so terrible. Did you have a miscarce?
That is amazing. I hope you and your baby are both doing great.
That's so sad. I lost a dog too, and it's so hard to deal with.
I feel for you. My dogs are getting older too. I'm trying not to put her down. I want to spend more time with her and make sure she's comfortable.
That's so weird. Why was he in the back?
I know right?  It really makes you mad when people are not respectful.
That's awesome. You must be really happy for him.
I feel you. I am not able to save much, so I don't have any financial resources. I just try to be as responsible as I can with what I do have.
I can see why you would do that, it's great you got out and had fun.
Yeah, I've had dogs since I was a kid.
That's a bit of a downer. Do you have any plans to deal with your feelings?
That's a great reason.
Yeah, I am pretty happy too, life is great right now!
That's a good point. I'm trying to make more time to eat more water and maybe cut down on some of those junk foods that are so easy to eat.
That's awesome! Where did you go to buy the dress?
I know how you feel, I've been there too! I'm so mad too!
That is great! What is your favorite game?
I agree. I have played a lot of classic games.
oh my god what happened?
Oh my gosh! That's creepy!
That's awesome!  What kind of art does she make?
I am sure she is a super talented kid.  What are her hobbies?
I'm a little confused. You're saying what does it mean?
I know that feeling. It was my sister's wedding and it was a disaster.
That is so nice of you. What did you do with it?
That's really sweet of you.
Yeah, I can only imagine that.  How did she manage that?
That's so brave of her, I bet.
That is crazy, I bet you felt so safe.
I was scared too! I hope you're okay!
That's really sweet.  What did you say?
Yeah, he gave her my grandmother's rings, since I had them available.  He was really happy.  I'm happy for him.
That is exciting. Are you buying a new car or are you looking for one?
I have never had the desire to get a car. I am too lazy.
That's so sad. Do you have a little one of your own?
I am so sorry!  I hope the baby goes well for you!
That is awful! What did he need?
I know how you feel.  That was my brother's gift from the same company.  They also didn't deliver it on time either.
I hate people like that.
That's terrible. Did you report her to the police?
I'm sure you missed out a lot of fun and social time
I am sorry to hear that.  Did you find a good job?
What was it that you thought they were leading you to?
That is terrible.  What a horrible situation.  I am sorry you had to deal with that.
That's a good thing to learn.  What was she not liking about it?
That's so sweet.  What was it?
It's a very brave thing to do.
That's awesome.  How old are you?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that!
That's terrible. What was your child sick with?
Oh that's a tough spot! I'm not sure how to deal with it.
That's so rude of him!
That is good to hear.
That's nice. What did she want to do?
That's great! I'm sure you will be a great parent!
I know that feeling. I had my second baby 2 years ago and it was so hard working and paying bills all the time. I feel like it's hard work but so worth it!
I know what you mean. It can be hard to deal with it when it does.
I know what you mean. I was in a relationship and I was cheating. I didn't want to do it anymore. But I ended the relationship because I felt like I was cheating. I wish it never happened.
I hate when the weather is so unpredictable
I can understand why you were worried about that.
I'm sorry. Did you find the meeting okay?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm not sure what to say.
I'm sure she will forgive you.
yea that is really hard
That sucks. I am sorry to hear that.  I lost my father a few years ago.  It was very tough for me.  I hope you can find some comfort.  It takes a while.  It will get better.  I hope you can get through it.  It is a long road.
I'm not much of a painter, but I have always been fascinated by art. What was the theme of the competition?
That is great! I love painting, but I never have the chance to do anything like that. I'm glad you are able to do it.
That's a pretty common feeling for a lot of us I guess. What did you do?
i do the same. I just try to be honest as much as possible. I hope you can find peace with it.
That sounds like a very relaxing feeling.  I am a little anxious when traveling but I have learned to take it in stride.
I think it's a matter of having confidence, I've never found that to be the problem.
I know right? I feel the same way about my husband. We're not even in a long-term relationship.
Yeah she's really cute, i bet.
I'm sorry to hear that, that's really tough. I lost my dog a few years ago and I miss her so much.
Yeah, I know. It is. It was a week or so. He was a 5 year old.
Oh no!  That is so annoying!  I hate when that happens.
That's pretty crazy! Did you get a ticket for him?
I love the sound of the 1!
That is so frustrating, did they fix it?
That's a big deal!  What are the most difficult subjects you're studying?
I've heard that one before.  It's a fun game.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Yeah I can relate to that.  How did you deal with it?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! Did you get a replacement?
That must have been a shocker. Did you have to go to work anyway?
I'm glad you are getting to spend time with him.  How old is he?
That sounds like fun! I love playing Bingo! What kind of Bingo is it?
I have never had a burrito that was that bad. What kind was it?
Oh no, I hope you're okay. Did she have to go?
I had a great day! I had the best lunch and the best coffee.
I had a good day, too! I went to the gym with my wife. We did some exercise and played a game of basketball with our son.
That is so cool
That is terrible. I can imagine people would be mortified
Yeah that's a pretty bad thing to do.  What were you doing?
I do too. I am sure that she would never do anything that would hurt me.
That's great! I'm sure you're both very happy together.
Oh no. Are you studying for it?
That sounds like a lot of work. I'm sure you'll do great!
Oh, that's so cool. I love animals, but my favorite is sloths. I have never been to the zoo before, but I'm sure it's going to be a fun time!
That sounds so much fun. I bet you are really excited!
That is a pretty rude thing to say to someone! Did you tell them to go back to the room?
Oh that sounds like a nasty problem! I think I should tell them that they are going to get some treatment for that!
That's good to hear. How are things?
I am so happy for you!  That is a big move!  I would be so nervous about moving!
I know exactly what you're talking about.
That's a good thing, I hope you guys have a good time this year.
I bet that was exciting!
That is so cool. I've always wanted to get my hands on a street car.
That's good. What is it about that you are feeling happy?
I bet that was a great feeling. What house did you build?
It is great that you got a new car. I'm still waiting for mine to be ready.
i am glad you bought a car
That's great! I bet you were excited about it!
That's awesome! I love watches!
It's a great feeling to have achieved your goals, what's next for you?
I am glad you graduated. What are your hopes?
I bet you are worried about that.
I hope you get a good score in that class.
I hate when that happens.  Did you do anything to stop it?
Yeah, that can be very hard on you. I hate when that happens.
That's a bummer. I hope she's in good condition now.
That is terrible! What happened to her?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you call the restaurant and let them know about the issues you found?
It's always good to be honest with the restaurant.
It's always good to have a connection to your childhood home.
I was, and I still have a lot of memories of them. I'm glad you are too.
That's great. Did you look back and see what they looked like?
Yeah, sometimes that brings up some good memories.
Yeah I'm sorry you had to go through that.
That's good that it didn't damage your home.
That's understandable, what happened?
That's scary. Did they say anything about the results of the tests?
That is awesome!  How did they build it so quickly?  Did they hire a team of contractors?
I haven't, but I'm sure I will one day!
I'm sorry to hear that.  What was the cause of death?
That was a tough day for you.
That's crazy. What was wrong?
I agree, I've had that happen to me before, I was waiting for an appointment to see my doctor and they kept delaying the start time and when they finally did, they just sat at the doctor's office for a while, talking and laughing. I was so frustrated.
Yeah, that's the kind of attitude I'm not looking for!
That's good! Are you studying for the test? What's the test about?
That sounds like a lot of work. I hope you do well.
I love going to the beach! What is Orange Beach like?
That sounds so nice, where is Orange Beach?
That sounds like so much fun.  I'm sure you have some great memories of that.
That sounds so nice! I bet you were very happy!
That is nice to know.
Oh man, I know what you mean. I had one of those keys a long time ago. I was so excited and sad at the same time.
That's terrible. Did they give you any trouble?
That's terrible! I'm sorry to hear. I've had that happen to me before and it's so frustrating.
That's a good feeling to see him excited about something! Did he get a date?
Oh, that sounds like a pretty awkward situation!
That's weird.  Do they talk to each other?
That is not something you should do. It is a waste of your time. If they are going to notice it's too late.
I bet!  That's always great to hear.  I'm glad you get recognition for all your hard work!
Oh no. That must be so annoying. What did you do?
I'm sure it was not right to be upset.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure why I was being so upset.  I'm not sure if it was the baby or the person crying.  It's hard to tell without a way to measure it.  I'm not sure I would do anything to make the situation worse.  I'm just trying to be rational.
That's good to hear. Do you have to stay with the company?
That is good for you. I am glad you are staying.
That's so sweet! I love it!
That is nice of her, I hope you are happy with her. She is the only grandparent you have left.
That sounds scary! I bet you were relieved when the storm shelter opened and you could get out.
I am so sorry to hear you were through it.  I am so glad you are all alright.  You are so fortunate!  I am so sorry you were through it too.  I am so sorry you were through it.  I am so sorry you were through it.  You are so fortunate!
That's a nice idea.  I don't really have a garden.  I just have a few plants on the porch.  But I like to think about the plants and how much effort it takes to keep them happy and healthy.
That is true, it is very nice to have plants.
That sounds great. What's your wife like?
Yeah, that's cool, but I bet you're really excited.  How long has she been gone?
It is great that you are planning a surprise party.
Yeah, that was a stupid thing to tell him. I feel the way you did too, but you were probably trying to be a good friend. I hope he didn't get too upset!
Yeah, you know that feeling when something is wrong? Yeah, I know you should tell him the truth. I mean, if you're really interested in him, it's better to be honest. It's just better for your mental health to be honest. You can say something like "I'm not really feeling it right now, but I really want to get to know you better" and just see where it goes from there. I'm sorry you had to do that.
I'm sorry to hear that, but it sounds like it was a bit of an unfortunate coincidence.  I hope you were okay in the end.
I can understand how that would be a problem. Did you end up getting a stomach bug or was it just something else?
That is so gross!
I know that feeling! I was so disgusted.
That's a good point. I'm sure the owner will be happy to see it.
I would probably just return it. I would also try to figure out why you wanted it so badly.
That is the worst.  I have a wife who is a complete mind reader.  She will be "oh, I want to go to Starbucks, but I don't want to go to Starbucks."
I can understand why you would.  I don't like the place we went either.  It is hard to get a good meal at the place we ended up.  We ended up going to a different restaurant.  I think we will go to the place we wanted to eat next.  I don't like to go anywhere else.
Oh wow! How was it?
That sounds great! I've been busy too!
That is awesome! What are the classes for?
That's so awesome. I love that you got through those two courses and can now take a breath.
Yeah I feel like we have gotten more financially free over the years.
That's great to hear. I've always been a bit frugal.
Yeah! I feel like they really care about me, I'm glad they are my friends
That's very kind of them to do that, I'm sure they're happy they could help you.
I'm so glad you're safe!  What was the worst part?
I would have liked that! I hate storms. They are always so scary.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I hope that you can still enjoy the time you have with friends.  Do you have any family that you can stay with?
I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  I hope you can get through it.  It's not easy but it will get better
That is terrible. Are you looking for someone to talk to?
It sounds like you have a tough road ahead.  I hope you can get through it and come out the other side.
That sounds awful. I hope they were able to get it figured out.
It's always something with the plumbing!
Oh no! I'm sorry. What did happen?
I am sorry. I know that things are better now but sometimes we have to wait a little longer. I hope you are happy and not lonely.
I know what you mean!  I have to get my kids ready for school in the middle of the night!
I agree with you. I would never want my neighbor to wake me at night.
I'm not sure I would have thought of yelling.  I'd just be a bit of a jerk and tell them to go to hell.  I don't think I'd be a jerk like that in the first place.  I just don't like the noise of yelling and yelling and yelling.  I think that's just a natural part of life, but I think I'd just try to find a more constructive way to deal with the situation.  I think that's a lot
It is always good to have some backup plan, and to know that you have the means to move on.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Hopefully he will be able to do it.  What kind of surgery?
That's terrible! I hope he can do something to help!
I am so sorry to hear about that.
You are right. I've heard some doctors do that. It's not good, I agree.
That's crazy!  I live in a place that's way too hot in August, so I don't know what to expect.  Do you live in the Midwest or East Coast?  I live in the Midwest, and it's way too hot there in August!  I don't think it's even possible to be 80s in the Midwest!
That is good news. I am happy for it.
It does?  why?
I agree, it's a learning curve, but it's worth it! It's a great way to practice your speech skills and get ready to be on stage!
That's true. I used to watch a lot when I was younger.
That's a good movie. I haven't seen it in ages.
That's true.  I have seen that movie many times and still think that Harry Potter is the best movie.  Harry Potter is more realistic than the other movies, I mean you have to deal with the fact that Harry didn't have a father and was left to be raised on his own.
It's true, kids are smart, but they're also stupid. I've had some good friends over and I've had some bad friends over. I don't know what's going on.
I am glad you have your first job.
That's cool. I have never been to Dairy World.
Yeah, but they are really bad for you.
That is good. You worked at that place?
You must be a good person yourself.
I love seeing that.
Yeah, I love downhill streets.
That was so fun! Did you ride it to the bottom?
That's not cool.
That's disgusting. I don't understand why people would do that.
That is awesome! Congratulations!
That's awesome! Congrats! I hope you get some good recognition.
I have been there before. I was so surprised that she broke the news.  I was surprised that I got the news first!
I am new here and I have been here for about 2 weeks. I'm not sure if I can get my application approved. I'm hoping I can get a job soon so I can start to get my life back on track.
That is really nice of them.  I bet you were so relieved.
I know that feeling when something goes wrong. It can be stressful.
That's great! What did you do to earn such a great recognition?
That's awesome! Congrats! What restaurant was it?
That's nice! I hope you guys enjoy it!
Oh no! I'm sorry you forgot. I've done that too.
Oh man! I would have been really mad at you for not getting the chips for him!  I have 2 kids myself so I know how hard it can be to get things done when you forget the most important ones.  Maybe next time you can ask him what he really wants and he can help you out!
Yeah, I can imagine that.  It's hard when you forget things, especially when you're a mom.  I remember the times when my kids forgot stuff.  It's like they forget everything except for the one thing you forgot!
That is the worst.  I'm glad you are okay though.  Do you have any kids?
It happens to me sometimes.
That is so lucky. I would forget something like that too.
That sounds like fun!  What did you make for dinner?
That is very kind of her.  I have a very hard time paying rent on time, but she is the only place I have ever lived.  I am going through some really tough times right now, and I am not able to afford to pay rent.  I was able to talk her down on the amount and she was very understanding about it.
That is very kind of her, it is very hard to have a landlord who is understanding and empathetic. I hope you get a great deal on your rent this month.
I'm sure you did. You must be very good at your job. What kind of job it is?
Oh, I love that.  What did they think of it?
Oh, how did you break up?
I know how you feel, it's tough. But I think you should be happy that you're taking a chance on life.
That is great news!  Congratulations!
That's amazing, you should be proud of yourself!
That is great!  What were their names?
I hope so. I'm a little worried that it'll be too late though.
Yeah, bills can be such a headache.
It happens to me too, I hate it when that happens! I'm glad you got to cancel it though, hope you didn't pay it!
Oh wow! Are they excited?
That must be exciting!
It's okay. What happened on that day?
That's a bummer.  Maybe you can try to get your mind in the game for tomorrow.
Oh no! Did something happen?
Yeah I can understand that. What was the exam for?
That's really inspiring. What was the minister talk about?
i think he was a very intelligent person.
I am sure you will do your best.
That's scary, I hope you can save enough money to pay for the baby!
Oh man, 5 months is a long time.  Are you sure it's worth waiting that long?
Yeah I know how you feel, I have to wait 2 weeks for my results too.
Oh, I bet you felt great!
That is great! I bet you feel like a rockstar now!
That is awesome. What did you serve?
Oh wow, that's awesome. Did you have a lot of work to do?
I'm sorry that you have to go through this.  I'm sure you're a very nice person, and that's why you have no girlfriend.
That's great that you were able to work it out and now you're in a relationship.
I like routine too.  It's so relaxing!
That is great, what does it consist of?
That is awesome! You must have worked hard for it.
Oh yeah, I've been trying to eat more carbs, and I've been doing a lot of cardio. I think I'm starting to see a change.  I've lost about 10 pounds in the last 3 weeks. I'm going for the 3 month goal, and I think I'm going to start doing a little bit of strength training too.
That's terrible. Did you get any money from your insurance?
Oh no.  That must be really stressful.  Did you try contacting the insurance company again?  Maybe they will be able to help with your temporary housing.
I'm so glad you're okay. That's the worst part about being young.
That's awful! Did he survive the rain?
Did you get to talk with her?
I love when people surprise me.  I'm glad she did.
That can be frustrating.  I have been struggling financially lately too.
Oh no. Are you worried about getting in trouble?
Oh wow. I'm glad you're excited about the baby boy, I hope everything goes well!
Yeah, that is a big deal for me too. I'm glad you have a new baby.  I hope you get a lot of sleep soon.
That's great, I hope everything goes well!
I can imagine how hard that is, I am a little worried about you.  I hope everything works out and that the baby goes well!
Oh that's cute. Did you guys get back together?
That's so rude of them.
Oh I see, you were upset because she refused to do something for you?
I understand how you would be upset, but it sounds like you're a very understanding person, that's good
That is a big milestone!
I am sure she will be a pro at that in no time.
That's cool! What did you do to practice?
I am sure you will do great, keep practicing!
It's always fun playing old games with friends. I have a few old games that I still play.
It's always fun to play old games, and I'm glad you can play them now on the Xbox 1! I used to play old games on the Sega Dreamcast, and Sega 32X, and Sega Saturn. I'm glad you have the ability to play them!
I know, I was. I was going to take a trip on it but I was afraid I would fall out of the window.
I hate train rides as well.
It is always good to get new car.
That sounds like a great idea! Are you looking for something specific?
It was pretty intense. I was worried she might get upset with me for showing it.
That's awesome. What was it about the movie that you liked?
I feel you, I am feeling the same way right now
That is good to hear!  I'm sure that life will change for you soon.
That's disgusting. What kind of hair?
Oh my goodness!  That is disgusting!  I'm sure you were upset about that.  I've had my fair share of hair in my food.  I just wish that wasn't a part of the meal that I ordered.  I'm so glad you got your money back.  I think I'm going to order a salad at the next meal I have at that restaurant!
I'm happy for you.  What's the bike?
I hope you enjoy your new bike!
Yeah!  That is so awesome!  Congratulations.  I hope you have fun in your new home!
I'm so jealous!  How long has your parents been renting?  What type of property are you going to purchase?  I'm a first-time home buyer and I am so nervous about this!
I'm the opposite! I pay all bills on time!
I feel you, I'm the only one who pays all of our bills.
I am so sorry to hear that.
That's terrible. Did she die quickly or slowly?
I am sure it will be fine.  You will be paid.
Oh, that's terrible. Did you talk to the professor about it?
That's a cool find, I bet it was really interesting to see old family pictures
That's nice! What was your Great Grandfather's name?
That's great, what did they surprise you with?
That's nice, what did they do?
That is terrible. Are you okay?
That's a good idea, but it's hard to avoid areas of high crime in some neighborhoods. You're right to be careful.
I am sorry. That must have been hard.
That is very sad.  You are lucky you got away with it.  Did he eventually find out?
That is awful. I hope you got a good grade.
That's true. It's always better to be over-prepared, rather than to be under-prepared and then trying to cram all night before the test.
That is so scary. Were you able to run?
That is scary, did they try to follow you home?
It is fun to dig up old things.
I love collecting sports memorabilia!
I hope you got the job. What kind of job?
That is great. What is it about it?
I've never seen the movie. I think I'll watch it this week.
That's so cool, I have never seen it, but I have seen Hamilton in the movie. I love it!
Yeah that's always a great experience, especially if you are in the water.
That is the best part of summer for me.
That is terrible.  Did you pass it?
That's a horrible feeling. Did you do well on other subjects?
That's a fun time to have with your wife, you should be having a lot of fun.
That sounds like a great time! What kind of dance is she going?
I am sorry to hear.  I lost a cat a few months back, and it was really hard.
That sucks.  It's hard to lose someone you love.
It's normal to feel sad.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you have some time to grieve and reflect on your father's life.
That is always fun. Did you have fun?
I'm glad you went to the beach. Did you go to the ocean side or the beach side?
Oh, that's awesome! I've seen it a few times. What was your favorite part?
That's amazing! What was your favorite part?
I love when people can spend the day with their family.
That's good. I hope you have fun.
That is not good. Did it get away?
Yeah that would be terrifying. Did you hit anything?
Yeah that is very caring of you.
That's very nice of you!  What are your sisters' hobbies?
Did everything go well?
I bet you were. What was it like?
That's so creepy. What did the dog do to you?
I would not have been that brave.
That's a great quality. I can't sing, but I'm a great singer of the guitar!
I have been trying to learn singing for years but i just can't get it down.
That sounds like it was a lot of responsibility! I'm sorry you were gone for so long. What did you do when you came back?
That's good.  They should have been able to figure it out.  I'm glad you didn't have to do anything for them.
oh no! that's disgusting! did they have been dead for a long time?
That must have made you very uneasy.
I know, right? It's a lovely day.
That is a good one. I have never heard it before.
It's nice to have her visit sometimes.
I love that. What did they order?
That is so bad. Did they have sex?
That is so rude of them to do that. Did you confront them?
That's so annoying.  Is it a male or female?
That is a pretty scary thing! Did you call an exterminator?
That's the problem. You can't afford anything anymore.
That's a good attitude to have. You're going to do great. You're going to make sure that you cover those bills. I'm sure you can do that.
That's great! I bet you were a bit worried.
Oh, that sucks. I bet. Did you not get a lot of friends for your money?
Oh no! I am sorry to hear about that.
That is a terrible thing to do.  How could you do such a thing?
That's no good.  What happened with her?
That's pretty bad, I'm sure she was upset.
That's a good thing you did, I'm sure it made your friend happy.
That is so sweet. I am so proud of her.
Yeah, that's so sweet of her! I bet she's a sweet girl. I love that she's so affectionate.
That can be intimidating.
Oh no! Did you have to talk to them?
Oh wow. I think you should do that. You have a very interesting perspective.
That is too bad. Did you go back to school later?
I'm so sorry, I know how much you must be missing him.
I am, I just feel so bad.
It's so sad to see them pass away.
That is fun! I bet you were really fast.
That is gross.  I hate when my dogs go potty on the carpet.
That's great. I have never watched anything like that before.
I agree.  I am not good at dancing.  I am more of a singer.
That's terrifying! Did you run away?
That is crazy. Did you get bitten?
Oh, you got lucky!
It's fun to dream about winning.
Oh no.  What did you do?
I would have spat it out and thrown the cake out. I would have never eaten it. I would have never eaten it if I saw that spot.
It is hard when we lose our pet
I know how you feel. I lost my dog 3 years ago. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I've been there too.
I know, he was. I hope it will get better.
That's terrible.  I don't know if I would trust the news anymore if I had my choice.  It's all just a bunch of fake information.
I agree with you, I think it's so hard to find good information out there
It's nice that she is so excited to see you. It's good to have a good relationship.
That is sweet of you to do that. I would probably do the same thing with my kids if they were older.
That's too bad. What did you do to lose it?
That's really bad. I'm sorry you went through that. I hope you're doing better now.
Oh wow! I would have thought that!  I love shopping at Walmart!
I have been to aldi's before.  I have noticed they are very good for the price!
That's awesome! I'm a huge basketball fan. What do you think they'll do this season?
That is great!  What team is that?
That is very sad.  I hope he is at peace.
It's sad that he's gone, but I'm sure he's at peace now. I hope he's in a better place.
That can be a problem.  How did you know?  Was she telling you anything about it?
That sounds like a lot of pressure.
That is great, what are your goals?
That sounds like a lot of work, but if you have to, it's better than not. What's your plan for how you're going to get through all of it?
Oh wow! I haven't seen any of the Broadway shows. What was it about Hamilton?
That is cool, I've never heard of it. What's it like?
That is so nice. Did she get back to her normal weight?
Yeah, dogs are so smart.  They can do so many cool things.
I bet. Did you ever perform?
Oh man, I bet you must have been really hyp
That's really cool! What kind of contest is it?
That sounds awesome! You're going to be a pro!
I'm glad you felt proud. That is a great achievement for a child.
I'm sorry to hear. I've lost my dad recently as well. I know how that feels.
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope they are in a better place now.
I bet it wasn't easy! Did everything go well?
That's awesome! I bet they were impressed!
Oh no, you're feeling jealous? Why is that? Did she buy a house for you?
I am sure you can have your son run around.
That's so rude. What did you do?
That's pretty gross. Did she say no?
That is a great feeling! What is your favorite place in nature?
That is great. I like to garden as well.
I know right? I loved it! What was the reason why you were so in awe?
i love musicals, have you ever been to a musical show?
That is a fun place to be.  What kind of skating does your daughter do?
Wow, what a great experience for her.
That's not a good thing.
I agree.  It's like they think they are above the law or something.  I would be more concerned about the kids that are around them.
I am a parent.
That sounds so special.  How did you get to this stage?
Oh wow, you should try meditation, that's what I've been doing to help with my anxiety, it's really helped.
That sounds awful, I hope you feel better soon.
Oh no. What made you nervous about flying?
I can imagine. It must have been scary to have to worry about that every time we travel.
I'm sure that is a good feeling!  I'm sure it's a big deal to pay off a house!
I'm sure that's a great feeling.
Oh, that is interesting, I bet you were a little jealous. Did you get over it?
That makes sense.
That must be exciting. What are they doing?
That is awesome!  What kind of baby are they?
I'm sorry to hear that.  How long have you been cosigning for?  I would have to talk to a financial advisor to figure out what to do.
That is a lot to deal with, I hope you are able to get him to pay you on his own.
That sounds great!  What diet did you follow?
It's great that you are following your diet.
Oh that's so cool, I had my son accepted into college this year and he's a computer science major.
That's great! I'm glad to hear it.
That is terrible. Who was it?
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.  It's hard to accept when you were so close to them.
That is great! How long did you last together?
Oh that is nice! I love seeing old friends.
That's awesome! Did you get the high score?
That is great that you worked so hard. You should be very proud of yourself.
Oh that sounds like fun!  What is your friend going to be doing?
I am sure you guys have a great time together.
That's awful, I'm so sorry.
Oh no, I hope they can find a treatment!
That is so sad, I'm sorry. I love my dog so much, I don't want to say goodbye!
I'm so sorry. That must be so painful to go through. I know I will go through the same thing. It's hard to say good bye.
I hate when people get lazy.
That sucks, but I hope he gets back to his old ways.
Oh, that's sad. I hope they all do well.
That is not fair! You are a better person and you should not be ashamed of your body.
I bet you had some great times.
It sounds like you guys had a lot of fun. I'm sure you're all friends.
That's terrible! Did you have any money left?
That sucks, what are they doing?
It's good to have some friends. What happened?
That sounds like a lot of fun!  What happened after that?
I know, sometimes you need someone to talk to. But it can be hard when you're alone all the time.
That is great! I live alone too and I love it!
That sounds so scary. I would have to go back and kill it!
Oh wow!  I bet you were so scared to get out of the car!
That's awesome. I've never been to Florida.
That's the best time to get a good vacation, I hope it goes well for you.
Oh that is so annoying.  Do you try to talk to them about it?
I know, right. It makes me mad.
That must have been so hard on you.
That's so sad. I hope she is okay and that you are able to get some counseling soon.
I know right. I feel like I'm always trying to get what I want, but sometimes I just have to accept that I won't get it.
That is true, but I think we all have to accept what is in our control. I don't think it is fair for the other person to be rejected. I hope they will come around.
That is scary.  I am sorry.  Are you moving to work or to school?
I am excited to move! I love the cold.
That sounds amazing!  Are you a beginner?
I agree!  I have a lot of savings and a nice house.
That's good to hear.
Yeah, that's terrible, but it's not your problem, and you're not the one who is going to get her help.
It's so heartbreaking that she's not seeking help.  I'm sure it's hard to deal with when someone you care about is struggling.  Maybe you could talk to her about how you feel and try to see things from her perspective.  But if that doesn't work, maybe you should start making plans for her, like getting her into a rehab or whatever.  Maybe that could be the best thing to do.
Oh wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you both ready?
That's awesome.
It's great to hear that you remember that experience so well. I've never been able to visit Chicago.
I'm so glad you didn't have a nightmare!
I have been there. I was so scared.
I'm so proud of her!  That's a great school.  Congratulations!
That is amazing! I am so happy for you and her.
Oh wow! What did he buy?
oh nice. I've been wanting to buy one of those myself.
That's so exciting! Congratulations!
I love that major. I'm not really sure what I want to study but I'm sure I'll figure it out.
It's not good.  What did you do?
I would have to say that you need to be honest with her. It's hard to keep lying, and you don't want to be in a situation like this.
I have a family coming in to town too.
It sounds like a lot of excitement and anticipation!
That's cool. What was your major?
That's great that you still stay in touch with them.
That's awesome! Horror movies are so much fun!
It's always scary when watching horror movies! I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. Do you watch them often?
That sounds so nice! What place?
I am happy for you.  How long have you been together?
I am so sorry to hear that. I know how you must be feeling.  I have had my dogs pass away too. I am sure it was very painful. I hope you are doing okay.
That's terrible. I'm sorry.
It's not that hard to do in the US.
I agree with you. I was shocked that he was elected. I am not sure how he was able to get that many votes.
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully they can still have fun together without you.
Yeah, it's not healing at all. I'm not even thinking about it anymore. I'm going to the doctor and they will figure it out.
That is a great place, what did you guys do?
That sounds like fun! I love going to the South!
That is terrible. Did you get the project back?
Oh no. What happened to your teammate?
Oh my goodness, that's scary! I hate those bugs!
It can be very annoying. I've never had any in my yard.
That was so scary.  I am so sorry.  Did you get the packet?
Oh man, that's scary! I hope that's not a possibility.
I bet you were nostalgic!
It must have been a great feeling.  Did you have a lot of horses there?
That's pretty handy! I always keep a spare tire and tools in my car.
Oh wow.  You have some experience.  I had my first flat last year and it was a real bummer.  I ended up having to call for a replacement.  I had to wait 2 weeks to get the new tires.  But it was a great experience.  I've gotten so used to it now.
I can't imagine doing that! Did you do it?
That was scary. I'm sorry you got hurt.
I'm so jealous! What is it like there?
That's too bad, it's good you have good friends to talk to.
Oh wow! I love moving! What's the move to?
That's awesome!  What's the move to the new place for?
That is great!  Do you meditate daily?
That's awesome, I've always been a bit of a meditating nerd.  What's the best part of meditating?
I hate it when that happens!  Did you call the police?
That sounds scary. I'm glad it turned out okay.
Oh, that's terrible. What did you do to try to get back on their good side?
That sucks. I'm sorry. Did it happen to you before?
That's terrible. Do you have any tips on how to prepare?
That sucks. I hate presentations too. But it is good that you are prepared for it.
That is very nice of him
It's nice that there are people like that around here.
That is a great way to describe it! I'm glad you have such a good time here!
Oh wow. I hope you got some antihist to help you out.
I'm sorry to hear that. I would have done the same thing next time.
That's terrible! I hope he wasn't too upset.
Oh wow, I would be very embarrassed!
I can relate to that. I remember being a kid when I was young and my parents would take me to the zoo. I loved that place.
That's a good thing, I think.
I love that! What do you do?
Yeah, that is great that you have the opportunity to work in that way.
Yeah I have had some of that in the past.
It's a shame when people don't make the time to call and visit friends, but sometimes life just goes on and things just get busy. I hope he'll get back on the phone and make it right.
I know, I feel the same way! I was hoping he would be a little more considerate. I think I'll just keep him to myself.
That's pretty cool.  Did you end up winning?
That is a nice prize, did she use it to buy something she really needed?
I love it when people can solve complex math problems
That's cool. Did you get the job?
I bet you are excited about that
I love when you can just clean the dirt out and get on with the day.  How long have you lived there?
That is creepy. Did they attack you?
I am sorry to be the one to tell you but it was a woman!
Yeah, that's really cool.  How old is she?
That's so cool!
That is bad. What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that!
That can be frustrating.  Are you a truck driver?
It's always a bit of a worry.
I hope you do well in it.
It depends, but I'm happy for me. I don't think anyone else should go to school for electrical engineering.
That's crazy! I bet it was pretty terrifying.
That is terrible.  What happened?
I agree. He was a very unique individual.
I agree, he was a good guy. I hope he was able to find some peace in heaven.
That's really sweet of your supervisor. Did anything interesting happen?
That's good to hear. What was the supervisor looking for?
That is exciting. What amusement park is it?
I love amusement parks! I have been to a few and have always enjoyed them!
That's really smart of you!
That is good.
It's always nice to get to spend the holiday with loved ones!
Yeah I love that.  I always think about Santa.  I was so excited for my sister to come home.
That's terrible. Did you get it fixed?
I know, I feel so sorry to the dog. I would never have let her get away with it.
I agree. I used to love watching TV but now I watch it for a long time. I don't know why!
I know what you mean. I have been crying for hours after seeing some sad show. I just want to go home and be happy again
Oh that sounds like a lot of fun!
That's a great place to go!  I have never been.  I've never been there.
I agree!  They are just too young to understand.  I remember when my kids were young and I used to tell them that I was going to the bathroom and they didn't even care.  I thought they were just curious!  But I would tell them again because it's good for them to learn about the world and to not take everything for granted.  I used to tell them to pick up after themselves, too, and I didn't want them to make a mess on
That is pretty gross. I would be sick to my stomach if I had dropped a candy bar and then eaten it.
I would have eaten it too!
That is really nice of them.
Oh that's so sweet of them, I hope they get better
Yeah, that's terrible.  Did you have insurance?
oh no!  that's terrible.  are you okay?
That sounds like fun! I bet you enjoyed it.  What were the plans for the day?
That must have made you happy.
That's great! I bet you're going to have a blast! What's the best family vacation?
Oh, I understand. I have a few family members who are not as close to me as others, but I do try to make sure they know they're important to me.
I'm so jealous. I wish I could dance.
That sounds like fun! I've never been to a dance recital before.
That is so awesome.  What did she do to stand out?
That is nice of him!  What did you guys do together?
It's always nice to have help when you need it most.
That is great.  Are you going to the interview?
I am glad I could help you out
That is gross! Did you wash it?
I hate when that happens, I always make sure to check every single thing before putting it out!
That is awesome! I would love going to see it.
I love the quirky things. I have to admit that some things I don't really know about.
I love going to those stores too. They're always so fun to browse.
That is really cool.  Did you move for work?
That must have been nice.  I would love to travel and meet new people.
That's so cool! I love moving around a bit! What city are you in?
It is always better to be safe than sorry, but it is nice to have a great family that takes care of you
It's always nice to have a family that takes care of you when you need it the most
That is so true, some people have no concept of right and wrong.
I agree. I think it's a shame.
That's so unfair. What do you think you're supposed to do?
I can't believe that. How long has he been dating?
Oh no.  How did you get cut off in traffic?
I feel you, I was in a hurry and didn't even even look at the guy who cut me off.
That is so sad.  I am so sorry.  What happened to your sister?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that they lost their child. That must be very hard for them.
I hope you get the job you are looking for!
It can be really tough to be in a job market like this, where there is no job market to go to. I hope things turn around soon for you.
That's awesome! How old is she?
Oh that's great, I bet you are excited for her! I am sure she will do great.
That is a lot! What is the company for?
I'm sorry to hear that, but you have to get ready. You can't let the busyness of summer keep you from enjoying the sunshine.
That's awesome. I've never done it, but I would be a lot more likely to try it.
That is so awesome! I've always been interested in it.  I would love to go one day!
That's true. It's good for mental well-being.
That's awesome. I'm a vegan myself. What are some of your favorite vegan foods?
That's great. Do you eat plant-based every day?
I know how that goes.  Do you take them regularly?  Do you find they help at all?
That is a very selfless thing you did.
That is so nice.  I am so happy that she is healthy again.
That's really cool. I bet you feel really lucky to have such a good mom!
Yeah, but it is hard when she is sick.
I have a Dodge Charger, it's a beast!
That is an amazing car.
Yeah that would be so annoying.
That's terrible! I hope she doesn't chew up any of my other shoes. She has a bad habit of chewing up anything she can.
That is so nice of her! What did she make for you?
oh that's awesome. what did you do for birthday?
Yeah, my favorite meal is a good burger and fries!
I'm so sorry to hear that.  How long were you together?
That sucks. Did he cheat?
Oh wow! I love when people show you love and care for!
I love pot roast!
I'm so happy for you! Congratulations!
That's awesome! Congrats on the promotion and the raise.
Oh wow! I am so happy for you.  What words has she learned lately?
It is indeed. I have two kids and a wife.
I love when people are so prepared for their trip.
That sounds amazing. I've always wanted to visit Japan.
That is so nice of them. What did you order?
Yeah, I love sushi.  I had a good time.  How about you?
That's awesome!  I'm a sushi guy myself.  What kind was it?
That is so nice! What park?
It's so nice to go for a ride and get some exercise. I'm a bit worried about the heat though, I'm going to try to go for a walk tomorrow.
I can imagine! It's great you have a house to yourself.
I am sorry to hear that. I am glad you have family close to you.  How long are your husband away from home?  I am in the military too and it is hard to be away. I hope your husband is home soon and you can spend a lot of time together.  I am in the military too.  It is so hard when you are so far apart.  I am sure it is not the same in Alaska as it is in other states. It's
That's really cool! What made you move?
That makes sense. I'm glad you have a good sense of adventure. I've always wanted to go to Japan. Have you ever gone there?
That sounds nice. What kind of car?
I'm happy for your brother.  I've never been able to afford a car.
I can't wait for my kids to be older. I'm 40 now and they are 8 and 10.
That's awesome, I have a 15 year old brother. I'm going to have to start driving him around again!
I am sure it was nice to see them. What did they do?
That sounds like a great reunion! What did you two talk about?
Yeah, I miss the place where I grew up, and the people I grew up with, but it's a good experience to have.
You have to go visit me!
That is pretty rude.
It's good to be committed to someone.
That's so cool! What type of play was it?
Oh, wow, I hope it was a great play! Did you enjoy it?
I know the feeling! Sometimes it's nice to be home with your family
It's good to be alone sometimes.
That sounds like a great recipe!
Yeah, I love buffalo wing sauce.
I am jealous of you
That's awesome! I'm always looking for opportunities to advance. I'm a big believer in hard work being rewarded.
It is exciting to hear, but also a lot of stress and worry.
That sounds like a good plan.  I hope it all works out for you!
I bet that was scary! What kind of videos were they?
I can, I think it's just a feeling of curiosity or boredom. But I think sometimes curiosity is just a way of trying to escape boredom or boredom of boredom!
Oh, nice! Are you a football fan?
I am a Packers fan too. I am so ready!
It is so cool!
I have never been to a BMX park but I have seen videos of them.
Oh no! That's terrible! Did your friend have to go out of his way to pick you up?
I'm glad it was just a simple fix. I would've been stranded.
That sounds like you put in some effort.
Oh that is cool. I hope you got the A you wanted.
That sucks. I'm sorry.  I know it can be really tough.  Did you talk about it with him?
It is very hard to deal with, but I'm trying to be strong.
That's so exciting! Congratulations!
Oh wow. That is amazing. Congratulations!
Oh that is so bad, I am so sorry!
Oh, you were prepared! That's a good thing. I bet the rain didn't flood as badly as you thought it would
It is always better to tell the manager or just leave. I would never steal.
That's good that you didn't get caught.
I hope they get better.
It's good that you're taking care of him, that's the kind of friend he should be grateful to have.
That's awesome! You must be very proud of yourself!
I'm glad you got on the honor roll. That's a big accomplishment. What's the secret to getting on the honor roll?
Yeah, that's a great way to break up with friends.
I have never heard of that movie. I'm curious about it.
That is funny.  What did you end up getting the job for?
Oh, that's awesome! Congratulations! What kind of job did you get?
That's horrible. What kind of dog?
Oh my, I hope you didn't have to go to work! I would hate to have something happen like that. Did you have to wait until they went out for a while before you went in and took them out?
I would have been a bit upset about it as well
Oh wow that is so embarrassing! I would be so ashamed
That's a pretty accomplishment!  How long has it been?
That's great! I bet you feel proud of him!
That is too long! Did you guys get along well?
Yeah, that's not uncommon.  I'm sure she was happy with that.
I'm sorry about that. I've lost my own dog to cancer. It was really sad. I wish I had a pet right now.
It sounds like he was a good dog.  I hope he didn't go that quickly.
I remember that. I worked my butt out for my first week. I was so excited.
Yeah that is what made me so nervous
That's so cool.  What did they do to it?
That's good. What kind of bus is that?
That's awful. I'm sorry.
I understand.  It can be tough when things end.  But you will get through it, and you will be better off for it.
I'm sure it was a bit of a shock! Did anyone notice?
That's funny, I've had that happen before, it's always good to laugh at yourself
Oh wow, how old is he now?
I love kids! I'm so excited for your son's college adventure.
That's terrible! What happened?
Yeah I know that feeling, it's like your body just goes, "No, no, no!"
That would be a terrible thing to do.
I bet you were glad to be able to share with them.
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.  What did happen?
I understand how hard it must have been. I lost a sibling myself, and it's not easy to talk about. I hope that it helps you to remember the good times and not get too caught up in the pain.
That's true, but you know what's even better? Having a good job and a good family!
I know right! I feel like I've been working hard for my life.
That is nice. What do you do to keep yourself energized?
That's a great job. You are very grateful.
I have never lost my phone
That must have been frustrating, did you get a new phone?
That's so sweet of them, what made it so unexpected
I'm sorry, but you are 34, not 34
I feel that, I have a very hard time connecting with people from other countries, and it makes me feel like I am living in a bubble
I bet.  That is really cool.  What are you and your son going there for?
Oh no, what show is it?
That is a fun show, I have seen it on my TV a few times
Oh yeah. That is very helpful to have that in you.
I have been there before. I was trying to help a friend and I had to explain something to them, and they didn't understand it at all!
That is nice. I wish I had that time to myself.
I understand. I have never flown before.
That's not very consider of of you
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that.
Oh that's great! What did you do on Sunday?
I am sorry, but you can't be happy all the time. You will have to deal with some stress and frustration.
That's a lot of weeds! I'm sorry that it happens.
That must be tough. I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm sure it will get better.
I can imagine that would be stressful for you and the kids.
That is so bad! Did it end up being a problem or was it not a major issue?
That's terrible.
That is awesome. I bet she's very proud of herself.
That's awesome. She must be pretty talented.
That must have hurt.  Did he get in trouble?
I would have told him that if he didn't teach her to stay out of his business, she would be in trouble.
That's too bad. What do you do?
Yeah, I don't know if it is worth it.
That sounds great! I'm a bit jealous. What does he do for a job?
It's great that you are looking forward to it. I hope it will happen this time! I'm a little nervous though because I don't know if my husband will be able to do anything this time around. I've been looking for months. Maybe I should just start saving my money for college instead. That's a good idea though!
That can be so disturbing. What did the movie have to do?
I agree, I just don't like watching that type of content, but at least it is a movie, right?
That is so frustrating.  I hope it works out for him!
That is very exciting and scary at the same time
That is very tough. It's like having a best friend who is no longer around.
I can relate, it's not the same, but it's good to have them around.
It's amazing how fast kids grow.
Oh wow. You have a lot of experience now. I have only just started. I think I have to be happy that I'm not the one starting kindergarten. I'm so excited to see my kids go off into their own little worlds.
I'm glad you made it!
Yeah, you should always stay away from places where gunsshots can happen.
I'm sorry for your loss.  How did he die?
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope he was at peace.
I am glad you are happy.  What did you do for the new job?  Did you get a promotion?
That's so rude!
That is terrible.  Why did you do that?
I love the beach! Did you have fun?
I love beach trips too.  What did you do?
That is terrible. What did you do to deal with that situation?
That's terrible! How long have you worked with your coworker?
I've heard a lot of good things about it!
I'm not familiar with that, but I've heard great things! I'll definitely look up his work!
Oh my god. Did anyone know?
oh no.  what kind of thing did you throw up?
Wow. What happened?
That must be a bit nerve racking, especially if you are not used to meeting new parents.
That's not cool. What did she do?
That is a tough situation to deal with. Did she say anything to you about how she felt?
That is terrible. What did happen to her?
Oh wow, that's nice. I've had to be there for my own.
That is awesome! Congratulations on the proposal!  What made it so shocky?  Was it a surprise?
That is so sweet.
That sounds really nice. I wish I could be like that.
I really like that about him, he seems like he really cares about his people.
I remember that too! It was such a fun time.
I remember that. I used to be scared of them.
That is frustrating. Do you get tired easily?
That is terrible! I am so tired all the time!
That's exciting!  Are you planning on buying a new home?
Oh, that's great! I'm glad you got to see the house. What's your first house going to be?
I love hanging out with my mom too!  What did you guys plan on doing?
That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.
I know that I understand. I have a little brother too and he wants to be with his sister but he's always getting into trouble. He's 12.
That is so sad.  You need to be able to take care of her.
That is so sweet. I am so glad that you are so proud of your child.
Yeah, she is very talented.
Oh no. Did they do well?
I would do that to my daughters too
That is great to hear.
That's good news!  I hope you get it!
Oh, did you look through them?
Oh my, I love looking at old photos.  Are you looking back on your childhood or your parents' childhoods?
I hate my dad. I'm sorry to hear that.
That can be really tough. Did he have a reason?
Oh, you're going to crush it! I've been preparing for that interview too, and I'm sure you will do great.
That's great. I hope you get it.
That is a good one!  What was the surprise?
Oh no, I hope you were happy with the cake you got!
That is terrible. Did she leave you for someone else?
That's terrible.  I would have been devastated if I was her.
Oh no.  What happened?
That's a good point.  I think it's just that sometimes we don't get a chance to do things like that.  I just hope they make up for it in the future.
Oh that is good! What job was it?
It sounds like you are doing well
Oh no! Did you go outside?
That sounds terrifying! Did you try to get it out?
Oh no! That is terrible! I hope you are okay!
That's so sad, what happened exactly?
I have had some problems with them in the past.  What did the problem be?  Was it the clog or something else?  I had issues with the clog in the pipes in my house.
Yeah, it was a bit of an adventure. I'm glad it's over.
I'm so sorry that you had to go through that.
It's good that you are over it now.
That's great!  Marriage is such a wonderful thing.  I hope you both have a wonderful life together.
That's so cool! What kind of store was it?
That is terrible.  I hate when that happens.
That is horrible. I would have been very upset about that.
Oh that's great! I've never been able to afford a house, I'm a single parent. What kind of house are you looking for?
It sounds like you are very excited about this.  I hope your family is too.  I am sure that house will be worth a pretty penny in a few years!
I am glad you have your car. What kind is it?
That is awesome!
i hate when my cat jumps on me.
ali, thats crazy! what kind of animal is your cat?
I know right? I'm sorry to hear that.
I feel you. I have been feeling down lately too. I hope things get better.
That's awesome! What are you going to spell?
Oh wow. I'm sure you will win. What is the spelling bee?
It is a challenging task.
It's a big step, and it's going to be hard work and patience! But she'll get it! She's a smart girl. You did great!
That's really hard.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Is there something you can do to get through this?
I know how you feel. I've never been apart from a girl that I really cared about for a week.  It's hard to keep the connection alive.  But you'll get through this.
That's really sad. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have a favorite memory with your dog?
That's so sad. I had lost my dog last summer.
I bet! I bet.  That is so exciting!  How excited?  What will you do?
Oh wow!  That's amazing.  What did you do while you were away?
That's always fun, I like to see the scary movie too.
I hate that kind of movies! I don't get why people watch them.
That sounds great. Where are you going?
I bet it's going to be a great time
That's awesome! I bet it was hard to wait that long for her.
That's great. What language are you learning?
That is great. What did you have?
I love having big meals at my house too!
That sounds so bad! What movie?
I have heard of that one, but I have never seen it. I'll have to check it out.
That's nice. Did she still write to you?
Yeah I love reading old letters.
I know what you mean! I have a fear of being alone in the dark too.
I have done that too.  I was at the woods and saw some people walking.  I thought they were monsters!
I'm proud of my wife too!  What is she doing?
Oh, really? I bet she is! What made you so proud of her?
I'm sure it's an expensive car.
That is terrible. What a pain. I would have been very angry.
That can be nerve wracking. What is your new job?
Oh that's good, you will be fine
It was a bit scary but my dogs are really well cared for.
Oh that sounds scary. I hope everything was fine with them. Did you have a good friend that was going to take care of them?
Oh, I bet you miss her a whole lot?
That's a long time, how long has she been there?
That sucks, but you will be happy to have her home.
I know the feeling. I was away from home for 2 months. It is hard to deal with it, but you will get over it.
That can be scary. What city are you moving to?
That is normal.  You can't just move to a new city without being prepared for anything.  I would suggest that you go to the city and get out and get a feel for it.  You might find that you really like it, and you can't think about the negative side of it.  I hope you get out and get a feel for the city, because that's the best you can do.
That is so rude. Did you have to find another person?
It is very frustrating when that happens. I hate when people don't help out when you're trying to get a job done!
That is so true, it was a thriller movie.
I love that movie! I have been to a movie show in Paris where they showed it. It was so good!
i know what you're talking about.  it can be so nice to not have to work so much and have a lot more free time.
That is a nice thing to be able to have those friends, and it is good they are sharing it.
I'm sorry to hear that, did you yell at the person who was serving it?
I hate eating liver.
That is so cool. What breed is he?
I love labrador retriever mix.
Yeah, dogs are really hard work.
That sucks. I have a friend who is a nurse in California. I've always wanted to live there but never could.
Yeah, I've always wanted to move there too, but my parents are too old to move.
That is horrible. I'm sure you were very upset.
I can understand that.  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to look around.  I was not prepared for the fact that I would be paying a lot of money for a caterer that was not going to do anything.  It was stressful.
I know right! Sometimes they are just so upset about something they think they did.
I hate dealing with difficult customers too.
It sounds fun! I've always wanted to see the world!
That's cool, I'm going to Japan for the first time.
That's crazy!  I'm sorry you had that.  What happened?
That's creepy. Did you call the police?
Oh, that's not very nice of him.
Oh no. Did you try to get him to pay you back?
That's good, what trip are you going on?
I can imagine how that feels, but it sounds like you are doing better than I was last time.
I bet that was frustrating.
That is great! I am happy for you.
That's awesome! I wish I had that kind of time.
I bet she was happy to see you.  What did you order?
Yeah, it's not like you can just go somewhere else and do whatever.  It's like, you're hurting her feelings and making her feel like you're not really hers.
I have seen that movie before. I think it was a really scary movie.
It is one of my favorites. I'm a horror movie fan
Oh wow, that's a lot of work.  But I'm sure it will be worth it in the end if it's what you really want.  I've had 2 kids and I would do it all over again if I could.
I have a friend who is trying. She is a nurse and is so excited.
I'm sure it will arrive on time. It is a book.
That's great! I'm sure it's worth it to have a good book to read.
That's so true. I had in-laws who didn't accept my partner and would not even let us have a family of our own. I felt so lonely and isolated
It sounds like you have a good in-laws.
I am sure it will come around, it takes time.
That's a good point.  I'm starting to think that he might need to learn some discipline.  I hope he will.
That's awesome! How did you plan it?
Yeah, that is a pretty good surprise party.
That's awesome!  I hope she is a good one!
That's so sweet!  I'm glad you're happy with your wife.  I've got to be with my wife for a few more weeks.  She's going to be back home with my parents soon.
I hate roaches! They are the worst. I have to get rid of my dog from them every time he comes back from outside.
I'm not a fan of them either. I have a pet roach that I like to feed them.
That's no big deal, you can still go to another friends party
That's okay. I'm sure you can make up with your friends.
Yeah, I can't wait for the next time she comes home
That's a great story.
Oh yeah, I love going to the movies. I'm going next Friday with my family.
That's awesome, I haven't been in that situation before but I'm sure it was fun.
Oh wow, I bet she appreciated that.  That must have been a kind thing to do of you!
Yeah they are great! They are so useful and can make someone's day a little brighter.
Oh, that's really cool, what puzzle is it from?
I love that, I would have been so happy to have a piece of art that was made just for me and my wife.  I think we should go to Etsy and buy some more of it
Oh wow, that is a long road trip!
I'm so glad you had such a good trip. Where did you go?
That is a good way to travel, not rushing and just enjoying the view!
It's not so bad, but I don't like the feeling of not knowing if I'm safe.
Oh wow, what kind of renovation plans?
I am glad you are keeping it organized, that's a good way to go!
That's cool, how did they graduate?
That's great! What is your child graduating in?
That is a great accomplishment! I've been trying to get healthier for a while now. What kind of pool do you have?
That's cool. I've been going to the pool a few times too.
That is a good thing. You can always meet new people.
I understand.  I was in a relationship for about 10 years and my girlfriend left.
I have heard that one before. What was your impression of it?
That's cool. I've never really listened to that song before, but I've heard the title song. It's a classic, though. I'm glad you enjoy it.
I feel the same way.  I don't want him to feel like he's not a part of the family.
That's good that you're thinking about how to help him, though.  You can't expect a 10-year-old to do anything on his own.  Maybe you can find some things for him to do to help get him more motivated.
I hate that. I don't like it when that happens either.
That is scary.
I feel you. I have had my fair share of frustrations.
I feel you, sometimes I just want to watch a movie without any extras, but they want to make it a little more complicated than that.
Yeah, she really is the best. She's so good and smart, and always puts others first.
Yeah, she's really smart, but also really nice. I'm happy to have her in our family
That's understandable, but just be yourself, you'll get a yes or no.
I can see why you're nervous. But you can't let fear stop you from asking her out.  I'd do the same thing.  You never know!
Oh no! I would have felt so bad! Did you try another store?
I bet it's good. I'm not a big meat eater myself. But I do like the taste of bison. It's so lean, I like it when people say that.
That is a bit gross. Is it a problem?
That sounds like the worst. I bet it's a bit embarrassing for you!
It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler
It's good to know he's safe.
That is so weird, did you get embarrassed?
That must have been very awkward
Oh no.  I'm sorry.  Did he go on vacation?
I understand, I have been in similar situations with my husband, he is always off to a deployment or a mission, but he always comes back to us with a big smile on his face.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! What was wrong with her?
It's good that it turned out okay. I'm sure you are proud of her!
That's a cat. Cats are very particular about their space.
That's crazy, what happened?
I know that feeling. What is the task?
That is not good. You might want to try some new software to help you.
I love The Greatest showman.
That's so cool of him, I'm glad you got to see it!
I bet that sucked.  Did you have to work overtime to make up for it?
Oh no, I'm sure that was frustrating! Did you have to do anything special to get over it?
Oh, I'm sure you're not the first to misread that calendar. I bet you are not the first to do that.
Yeah, I feel bad too. I just hope she is home safe and sound.
That's nice! You must be excited about that.
I'm so happy for you guys!
That's so sad. I'm so sorry for your pet.
That is so sad. I am so sorry. I will pray for your family.
I agree, it's heartbreaking to see them like that. I think we all need a little more compassion and understanding for those in need, and maybe a little less for those that are struggling.
That is very kind of you.  I would do the same if I could.  I have been trying to get more involved.  I just wish there was more support.
That is so sweet! What happened?
That is awesome! What made him do it?
That is the way I feel.
I am glad you have not done it. I am very committed to my wife.
Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that, but that's a pretty cool thing! I've always been fascinated by astronomy.
That's so cool. I bet you were really hoping to see the stars.
I have been with my wife for 30 years now. I think we are at the peak of our relationship. We are getting older and it is hard to find the time to just relax and be ourselves.
It is a big responsibility for her.  I hope she is able to balance that out.
Yeah that's true, she's a great mom. I don't know what I'd do without her.
I know how you feel! My mom is always there for me.
That's awful. I'm going to miss you
Oh yeah, I have been there so many times.  It is a long time since I've been.  It's like the longest drive.
That's awesome, are you going with family or on your own?
i love disneyland too, what are you going to do?
I'm glad you got an A! That must have been hard work. What was it?
That's great! What class is that?
That's great! What are they like?
Yeah that's nice! I have kids too.
That sucks, how long has he been doing so much?
That's great!  I hope he appreciates it.  I would too!
That is unfortunate. What is going on at the job?
I am sorry to hear that. What will you do now?
Oh that's great! Are you excited about the job?
I have, I applied for a job at a big corporation a long time ago, but I never ended up applying. It was a long time ago, though.
I hate going to the club.
I understand. It can be really frustrating when guys are talking to your girlfriend.
That is really sweet, I love it when you have that kind of surprise at work!
I am glad that you were able to be so open with him, and that he came to visit you.
That is terrible. Did you buy it new or second hand?
It's really frustrating when that happens!
It sounds like a tough time, but it is a good job, right?
That's great!  What kind of job are you?
Yeah that would be so mean of him.
I would have been mad too.  I would tell him to apologize to his sister.
That's terrible, what's his name?  Is he going into treatment?
It's hard not knowing the diagnosis of the disease, it is very hard.
That's pretty cool. Did they stay for a while?
That sounds so nice. I hope she was able to catch up with you.
That's great! What's the subject of your test?
I am glad you have been studying hard, and I hope it goes well.
That is nice! What was your kids drawing of?
Yeah that can be very nostalgic.  What kind of drawings were they?
I bet that was a fun memory!
That's so cute! I love the way men think about proposing.
That's crazy! What happened?
It is always a good idea to listen. I am glad that the people up there were okay.
I love puppies! Do you have one at home?
That is so cute!  What breed is she?
It's cute! What is she doing now?
Oh my, that is awful.  I would be so angry.  Did you call the police?
It's like when they ran into a tree and left a note.
That's so cool. What kind of storm was it?
Oh, I am so glad you are alright! Thunderstorms can be scary!  I hope you are alright too!
That is exciting! What field of study are you looking into?
Oh no, you'll be okay! I hope you get in!
That's a good feeling.  What kind of plants did you have in the garden?
I love a garden!  I have a few in my yard and a few in my garden.
That is very kind of your neighbor.  How did you thank him?
That's really nice of your neighbor, they must be a good one.
That's so cool! Congrats! I'm sure he is very proud.
I'm so proud of him! I'm sure he's going to do great things. What are his plans?
That is awesome! What are you planning on doing on your vacation?
It is a wonderful place! Where you are planning on going is not important to me. I am sure you'll have a great time!
That's terrible. Did you get hurt?
I would have been so angry.
I am so angry. They have to get that service down.
I've been a customer for over 10 years and they've never been able to help me with a single thing.
That's so annoying! I hate people who jump into line first. It's like, you're not really even there yet.
It's so rude! I hate when the person who's paying gets to go before everyone else.
That was a disaster. I hope everyone was okay.
It was a scary experience.
I love when that happens, it is so nice of him!  Did you like it?
I love when the people around you show you care and appreciate you!
That's nice. Are you going to go with them?
I am sure they can make an exception.
I'm glad you are excited. Are you expecting a boy or girl?
It is great to have a big family. I hope you all have lots of fun!
That sucks. I am sorry for your family.
That is terrible.  I am sorry you have to deal with that.  Hopefully he is getting better.  It is so sad.  It seems like it is something that can affect anyone at any time.  It must be really frustrating for you.  I am sure you care deeply for him.  I hope it gets easier for him in the future.  It is really sad for families.  I am sure he will always cherish the memories he has of you.  I
Oh, that was a kind gesture. Did they sing it in a karaoke kind of way, or just in a group?
That is nice. What did they sing?
I hate when that happens
I hope you did well on the test!
I am too, what's his age?  What's he into?  I am so proud of my son as well.  What is he into?
That's awesome! I hope he continues to do well!
I'm sure you're looking forward to it!
Yeah, that's the worst part. You just hope and hope that everything goes right.
I am sure it wasn't the brother's fault.  What did he do?
It can happen, maybe he was busy. I would ask him if he can make it.
That sounds good! Do you have anything planned for it?
It is a great day to go out and enjoy the world.
That's a terrible thing to do.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Have you tried counseling?
That is a good thing. Travel advisories are usually just a warning.
Yeah, it was a bit stressful, but nothing that would stop you from flying!
Oh, that's terrible, what happened?
That is terrible, I hope things improve for you.
Oh, I'm sorry, you had to go through that?
That's really cool. I've always been really interested in design and art.
That's great! What did you win?
That's cool. What was the prize for winning the tournament?
I hate spiders!
I'm sure you can overcome it. I've had spider phobias for as long as I can remember.
I agree.
That's true! I have been playing a lot of Fortnite lately, so it's great to see how it's been doing so well!
That is terrible!  Did you order the food you wanted or the other?
I hate when things like that happen. I would have been so upset!
That's good. You have to have family to make it worth it.
Yeah, that is what I was thinking.  I was lonely and I didn't get to see my family.  My wife said she would be back soon.
That's really cool. I have a nephew myself. How fast is he growing?
That sounds so exciting!  What kind of growth is he talking about?
Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that.  What kind was it?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope they can find it soon.
That is a great experience, what high school did you graduate from from?  I graduated from high school a year later than you.  Was it a tough time for you?
That's great. I graduated from high school 20 years ago. I'm 40.
I bet. That's not good.
Oh my god, what were you eating?
Oh wow. What kind tornado?
I hope that the pantry holds up.
I bet that was nice of her.
That's awesome! I hope you're able to keep it.
Wow, that's a rare trait. What makes him that way?
That is wonderful.  What kind of health problems do you have?
I'm sorry you had that happen. Did you report it?
I know, I feel like I should have been home.  I don't know what's wrong with people.  They are so careless!
i would be scared of them as well
I hate snakes. They are so scary and venomous. I'm glad you are not a snake hunter.
That's unfortunate. What happened?
Oh no, I'm sorry. I hope things work out for you.
oh no that's not good
I am sure it was fine.
That's really nice. It's always good to have a partner to have someone to be with.
It can be hard, but I think it's the best.
I'm sure you're all friends
That's great! What's your friend's name?
I know the feeling. It's great that you are doing that.
That sounds like a great attitude to have.
Oh yeah! How old are you two?
That's awesome. I'm happy for you both.
That's the best feeling in the world!
I have never won a scratch off.  What kind did you win it on?  Was it a lottery ticket or something?
I am sorry. Is your grandma very old?
That is a pretty good gift.
I know. I'm so jealous.  I love going to the beach.  I hope you guys can have another vacation soon
That is too bad, I would have loved to go to the beach with you. I hope you had fun despite the rain.
That's great! I'm sure you will do great work there!
I feel the way!
It must have been gross.
That's no fun at all!
Oh, that must be very tiring.
I understand, it can be tough.
I'm sure it will be okay.  Are you moving to a city that you know you will enjoy?
That's great. I'm sure you'll do fine.
Oh, I see.  That's not cool.  Why do you feel like that?
Oh, yes. I hate when they do that too. It's like, why would you want to do that to someone who is already with someone else.
I am excited!
I love the old ones. They are so much better than the new ones.
That is embarrassing. I hope it never happens again
I have had that happen to me, but not as often as people farting.
Wow that is awesome!  How did he do that?
It's a nice surprise.
I agree, people are so lazy.
That's terrible.  I hate it too.  What do you do?
I know how you feel. What are you afraid of?
That sounds like a fun time, I hate going near hightights too.  What happened when you got on the elevator game?
That's a bummer, but I'm sure you'll find a job soon. You've got the right skills, and you'll be fine.
I'm glad that went well.  I've been having some bad days lately and needed to hear back.
That is so exciting! What are your plans?
I'm a fan of Disney too, I've been to Disney World and Disneyland.
I bet.  What kind is it?
That sounds great! What kind of car is it?
I love that.  What kind of school clothes are they getting?
I love Goodwill!
Yeah, it's great to have that kind of kindness from the community. I know how hard it is for people to be able to give, so that's great to help.
That's horrible. Did you tell her you felt that way?
Yeah that would be really bad to do.  What did you do?
That's terrible, do you get upset?
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. Is she busy?
Oh that's sad. Are you going to visit him?
I know what that's like.  I've been there too.  It can be tough.
Yeah I can see that, you need to set goals for yourself and make sure you're doing the right exercises.
Yeah, goals are great, but it's also good to have a little bit of humility, right?
i feel the same way
i agree i hate to see them
That's awesome! I'm so proud of you!
That's really awesome. What was the major?
That sounds like fun! I'm not really into electronics but I know a few people who are.
That's really cool! I've always wanted to get one of those!
That is so nice of you. What did she lose?
Oh that sounds tough.  I hope she is okay.  I'm sure you are trying to help her out.
I agree, I don't care about the politicians, just the country
It's always easy when you're a fanboy.
That's cool. Did you have a computer or did you have to buy one?
Yeah, that's a real bummer.  You're not alone in that, though - I've been there.
That is sad. Do you miss her?
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I have a dog named Luna, and I'm so attached to her. She's such a sweet girl. I'm sure she's watching over you right now.
It's always good to have a good partner
That's amazing, I'm glad to hear that.
That is very sad. How are you handling the situation?
That sounds terrible!  Did you ever report it to the police?
That is crazy, what happened?
I'm sorry I couldn't help, but you can't meet new people when it's dark and you are hiking.
That is so nice of you. I bet it will bring back good memories for you.
Oh, that is so sweet!  I'm sure it was a great way to keep her memory alive.  How old was your puppy?
That's good. He will get through it.
That sucks.  I hope he doesn't have any issues.  Is it a boy or girl?
Oh, I understand. That is very tough. I have two little boys. I don't know what to do.
Yeah, I know that feeling. I used to sleep train my daughter as well. It's tough, but it'll take time!
I've always wanted to see the world, but I've never been.
I have traveled there and it is amazing
I agree.  I've been there twice.  It is a beautiful place.  But I am sure you will go there one of these days.  You deserve it.  It is so beautiful.  I know you will fall in love.  You will be so in love.  I am sure of it.  I know you will be with them.  I know you will.  It's just that you need to be in the right place at the right time.
That sounds nice. I'm always a bit jealous when my friends get to eat free. Did you eat at a restaurant or something you bought on your way?
That is awesome!  What restaurant?
Yeah I know.  I hate it too!
Oh I know that feeling. I was driving last week and there was this guy who was in front of me. I was so annoyed. I had to pull over and take a deep breath. I'm just not going to be able to stop.
That's okay.  It's normal to be a little scared of the dark.  You are not alone in this.  There are plenty of people that are afraid of the dark as well.
That's not normal.
Oh, I see.  That's very kind of you.  What kind of dogs do you see at the shelter?
Oh, I can see why you would be excited about that.
oh that sounds scary, was it a storm?
That's crazy! Did you have candles around to help?
That is so bad, what happened?
I am sorry that happened to you. It is a very bad thing to do. Did it happen when you were not around to see?
I can only imagine.  Did you call a store?
I hate the smell of spoiled milk. I don't know how to get rid of it!
I know how you feel! I was so happy that day.
Yeah I do love it too! It is like a soothing white noise.
that's a terrible thing, how did you do?
Oh wow, that must be so stressful. I can imagine that would make you nervous every time you drive.
I've played a few times.
You are crazy man.
It really is, I've lived here my whole life and I can't imagine living anywhere else. I love the music, the food, the architecture...
That sounds like a blast! I love New Orleans. I've never been, but I've been to the French Quarter at night.
Oh man, you mean when you go out and do a good deed and the other person turns around and does something awful to you? I think you mean that. I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, that is a terrible way to make a living.
I am so jealous. I have not been able to get a job for months.
i know, i was so upset
Oh wow! I'm glad you didn't judge her friend!  That is a really cool experience.  I love trying new foods and drinks, but there are some foods that I just don't know if I can stomach.  I'm sure she would be happy to know that you did that and that you did it with her friend's consent.
That is a bit gross. I would have left if I saw it.
I hate presentations.
That's good! You're going to do great!
i know, i was in that situation with my best friend.
That's a good story! What happened to her? Did you ever see her again?
That is so nice of her.  What was the interest rate on the loan?
I love my mom.
That is horrible. I bet your dishes are still there.
Oh that sucks! I've broken my finger before and it's a total pain.
Oh that sounds nice. What kind of school supplies do you kids need?
I am glad to hear that! I'm a bit more organized than you.
I know!  It's like you have to have everything ready in advance.  I hate that.  And it's hard to get the right stuff.  It makes you feel like the person who has the best time of the year is not even the person with the best stuff.
That's so frustrating. What happened?
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did you get it back?
I would have felt terrible.
I can imagine that! I hate crowds like that. I'm usually at the store around 10A too!
I can imagine.  I have a lot of friends who work in retail, they're always the ones in the checkout lines.
I love the idea of ordering online! I have been thinking about it a lot lately. What do you like to buy online?
I am sorry.  That is a bit gross.  What kind of spider?
Yeah I hate spiders.
Oh, that's okay. I've never been to theater myself.
I can understand why you would feel uneasy about the situation, I've seen some weird stuff in the theater before
I understand that. It can be frustrating.
I understand. It's frustrating. I wish you guys luck.
I would do that for my best friend.
I can imagine. I'm not that good with money and I'm not very good at making smart investments. How long have you been doing this?
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure it was a traumatic event for you.
Oh wow, that is so gross. I can't even imagine.
Yeah, I am pretty good with math, but it's not my strongest subject.
That's great! I'm glad you were able to pass the exam.
I hate waking people up, especially when they are in a bad mood.
Yeah that's the best way to get a cat to play.
Oh that is crazy. What kind of school did you go to?
Oh my! I can't believe that! That's amazing. You're going to change the world!
That is terrible! Did you apply to other schools?
That's terrible. Did you have to look for another college?
That's terrible! Did you call him back?
That's terrible. Did he have any good movies lined up?
I agree.  I was playing games for years before I started playing games for the first time.
That's true. I've been playing a lot more games than ever. I have no idea why I am so into them. I think I like the social aspect.
I know right? It's so hard to find places to go to. I wish it was better in the winter.
I have never been to a roller coaster, I'm not really into thrill rides.
I'm excited too!
That sounds awesome! What major do you study in Electrical Engineering?
That's great! It sounds like you are a very grateful person.
That is a nice memory.  Did you get a job to go buy it?
I love bowling! I've been playing for years. What is your son's name?
I do! I have been since I was a kid!
I would make sure to tell the police about it.
That's a bit unsettling. I hope there aren't any. Are you sure it's just your dogs?
Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you going to try to practice more to be a pro bowler?
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope it didn't ruin your evening
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
I'm sorry.  What happened?
I'm sorry that happened. I hope you can reconnect with your old friends and that life works out for the best.
It's hard to be a single person in a big city, but I'm trying to find my way.
Yeah, it's hard when you have to go through that and then not be able to do it again
That's a lot of work. Maybe you should look for a job that's easier to do part time.
Yeah I feel you!  College is so hard!
That's good to hear. I'm sure you'll do well.
That's great. How did you have such an amazing dinner?
Oh man, that is so good of them! What kind of pizza is it?
Yeah, it is so annoying, but he will be okay. I have had a few of my own and it is so hard.
That sucks. I have two kids and they both have teething issues.
Oh wow, what game?
That's cool. I'm not a big gamer myself. What game is it?
I feel bad for them. I would try to stay away from them
That's a bit frustrating, but at least you are the most responsible one.
I agree!  I love storms, but only when I can be inside with my TV
That is terrible. I hope you and your husband are alright.
That sounds like it. Do you have a lot to do?
That's good to have confidence.
That's awesome! Which artist is it?
That's really cool. I love hearing music from when I was a kid.
That is awesome.  What kind of bowler is he?
Oh, that's great!  I bet it is a bit frustrating when you're playing with someone and they are doing better.  I hope you can still have fun playing with him.
That's great! What's your job?
That's great you are so ready to go.  What are your plans for tomorrow?
Oh well.  I guess you will have to go back to the drawing board and try again.
I can relate to that.  I've made a few mistakes in the past that I'm sure will come back to haunt me.
That is so cool! Where did you go?
Yeah that's great that you got to see them. I hope you get to do more of that.
That is so awesome! Did you guys have a contest?
That's cool! I bet he was happy. What kind of vehicle was it?
That is normal.  What are you worried about?
That is crazy. You should get the money and go!
I bet that was frustrating!
That is so sad.  Did they get away with it?
That sucks, did you try jumpstarting it?
I'm sorry that your car is not starting, but maybe it's not time to replace it yet.
That's okay.  I'm sure you'll do great.  Just take it easy and be yourself
It's normal to have that anxiety, but I think it's a sign of confidence in your work. I'd be worried if you didn't have confidence in yourself.
That's gross, how many dogs did you clean up for?
Yeah I hate it.
Oh, I see.  What happened after that?
I can see why you might feel awkward.
It is a problem for many students.  How did you afford it?
That's nice of your boyfriend.
That's so awesome. What was it for?
That's great. I am proud of you too, you must feel like you did your job right?
Oh that's good! What car was it?
That is awesome, did you find the car online or did you find it used from a dealership?
yea it makes me sad to see
I know right.  I hate when they smoke it.  It is just not healthy.
That's the worst. I've had that problem for years.
i hate that too! i always get the ash on my work clothes, it makes me so embarass
I am so sorry.  That was such a disaster!
That's terrible! Did you lose anything?
That is the worst thing.  I have never had to flush the toilet.  It's the worst.  I don't understand how some people do not do that.  I flush the toilet every time I go to the bathroom.  I think some people do it once in a month or something.
I hate that too
That sounds pretty cool. I'm sure you'll do a great job. What team leader?
I know that feeling.  Are you going to be able to handle the pressure?
That sounds like a lot of anxiety.  Did you get on it?
It's good to get back to something old again! I love that. It's great for kids and adults alike. I hope you guys had a good time at the park!
That is nice! How old are they?
That's great news! I am 40 too and it is nice to know my kids are thinking of me in that way.
Oh my goodness, that is so scary.
That's terrible. Did you get her to the hospital?
I feel bad for that person. What is their name?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope they fix it for you soon.
I'm so glad for you! I love off days
Oh well, maybe you can take the day off to sleep in?
That is creepy. What kind of noises?
That's weird. Did you ever figure out what was going on?
That is terrible!  What happened?
That is understandable, I would be nervous too if I had to present in front of a lot of people!
I am so sorry for your loss.  My aunt passed away a year ago and it was a very sad experience.
It's a tough time.  I hope they found a good solution for her.
That's great. Did you go out with her?
I'm glad that happened. I've been having trouble asking out.
That is so cool. I don't even have a multi tool. I'm a bit old and my hands aren't what they used to be. I don't know what to do when things are broke
That is so cool. I like to have tools on me at all times.
That's exciting! What's your new job?
That is great! I'm sure you will do well in that position.
Oh that's great! I'm sure you're excited!
That's awesome.  I'm a truck driver.  I've been looking for a new SUV.  I've got a truck for work, so I don't need a car for driving.
That's great. You must be really excited.
That's awesome! You must be so excited.
Oh, that is great! I'm glad to hear that life is good. What kind of breakfast do you like?
I can't wait for my next breakfast!
It's always good to be prepared! I'm glad you're thinking ahead.
I feel you, I've been trying to be prepared too. I hope you don't need it.
I know right?  It really makes you appreciate everything and the little things.
That's great to hear about the changes you've made.
That sounds like fun! Where are you going?
That sounds like a good time! Are you two excited?
It's good to see someone supporting a family.
Oh, that's awesome! What kind is it?
That is so cool, how much did it cost?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did they not have a good reason?
That is very unfortunate, why don't they come to your birthday?
I'm glad to hear that it was a nice time for you and your wife to relax.  What were you watching tv for?
That's a nice way to spend the evening.  What did you do after that?
That is terrible! I would have been so mad! Did you get to leave?
Oh man that sucks, I'm sorry you had to deal with that.  That sounds like it could have gone either way.  I'm glad you had someone who was able to step in and help out.
That sounds like a good night's rest, I'm glad you got to do that!
Yeah that sounds nice. I bet they kept you awake!
That's really hard to do without her. I'm sure it's not easy to do alone.
I know how you feel.  I've been waiting on my girlfriend for 4 months.  It's hard not having anyone around, but it's worth it to have a girlfriend.  I just miss her a lot.
That's pretty cool.  I bet he was happy to have found that.
That's really sweet. I'm glad he found it. Did you guys have a good time reminiscing about old times?
That's nice of you.  How long were they away?
That is a good point.  I'm glad you were able to help.  It's always hard being apart.  I hope she has a good trip.  I hope it is not too stressful.  I hope she doesn't have any bad health problems.
Oh no, that sounds really scary! What happened exactly?
Oh man that sounds so bad.
That's no good. Did he get better?
That is so nice. How long did he have it?
That's a common feeling! What happens when you do wait?
I know what you mean. I'm a little anxious about that too.
Yeah, I love dogs too. I have a dog.
I love dogs, I have a couple. I'm a dog owner and I love them!
That is terrible! Did you take her to a vet?
Oh that's so nice of you. I wish I had a vet like you. I'm not sure I could afford it either. I have two cats, Luna and Miko. I have to take them to a vet in the city that I don't really like. I wish I could afford to have them take them in for surgery. I hope they make it through the rest of the surgery okay.
It's really bad. Did it happen recently?
I hope everyone is okay.  That is terrible.  I am sorry for your loss.
That is sad, did you find out why?
That sucks! What happened?
Oh, well, you should consider joining a club.  There are many clubs for people who like to do things on their own.
I feel you. It's like I am the only person in the world. I am so glad to have you to talk to!
i love my car!  what is it?
that's cool
I know what that is like. It is hard to have friends who dont visit you.
I feel you. I wish I lived closer. I've been living in a small town and my friends are in the city and I don't have any friends in the city.
I am so sorry!  What happened?
It's always a shame when food is burnt, but I hope the food was still edible.
That would have been very scary.  Did you hit a person?
i know what you mean.  I once hit a car in a parking lot and i was so scared.  I ran and i didn't see anyone
I love my sister! She always looks out for us and makes sure we're okay!
That's nice. I'm sorry to hear you're sick.
I would have been so scared!
Oh that's terrible, I hope no problems. Did you call the police?
That's nice. What kind of car?
That is a pretty cool car!
I am sorry to hear that!
I feel your pain.  I'm ashamed of my parents because I don't feel they call or text me as often as they should.  I feel like they're always so busy with their own problems that they forget about me!
It is always better to have a good laugh and not have to deal with someone being mean.
I bet they are sorry.  Did they do anything to hurt you?
That is not a common reaction. What was wrong?
That's not good! I hate walking in the dark!
I love to hear that. What is the reason you are so faithful?
That sounds like a really long trip. Are you sure you're ready for that?
Oh no!  What is wrong?
That is terrible. I hope she is not having an affair.
It is always disappointing to miss a movie you want to see.  I hope they release it soon.
That is a pretty good movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy it
That is so nice!
Yeah that is great! I love the beach.
Oh wow! That sounds amazing. What cruise are you going on?
That sounds fun. What's the itinerary like?
Yeah that is a pretty common feeling, especially when it's a hot summer month!
I understand. It can be hard to deal with when you have cravings that you don't want to satisfy.
I'm glad to hear. How long has he had it?
That is amazing! I am so happy for you guys!
I would be mad! What did he do?
That's terrible. What did he do with the bathroom?
I'm sure you'll be great, just be yourself.
I hope you do well.
That sucks. Do they ever get along?
I think you just have to roll your eyes and not pay attention to it.
That is terrible. I am so sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry that happened to you. What did you do next?
I have 2 kids. They were in school for the first time. I was nervous about it.
Yes, my son is going to 9th. He's going to be in 8th now.
It is sad to hear that he passed away.
You must be so sad. I hope he is in a better place.
Oh no! That sounds so scary! What happened?
That sounds pretty crazy. I've been lucky in my life too. But sometimes you don't realize how lucky you are until it happens.  I hope you win again!
That's terrible. I hope you can work things out with her.
It is good that you did not let it happen.
That is true, people have a tendency to look like they are better than they really are.
That was kind of nice of you. You are a good person.
That's so cool. Did you go swimming?
It was nice to relax and have some fun.
I know, it was so scary.  I felt like I was going to fall in a lake.
Oh man, I can imagine that was a scary experience.
I have never lost a pet before. How long did you have the puppy?
That is so sad. I lost a pet of mine too recently and it is very difficult.
It can be. What happened?
That is so annoying.  He should be able to return it.
I love that. What do you like to eat?
That's a nice treat!
That is terrible, I hope you guys get it back on track soon.
I am sorry to hear that, I would have to do more to help out. I would start cleaning and organizing and help out more with your husband.
That is a big accomplishment!
That's awesome. I bet you're very proud.
I'm glad it was your birthday. What did you do?
Oh wow, you are so lucky! I would be happy if my husband did that for me.
That sounds like it was a lot of work! Did you have to go through the boxes?
I can imagine how happy that must have made you feel!
I'm sure it's not that hot in your area.
I am sorry to hear that, that's terrible.  I would have been scared.  I would have just gone outside and called an electrician and had them fix the AC.  That would have been a waste of my money.  I would have been scared of getting bitten.  I would not have gone back in until it was fixed.  I would not go to an electrician.  I would go to a hardware store and get some ice to fix it.  I
Oh wow, that's so cool! Where are you moving to?
I can't wait for my family to get to this new place. It's going to be a lot different than the old one.
That is really awesome! What's your goal?
Yeah I do a lot of yoga.  I'm a yoga teacher.  I love to run, but it's not my favorite thing to do anymore.  I'm trying to get back into it though.  It's good to get my heart rate back up and my blood flow back up!
It's nice to be able to do that!
Oh my gosh, I am so jealous. What is the plan for you?
That is great to have a great year.  What have been the most great weeks you have had?
That is amazing. Congratulations to your husband.
That is so sad to hear.
That's awesome! What is her favorite thing?
Did anyone survive?
That's terrible. It must have been terrifying.
Oh that sounds wonderful! I'm glad it's your baby and you're taking care of them!
I know what you're saying.  Sometimes I feel the same way, but I have to remind myself that I'm a mom and that's what I was put on this earth for, to be a mother and to take care of my child!
I feel for you. What did you eat today?
That's a great attitude to have. I know I did the same with my weight loss.
That's a bit of a scary decision. What do you do?
That's terrible.  You might want to look into other job opportunities.
That sounds fun! What was it like?
Oh, I love the beach!  How many kids did you take?
Oh, wow.  I bet you're so proud of him!  I have two dogs, Luna and Jasper.  They're about 4 and 3 years old, so I'm pretty new to dog training.  I'm pretty happy with Luna's progress - she's a bit of a handful.  I'm trying to get Jasper to potty in the yard.
Yeah, I have a dog too!  He's a little scamp.  He's a little bit of trouble, but he's my little buddy.  He's been potty training for a week now, but I still have to keep an eye on him.  He's a little scallywag!
That can be really tough! Did you move for work?
That's so sad! Did you move away from your old house?
That is great, what position?
i bet you are.  what position do you play?
I'm sorry you're having to go through this. Is this something you've been worried about lately?
That's awful. You are going to have a rough 2 weeks.
I am sorry for your loss.
That's a good point, I think it's a good thing to have a vacation to look back on. I hope you had a good trip.
That is amazing. I have never been able to do that. I can barely eat healthy and then I end up eating junk food and eating it again the next day. I just feel like I'm a failure.
I am sure she is not doing anything wrong.
Yeah, I would have felt bad.
That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what you must feel like. Did you get the card?
I love my cat. I have 2. They always play with me.
That is disgusting. I am so glad you were not hurt.
Oh wow. I bet you feel proud of him! That is a big step for him
That's awesome! I'm so proud of you and your son too!
I'm sure it is a bummer when that happens.  What did happen?
I can understand that. I've been there.
It must have been a bit uncomfortable.
I would be so grossed out by that!  Do you think the roaches had a special deal with the gas station?
That's crazy! I hope you're okay.
I'm so sorry you were hurt! I can't even imagine being hurt that way!
I am sorry. I am sorry for that.
I know right!  I am in school for the same thing.  I'm hoping to get good grades so that I can move forward.  I am a bit nervous though.  It's scary to think that you're in a new situation.
I love when that happens, it's like the mail has come to the door.
It can be a little stressful, especially when it's something that could have gone wrong, but it usually turns out okay in the end.
That is a terrible feeling.
That is so funny. I bet it was embarrassing.
It sounds like fun, what kind of metal were you listening to?
Oh wow! That sounds really hard!
That is true, I had that experience with my kids. They are now in college and I am back home.
I know what you mean. I was supposed to go to a concert but it rained on the way there and I ended up having a great time.
That's terrible! What kind of tumor is it?
That is terrible, I hope you are doing okay, my brother was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago and he is doing okay.  I hope your father is doing okay.
That's cool. I love it too.
I have been thinking about it too! I have to get my kid to go to it with me.
That is pretty sweet!  Did you get drunk?
I'm glad you had a fun time, that sounds like a great spot!  Did you guys hit it up a few more nights?
Oh, I understand.  What kind of drink were it?
That is nice!  I love the sentimental value of those kinds of things.
Yeah, that's really cool, I bet you feel a lot of nostalgia from it
I know right, but sometimes I like to do the "I love you's" and "I miss you"s.
I'm sure she was disappointed. But what about you?
It's normal to feel scared when you are going up high.
That's understandable. What are you afraid of?
I'm a party animal. I'd be there too.
Oh no! That is terrible. I hope they didn't arrest anyone.
That's terrible. Did she say why?
Yeah that is terrible. What was the reason?
That is too bad. I have never heard of a haunted house.
It was scary for me too.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh yeah, I know that feeling.  She snores so loud it is like thunder.  It is so bad that it wakes me up.  It makes me feel like the house is going to collapse.
Oh wow, what kind was it?
That sounds like so much fun! What kind of course is it?
That is great news!  What is the baby's name?
That sounds fun! Congratulations!
That's awesome! What are you going to do?
I love going to Universal Studios!
Oh wow, that's a long time to be by yourself?
That's not good. How did you find yourself alone?
I'm sorry, what did you get on that test?
That is awesome. You must be so proud of yourself!
It's a pity she has to leave.
That is sad. I hope you get your car fixed soon.
That's great! I'm so happy for you.
I love it! What is the complex like?
That's good! What kind of job is it?
I would have been a bit surprised if the interview went well, but I'm glad it did!
Yeah, I bet you were impressed by her skills.
Yeah, I love when that happens. I've been playing a little bit lately but I'm still a total novice.
I'm sorry that happened to you. What happened?
Yeah, scholarships can be tough to get and it's frustrating.
I am very optimistic, I believe everything will work out for the best.
Yeah that's true. I am excited for it to be done
Yeah that's pretty cool! What did they study?
That is really nice.
That's good, I like being able to be alone, but not being lonely
That's great. Do you like to go to the park or something?
Oh no! That's not good!  Did you take it to the vet?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you take her to the vet?
That's great! What's the big surprise?
I have a baby shower coming up.  Do you think you're going?
Oh my god that's nice of them, that's really cool.
I can see how that's a good memory.
That's a lot of courage to take. Where did you go?
I bet that was an exciting trip! Did you have a great time?
That's awesome! What kind of flying is she?
It's not easy to fly alone, especially if you are traveling with a lot of luggage.
I don't trust people either. I'm not sure why, but I just don't trust them.
Oh that's terrible. What did you do?
Oh man, that's terrible!
Yeah that sounds like the kind of scam I would fall for.
That is so exciting!  Are you ready for motherhood?
That's great news! Congratulations! How long until the baby is born?
That's really cool. Where did you go?
It must have been a big stress. But you did it!
That's awful, what did it happen?
Oh no. Did she cheat on him?
That's exciting. What are your plans?
Oh, that's great! Congratulations! How long are you expecting to wait before meeting the baby?
Yeah, it sounds like a lot of fun.  Did you guys have fun?
I have never gone on one of those floats before. How did you feel about it?
Oh wow. That's really interesting. Did she get a collar?
Yeah that's sad, but that's not surprising, dogs are old and can get sick or old too.
Yeah it is hard when people don't understand you and you're still interested.
Oh my, I would have been too.  That is horrible.  How did you deal with that?
Oh wow. Did you call the police?
Oh wow. That's a terrible thing. I'm sorry he did that.
That's so exciting! Are you sure it will be a boy?
Oh, I hope you have a boy too, but if he's a girl, I don't mind!
Oh no. I'm so sorry.  How are she doing?
That's really sad. What happened?
That's cool, I've been in the band myself.
Oh my, I would have been terrified!
I'm not a big elevator fan either.
That is pretty wild.
It is always a blessing to have a place of our own. I wish I could afford it, but unfortunately I'm a bit short on the cash.
I'm sure that's wonderful. I'm glad you're happy.
That must have been really stressful.
I can imagine! Did you call 911?
That's awesome. What did he say?
I am sure he did great.  I am sure you are a great leader too.
I know the feeling. Sometimes it's hard to find the right words!
I'm sure it does.
That is so nice! What movies are they watching?
That's a fun family activity!
Yeah I am glad you are so happy
That is awesome, what are you planning to do now?
I know. I was really upset.
Oh well, that's okay. You should try to find another job.
That is so terrible!
That's good. You must have had a bad experience.
I'm sure it was not a big deal.
I would be upset.  Did she not hear?  She should be.  That dish is very expensive.
That is great! Where you moving?
That sounds like you are looking forward to it.  What are you looking to move into?
That's great. What was the emergency?
I love that! I wish I could be that prepared for emergencies.
I'm sure it was a bad moment.
That's funny, but what was it that you did at that party?
I'm glad he graduated. How did he do?
That's awesome. What is your son studying for?
Oh, I know. I hate when they do that too.
I would have. That's not how you handle it.
Oh, I'm sorry. What makes it angry?
That is true, people often think they have more friends than they actually do.
That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of swimming?
Oh, that sounds fun! I love swimming too, but it's a lot of getting in and out. I don't get excited like you do.
That is very sweet of you, I am sure she appreciated that
It's nice to be able to help your wife.
That's nice. How many?
I know how that feels! I'm a bit jealous, but at least they're good for you. How old are they?
Oh yeah? What kind of party?
I am sure you were. What kind of party was it?
It sounds like a lot of damage was done. Did you have any damage to your home as a result?
I'm glad it didn't happen.  I don't think I could handle it.
It sounds like she was very good! How old is she?
That's so cool! How old was she?
It's okay. You're not alone.
Yeah I have done that. It's hard.
That is sad. Is he not happy with his new job?
I am sorry to hear. I think you have every right to be upset. You are his sibling after all.
I hate when food has something in it that I don't know where it came from!
Oh wow! That's pretty disgusting! What kind of food was it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have fun?
That's a fun experience! What was your favorite one to ride?
That's terrible. Did you tell him how to feel about making fun of others?
That's not very good of a friend to do that, but I guess he was trying to apologize.
Oh, I know how you feel.
I understand.  Do you have to go to any parties?  If so, you should try to be more outgoing.  You might find it easier for others to talk to if you do so.
Oh that? What did they do?
Oh, that's not good.  Why do you feel that?
That's a good movie, I'm sorry to hear that you were afraid.
Yeah, I'm not sure what I would have done if I was in the same situation as you.
It was sad for you too. I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.  I know it can be hard.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did she leave for a trip or something?
That's terrible. Did she leave because you were not good enough?
That's a great time to spend with the family.
I bet! I've never been.
That is terrible.  What happens when people talk down to you?
I feel you, I'm a shy person too.  What do you think you could say?
It's great when family members come together, it's always nice to have a time together
That is so nice. It is always a good time when you are with your family.
I love parties! What did you get for your birthday?
Oh wow, what happened?  Did they not know you were going to be so happy?
Oh, I know.  I hate it when people are mean.
I agree.  I have never seen people being mean to others.  They should just be kind and respectful.
That is understandable, but you could try talking to them about it
Oh, yeah, I've been there.  How do you start?
That is horrible.
That is horrible.  What is wrong with your dog?
I would have told her to keep quiet. I would have asked her if she was okay. If not, then I would call the police. I wouldn't let it disturb me. I am not sure how long she has been doing this, and it's been at least 2 or more nights.
I know right, that's crazy! I'm sorry to hear that you're having to deal with this.
That is good, you are not afraid to let someone in your life that you don't trust.
Oh man. I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of stuff do you mean?
That's a big achievement. You should be proud of yourself.
It's great that you're working towards your goal. I'm sure you'll be successful.
Oh yeah. What's the problem with the teeth?
That is so true! It is like, you know it's coming, but you don't want it to come.
Oh that's great!  How did he end up there?
I can see why he's got a job.
Yeah, I know right. They're all super rich and famous. I just don't really care about that part of life, I'd rather be doing my own thing.
That sounds like fun! What happened?
Oh that sounds fun! What happened after?
That's awesome. What kind of car is it?
That's awesome!  I've always been a Toyota fan.  I've got a 1993 Toyota Camry.  It's been with me for 15 years.  It just broke down on me last week.  It's a real pain to fix!  I'm thinking of trading it in for something new.  What car are you going with?
That is so gross. I don't know what to do with bugs. I would freak out if I saw one like that!
That is disgusting, what kind of bug was it?
That is so sweet!  What kind of cheese was it?
That's really nice of her! I'm glad you got to try the cheese!
That's cool! I've never had a cheddar from Tillamook before.
It's a good idea to check out the website for more information.
I am sorry about your loss. I hope you are able to move on.
I am so sorry for your loss.
Oh no, I hate when the weather doesn't cooperate.
That is a shame, you should have checked before you went
Oh, that sounds like fun. Did you all have fun together?
Yeah that's cool. I'm sure it was fun for you.
I am sure it was good.
That sounds like a great time.  How long have you guys been together?
I agree. It's hard to see the good in some people's attitudes.
Yeah I agree.  I think we need to focus on the things we have in common and not so much on the differences.
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm so sorry that you have to go through that. I know it's hard to even say the word.
Oh my. I am sorry to hear that. I am glad that you have each other to support each other through this difficult time.
I am sure you were a great sibling.
Oh, I bet she was really sad about that. Did you call and apologize for not visiting?
I love live music.  Is this one of your favorites?
I do not. I will have to look up their music. I am not familiar with either of these bands.
It sounds like your property management is doing a pretty great job.
I hope you find a place you can call home soon! I hope you can get your issues with the management company resolved soon.
It is a lot of work, but it is a lot of fun.
It is good for them to go back to school.  I know how that can feel.
I bet it was fun.
That is so exciting! What did you do?
That sounds like a lot of fun! What did you do there?
That is crazy! I bet on it.
That's awesome, but I'm still waiting to hear if I'll win.
That's so awesome!  Congratulations!  How long will it be for?
It's always nice to see that the hardworking people in our world get to have a little bit of a reward
It sounds like you have a son.  That's a big accomplishment.
That sounds great! How long has your son been looking to buy the house?
That is terrible. What kind of places do you eat?
I can't understand why you guys can't agree on anything. I've tried to be patient, but it's getting so frustrating.
I'm not sure what you mean by that.  You want to sue for making PB&J.  That is a pretty silly idea.
Oh yeah. I'm happy it's Friday too, I don't know why we don't have a day off more often.
That is great news!  I am also off today.  I work a lot and have no one around me.  I am a little happy.  Friday is a good time.  Friday, I'm a little sad.
Yeah, that's a pretty common problem with friends.  What did they fight about?
That's understandable, it is hard to deal with someone you care about, but you should try to find ways to make your relationship work.
I have lupus as well and I am trying to get my diet to be more healthy.
I hope it works for you! I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh wow that must have been so terrifying.  I'm glad you are safe.  What city was it in?
Yeah, I've seen some terrible tornadoes. I hope you're okay.
That's awesome! I'm in a similar situation.
It sounds like you are very happy.
That is so fun. I love decorating the house with the family.
That's nice. I love the holiday too, especially Christmas.
That's great! What do you do with your sister-in-law?
That is great. What kind of person is she?
It's always a bummer when the weather doesn't cooperate.  I'm sorry that happened.  I hope you get to go back soon.  It's always better when it's sunny.
It's a good thing that it rained. I'm sure you'll go again soon!
I hope you both get what you want!
I am glad he got the promotion.
That is nice! It is good to be kind to people.  I would never do something like that.
Oh, that's a little creepy.  I'm sorry you had to go through that.  I can understand why you would be a little uncomfortable.
That must have made you feel bad.  Did you tell her?
That is really bad. What did she tell you?
That's terrifying. What was inside?
That is a funny story. Did you call the police?
That sounds like a great time!
I'm sorry that happened to you.  Did you guys watch a movie about drama?
Oh no, that is so sad. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I know how much you love your pet.
That must have been hard for you, I know how much you love your dogs.
That is very kind of you, it would have been nice if she knew.
That was very kind of you.
I have lupus, it's a real pain in the neck!
I hope it works out for you.
That's terrible. You need to tell him to stop.
It's like she thinks it's an accident or she's doing it on purpose.
That is awful! I'm sorry to hear that.
That's terrible!
Oh wow, that's awesome! How much did you win?
Did you win the jackpot?
That's awesome, how much did it cost you to get the money?
That's a bad experience. Did you get your money back?
Oh my gosh that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. I would have gotten so upset.
I bet. Did you tell him that it was wrong?
I know that feeling well! It can be hard to see the bigger picture, but you should never let your emotions get you into a situation where it's bad. You should be the voice that helps her!
Oh, I hope it wasn't anything bad! Did you check if it was a scam?
I'm sorry to hear that, did anyone get your mail?
That's terrible, I hope the person who did that is held accountable.
That is true, but you never know.
I love mexican food, it's one of my favorite foods. What was your favorite part?
That is nice of her to come visit. I hope she had a great time and a safe trip.
I am sure you are going to crush it.
It is a great feeling to know you are prepared!
That sounds like fun. Did you like it?
That was fun! Did you get to meet any hockey players?
That is terrible! I hate when that happens!
I would've been worried about it too, I hate seeing animals running around without a leash.  It was a nice run and I would've wanted to see the dog but it was too fast and it ran off!  I'm sure the dog is now running around the city!
It's tough, but it will get better.  You can't stay down for long.
That is terrible news, I am sorry for your loss.
I bet it gets a little lonely.  Is he gone for long periods of time?
That is not a good sign. I would get out of your house as fast as you can!
That's great! I'm so happy for you!
Well that's good for him and for you!
That's really nice of you, what course was it?
I know the feeling. What kind?
I know, I feel the same way, but I have a lot of family around.
I bet you felt that way.  Did you see anyone else?
I hate when people do that. I hope you didn't get into an accident!
I am so sorry to hear that.  I have never seen it but I have seen some of the episodes.  It's a very good show.
I haven't seen the show yet but I've heard it's a good one. I'll definitely watch it.
That is the best. What is the show?
Yeah that sounds good. I hope you guys are both happy!
Oh no. Are you moving to the south?
Oh no, I hope everything goes well for you and your family.
I'm sorry to hear that. I bet it's not fun!
That's great! What kind of kids are there?
It was necessary?
That's terrible, did you get to see them?
That's so cute! I bet you had to feed him a lot!
I love animals. I'm sure he was lonely.
That is so creepy. Did you answer it?
That's not good. Did you try to call back?
That's so exciting! What's your name?
That is great! Congratulations!
It's always fun to dress up in costume. I like to dress up in a costume for Halloween, but my costume for Halloween was the only thing my kids were excited to wear.
I have a great sense of humor, so I love Halloween costumes.
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I've lost my home twice in my lifetime, and it was my home. It's so hard to see your home go up in smoke and ashes.
That is terrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.
Oh no, how did you escape?
I am glad you were okay!
It's always a little nerve-wracking when you meet the teacher of a child.
That's great.  I hope you all have a good year.  I am sure you will.
I've heard that one was pretty bad.
That's too bad, I've been in the same situation. I didn't like it, but I was a kid and I loved horror movies.
I love high school year books. What was your favorite year?
I am sorry you were not happy with the memories of your school days.
That sucks. I've lost a few friends over time too. I'm not as good of a dancer as I used to be.
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how it is when you lose touch. I hope they stay in touch.
That is pretty cool. What did he do?
That sounds scary. Did you get it back?
It sounds like she is growing up to be a great person!
That is awesome! I'm so proud of you for her hard work!
That's exciting.  What are you doing on vacation?
It's going to be a great time! I've never been to Daytona.
I love Daytona!
That's fun! I'm sure you will have a good time! What kind of casino will you be going to?
I love Blackjack as well, I'm glad you guys are going to have some fun!
That sucks. I would not have reacted that way.
That sounds terrible. Did you try talking to them about it?
I am sorry about your father. What kind of vacation were you on?
That sounds sad, but it sounds like it was a good trip.
That's awesome! I love winning lottery.
I'm so happy for you, you must be so relieved. I have a lottery ticket too and I haven't won anything yet.
That's awesome! What did he do?
That sounds amazing, what award was it?
I hope you got to enjoy your prize.
I hate when that happens, it makes you mad and want to do it yourself.
That sounds like she was trying to get away with something she didn't.
That's nice of you guys! I'm sure your son appreciated the gift.
Oh, that's so sweet. What was he little for?
It must have been scary. Did you get hurt?
Oh, that is a funny story.  Did he ever find out?
I can only dream of that!
I am glad to hear that you guys have that financial stability
That's crazy!  I've never fallen like that!
That's crazy! I'm sure the baby was so excited to meet you!
It can be lonely when you are married to one person. I'm sure you miss him!
I am sure it's not the same as having someone with whom you share life.
I can't wait for them to be older and move out, but it's hard to let go of them as they grow older.  I hope they stay close.  How old are they?  Are they in elementary, middle, or high school?  How old are they?
I am glad they are moving out of the house.
That's awesome! Did you take it at least twice more?
It's good that you were tired. I'm not a fan of taking exams, but I guess that's what you have to do.
It was so sweet! Did you go on a cruise or something?
That is nice. What was your favorite part of the trip?
I would feel the same way.  Did you apologize to her?
I'm so sorry that you had to deal with that. I know that it's a hard lesson to learn but sometimes it's necessary to do what you think is right even if it's hard.
That sounds like a good deal
I'm jealous.  Where in Florida do you plan on going?
I love lottery tickets!  What kind of lottery was it?
That would be nice, but it was only a few dollars.
That sucks.  I have a good friend from college who moved away last year.
I hope your friend calls you back.
That's horrible.  Did you get the person's license?
Oh, my god.  That is horrible.  I'm sorry to say this, but it's a miracle you are okay.  You must be so relieved.  I'm not even sure if I can ever go back to driving.
That's a pretty bad situation.  How long were they watching?
Oh that's so sad.  I hope everything was alright.
That's great to hear. It's good to feel good about life. What kind of relationships?
Yeah I am. I have been feeling great about life recently. My relationships have been going very well I am not, I just got out of a relationship that lasted for 6 years. I am looking forward to this new chapter of my life. I have a lot to be grateful for.
I am happy for you, that's awesome!
It was my sister! I was so happy. I was expecting something from my boyfriend, but it was my sister.
That is terrible. Did you talk to her?
Yeah, it's the little things that can be really annoying.
That's sad! How old was the baby?
Oh no! That's so sad, I hope everything turns out well!
That's a great show. I haven't seen it in a while.
I've seen it! I love it! I'm always looking for something new to watch!
That's right. I was sad to see them close.
It really does. It's a shame they shut down the stores.
Oh that's terrible.  I hope she didn't mind as much as I do.
Yeah, that's what happens when you get busy with work and kids.
That is so true, you should be with the person you love.
Yeah, I think that's right. I don't think cheating is a good thing to do.
I'm sure that is not fun.  What do they do?
That is a lot of time to sit in a room. I wish they could have some more time together.
That's nice! How old is he?
I hope he enjoys it!
That's great. What is your favorite holiday?
Yeah, that is the thing. You get so used to the holidays, you forget what it's all about. I think the best part is that you get to see all the family you haven't seen in a long while.
I have seen that before, it can be scary.
That is bad news. Are you safe?
I'm not much of video games, but I love playing them.
I've been a huge World of Warcraft fan too. What's your favorite expansion?
That's awesome!  Congratulations!
It's good for you to get that promotion!
I know! It's like a work of art.
I understand why you like that. It is nice to be able to find what you are looking for easily.
Oh no.  That is awful.  Why didn't he tell you?
I can't imagine what you're going through right now, but at least you have your time to think about things you want to do in the future.
That's so cool! I've been trying to get her to potty for hours!
That's awesome! How many?
Oh I see!  What's her name?
I bet you do! I have two and they are both such sweethearts.
Oh that's interesting.  What degree is it?
It's great that you are so enthusiastic about your future.
Oh that is sad. What was it?
That can be tough, I'm sure you were feeling a little jealous.
I love The Lion King.  I haven't seen it in a while.  It's so much fun to watch.
It's great you have a connection with your daughter.
I don't know what you are talking about.
That is too bad.  What happened?
Oh no. I have been there before.
It can be tough when it comes to the week, I hope you get back on track soon!
That is terrible, how long have you been working for the company?
That's awful. What happened?
It is sad too. We need to work together as one nation and not be so divided. I don't know how we get there though.
That sucks, do you like having them around?
That is a long way to go. I have a family member in the same city but they live far away in another part of the state. I know how it feels.
Oh no! Did he get it from eating something?
That is terrible! I hope he gets it checked out.
That's terrible. What was his name?
Yeah, that's a terrible way to start the week
I know the feeling!  I was in the middle of a storm last year and the power went out.
I know!  I hate the thunderstorm, and it always makes me feel like the world is ending.
Oh my! I bet that was fun!
That is so cool, I love finding those kinds of things. What was it used for?
Oh wow!  I would have been so upset!  I hate spiders.
Oh wow. Did it leave a mark on you?
That's so exciting! What are you studying for?
That's a lot of pressure! I hope you do well!
That's awesome! Are you going to give it on a specific topic?
I am sure you'll do great.  You'll be nervous, but you'll do your job!
I am sure it was for good reasons!
I love selling stuff. I used to do it all the time when I was young
I am sure you do, you have been married for 20 years.
I know what you mean. I think that's what makes it easier to keep things going when you're having trouble.
That is terrible. I am sure it was a very scary experience.
I've never had a house in a hurricane, that's scary.
Yeah that's so frustrating. I've had flights like that happen before and they just ignore you. I'm so tired and irate.
That is so rude of them. I would not fly them.
That sounds amazing. What is it that you want to do?
That's really cool. I'm glad that it worked out well for you.
That's cool, I love fishing.
Yeah I love fishing. I've never been very good at it though, but I enjoy it.
That sucks. Did anyone laugh?
Oh my goodness!  That is terrible.
That's really nice of them to do that for you.
Oh, yeah, I've had those moments too where I'm thinking about the battery running out and it's too late.
That's awesome! What team are you rooting for?
I'm a football fan!
Oh no, I hope you were not hurt.
I would have been very mad!
That was cool. Did he go there?
That is awesome! Congrats to your brother.
That is really nice of them!
Yeah that is the kind of thing I like to hear about, the kind of kindness that makes life a little bit better
Oh that is a horrible thing to see. Did you yell at the dog?
I know right! I was so mad! I was like "what the heck! You're a dog, not a petting zoo! Why are you jumping over there and knocking people over?" I hope they are responsible and they will be more careful in the future.
That is terrible. I have had that happen to my car.
That sucks, hope you don't get into too much trouble with it.
That is terrible. Did they steal anything else?
That's terrible.  Did they leave?
It is very exciting, I am a little jealous, I have not been trekking for so long.
I'm glad you had a good time.  Did it go well?
That's so cool. I love rock music.
That is awesome. What was their music?
That is so cool! I love bowling!
That is really cool!  I have never been good at anything, but I have learned to bowl.  It's a great way to be able to play with friends.  What's your favorite part about it?
That is disgusting. I hate it when that happens.
That's so sad. Did you call your dog?
That's awesome. What kind of debt are we talking about?
I'm glad for your good luck
That's great! I'm sure you'll learn from your mistakes.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's tough sometimes. But you have to keep going.
That's great! What's your major?
That's great! I'm sure you will do great!
That is great!
I can imagine. I have had to sell a house for a lot of money. I'm glad you got the good luck you needed!
Oh no! That's not fun, what did you do?
I love the humor.
Yeah that is a nice car. I bet you were happy for him though?
That's a pretty sweet car! I'm sure he will. I have a 2000 Honda Civic and it has held me together for a long time. I'm not sure I could afford another car right now, though.
I have never had to upgrade before. I am glad you got a good one.
That's awesome! I have been wanting to get a new car.
I love that! Throwback hits. I like that too.
It's always good to reminisce about the past.
That's terrible! How old was he?
I know it can't be good...
That's great! I'm sure you'll love it! I've moved a few apartments recently, it's a lot of work.
That's great, you're lucky to get away from them!
That must've been frustrating, I'm sure it was!
I bet that made you feel terrible.  I've done that before too and I felt awful.
I love family reunions! I haven't had one in a while, but I'm excited! What kind of family reunion are you having?
That is great! I hope everyone has fun!
I'm happy for you! What's your personal record?
That is awesome. I love working out. It's so great to be able to do it and see the results. I have been wanting to start working out more.
That sounds great! What are you going to do?
I love that you've been working out for a while now. I have to do the same thing to feel good about the future.
I love bowling, and I bet that's a really cool custom ball.  Did your brother buy it?
It's really cool to see people improving over time, and it's good for them to have the opportunity to do so.
Yeah, I would not have done that either.
Yeah, that is what I would do too. I would also consider putting earplugs in, I know it sounds silly, but some people can't sleep with ears plugged. I hope you get some good sleep tonight
That's terrible.  Did they ever calm down and go away?  Or did you just have to move on?
That is funny.  I think you should try to relax a bit.  It's not like you're going to start singing and playing the piano.
I bet it was pretty spooky. What did you hear?
Oh that's creepy. I would be so freaked out. Did you tell your dad about it?
That's so exciting! I've never traveled abroad. What city are they in?
That is so cool. I wish you the best of luck.
Oh that was nice.  Did you go to church?
That's a bummer. Christmas was always my favorite time of year.
Oh wow, that's great! Did you end up getting a job offer?
That's great! I hope you got the job!
I have never been in that kind of situation. How did you react?
Oh my.
I stress eat a lot too.  I had to get a gastric surgery a few years ago.
That is good news, but also good that you are aware of your body and want to control it.
I hate when people get a new car and they don't tell anyone about it. I would be so jealous!
I bet you feel bad about yourself when you're driving your beat up Chevy. I mean it.
i understand, i hope i get to meet a good one
I understand. I'm a little jealous. But you will be safe.
That sounds like a great move. What are the pros and cons of the move?
Oh, I hope it is quiet!
Oh that's a bad one.  How did they do that?
I have never heard of that before. How do you deal with such a thing?
That is very fortunate. I have never been in your shoes.
I can relate. I'm always thinking about my parents, how they've been so generous and supportive. I feel so thankful to them.
Oh, I'm so glad you did! I'm not exactly crafty like you, but I love to make things! I love sewing and embroidery!
That sounds so fun!  I would love a new blanket.  Did your friends like them?
Oh, what was the trip like?
I've been there, it's beautiful!  What was your favorite part of the trip?
That's a great reason to appreciate your family.  How many family members do you have?
I know what you're talking about. I used to always think about the things I had, but now I think about the things I'm thankful for. It's a good realization to make.
I love dogs too!  What kind is it?
It does! I have two dogs!
It is normal, it is a big step for a child to move out of the house and start school.
I know the feeling! I've got a lot of friends from last year and they all go to the same school! I'm worried that I'll miss them too much. I've never been away from my parents for a week before!
That's a good thing, it's good to have self-awareness!
That is good news! You are a good person.
I bet you do! I hope you do great.
That's awesome. You must be excited. What are you going to be studying?
That's so awesome!  How much did he want?
It's great that you're excited about his future.
That sounds great. I am so happy for you!
I would love to get one of those. I don't know how you are doing it but I hope you are going for it!
That's so sad, did you guys hit?
Oh no! Did the other people involved in the accident stop?
That is nice, do you have any kids of your own?
I can relate, my kids all go to college next week.  It is hard to believe they will be gone for 3 years.
That's good! It can be scary sometimes. I am glad you feel better about yourself.
That's great!  You should keep working out.  How many pounds did you lose?
I like grocery shopping!
Oh, that sounds great!  I love Indian food, especially curry!
I love trying out different foods. What did you eat?
That's a nice way to look at it.  I'm not a fan of green beans myself, but they're okay in a casserole or something like that.
Oh, that's terrible! What happened?
That's not good, did he scare you?
That must have been very scary. Did you feel bad?
That is so gross. I hope you didn't get sick.
Oh man, that's a tragic thing. I'm so sorry.
It's a shame that he was not able to find peace, I hope he was at peace.  I am not a fan of his work, but it's hard to be against something that has such positive impact on society.  I think we need to be more compassionate towards people who are struggling with their mental health and just need a little more help and understanding.
That is a good point.
That's too bad. Did you try calling her and she said she was busy?
That's awesome. I'm glad you got to experience it with her. It's always nice to be around the family again.
I'm not sure what you're trying to say, I think you're just having some trouble with the text format?
I'm glad that you guys won.
That is so unfair!
I can understand that, but I think that's what kids are supposed to learn, and they are! I just wish I could have learned in a different way when I was. I was a bit of a trouble maker, and my grades reflected that.

That is a very good point.
I love hearing kids learn new things.  I remember my first words being "mama" and "dada" when I was little.  It's fun to hear my grandkids say words like that now.
That is so awesome!  I have a few friends who speak two languages.
Oh no. Did they move in another house?
It is funny how life works out sometimes.
Oh no! Did you take the cat to the vet?
I am sure it was a good cat though.
I can imagine that. I have had friends like that, but they are very rare.
Yeah, it's amazing what people can accomplish when pushed to the limit. I know how you mean. My sister is a bit more of a mess, but she's still the same person she was before. I don't know what makes me better. I just try to help her.
That is so awesome! I love watching TV too, I haven't been to a movie theater in years.
I've never used Hulu Live before but I think it's time to try it out! I love to watch TV too!
oh that's terrible
That's horrible. I hope the cat is okay.
Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.  I can only imagine how difficult it would be.  I have had to lose my two daughters in the car in an accident, and I have lost my son in a drunk driver in a drunk driver in an accident.  It is a never-ending list of people who have taken my children from me.
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, my heart goes out to you. I hope you are okay
That's really kind of them.  I bet that was fun.
That's so nice. I would do the same thing.
Oh, I bet you're nervous about that! What's going on?
Oh no, that's terrible!  What are you and where you headed to go to?
I agree. I hate when people are mean to animals.
That's so true, people are always being mean to animals. I have never been mean to animals either, they are my pets, my dog and my cat.
I love Christmas too.  I think it's a great time to look back and remember the good times.  Do you think you'll be able to get back to Christmas next year?
That's nice, I'm sure you'll always look back on those days with a smile. I'm sure you'll always look back on those days with a smile. I think I'll always look back on them with a smile.  I'm sure you'll always look back with a smile.
That is crazy. I have never been to a restaurant.
I know someone like that.
I bet you are! What city are you moving to?
That is great! What are you moving to?
That's good that you prepared.
that is good to know
That must have been a lot to take in.  How long have you known them?  Did they live in a different state?
I'm happy for you.
I bet.  How sick was she last time?  Did she have a tooth absitively or was it a dental problem?
That's a good point.  You're right, it's not just about the procedure itself but the stress that comes with it.
I am sorry for your loss.
Oh wow, that is very nice of you to be so kind.  Did you live in the same house as her?
It's always good to have a plan for emergencies.
It's great that they were able to help.
It's good that you're preparing for your move!
That's crazy! Are you going anywhere exciting or exciting?
That's nice.  I'm glad you found each other.
Yeah that's a great feeling, I'm so happy for you!  What made you choose each other over someone younger?
That is so cool! I don't usually listen to that station either. Did you like it?
That's awesome! What kind of music do you like?
That's awesome. What did you do well on it?
That sucks. Are you studying for the final exam as well?
I love golf! I'm not the best player but I love watching it!
That's great! I love golf.
That is awesome!  I've been a big golf fan for years.  What's your name?  I love watching the guys compete!
That's cool.  How often do you skydive yourself?
That's really cool. I have never been sky diving, but my brother is and he says it is so much fun.
That is a good thing!
That's awesome. What do you like to do in your free time?
I can imagine how that feels.
That is so frustrating!
i am sorry to hear that. I hope you are doing better now
That's really tough, I'm sorry you lost your horse.  Did you find out about the cancer in time to do anything about it?
That must be so exciting. Did you have fun waiting?
I am sure you are excited to see him.
Oh really? Why is that?
that is awesome. i wish i had the courage to do the same.
That is nice of her.  Is she going to visit you?
Oh, that's great!  I love taking language courses.  I'm sure she will do great!
That's a lot to do. I hope she's home before the weather gets too bad!
Yeah, I'm not worried either, but I'm a bit worried that she won't come back to me in a clean house. I'm not going to make her do it. I'll do it myself, and she can just come in and be all clean and stuff.  But I'm sure she'll come back to me in the end.
That's a pretty big mistake!  Do you know why you did it?
i know how you feel.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's terrible. I hate when that happens.
oh no, did you hurt anyone?
Oh my, that must have been frustrating.
That's so cool. I'm sure you're excited to have your wife back!
I know that is a long time away.  Are you guys having a good time while she is away?
That's terrible. How long did you live there before moving?
I've moved around a lot. It can be scary. But you have friends to help you out.
That sounds really hard. Did you have to move somewhere new?
Oh wow, where are you living? I am from the north. What kind of places were rents and gas?
That's a long drive. Did you enjoy it?
I am glad you made it safely.
Oh no, I hope you both are okay.
Oh wow, that is unfortunate. I hope she feels better soon.
That is true, I'm going to school for a year now. I'm a teacher.
That is understandable, how long did you stay home?
It's not every day you get to say that, I'm sure it's a big deal!
That is scary! I hope she gets through with it.
I'm sure it's not fun.
I'm not a big racing fan, I'm a big soccer fan. I hate losing in any sport.
It's always a good Monday.
That's great! What a wonderful surprise! I would be so excited!
That is so sad.  I have had some pets die before me.  They were my pets.
That's terrible. I hope the family is okay and that the fire was not too bad.
It's so hard when our dog gets sick.
I know that feeling!  My dog is going in for a surgery in 2 days.  He's a little old boy so I'm a little worried.
That's really tough. Did you stay in the house with her?
That's a long time. I hope you both are happy now that she's back.
That sounds really tough. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I would have been so stressed out!
That's a lot to take in, especially with a child to raise. It must have been tough on you both.
Oh, that's great! I love traveling! What's the most exciting part about visiting them?
That's so cool! I've been away for so long too. What are you looking for from them?
That's weird. Do you have a pet spider?
I think I understand.  It's not a disease right.  I have a friend who is very allergic to spiders.  She will die if they touch her.
That must've been pretty cool! I'm sure you were excited.
That is so nice! Did you feel like you were the only person there?
That's not very considerate of him.  I think you should talk to your parents about it!
That is so annoying.  Why do kids throw food like that?
That's really scary, what did you do?
That's awful, I hope she's okay. Did you get a picture of her car so I can post it on social media?
That's a fun find! Did it come from the chef or the restaurant?
That's good. I would have been a little upset. Did you get the refund back?
oh that is awful
It's the bread of life!
I'm glad you feel that way. I'm feeling a mix of emotions right now.
That's so sweet of him.
I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sure you will get over it.
That's so sad.  I have had a lot of pets in my life.  I have lost 4 in the past 2 decades.  I wish you well.
Yeah, I have a dog. I just love them!
It's just a dog. I'm just a dog owner.
That is a good thing. I like to be scared sometimes. It makes me stronger.
That's a good one! I'm a little jealous, I've never had to cook anything other than a microwaveable meal.
I love kids!  How did he do?
Oh that's great! I'm glad he is learning. Pre-algebra is so much fun, but I can see him struggling.
That's great! I hope you have fun!
That's great.  How long has it been since you last ran?
That's understandable. Are you planning to be the center of attention?
Yeah, I know how you feel!
Oh, that's so cool. I haven't been there yet, but I've heard it's really nice. Did you enjoy yourself?
That's crazy! I've never been there. Did you enjoy it?
Oh I know how you feel! I always feel that I'm going to have to do a lot of push ups to get through my gym session. But you know what? I didn't even think about it. I just went for it!
That's cool. What kind music do you like?
It is a terrible feeling. I have been in one a few times. It's a terrible experience.
That must have been terrifying.  Did you get out of the car?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried talking to her?
That sucks.  I hope she feels better soon.
I am so mad about that!  I would have to tell them that I am not active anymore.
That's awful! I'm sorry to hear. Did you call them and ask them why?
Oh yes. It is a sad thing. I lost a friend a few years back. I still miss them.
I'm so sorry to hear that.  It's so hard to process and understand how someone can feel that they have no other choice.  How is he doing now?  Is he okay?
I have! I have two!  They are the cutest things. I am the luckiest person in the world!
I have never had a dog. I think it's a lot of work. But I think I would be willing to do the work. I have never had a dog. I have had a few cats. I think it's a lot of work. I would never have a dog. I don't want a dog! I think I would have a very hard time taking care of a dog. I think I would get so stressed out! I think I would be a nervous wreck!
I like chocolate too, but I don't store it in the fridge. I like it room temperature.
Oh no! Did you have to go shopping for another one?
That's not very considerate.
That is so nice of you to admit to it.  I would feel the same way if someone found something in my car.
That is a terrible thing to go through, I am sorry.  What is your situation?
I can relate. I've been broke my whole life. I just lost my job.
I'm glad you have such a good relationship with your mom!
That is nice! I bet you are proud of your family. What's your mom's name?
That's terrible!  I hope everything works out for you.  Are you flying to a foreign country?
That's really cool. I've never had that happen to me. I'm glad you didn't let it stop you.
Yeah, it's always better to go ahead and do it. It's always better to have the money and not the problem.
I'm sure you'll be back on the water this weekend.
That's awful. I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you try to find another way to go?
Oh, what happened? Did he have a band?
I can imagine! That sounds like it was a wild show. Did he play the whole set?
That's a little scary.  What kind of situations?
That's pretty gross. Did you guys have to do any special cleaning?
That is so annoying. I have never been able to get rid of my dirty socks either. I am always getting them and then putting them back in. I think I should have a special box for them.
It can be frustrating when kids stick their dirty socks in a place you want to keep them
Wow, that's a big change. What color did you choose?
That's awesome! You should get a trim!
That is pretty bad. What happened?
That's awful! Did they laugh?
That is quite an expensive thing!
That is horrible. I hate that people can just sell things like that.
It's a hard class!
Oh wow that's great. I'm sure you did well.
I can relate. I have to vent to my therapist about some of my issues. I don't know if I would want therapy though, it is not my thing
That is true.  I can understand that you would feel that way.  Do you have a friend that you can talk to about it?  I am not really sure if I would be able to help you.
Oh wow. What are you training her in?
That's awesome! How old is she?
Oh, that's so exciting! Do you think you'll get what you want?
It's always a great time.
Oh no, I hate when people do that.
Oh no!  That is terrible.  Did you call the casino to report the theft of your money?
That's a scary feeling. What made you feel so scared?
Oh yeah? How did you get over it?
That's so exciting! Where are you both going to meet up?
That's exciting.  Are you going to a restaurant or somewhere else?
I hope you do good.
I am sure it will go well.
Oh, I'm sorry.  What's wrong with that?
That is a bit creepy. I guess it's just trying to wake you up.
I'm glad you made progress. I've been there too.
I'm so glad you're excited!
I know.  I used to play video games with friends.  We would play together and then go out together afterwards.  I think it was the best thing.
That is hilarious!  I would never do that to my family.  I am glad you are having fun though!
I can understand that.
That is so sad, you could have called the hotel to see if they would let you stay for the rest of the trip.
That can be tough, but sometimes you should just let go of it and focus on the person you really care about.
Yeah, it can get complicated.  What did you do so far?
It's a classic, I think I've seen it at least 10 times!
That's crazy! I love the ring movies.
That was a bad experience. I'm sorry to hear that.
That's crazy! What was in it?
Oh, I think that's a nice person to do
Oh that's a good point.  I would say something then.
I'm so angry! What happened?
That is terrible, did you have to call police?
It sounds like you have been working hard to change your habits! What have you been working hard on?
I love how we've gotten so much more efficient at taking care of ourselves over time
Oh wow.  What are the reasons for that?  Is it the sleep?
I am sure it was just a habit you developed.
That sounds fun! What kind of activities did you do?
That sounds like fun, what a great time!
That's no good, you should talk to them about it
That's understandable, especially in a quiet environment.  It's hard when you have to try to focus and be productive, but you also don't want to deal with people bothering you or making a disturbance.
I am sorry to hear that. Have you talked to someone at your new bank?
Yeah, it's a bit crazy. I've heard of tellers messing up before, but I didn't think that was going to happen to me. They're supposed to know their head from their head. I think they're just lazy. I'm going to have to start over with my current card and get a new one.
That's cool! I bet that was fun to watch!
That is awesome, what kind of games did you build?
That's good. Have you been to one recently?
I'm sorry you are experiencing that.  I hope the dentist can figure out what is wrong and get you fixed up soon.
I've never camped out for a movie. I'm not a fan of the series. What movie are you watching?
I would have been mad.
That is horrible. What did you do?
Yeah, that is a bummer. I am so sorry that happened. I am sure you were very happy for her, but I hate that she can't go out with friends anymore.
That sounds so scary.  Did you get a new one?
I have never had a cat jump through a window. I'm sure that would be a shock!
That's awesome. Did you lift as much as you could lift?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.  That's a great workout!
I'm not really sure what you mean.
I'm glad you have some thoughts to consider.
I have never done that before. What is the odds like?
That's great news, good for you.  How long will you be traveling for?
I've heard of those before!  They're fun!
That sounds like fun!
That's so cool. How's she doing?
That's so sweet! I love animals. I have a dog too. I named him Max.
That sounds like fun! Steely Dan is a great band.
Yeah, I'm glad they still play their music today.
Oh, I love the name fido. What kind is it?
That is so cool! I've never been around a puppy before but I love dogs! I have two cats. What breed?
That is so funny!  Did Christy take the toupee?
I am sorry to hear that. What a goose!
It sounds like a nasty situation.  What did you do?
I would have done the dishes!
That's creepy, what was it?
I would have been terrified!
That's okay, it's okay if you don't feel ready for a job interview.
It can happen.  What happened?
Oh no. That can be a sign of a fire, can it happen?
Oh my goodness! That's disgusting. I would've been terrified.
I'm sorry to hear that. Were you okay?
I would have hit you too, that is not good
Oh, you are preparing for an award?
Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you working on something for work?  I don't know what it is.
That's so cool!  What store were it at?
I am sure the person was nice to you
I'm sure that's a good grade.
Yeah, sometimes you just need to go back and re-read the problems to understand how you did them.
That's really cool! What did you do when you found it?
It is always great to have a look back at our lives
That sounds like fun.  What team did you go see?
That's awesome. What game were you watching?
That's really bad, did he end up cleaning it out?
That's disgusting. I'm sorry she passed away.
Yeah, that's a bummer. Did you guys get insurance?
That sucks!  What did you do to fix it?
That is awesome. How long was it?
I have a similar car. I love the smooth ride it has.
That's cool. What subject was it in?
That's great, what are you studying for?
It's a good thing you studied hard.
I know that feeling, but you did great!  Congrats!
That's terrible. Did you try to return it?
I hate when people leave things in public places. I would have felt bad for leaving it there.
That's true.  People that are really nice can change your day and help you see a different side of things.
I agree, but sometimes it's hard to know what to believe.
That is great. How old is she?
That is awesome! I have never seen that before.
I know what you mean.  I work a full time job and sometimes have a few hours to myself.  It's not always a good use of time.
I know the feeling. I'm so jealous.
I am so happy for you! You sound like a very smart and hard working person!
It sounds like you're really working hard!
It is hard to do, but it is a necessary thing to do.
That sucks, I've had to do that for years. I've been thinking about switching to a different city, but I don't know where.
That sounds like a weird meal.
That sounds disgusting!
That is good news. Is she in good health?
I am sorry to hear about that.
That's good that he has your back. Did you know what happened?
Oh wow, that's terrible! Did you guys end up hanging out after the wedding?
It is a problem of the society
It's so unfair. I'm sure someone else has bills.
That's cool. What is it that you like most about them?
That's really cool! I've played some old school games. Do you have a favorite one?
That's really unfortunate.  I've heard about that explosion in Chicago.
Oh my, that sounds amazing! What kind of brewery is it?
That is bad. What is wrong with them?
Oh, that's so sweet of you to care about your girlfriend! It's so nice you want to be so careful around her!
It's hard when you have people around you that are so close, you want them to be okay.
I've always loved cooking, but I'm not sure how to make it taste like food. Maybe I need to get more of an appreciation for the hard work that goes in.
Oh that must've been a surprise. How did you feel about that?
Oh, I am so glad that they did!
I love peaches!  What are fawns?
I am so jealous. How do you give them peaches?
That is great, how long were they away for?
I hope you have a nice reunion!  Did you guys talk about anything interesting?
I bet you were happy about it, you're moving on!
I would have been upset. I hate when people say that without even asking.
That's terrible.  Did you get paid for it?
That is terrible.  You should speak to your boss about it.
That's terrible. I bet they got in big trouble.
I hate when people are stupid, especially when it is at a convenience store or restaurant.
That is so awesome! What kind of job was it for?
Yeah, it is great.
That sounds good, what is your second cup for?
That sounds great!  I'm sure you're right.  You're just happy to be alive and have everything you want.  That's great!
I know the feeling.  It is stressful.  But you should get that job.  I think they will be great.  I am sure they will be.
That's so annoying! I hope you got what you needed in the end.
That is nice.  I have never taken retirement.  Is he happy?
Oh wow, I've never been there. I wish I could go there one day
That's terrible!
I hope you have a great time with your wife when she gets back.
I'm jealous, I'm not married and I have no one to go on vacation with.
That sucks. What did they say?
Yeah I've been in that situation before, but I don't mind. I just keep going back and asking them more and more questions.
That is a long time. I'm sure you were missing her.
Yeah, I feel you.  My husband is away for work for 3 weeks.  We have two dogs that need to be walked.  It's a lot of work.  I hope your wife is back soon!
Oh, what was it that you were interviewing for?
Oh, I'm sorry. What kind of job is it?
That is really frustrating.
That is terrible.
I understand.  What are you guys going to do?
I hope you guys have a wonderful time together!
That's crazy. Did it sting you?
Oh my god! That must have been so scary! I hate when that happens. Did it bite you?
That sounds like a real pain in the butt. Do you use bug spray or do you try to avoid them at all costs?
I have never heard of that. Are they poisonous?
That is so scary!
Oh yeah, it's just the fear of the unknown that makes you afraid of them, not just the physical fear.
I would love to do that! What's the rush?
That is awesome! I bet it is exciting. What is skydiving?
It was a bit of an embarrassment.  Did you have to call a plumber to come out and fix it?
Oh no! That's disgusting! Did you have a good laugh about it?
That is terrible. I hope you are okay.
That must be nerve wrecking. I hope it goes well
It was good to have a friend help you out.
That sounds like a lot to do! I hope you are ready!
That is true.  I have been to a lot of places where people are staring at their phones.  It is like they are waiting for their phone to call them.  It can be very uncomfortable.
Oh wow, that sounds so uncomfortable! I hope that you were not embarrassed.
That is so sad. I have lost my dogs too many times.
That sucks.  I am sorry.  I am sure you will be through with it.
That is sad.  How old is she?
That is sad, did she have a good time?
That's exciting! I'm looking to move to a new apartment too.  What are you moving to?
I know that feeling! I'm moving in 2 weeks and I'm so ready for this.
Oh no. How did that happen?
That's awesome! You guys are lucky! What do you do for entertainment while she's away?
Yeah! I'm really excited to apply.
I can relate! I have had a bunch of spiders crawl all over me. I just can't stand them!
That's great! How many games have you played?
That is awesome, are you playing soccer?
I understand.  It is hard.  I am glad to hear that you are doing better now.  What job are you doing?
That is a tough situation.  Do you have any plans to move?
Oh wow! Where are you going to go there?
Oh, that's a great trip! I've always wanted to visit India. What city are you going to?
That sounds so nice! Did anything exciting happen?
That's a nice thing for them to do.
That's a little annoying.
That is great. I hope they like the neighborhood.
oh no, did they get in trouble?
Yeah, that is embarrassing, but it's not like you can change the pants right in front of everyone!
That's weird. Did you get a seat?
That's not good. Did you get in anyway?
I am sure he is happy to see you too!
That's awesome. What breed is he?
Oh wow! What did he wear?
Oh my, I am sure you will be back soon!
That's so exciting!  I'm sure it's going to be amazing.  Congratulations!
That sounds like a lovely wedding. I'm glad it was so small and special.
I know that feeling.  It's like they're not even human.
I bet, that's pretty gross
That's nice! I'm sure he's happy.
i love the church. I think it's so good to help out those in need and spread hope to people.
Oh, that is so gross.  What happened next?
Oh no! I would have been so upset!
That sounds great! I've been wanting to try out a new restaurant. What kind of food do they have?
That is the worst! I hate when that happens.
That's a bummer.  I'm sorry you didn't get to have a more cohesive team.  Did you end up leaving?
Yeah, that can be tough to deal with, especially in the workplace.
That is a great thing to have!
Oh wow, that is amazing! I bet you were happy.
Oh no! I'm so sorry. What happened?
i understand, i lost my dog last year too, it was a really sad day for sure
Oh well, that's a bummer.  Is he going to visit you soon?
It's always tough when you don't see your favorite people.  It's hard to understand why things happen.  I hope they catch that soon.  I'm sure they will.  It's just hard when you really really want to see them.
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.  It's so sad that she didn't get to spend more time with you and your husband.
Yeah I can imagine.  That is really sad.  I hope you were able to get through it.  I am sorry.  That is really sad.  I can only imagine how you must feel.  You must have been devastated.  I can only imagine how hard that must have been for you.
That's really sad. Did they get a description of her?
Oh my, that is terrible. Did you try to find her?
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you're able to get back to playing.
Yeah it's not easy to keep it up. I have to be so careful not to hurt it anymore. But it's worth it.  I'm a little bit lazy and I like to just sit and watch people play. But it's a great way to get exercise and be active at the same time. I don't think I could just walk anymore!
That is true, I have never gone skydiving before, I was a little nervous.
That's so brave of him!
That's really cool! I love watching TV with my family and we always have to buy a new one every 2 months. What kind of tv do you have?
That's great! I've been thinking about buying one. What kind is it?
That is so gross!  I don't think I'll ever go to a hotel again.
I would be so mad at that bug, I would be trying to kill it right now
That is okay. You will do great.  You will do just fine.  Remember that you are prepared for the interview and you can handle it.  It is not about being nervous, it is about being ready.  So, take it as a challenge and you can overcome the fear and do it well.
That is good, you are going to do well!
That sounds so cool! What did they do in high school?
I love high school memories, they are always fun to reminisce about. What a nice memory!
Yeah. I feel like we've lost that.
That's so adorable! I love puppies! How old is your puppy?
That is nice.  What breed?
It's so frustrating when that happens, and when it happens on Ebay specifically, you feel even worse.
Oh, man that's frustrating. I'm sure it was frustrating too.
That's not good! Did you have a glass of milk to balance it out?
Yeah, self control is something to work on. I bet it was a bit embarrassing.
That's no good, I hope he gets better soon.  Do you have any other remedies?  I always try to use herbal remedies to help with the illness.  I have heard of them being helpful in treating this type of illness.
I'm sorry that your son is sick. Hopefully he feels better soon!
That's really cool. I bet you were really good. What was your name?
That is awesome.  Do you still dance?
That's awesome. Are you a fan?
I agree. I've been around golf since I was a kid too. I've played a lot over the years and have a good feeling about it.
Oh my goodness.  Did she tell you about it?  I would have been upset.  Did you talk about it?
That is so cool that your mama bear side came out.  I wish people like that existed more.
Oh wow! I'm so sorry. What kind of bones were it?
That must have been gross. I would have called the police.
I agree. Animals are very intelligent and loving creatures.
That is disgusting. They should be put on trial.
I'm sorry you were scared. What was it?
I hate raccoons. They are so mean and annoying. I hate them so much. I wish they would just disappear.
That is good of your friend.  I'm sure he will pay you back.
It's always good to have a friend who is willing to lend.
That's so sweet. Did you do okay?
Yeah that is cool.  I like blindfolds, I love it when they are blindfolds.  It is fun!  I like to blind myself with them too!
I have seen them, but they don't usually fly at night.
I've been looking around my neighborhood for years and I'm pretty sure I've seen a drone flying around. I've got a feeling it's not from around here.
Yeah I can see how you would be.
Oh man that's pretty annoying! What's she like? Is she a friend of yours?
I'm sorry to hear that. Pets are a part of our lives.
It was so hard for you.  I know how much we love our pets.
That sounds really scary, what did the doctor say?
That must have been so scary!  I'm sorry he had to go through it.  I would have been so scared too.  I can imagine how worried you must have been.  I would have been too.  Hopefully he was okay.
That's terrible!  Did you call the hotel?
i hate salmon.
Oh that's a great idea. I would have been so scared.
I would be too! I would be so worried about getting to work on time.
That's great! You're so smart!
That is great, I bet you have to work very hard to get where you are today.
That was pretty scary. What happened?
Oh that is a great story.  I have never been on that roller coaster.  I don't know what it would be like.  I am a nervous person.  I am afraid of heights.  I think that would be a good idea for me.
That's so unfair. Why did they get to go?
That is a bummer. Maybe you will get to see them this weekend.
I know, it really gets me. I have had my fair share of losing pets as well, but I've never lost a dog. They were my best friends.
Yeah, that is a terrible loss.
It is going to be so much fun!
I know what you mean, I was counting down my own trip.
Oh no.  That is horrible!  How did she do?
Yeah, she has a pretty good head on her shoulders.
That is a bummer.  Do you have to do something that you wanted to do?  Or did you just have to wait till the weather cleared up?
It's a bummer, but maybe tomorrow will be better?
That was a great movie. I love horror movies.
Yeah, that was pretty scary. I was really scared for my life.
That sounds like you're trying to find the best deal for your insurance.
I know right. It's crazy how expensive it is these days.
oh no, did you have to do that?
I know, I just can't resist.  It's hard for me when I'm on the diet, but it's hard to resist when my mom is making cake!
I am sorry to hear that.  What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. Panic attacks can be scary. Did you have to go to the hospital?
That is terrible! I hate when people do that.
That is awful. I hope you find him soon.
That is horrible.  Did they leave without explanation?
I feel sorry for you.  It is tough to go through a breakup like that.  Did you talk to a therapist?
That is so nice of you!
I know right! People are so nice these days.
That's great. How long is the college?
That's great! What field is he in?
It's okay, I've had my share of picky eaters.
It's always hard to find a place that can make food that is not contaminated.
That's a pretty silly thing to happen.
Oh, wow.  Did you spill it on someone else?
I know right? I was watching this movie and the camera kept following this girl, I thought for a second it was following her into a bathroom.
That's so scary. Did you call the police?
I am sure they will not mind.
That is so annoying, you should tell them.
It's okay, it's a great pizza! I've eaten an entire pizza by myself before.
I bet you are going to have to work out a lot to eat that much!
That's great, what kind of job do you work at?
I am glad for you! You deserve it.
Oh, I bet you are excited to start.
That's great! What age is the class you're going to teach?
That sucks. What kind of dog is it?
Oh no. I'm so sorry. That is awful.  I hope you find him.
That is a hassle. Do you have one now?
That sucks! I've had to deal with that too, and it's so frustrating. It's like they're trying to make it more difficult for you.
I bet that was exciting for her. What did she get the promotion for?
That is awesome! I hope she keeps going!
That's awesome. Did she do it alone or with your help?
That's so cool! I bet you were thrilled!
I know how you feel!  He will do fine though.  He's going to be so busy and will have to be very smart and responsible.  It's good for him to be out there.  It's hard for him to go to college because he didn't have a choice otherwise.  He was forced into it because his parents were so worried about his future.
I can understand. I am going through the same thing with my younger kids.  They are so different and they have their own personalities.  I am sure it is stressful for you.  But you will get through this too.  It's a new phase of life and you will get used to it eventually.  Just be there for your son, even if you're not in the house.  That will make the experience less stressful for him and for you too.  It's
I understand what you are going through. I have had a child of my own and it was hard. But you will get over it. You are going to have to let him go. I know you want him to succeed and that he is capable of it himself now.
Yeah, he is 5 and I am pretty much his mother, but I can see him getting into the whole crazy world.  Its a lot of fun though.  Its nice
That's so cool!  Did you get a new one?
It is always fun to look back on old times. I hope you have many more fun times with your Nintendo 64
It's not easy. What major is it?
I'm glad you did well on the test. I've been there too, and it's hard to get back on track.  I'm sure you'll get back on track.  I'm sorry you're struggling in your major.  Maybe you could look at it as an opportunity to get more involved.  I know it's tough, but you're not a failure.
Oh, wow! Did he cook?
That's great. I wish I had that much free time.
That's the worst.
I would never forget to pick up the coffee filters.
It's nice to have a good friend to talk to.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I've had a few of those for years.
Oh wow, I am sorry to hear that.  What do you do for work?
That's good. You're not going to end up in prison, right?
I know right? I'm glad you're happy.
That's awesome. What made you so happy?
That is terrible! What did you do to help it go away?
I can imagine.
Oh no. What did you do?
Yeah, I can't believe she would do that! I would've eaten her ice cream!
Oh that's awful.
I'm sorry, but you can't expect to be perfect all the time, especially when you have a baby on the way! You're going to have to work at least a little bit to provide for your family.
It's normal to be nervous, but you'll do your best for the child and you'll be okay.  It's just a matter of time before you get used to it.
That sounds like so much fun. Did you try to pet it?
That's awesome! Did you have a cat?
Oh, that's good. You must be nervous.
Oh man, that is a lot of pressure on you.
Yeah, that was really frustrating for me, but I knew I was moving out of the country. I just wish she would have gotten all of it.
I'm glad you did that. You need to be honest with yourself and your feelings. You don't have to hold onto the past.
That is true. They are very dangerous and can cause serious harm to people.
I hope you didn't have to wait a long time for them to arrive. I'm sure you were in a lot of pain after.
I can understand, it's scary when you are on the bridge.
That is a terrible situation. I hope no one was hurt.
I'm so scared of scorpions.
I know right? I hope it goes back to the kitchen!
I am not sure what to do with that!
That sounds really good, I would be amazed too.
That is awesome. I'm sure you're lucky.
I am so happy for you Kayla!
It's bad. I've heard that. I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear.  Hopefully it will go well for you.  I'm a cancer survivor myself, and I know how you feel, it's hard to deal with but you will get through it.
That's scary! Did anyone see what was happening?
That is so scary! I'm glad you are safe!
That sucks! Did it work out okay?
That sounds pretty awful, but I hope he is feeling better and you're happy.
That is awful, how did you contract it?
I am sorry. I hope you get better.
That does remind me of the good times.
That's so cool, I'm a gamer too!
I have too. What was it about?
That's not good. Did you try to prepare for it?
That's awesome! What kind of diabetes?
It's just life, right?
That's cool. What kind of movie?
That is cool! I have been there too.
I am so jealous of you.  Did you buy it for a special occasion or just because?
I bet. He must be very good at that
That is ridiculous. I have been trying to get him banned for a while now.
That is a good point, I think it is unfair that people are being banned.
Oh wow, did you find them?
Yeah, I was so mad at that kid, I wanted to kick him in the face, but then he was laughing and saying something like "I didn't even know there was anyone behind you!"
That is a terrible thing to say. What made you do that?
I am sorry to hear. I would have been angry too.

That's really nice of you.  What was the reason for him fleeing?
That's great!  You must be very proud of your son.
Oh my, that's a good one!
I bet that's amazing!  How does he do that?
I'm sure he will.
That's so cool. I'm not really into eating.
That's a good point.  I can't say I'm the greatest eater in the world, but I'm certainly a contender.
That's so nice of them! You should appreciate their kindness.
Yeah, that is a nice boyfriend.
I love looking back through old pictures of my kids.
That sounds like a tough situation. I'm sorry she had to leave.
It is a good thing she was not in a room with the furniture.
Oh, that is a bummer. Did you have to clean it up?
I have a nephew that just started college. I am so excited.
I am sorry but that is not a good thing.
Yeah I'm sorry to hear that.
It is hard when the people in charge are not good to question their decisions. It makes me feel bad for trying to question them.
That is sad. I have had to lose a few pets myself. It was a hard time.
I'm sorry, that is terrible. Did you call the shelter?
That's tough, what happened?
Oh my god, that's really sad, but I'm so sorry to hear you.  I know it's tough to deal with.  But I hope you find someone else that loves you.  I'm sure you will.  I'm just praying for you.
That's really great. What kind of pie?
I love that kind of pie. What kind was it?
That's great! What are your favorite things?
That's true, but sometimes you gotta have some things to make you happy!
That sounds like so much fun! What kind of fire did you use?
That's cool, did you cook anything?
That is crazy, I would have stayed with friends or family.
Oh wow, that's a pretty scary situation!
Oh no!  Are you going for vacation?
I agree, I've been to India.  It's a very different experience.
That's a bummer. Did you find a way to get it back?
I would be worried about that.  What are you going to do?
I feel you. I am stressed about my mortgage too
Yeah, that's terrible.
That sucks, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Oh no! How long did she go?
I am sorry to hear that, I hope you are okay.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you take any meds for the blood pressure or crohns?
I bought one too!
I'm sure you have thought about that plan, you're smart! You're not worried?
It's okay. I would be nervous too!
That is good to know. I am sure you will do great.
That's awesome! I'm a bit jealous.
It is a nice thing to have a clean house.
It must have been tough to adjust, I had my first child 2 years later. I think you must have had a lot of time on your hands.
It's great that she's doing well.
That's good. What's the location of the apartment?
I can understand that. It's hard to move to a new place, especially if you like the neighbors.
That is quite a move. Did you have to sell anything in particular?
That is amazing, I would love to travel full time.
I do! I have a bunch of old photos from my college days, and my parents, and my grandparents. It makes me miss them. I wish I could go back to when I was younger and be able to relive those good times
I do sometimes.  It's good to have a little perspective.
That is very sad, what happened to you?
That's the life of an adult. It can be hard to relive those days.
I love when people do nice for you. It's so sweet.
That is so nice of him, he should be rewarded with a medal or something.
I know how you feel.
Yeah that's true, I know how that feels. I had a friend who lived in the same city, and we'd meet up every week. But then he moved away and we've only been able to see each other a few times a year.
It's one of my favorites too!  It's such a great way to relax and just unwind!
I love to read and I have a huge collection!  I'm a huge fan of historical novels and I also love the legal dramas!
That sounds awful. Did she send it as a joke?
That's so sad. I'm sure it really brings back memories for you.
It's always sad to see a place go down.
I am glad to hear that. I have moved around a few times and have been in some bad places. I think it would be nice to have a place where I know people.
That's nice. How long have you had him?
That is very nice of you to take care of your little dog.  Do you live in a big house or is this your home?
That's quite cool, how did they do that?
That sounds like a pretty funny experience.  Did you end up getting rescued?
Yeah, I feel the same way. I think we should help out more with social welfare and get more people into the service system.
That is so sad. What is your charity?
I've never won a scratch off before. How did you do?
It's a nice surprise!
That's great. I bet that will come in handy. What did you win it for?
That is hilarious!  Did you eat it?
It is good that you put googly eyes on your potato.  I would do that.
Oh no! Did you get your shoes back?
That's so cute! Did you get them out of there?
That's great! What prize?
Yeah, I'm glad it was a gift card. I would have been so disappointed if I won
That is awesome!  What did they have?
That's good, I'm glad it worked out. What kind of sausage did you buy?
That's terrible, why are they not visiting?
That is really hard. I am sorry you have to go through that. I hope she gets better.
Oh, that's awesome! Where do you live now?
Oh wow! That's awesome! I'm sure you'll have an amazing trip!
That is great.  How old are they?
I am glad to hear that
I am a camper too! What kind of camp?
I would be upset.  That is a lot of stuff in a bag.
Oh, I'm sure that was a fun day for you. I hope he's not getting any of those things.
That's awesome!  I've never been camping in my life, but I'm sure they're very experienced.  How long did they camp for?
That is really impressive. She must have been a good camper.
That's cool. What game are you playing?
It's a great tournament. What kind shooting game is it?
That sounds like a lot of fun!  Are you both beginners or experienced?
That's cool! Are you an experienced skydiver yourself?
That's good, you're doing great.
I bet!  That's a great accomplishment!  What was the treatment room?
That's terrible.  What kind of limestone is it?
I bet that was a hassle for you. Did you get in a car?
Oh wow. What are you bidding for?
That sounds exciting! I've never been to eBay before, but I've heard it is a really fun site. What comic book is it?
Oh no! That sounds scary! Did you run?
Oh my goodness! That sounds so scary. I'm glad it was just a dog. I would have been really scared!
That is true. I have seen so much improvement in technology.
That is true! I have an old phone and it's so much slower than my computer!
Oh no! Did you feel guilty?
I can relate to that, my sister did that last week and it was so bad.
That is very kind of you!
Yeah, that is good to know, it's good that you are prepared for that
Oh yeah?  Was it a good one?
That was a scary movie, I love horror. What made you afraid?
I love shopping!
It's good for the economy and for the environment.
I hate that too. It's like I don't even know what I'm eating.
Yeah, it makes my stomach turn, but it's just the fact that it was my food and it's been sitting around
I am the same way.  I have a 2 year old and a 10 year old.  I am so mad every time they put their dirty socks and pants on the floor.  I have to pick them up off the floor every day.  I have been looking at those little vacuum cleaners that are for little kids.  I am sure it would save me a lot of time and work
That sucks.  My kids are always leaving things on the floor.  I have to pick it up and put it back every day.  I wish they would leave their dirty clothes on the floor like I did when I was a kid.
I agree!  I hate those people.  They have no idea what they're doing.
i agree, it makes me so mad.
That is terrible! Did you find out who shot him?
I'm glad it wasn't a human.
I bet you were excited about it?  Did it live up to expectations?
I've been to a lot of good restaurants, but I'm always looking to try new ones.  I'm not sure how to make the decision, but I think I'll try this one.
It's good that you have a local organic store in your area, they are a great resource for healthy food.
I can understand why you miss that food!
It is good to work on your skills
That's awesome! You're a winner in my book! What position do you play?
Oh wow!  What does that sound like?
You should probably call the police and report him as he's probably doing that all day long.
That is so annoying. I don't know why people have to be such idiots.
Oh no, that's terrible, that is not the way you want to start a job
I know what you're saying. I've been there. It's a hard life, but at least you know you have some control over it.
It's a fun experience. I've never gone to a concert.
Oh wow!  I bet you can't stop dancing!
That's great!  What did you want?
Oh wow!  That's great!  I hope you have a great time moving in!
That is great! I live in a big house, but it's a bit lonely. I'm moving to a smaller house, and I'm really excited to get out of my house and start my new life. I'm a new mom, and I have a little boy.
I am so grossed out just thinking about it
Yeah, that is the worst.  I would have to throw it back out to the yard.
Yeah I've been in some long drives.
That's a good idea though!
I am happy for you. What kind of computer did you get?
I love getting things! What did you get for it?
It's great that there are people like that out there.
That's good that you have a service that can make it easier for you.
Oh, what movie?
Oh, that's a good point. I didn't expect it to be so depressing.
Yeah that is great.  I am sure you are so proud.
Oh, that is awesome!  I have a 2-year-old and he is learning to count too!  He's getting it fast!  How long has it been?
I'm glad you had fun there. What was it like?
Oh man. Did you get a bruise?
Oh, wow, that's so gross!
That sucks. Did it spill on you or was it a small spill?
I think it was a raccoon, or a coyote. They are all around here.
Oh no. I hope it didn't spray you.
That's really fun, did you go to any popular cities?
That is so cool! Did you visit any places in particular?
That's great! Did you have fun?
I know right! I was like that when I was a little kid. My mom would clean up the mess and make sure the toys were put away. I think she was just trying to save me from the mess.
I feel the way you do about new things, it is so exciting
I've always wanted to do that! I bet it was so exhilarating!
Oh wow. That must have been a lot of walking.
Oh wow, what happened?
oh no that sucks. Did you call an ambulance for it?
Oh no. What happened?
Yeah that can be tough. But it is hard to think that it will be the last time you see your dog.
That is amazing! How did that work out for you?
That is so awesome. I am so proud of you!
I know, it is exciting and scary.
That's awesome! I've always been a bit jealous of people who live in Cali, but I've always wanted to try it out for myself! I'm not sure what school districts you'll be moving into, but I'm sure it'll be an adventure!
That is disgusting. I have seen people throwing trash on the street and I get angry.
Yeah, that's the way it is sometimes.  You can feel the frustration and anger, but you know you're not doing anything to help.  You can't really do much about the garbage that people don't care about.
I can understand that.  How many animals do you have?
I bet it is a little lonely.  I am alone most of the time as well.  But it is nice to have animals around, it makes me feel better
i hate that
I am not sure what to say about this. I have a few packs myself, but I don't think they are worth 100 packs.
Oh that is bad.  Do you take her on a vacation with you?
I hope it doesn't bother her too much.
That is so cool. I am a bit envious of you. What kind of work are you looking to get?
That's good that you're looking for a better opportunity.
It sounds fun! Are you going with family or friends?
That is awesome! Do you have tickets for every fair you attend in the US?
Yeah, that's a scary situation to be in, especially when you're not sure what the outcome might be.
That is a scary place to live.  I hope they are not using the guns for protection from the other people in the neighborhood.
I love looking at the stars, it's so peaceful. I've never been out there before.
I have never been to the country.  What is it like?
That's great!  I bet they had a blast.
I love my kids and my family, so it's always great to see them
I'm sure they were expensive. What brand did you buy?
Oh, that's a bummer. I've heard the yeezys can be a bit tricky for right-footed people to get the right fit
Yeah, that's a lot.
I am sure you can get it to work, it is a pretty easy process.
I hope it goes well! What's the speech about?
I hope you do well.
I would have felt bad for that.  Did you get a refund?
I would never leave my purse in the car.
I bet that was fun!
That's cool.  Did you do it at work or just for fun?
Oh no, what happened?
Oh, I understand. That must be really scary.
That's terrible. I hate that when people do that to others. I always try not to sit there too long.
I know how you feel.  I've been robbed of my wallet once.  I had left it unattended and someone took it.  Now I always lock it.
That sounds really scary.  Did he end up getting better?
That must've been scary. I'm sure he's okay now though.
I can't imagine how scary and difficult that would be! I would be too.
Yeah, I have seen people do it too. It's amazing how strong people can be!
That's cool! Did you get to pet the cats?
That is awesome! What kind of cat cafe did you go to?
It was your face?  What happened?
That's a scary spider. Did you get a picture of it?
That's a stink. I'm sure your cat is not happy with you for pulling it out of the dryer before work. I have never been in that situation.
That is pretty annoying. I hope your cat doesn't get sick.
I'm sorry to hear that, what was her name?
That's so sad. I have a cat too and I miss her. I hope she's doing well
It's nice to look back on the good old days.
That's really interesting.  I've never really had that experience before.
Oh, I hope it wasn't anything scary?
Yeah I know the feeling.  It's always a little bit of a nervous wreck.
Oh wow! That's so kind of you to do! I'm sure it was a very good bird.
That's really kind of you to do that.  It's nice to help out.
Oh that sounds fun!  What time do they come in?
I can't wait for my roast dinner either, I have to get it ready for the weekend!
It's great to see people get recognition for their hard work. What was your boss's name?
I am sure that is great. I am happy that my boss is paying me!
Oh, I hope you do well! What kind of work do you do?
That sucks!
I bet that's not fun!
Yeah, I feel you.
Oh no! I hope she is okay!
I'm sorry.  Do you think it was the shelter's fault?
Yeah, they need to test her. It's pretty serious.
That sounds like a lot of fun! Are you planning on doing anything special on the cruise?
It's so nice to be planning it together with the people you love!
Yeah, sometimes it's nice to have a little help from a roomate
Yeah that's nice to do.
I'm a little worried, I live in a flood zone. I hope it doesn't get too bad.
Oh wow, I have heard that. I am a little worried.
That's terrible! What are you going to do?
That is terrible. I hope they are able to find out who did it.
I'm not really into mac and cheese.
I love mac and cheese.  I add some bacon bits on top of my mac and cheese.
Oh wow! What are you going to wear it with?
That's awesome! What kind of style are you going for?
I know the feeling.  Do you have a pet?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm sure it will get better over time.
I bet that was a good feeling. Did you do well?
Yeah, it is hard to be in a position where you are the best. But I think it also depends on how you do it, so it is good that you are in a position where you can make a difference and help others.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I love water parks.
I have never been to a water park.
It's like a little oasis of peace in your home!
That's great. What kind of cat is she?
That is nice of her.
It will make great memories for her.
That is so exciting! Congratulations!
I am sure you will have a wonderful honeymoon
That's terrible!  I hope he doesn't.  What will he do if he loses his job?
That's bad.  I hope he can get it together and find a new job.  It's tough when you are in your career.
I'm so sorry. What happened?
It's hard when that happens.
I bet.  How did she do?
I am so proud of your daughter! She is a talented artist.
That sounds terrifying! Did you get any injuries?
I bet! How did it happen? Did you get hurt?
Oh that is so annoying. What was it?
That sounds awful. I hope it didn't get into the kitchen.
Yeah that's a gross situation.  I would have to find another way to get the mail.
I can't believe you left her alone! That was gross! I would have been so mad if that had happened to me!
That's awesome.  Did you have to give it to anyone?
I am sure you will be very confident.
I'm sorry, did it hurt?
I have never heard of a hairball puked up.
That must have been a very embarrassing situation. Did anyone find out?
It's like they're not human beings at all!
Oh, I love that kind of food.  I had a pizza once that was made from a bag.  It was so bad!
I'm sorry to hear that, did you order it online or at a store?
That is a problem. I have heard that some places in Costa Rica don't have addresses.
I'm glad you made it. I've always wanted to go to Costa Rica!
That is scary. What was happening?
Oh man, what happened?
I am glad that she is not a pervert!
That is a little too early for you?
That is nice! What were you eating?
Oh wow!  I am so glad for you.  I am not sure I have the same kind of experience.  How did it feel?  I am sure you are happy.  I hope you can continue that feeling!
I hope everything worked out well!
oh my god, that sounds really bad, i hope you are ok.
It is a good thing that he ate it!
I hate it when dogs eat our food.
Oh no! What happened? Did you guys have a fight?
I would hate that. I am a bit lazy myself and I like to listen to loud music.
Oh my gosh. That's a very common thing for dogs to try to do. Did you have her checked by a vet?
Oh my god.  That's gross.  Did she get it?
Oh, did you find it?
I hate leaving books outside.  I always forget to do it.
That sounds delicious!  What kind?
That is so sweet of him. I have been married to him for a few months now, and I have to say, he does that type of thing a lot, but it is always nice. It makes him feel good. It also makes me feel nice. I like to get chocolates sometimes. It is a nice treat for myself.
That is terrible.  Are they taxing you for your home?  I am not aware of any tax on my home.
Oh, I understand.  I'm not from here, but my neighbors are.  They are in a different state and have a lot less taxes.  But I can't afford the taxes they have to pay in the state they live in.  It's like they are paying taxes on the taxes of the people they live in.
I do that too, it's not had when they are perfect
That is a good thing.  I am happy to have you.  I have been with her for 2 years.  She is perfect for me!
That is amazing! I am so happy for you. Congratulations!
I'm happy for you.
I'm sorry that happened. Did you get your money back?
That is terrible. I hope she gets it.
That is a good joke. What did you do?
That is terrible.  What happened?
I love roller coasters, but I'm not sure about the safety.
I don't think I could ride that either! I've heard the worst stories about people falling out and hurting themselves.
That is terrible! Did you get him back?
That's terrible. What happened?
I agree.  What do you mean you think?
That sounds pretty frustrating.  Do you have any plans to change that?  Do you think that you could ever have enough of money to be set for life?
That is a nice way to look at it.  I bet there are many great memories there.
It is nice to have those memories.
I do all of the time, especially when my kids are asleep.
I do, I watch some funny videos and some educational videos. I also like to watch documentaries.
That's so weird, how did that happen?
I'm sure you had a lot of cake!
I'm glad you got it right. I'm not sure if you were joking or not, but if you were joking, it was a funny one.
That sounds scary! Did he teach you how to not burn it?
That's great! What did you remember most?
That's great, what did you do in the past?
It can be really tough when things don't work out.  I've been there a couple of times, but I'm not there right now, so it's hard not to feel like you don't deserve to have it.  I've been working for a few days now, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to work.  I'm going to go out for a run, and then I'm going to see if I can find something for lunch.
That is so true, I have a lot of friends that are in the same boat as me right now. We all have to rely on our faith in order to get through the tough times.
I'm sorry to hear that, what happened
That's a good point, but you have to understand that they're probably just not in the right financial place. I'm sure they have some good reasons for doing that.
I hope you didn't hurt yourself.  Did you check yourself out?
That's not good, did you take it to the doctor?
Oh, I love video games!
I'm not really into games, but I do play some. I have some good friends that we play online, but I haven't played anything recently.
That's so true. It's like they're cheating the system.
That is a pretty normal thing to feel.  I mean I work hard too.  It just seems like my friends have more opportunities than I do.
That's great! Congratulations! What are your plans for the future?
I am feeling the same way, it's been a good year. I'm excited for next year.
Yeah! It was great. I went to the beach and had some fun. It was great!
Oh that's great! Congrats! That is amazing!
That's terrible. I'm glad you're not too badly hurt!
I would have been so angry!
I do, I used to love playing Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Jump.  I haven't played either of them in years.
I remember them so well. They were so much fun!
That's great. What happened?
That is good news. I'm happy for you.
Oh wow, I'm glad you didn't give it to her.  Why would she ask for it?
That's kinda rude, but I guess it's a job. I don't think I could ever go out with someone again.
That sucks. What did you order instead?
Yeah, I'm sure you didn't enjoy that.
I bet that was a pain!
I'm sure it was a pain to get out! Did you have to clean it up before you went back to work?
I am sorry to hear that.  I had lost my cat a few months ago.
I am so sorry to hear that.  I am sure it was very upsetting.  I am sure it was very difficult to deal with.  I hope you are okay and that everything worked out well.  I hope the cat was able to be cremated.  I am sure it was a difficult time.  I hope the memories will stay with you.
I have been there, and I would not have liked to have been as young as I am now.
Oh, that's pretty cool! I have always wanted to visit one!
That's awesome! I hope you got it. What job?
I bet it was a nerve-wracking experience for you. Did you get the job?
I'm sure it wasn't a good idea
That is no good.  Did you tell them about it?
That's a fun way to get some adrenaline. Did you have a good time?
That's great! What was it like?
Yeah, I think we're all pretty bad kids at heart.
I am so glad you are looking out for your kids!  It is hard to see them go through tough times and then be told they need to be more like the bullies.  I try to remind them that everyone is on the same side and they should be kind to others.  I am sure it will get better for them.
That's right, it's a lot of work.
I know! I am so impressed. I am a gamer and I play a lot of games
That's so rude.
Oh, I'm sorry, that's terrible! What happened?
That's a nice way to spend time with family. Did you have fun?
That's really cool. I have family reunions too. What were some of your favorites?
I love ice juice. Did you sell it?
It's hard when you want something to be so much better.
That's so exciting! I'm sure she's very proud of her!
Yeah, I have a 4 year old.
That is so generous.
That's nice of your brother. I have a similar situation where I lent money to my sister. I don't know if she's going to pay me back. I hope she doesn't go bankrupt. I'm not a good person at all.
It's a great idea.  I've always been afraid of heights.
It's a good feeling, but you still can't help but worry about the worst.
Oh wow! Did you have to get it off?
I'm sorry that happened. Did you have to go home and change?
That's pretty scary. Did you report it to the police?
That's awful! Did you have insurance?
I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. I'm sure it's hard to see him go.
That must be very hard for you.
That's awesome! I'm glad you have that job.
That's awesome! What do you do at your job?
Oh, I love skydiving! I've never jumped, but I've been in a simulator.
I can understand that. How long was it delayed?
That is terrible.  I hate bad weather.  Especially when it's so unpredictable.  It makes me so worried.
That is a very bad thing to do.
That sounds like fun! I love eating all the food I can get!
It is so great that you have those memories. I am sure they will be a great source of comfort for a long time.
It's always fun to go back to places we used to visit and relive the good times. I'm a bit of a nostalgic myself.
That is horrible.  Did you find out what happened?
Yeah, it was a pretty hard time for me, but it made me realize how precious life is.
Oh, I bet that was fun!
I have to agree.  I don't like to be the center of attention.  I'm a bit of a shy person.
that is awesome. how long have you been together?
That is nice. I like that we can appreciate life just the way it is. I have been married for 15 years. I think I am going to get divorced this time. I don't like it.
That is awful. Did you report it stolen?
Oh no! I'm sorry.  That's really bad.  You should be careful about leaving your valuables at places you know they'll be safe.
It sounds very kind of you. What kind of help was it?
Oh, wow! That's great! What a wonderful way to help. How did you get into it?
That's good to hear. I'm married to a wonderful woman, I'm so grateful for that.
That's good. Life is good right?
I am glad you are happy. I don't like to talk about my problems. I just wish things would get better.
That's awful! Did you call the tow?
I bet that was frustrating! Did you end up buying a car?
I understand, but you should try to get a new one for less.
That's so funny. Did you get hurt?
I bet that was embarrassing.
I know, but I just cant help it when people are drunk. I am a good person.
That's so annoying.
I can't help it. I have to check everything. It's a habit.
It's okay to miss them. It's natural.
I am sorry to hear about your dog.  I lost my cat last year too.  She was the best cat I ever knew.
It's nice to have some family time. What lake is it?
That sounds like a fun time.
That's nice, what kind of things do you guys do?
I'm sorry. I hope you have a good life.
I know what you mean! I feel like we all have a little bit of a struggle going on in our lives. It is hard to make ends meet sometimes and not be able to do everything we want or need.
That's good to hear. What kind of work did you do?
That's awesome. I love learning new things and it's even more awesome when you can apply them in real life. What programming languages did you use to do the project?
It's always nice to have a good software to get the job done!
I hope you get better soon.
I'm glad you found good doctors.
That's terrible.  Did you have any time for yourself to relax?
It's okay to slip up sometimes, but it's good you are able to get back on track. You can do it!
That's great! I hope you do well.
It's great that you have been studying. You will do great!
That's terrible! Did you get a good grade on it?
Oh no, that's terrible! I hope everything works out for you. What did you do on your birthday?
Yeah I'm glad you have that. It really makes a big difference
That's great. I am sure that you will be okay.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you have a long life with your dog?  Did you have any children?
I am so sorry to hear that.  That must have been very sad for you.  I am so glad she is no longer in pain.  I know you must have missed her.  I am sure she will always be with you in spirit.
Oh that's a good thing.  I would have been very disappointed if I had bought something I didn't like.
I am glad you got it!  I would have been mad if I waited too long.  You should get the one you want, not wait.
That's so cool. I'm so glad you're happy. I don't think I've ever been in love before. I think I'm a little bit in love with my husband right now. I'm not saying I'm a promiscuous person or anything, but just because I've been married for a little while, I don't know. It's just nice to have a man in your life who is so supportive and loving.
Oh wow, that sounds amazing! I am so happy for you!
That must have hurt. Did you get in trouble?
I can imagine that.  That must have been embarrassing.  I've run into my parents at the grocery store and I'm not sure if I want to run into them again!  I hope that doesn't happen to you.
I love Washington, what city are you planning to visit?
That sounds like a great time!  I love history museums too.
That's very kind of him. What is it used for?
That sounds like a good memory. What kind of knife is it?
I am sorry to hear that. What kind of problems?
That is so true, I have been trying to get pregnant for years.  I have had a few miscarriages.  I am just hoping to have a healthy baby and be able to care for them.
It was very important? Why was that important to you?
That's awesome! Congratulations!
I bet it made you feel sad. Did you find out where you were?
That's a good story!
I'm not really a fan of skydiving myself. I've only been in a few times.
I've skydived before and it's a pretty amazing feeling.
i have never seen any of them.
That sounds like fun! I love watching old movies.
oh no!  I'm sorry.  What color are they?
That's so embarrassing! Did you run to the store to buy new socks?
Oh, that's a long time. What dance style are you dancing in?
That is so awesome, I am sure you will do well
Oh wow. What was going through your head?
I hate when that happens.  It is always embarrassing.
That's a scary thought. What did you end up finding out?
I am sorry to hear that.  Did you get the interview?
That's good. I am sure you are doing okay.
That is good, I hope it continues that way
Oh, really? What is the track you're at?
That's awesome! I love sprinting!
Yeah, but you can always try to run faster.
That's crazy! I love milk!
Yeah, I'm trying to cut back on my milk consumption but it seems I can't.  I just love milk so much.  I think I might have to get a gallon of almond milk.
That's great. Did you use it?
I bet it was a pretty good workout.
Yeah, I hate it when you are in a rush and you hit your own dog. That's like the worst thing ever.
I bet that was painful. I hope your dog is okay.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Was he in a bad relationship or did he just mess up?
That is pretty wild.  What was the text about?
Oh wow, what buffet was it?
Oh, that's too bad. You could have at least had some dessert.
I would have done that too.
I bet that was disappointing.
That's great.  I've always wanted to bench press 400 pounds.  You're a strong person.
That's awesome, you're going to be a legend! What is your weight class?
That's true. I love it.
You're kidding me right?  I'm a paranormal investigator and I've experienced some of the most bizarre things in my life.  I don't think I can handle the idea of a real-life Ghostbuster!  I'm not even sure I can handle my own family.  I don't want to be around kids!  I'm going back to work today.  I need to go back to my old life!
That must be tough. I don't smoke, but I do have a lot of anxiety and stress.  I think it would be hard to quit smoking. I wish you the best of luck in your journey.
That's great that you were able to overcome the habit! What made you want to stop smoking?
I bet that was fun! What did you do?
That is crazy.  I bet that was scary!
I enjoy doing the opposite
Oh that's great! I crochet a bit myself.
That's awesome! I've never gone to the gym before. What kind of workout were you doing?
I am jealous of you! I am a bit of an athlete. I have been doing a lot of weightlifting. I am a bit worried about my body though. I have some health issues. I am trying to get more exercise and eat healthier.
That's so gross! Did you get them cleaned?
That's a pretty crappy cat.
That sounds like a pretty rough day.  Did you feel better after that?
That's awful. Did he not get you to the hospital?
I'm sorry to hear about that. Did you guys break up recently?
That is sad.  I am sorry you broke up.  I hope you are doing okay.
That is good. Sometimes we just need to let it out.
Yeah, I feel the same way about that, I have a friend who is in prison and I miss her.
That is disgusting! Did you see it?
That is disgusting. I would have been so upset if I had seen it. I hate animals that die on the side of the road.
Oh, yeah.  That is one thing I hate about being in a small town with a small restaurant.  They always seem to be running out of food!
Oh yeah, you need to start eating more.
That's really cool, what's your favorite country to visit?
That's really interesting, I never really paid much attention to that part of the speech.
I am so happy for the puppies! I would have been so sad!
That's so good.  How many did you have?
It is such a fun time of year!
That sounds like a fun time, I bet.
That was a bad idea!
It was okay! I have eaten a lot of garlic and it never made me sick!
That is terrible! I would be worried if you had done that. Did you get in trouble?
I'm sorry that happened. I hope you can get it replaced or repaired.
I'm sorry. Did you find out about it later?
That happens to me too often, and sometimes I just forget I'm stealing!
I am sure she was the only one. What did she look like in the dress?
I have never heard of anyone having diamonds stitched on their clothes. I have always thought they would have to be very special to do that.
It's a little intimidating when you haven't seen them for a while, but you'll be fine!
I'm sure it will be worth it, I would be a little embarrassed about it.
Oh yeah. I've had to use my parents internet a lot lately. It can be pretty annoying.
That's right! It's always there and always connected
That sounds like it would be a great way to relax. I'm a bit jealous.
I think you're just tired of animals, that's all
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is okay.
I'm sorry to hear that. I've had to lose two dogs. They're such a great companions and they bring so much joy.
That is a rare thing to see.  What were you responsible for?
I remember it too. I was so happy to be free from responsibility.
I have a bunch of old photos too.
That's so nice! I bet it was fun to look through.
Oh that's good news. What grades did you have?
That's great, what did you end up getting in grades?
It was a good thing she was excited though. She would have been too lazy to drive if it was up to her.
That's a funny story. Did you have to pay for the damage?
I love working out. It's great exercise!
I bet you feel good about that? I know the feeling!
That's terrible! Did you tell the professor?
Oh, that's a good one. What do you mean? Did you do something to your stomach or just make a weird sound?
I love working out. I'm a big fan.
That sounds awesome! How much weight did you lift?
That is awesome! Meditation has so many benefits!
That's amazing.  I'm a bit jealous, but I wish I could meditate.
That must have been uncomfortable. What did you do?
I would be mad at him too, why would he do such a thing?
That is really nice of them! I would do the same for them!
That is really cool. You have to keep practicing.
That is so rude!
That is horrible.  Did you have to divorce him?
That's true, I used to go to high school and then go to college and then go back to work. It's a lot to go through.
That sounds so fun! What school were you in?
I am sorry, what kind of surgery did they do?
I'm sorry to hear that, but you will get back into things, and you should!
That is awesome, you must be very active.
Yeah, I'm not really good at it though.
I am sure that you can talk to them about it
Yeah, sometimes I have to be honest and tell them the truth. I don't think I would be honest with them if it was something I really wanted to.
Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you were able to take care of her well enough for her to pass away peacefully.
That is so sad. I am sure you will find someone who will love her just as much as you did.
I am sorry.
I am sorry to hear about that.
It's so sad when we lose our pets.
Yeah, I've lost my cat a few times and I feel like I'm going to miss them so much.
That's awesome! I bet you felt bad letting them meet! How did they do?
I bet. Cats can be a little feisty!
That is a scary situation! Did everything turn out alright in the end?
That's so cool! Did you have to have any complications during the surgery?
It's been a long week. I'm glad it is finally over.
It can be hard. But you can't let it go to waste.
I bet that was a nice reunion!
I bet it was. Did you have to remind her to be quiet?
That's so exciting! I love when you get something new! What kind of dress?
That sounds fun. What color is it?
Oh no, did you have to do it to get out of the house?
It's awesome that you are working towards your goal. Keep it up!
That sounds like a good opportunity!
That is awesome! I hope it works out for you!
That's great! What was it for?
That's good that you prepared well.
It's a shame. I hope you guys get new hammocks soon.
Yeah, it's like when you're trying to sleep and someone is banging on your door.
I love that kind of surprise, it makes you feel like a kid again.
That was nice. I'm glad you got to hear from him.
I love the weekend. What are you going to do?
It's great to have a relaxing weekend.
That's a creepy dream. Did you ever find out what happened?
I can relate, it is so frustrating.  I have a dream where I am at the grocery store and I just can't get anything.  I just want to get home and be free.
It's always nice to have a friend with your back. I'm not sure how you can afford one, though. That's a lot of money.
Oh man, I feel you. I really do. I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in some kind of financial limbo.
Oh, I know that happened with my family last year. It is so boring!
That sounds like a pretty relaxing way to spend the holiday.
Oh, nice. How did that happen?
It's always great to catch up with old friends
I would be mad too!
That is so terrible. You must have been very frustrated!
That is great. What made the time worse?
I agree. I think we have to take the hard times in life to make us stronger.
That's terrible. I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
I can't help but feel that people are trying to manipulate others, especially when they do that.
Did you block the group as well?
That's terrible. I would be worried about your safety.
I love that sport! What are you climbing to?
I'm a climber too.  How many people are you going with?  I'm going to be doing a big climb out of the city this weekend.
That's really unsettling. Did you try to talk to a counselor about them?
That's really scary. What do you think is causing them?
I'm not very good at exercise, but it's good for you. I hope you're not too sore tomorrow
That's awesome! I wish you all the best.
I'm happy for you.  What kind of baby is it?
That is great that your baby was healthy.
That is awesome! I have never learned anything like that before. I am a beginner myself, but I am really excited for my upcoming birthday.
Oh that's cool! I've never been to the Olympics.
That's a bummer, but don't worry, you can always join clubs or organizations on campus!
That's great that you have online classes. You might consider taking some of the online classes to meet new people.
That's a lot of work! Are you sure you're ready for it?
That's awesome that you're having a baby, that's something to be proud of. I hope everything goes well for you.
That sounds nice, do you have kids together?
I am in a relationship right now and I am not sure if I will be ever.
I know, it's so annoying when they show up unannously.
Oh no! I hate them.  I have never been in a place where they haven't invaded.
That's great. You're a very strong and independent woman.
I bet!  You're going to make them very proud.
I'm jealous!  That sounds like fun.  Where did you go?  I've never been there.  What's the weather like?
I can relate to that. I am in Texas and it takes me about 3 hours to go to California. It's a big deal for me to drive that far.
I hope it wasn't too expensive to fix.
That is terrible!
Oh no, what happened?
Yeah, relationships are tough, but they are worth it. I'm happy for you.
Oh wow.  How old is she?
That is awesome. I would be happy to see that. What type of rats are you talking about?
That's awesome! What did you do at the park?
That's awesome!  What was your favorite ride?
That's scary. Is it something you know about?
It's a terrible disease, but I hope she has a good time.
I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
I feel you. I let someone go too. I was so happy with her, but then she moved on. It's a tough thing to do.
That's pretty awful, were you in a rush to get back in?
That sucks! I would have felt like I had done something wrong.
I am sorry that happened. What did you do about it?
Oh no! I'm so sorry! That's terrible.
That is so awesome! I love your enthusiasm!
That's awesome, are you going to tour?
That's awesome. I have been to Madagascar once.
That's so cool! I have always wanted to visit Madagascar. How was your trip?
That's a great point, I'm sure it will be a better world if more people work towards it
That is true.  I believe we have a chance for better.  We just have to work towards that goal
That is so true. I once went to the woods and I saw a raccoon.
Yeah I have gone on many a scary hike and walk, and I always try to keep a level head.
That's disgusting! I wouldn't let my dog do that. Did you throw it away?
I can understand that. I would be pretty mad at my dog if he did that.
That's really sad. What happened?
That's very nice of her. It's great when people like that still exist.
That's really kind of you. I have to do that for my kids. It's a lot easier when they're little, but now that they're older, they don't care.
Oh no, I bet that is going to be a fun trip.
I can't wait for the kids to come visit! I hope you have a great time!
That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry to hear that.
I hope she has a good life and is at peace.  I know that is hard to see, especially for those who love her.
That's very compassionate of you, to try to keep a positive attitude towards it. I hope you can find a way to help her out as much as you can.
I bet you were so tired you didn't even drive
I can imagine. Did you get a good night's sleep?
I bet.  I bet you are the best husband you've ever been.
That is really nice. I hope he feels better soon.
Oh that is a lot different from when you were friends. I can understand the feeling.
I'm sorry, I was trying to be funny.  I know that feeling.  It's hard to be happy when you're struggling with money.  But I wish you the best of luck and I'm glad you're able to see the world.
That sounds kind of weird.
I would have been in a similar situation.
That must have been very embarrassing. What happened next?
I know! I had to go to the bathroom and get a towel to wipe up the mess.
What is the odds of winning?
I love when people do that.
That's cool! I have a friend with kids.
I understand that. But you could have been there.
That is awesome. What did you do in Washington D.C.
I would love to visit Washington D.C.
Oh yeah! I love surprise parties. What's the surprise?
Yeah, I bet it'll be great!
Oh that is nice.  What are you looking forward to?
Oh man! That's awesome! What did she do?
Oh no!  I hope you were okay!  What happened?
That is terrible.  I hate when hurricanes come through.
I'm glad that didn't happen to you.  What hurricane did you experience?
That is good. I love my wife, but I eat a lot of meat.
That is great! I like vegetarian food too.
I am so proud of her!
I hope she learns from it.  What is she going to do next time?
That's good to hear! What's it for?
It's great that you are prepared. I hope you do well on your exam!
Oh, that's a very sweet thing.
I am sorry to hear that. What is wrong with her?
That's great! What kind of pay rise?
That is awesome!  What kind of pay-rise?
Oh no. I'm so sorry.
I feel you, I was in a similar situation recently.
That's a bummer. But it's a great opportunity for growth and meeting new people. What's the new city?
I am sure you will meet people.
That is bad! What happened?
That's terrible. Are you going to retake the class?
That is annoying, I bet. Did you tell your sister about it?
Yeah, that is the worst part about being in a relationship. She does this all the time and I am the only one who doesn't seem to care.
Oh my god, I love those pens!
I'm glad you liked the memory, it is a good one. I'm sure you'll be getting a pen soon. I've been getting new ones for a long time.
That's good news! I've had to sell my house a few times.
That is good to hear!  Are you selling it to someone or to a family?
That sucks!  I'm sure she was really looking forward to it!  Did you find someone else to take her place?
I understand your feelings.  I'm sure you will be fine.  You can't be disappointed.  She will come back when she is ready.  She will come back when she is ready.  She will come back when she needs to come back.
That's no good.  Is she okay now?
That's disgusting. I hope she felt bad about what she did.
That's terrible. I hate when someone breaks into your car!
I hate when that happens.  Did you call the police?
That's a bummer. I'm sure it brings up some memories of your kids.
I know what you mean. I have 2 grand kids and they're both going to be in the same class this year. I have a hard time remembering things.
That's so awesome. What did you eat?
I can imagine. I would be so annoyed if my family and friends were gone for the day.
I'm sorry about your loss.  I'm sorry about your life.
That is sad.  What happened?
That's really sweet of you.  Did she enjoy it?
Oh, nice. That was sweet of you.
I know that feeling. I was laid off from my job too. It was hard.
Oh no. I hope that doesn't happen to you.
I would feel that way too. Did you find another copy?
It is always good to find new books, and I am sure you can find another book like this one.
That's a bit of a let down.  Did you talk to them?
I know that's what I thought too. I'm not sure what they were thinking about it.
I agree, I am getting older too, but I am happy about that.
I'm the same way. I've always been a simple person.
I would have just swam on.
That's disgusting! I would never do that!
That's a little creepy, I guess.
That sounds like he's a pretty nice cat.
I'm sorry about your loss. What kind of items did he leave for you?
That sounds like a lot to unpack!  What kind of work did he do?
That's nice of you.
Yeah he always does that. I'm lucky I can trust him with my car.
I can't believe what happened. What did happen?
I'm sorry you had a bad dream.
I am glad to see you helping the wildlife. I have never given them watermelon.
It's great that you are doing this.  It's so nice that you're taking the time to help these animals.
I bet that was so much fun to watch!
It is so cute.  I love puppies.
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.
It's okay.  I know you are trying to move forward.  You will be okay.  I am sure it will be okay.  It will get better.  You will find someone else to love you.  Don't give up.  You will find your way again.  It will be okay.
It was good that you were able to do that for him.  I have a friend who is addicted to soda.  It is so hard to deal with.
That's great!
I am sorry.  Did it get resolved?
I understand that. It was good that you talked about it and explained why you were acting that way. I hope your daughter is not too hurt.
I love that. I have a bunch of old cd's myself, I used to listen to music and watch movies all day.
I have played some of those games too, they were a lot of fun.
I hate being turned down for a job I really want.  I would have to look for another one.  Did you get the job?
Yeah, sometimes you can't do what you want because of what you have.
That is a good thing, how did you change your life?
I know right, I feel you.  I hope you find what you're looking for and find happiness in the end.
That's a pretty large boat!
That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that. What lake?
It is nice that you have this dream of yours, I'm sure your wife is glad you got it.
That is awesome! What kind of fish do you like to catch?
That's a good thing to have friends in your life.
Yeah, I can understand that. It is not fair to expect people to do good things for you, but at the same time, it can be good for them to get the chance to prove themselves
Oh no.  That is so sad.  I have had dogs before and lost one.  I hope you found your dog!
Oh my gosh, that is awful. I hope you are okay.
I love skateboarding.  I've been doing it since I was 8!
I skateboard a lot.  My kids love to go with me.
That is a bummer. Did you end up having a family celebration?
That is very sad. It sounds like they are not getting along with the mother's side of the family.
That is frustrating! I would have been upset too.
I'm sorry that happened. Maybe you can try again next time and see what happens.
That is crazy! What did you do next?
That's disgusting.
It must be frustrating.  Are you in a treatment program?
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you find what works for you.
I have a son who loves cars! He has a remote control car too.
Yeah that's cool. I'm glad he got it. I've been wanting one for a while now.
That is good to know.
Yeah, that's the worst.  They probably didn't mean to cause any damage or take anything.  But still, they shouldn't have done it.
That is really kind.  What a good woman.
Oh wow, that is a very kind thing to do. I would do something similar for a family member or friend. It's always nice to help out those who are less able.
It is great that you are letting him experience new things.
That's great! I had my daughter in kindergarten. I loved it.
That sounds like a great time!  I have been to a few revivals and it's always a lot of fun!  Did you have a lot of fun at this church?
That is great, you must feel very happy and relieved.
That's nice. I'm a big kid, but I used to be a little shy and didn't like crowds.
That's awesome! I love when my kids are in different grades and can see the progression of their education. I'm 25 years old and my youngest is 10, and my oldest is 16.
I know right. I was watching her live performance on Saturday. She was so talented.
You are right. She was the Queen of Soul.
I love red beans and rice, it's my favorite!  What do you think they put sausage in?
That is the best way to eat red beans and rice.  The wait makes it so good.  It's a little bit like eating a meal that you didn't have to work hard for.
I am sorry to hear that. Is your child a boy or girl?
I am sorry, that sounds terrible. I hope that things work out for your family.
It is good to see you got it right
That's great. You should be proud of yourself!
That's exciting! I've never been to first day of school!
That must have been a lot to do.  Did you do anything fun for them?
Oh no.  That's so sad.  What is the bullies name and age?
That is terrible! I am sorry you have to deal with that. I hope your girl gets it together.
That's terrible! Did you do it?
I would never cheat on my wife either.
That's terrible. I hope your dog is doing better.
Oh wow! That's great. How did she do?
That's so kind of you!  Do you have a kitten too?
Oh wow! That's so nice of you! I hope the little one is well taken care of.
It sounds like everything was going well until you went out to practice and had a disaster.
That sounds like a lot of practice!
That's terrible! I'm sorry to hear that! Did you get hurt?
I'm sorry you had that happen. I hope you didn't get in trouble for it.
That's terrible. I'm so sorry you are going through this.
Oh my. That is horrible. I hope he is okay.
That is great, you must be happy.
That is awful. I hate when people do not follow through on their promises. It's like you are stuck in limbo because you don't know what to do.
That sucks. I'm sorry. Did you call to ask about it?
Yeah, I know what you mean.  I had that same experience with the crock pot.
That's cool, did your kid have a lot of fun?
I can't wait to get my own kid to babysit!
I can relate. My sister has two kids and she is an amazing mother.
That's pretty gross.  What do you do in that situation?
That is terrible! I hope they were not toxic.
That's a lot of pressure. Do you have any experience?
I hope you do well.
i was so scared!
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get a settlement for it?
That's so cool! What was your friend so bad about?
I am glad you got a Nintendo Switch.  That is a lot of fun stuff to do!
It's always nice to see friends. What are your plans for the weekend?
I bet you will!
I bet that was a scary moment.
Yeah, my cousin was definitely a bad influence. He was a bit of a bully and a jerk, and he would often get into fights with other kids.
I understand why you would want to keep it, but I think it's time to let go and move on.
It is nice that you are keeping the thing that your grandma gave you.
That is awesome. I bet they feel like they are on top of the world!
I can understand that feeling, but at the end of the day, it's all about the money, and you're right, you're probably not that far from that milestone yet. Just time to start saving and working hard for that.
Oh, that sounds terrible. What happened?
I'm sure you can get your things back from them.  What did they mess with?
That is so sad. I feel for you. Did you get a new one?
Oh, that's too bad. I bet you're not alone.
That is awesome.  What did you do?
That is great!  I am sure you two have a lot of great memories to look back on.  I am so glad you have such a loving husband.  I wish I had someone like him to love me back!  I think I need to work on my self-worth.  I am so grateful for my family, I am sure I would be lost without them!  I love my family!  I am so grateful for my family!
I'm sorry to hear that! I hope they are doing okay!
It's always good to think about how the animals are living their lives. I'm sure they have a lot to be happy about, but sometimes you have to put yourself in their shoes and see things from their perspective.
That's awesome! What did you study?
That's cool!  What's the essay contest?
It is exciting! What city are you moving to?
Oh that is exciting! What city are you moving to?
Yeah that's pretty weird. Did you ever try to kiss him?
That sounds really awkward. I can't believe he would try to do that. I hope he was not that kind of weird or annoying.
Oh, that is great! How long has it taken you to find a job?
I hope you get it, I've been out of the job market for a long time.
That is unfortunate.  Did she have to go to a different store?
I am sorry to hear that.
i saw a guy do that in a bar last year. it was pretty scary
That is a pretty cool thing to see!
Oh wow! Are you going on vacation?
I know how that feels.  I hope your moving soon.
I would be mad as well! Did you get a police report?
That sucks!  Did you report them?
Oh wow! I've never been to an airport with my dog. I'm not sure I would be allowed to bring one!
I remember when I got my first dog.  I was so excited to have her, and she was the most loyal companion ever
That's a good brother.  I don't think he would have been very good with money even without you lending him money.
I know how you feel about that. I've been there too. I just try to be patient.
Oh my gosh. That's terrible. Did she get in trouble for that?
That's terrible.  I hope you get to the bottom of this.
That's exciting. I hope everything goes smoothly.
That's frustrating.  Are you planning to move this weekend?
That's unfortunate. What kind of job was it?
I'm sorry, but what is the job that you were interviewing for?
I would be so grossed out!  I would probably pull over right there.
I would have been pretty grossed out as well
That's exciting! Where are you moving to?
Oh, I hope you find out soon!
Oh no! I am so sorry.
It's a bummer, but at least you can use it as an opportunity to buy a new book.
Oh wow. Did she have the toy for years or was it just recently?
I know, I'm so sorry. I miss her so much. I wish I could talk to her right now. I wish I could tell her how much she meant to me. She was the best dog in the world.
That's great! What kind of job is it?
That's great! How much did you get?
Oh, that's good! You're going to do well.
It's always nice when you feel prepared for an exam.
That's not cool.  What happened?
That is terrible. Did he damage the car or was he drunk enough to not cause any damage?
It's always good to stay with one place
Oh, that's great. I wish I worked in PR too!
Oh, wow! I'm glad to hear that. What was the campaign about?
I'm sure that went well.  Did they ask about anything else besides what you told?
Yeah that sounds good.
That's tough. How did you do it?
That's true. I hope it works out. It'll be okay.
Oh yeah! My husband always says the same, he likes the same thing as me.
It's so hard to try new things, especially if it was something that worked well.
Oh, I understand. I have the same problem.
Oh, I know, it is frustrating!
Oh no.  I am so sorry to hear that.  I am so heartbroken.
Oh my! I'm so sorry to hear about the loss. It's so hard to say goodbye.
Oh no! Hurricane season is scary!
It's always a little scary when there's a hurricane, but it's a good thing to have the right preparation in order.
Oh wow! That sounds like the best!
That sounds so kind of your wife!
I can understand why, but I always go to restaurants and order the "gluten free" and just trust the person in front of me to do their job right.  I don't want to risk my health and have to go back to the hospital.
It can be frustrating when you order something you want and the food isn't made with your dietary restrictions in mind.
That's a pretty weird thing to see. Did you guys get a t-shirt with a funny color?
That's so cool! I have never had that happen before.
I'm sorry you are having this hard, but it sounds like your kids are growing up fast!
Oh, that's so true.  I'm so glad I have a few of those memories.  I don't think I'd ever have those if I hadn't kept them.  My kids are going to be my kids for life, so it's so hard not wanting to hold on to anything that reminds them of me.  I'm trying to be okay with that but sometimes I wish I could just let go.  I hope I can find that balance for myself in life.
That's nice. Do you have kids?
Oh my goodness! That's the best breakfast ever! I love bacon and pancakes too! I bet you felt like a king!
I love bacon. I have a bacon obsession. I think it's because my grandma had it.
I think you should just go for it! She is the one.
That sounds like a pretty exciting moment! What kind of proposal are we talking about?
I bet he will be happy when he finds out!
That's really kind of you, I'm glad you are there to support her.
Yeah, I know how that is.  My friend is in a tough spot right now, but I know she's going to be fine.  I'm just trying to be there for her.  It's hard to see someone else struggling and not being able to help.  I'm trying to be there too.  I just know she'll come out the other side.  I'm so proud of her.  I know she's going to do great.  I know she
That's a pretty frustrating feeling. I would have been too. Maybe you should just save up for it?
Oh wow, that is a nice car. I would have loved to have that. I am not very good at cars. I have never even been to a car show.
I have one! I love my Subaru Brat!
That sounds like a fun way to save money.  I'm not sure what the scratch and win odds are though.
I know, I was so upset.  I don't know why it still is a big deal with her.  She's 3 years old.
I can understand that, but I was so embarrassed. I am not sure if it is a phase or if it's a problem.
That's awesome! What toy is it?
That's awesome! What toy is it?
Oh wow!  That sounds like so much fun!  What are you planning on doing on the cruise?
I've been wanting to go on a cruise for years too! I've heard they're very good for relaxation.  Have fun!
Oh, what happened? Did he have some kind of emergency?
I am sorry to hear that, that must have been a scary situation for your father.
That's sad.  Did you go back to church?
I'm sorry you felt down and down, but I think sometimes you need that kind of time to recharge and refocus.
I do too, but I have to say, I have never eaten anything but junk food at night.
I'm sure you'll feel good about it in the morning, and you can just enjoy your junk food. I'm sure you won't feel bad about eating junk food!
That's awesome! What did he do?
Oh my, that's awesome. I have 2 boys. I love seeing them open presents!
Oh that's cool.  I'm not a volleyball player, but I know someone who is.  Did they have fun?
That's really cool!  It's great that you have such a close relationship with them.  Do you have a favorite team?
oh, i see, that's terrible, i hope you are okay
I am sorry. Did you have a cure?
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you taking her to the doctor?
Yeah, that is bad. I hope she gets better soon.  I hope it is just a stomach bug and not a more serious disease.  I hope she gets better.
That's so sweet. I love my cat.
That is nice, my cat is sleeping too
Oh wow.  What kind of job?
I hope you do great.
That is a bit alone, but it is also very peaceful.
That's awesome! Where was it?
That was really bad. Did they have a good time?
Oh, that's awful.  I hate that kind of thing.  Did anyone else get a little gross?
That sounds like a fun experience.  What was your daughter doing there?  Was she trying out for the team?
Yeah she's got a great personality.
That is really nice of him.  I bet you appreciate that.
Yeah, that is understandable.  But, you should be able to repay him, if you work.  You are being very generous.
Oh no. What happened?
That's understandable, but they are there to help you.
That is so exciting! I have been to school since I was a kid. I remember how hard it was. How old are they?
That's nice!
That's no fun at all. Did you get to see them in person?
I agree. Sometimes it is just good to stay home
It is frustrating when people are in a hurry.
It can be so frustrating. I have been there a few times and I've gotten so mad that I just walked out and bought my food at the grocery store.
I'm sorry to hear about that.  How did you handle it?
That is a sad occasion.  I hope they are okay.
That's a fun trip. I'm a bit too old for traveling to that kind of distance.
It sounds like a lot of fun.  I've been wanting to travel there too.  What is your favorite part of Europe to visit?
That's always fun to see old friends.
That's a bummer. I've been away for a few years now.
Yeah I understand. It's hard when you can't get everyone in the same room. It's like you have to be on a different plane.
Oh wow, I didn't know that!
It happens all the time, I think she just likes the way she looks in them.
I'm so sorry.  That is terrible.  Why was they being mean?
Oh, that's so awful. I hope you guys are safe!
I understand that, but it's hard to see how she was able to get away with that for so long!
Oh, I am sorry. Are you going to be able to see her soon?
Yeah, I know what you mean. I have a niece as well, but she lives in another state, so I don't see her often either.
That's great! What are the kids in 1st and 3rd?
I bet it did. That's what shopping for school is all about.
I bet. How long have you been waiting?
I bet. I'm glad everything worked out in the end.
I'm sorry to hear that, that's not what you signed up for
Oh, I understand. My brother and his wife had a very complicated divorce, and it ended up being a very messy and emotional one. They are now divorced and it's a bit of a rough start.
I love volleyball, I used to play it in high school.
That is so true.  I used to love playing with my friends, I miss it.
I love fishing! Where are you going to go?
I've never been fishing before but I've been told it's fun. I've heard about stink bait, but I've never heard about secret recipes. What's stink bait made of?
That is a fun night, are you going with friends or family?
That's fun!  I love playing domino's, but I have never played with a group of locals.  What is it like?
Oh, that's a little nervousness. Is there anything in particular you are nervous about?
I bet that was nerve wrecking. I always feel the same way about guests.
I am sure you will.
I am sure you will. I got the same thing last year.
That's so annoying. Did you take him out for a walk?
Yeah that is so annoying. I would have to call the animal control.
That's awesome. What's the weather like? I'm a little nervous about it.
That is awesome!  I have been camping a couple of times.  What type of camping do you plan on doing?
That's so scary! Did you call the police?
That is pretty scary. I don't like it when it happens.
I hope the water doesnnt get in your door!
I am so sorry. I am sure it will dry up soon.
I would have been upset.  Did the store have a good quality cake?
I would have been upset. Did it taste like it had some kind of flavor or was it just gross?
It's good you took care of yourself and made yourself feel better. It's always a good idea to be professional and look your best in front of a camera.
Yeah, sometimes a little bit of self care can really go a way in making you feel more confident about your situation
That's so cool. What's her name?
I love cookies, but they can't be healthy. I love cookies too, but I love them more when they're made by my grandpa. He was a great cook!
That is so cool!  How old is she now?
That's so sweet.  I'm sure it brings back a lot of memories for you.
That's so sweet! What kind of games are they playing?
I have a daughter, she is 3 and is so cute. She loves playing with her dolls, but I have to play video games to keep her entertained.
I love that dip. I used to buy it by the container
That's sad. I'm sure they'll restock it soon though.
Yeah, I'm glad I did that job for so long.
That sounds great! What kind of job is it?
Yeah, I bet, you should hear back by the end of tomorrow. What kind of promotion are you talking about?
Yeah I can relate, it can be nerve wring.
I'm sorry to ask, but I'm not sure what that is?
I'm so shocked. I never would think that.
It's a shame, and they should be put in jail.
I'm glad they made it that far!
Yeah, England is pretty cool!
Oh, I know right? It's always a bit of an adjustment for the parents to be back to work and just having the kids at home.
That's cool.  What age are the kids?
It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with. Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!
That sounds gross! I bet it was gross to see all that stuff that had been left behind!
That's disgusting! What did you do?
You are right. They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty.
That's really horrible. It's so inhumane. I don't know what they were doing.
That's good to hear. I'm sure it is a lot more difficult for those animals that live in other parts of the world.
Yeah, I agree. I have friends who volunteer at a shelter in my city, it's so nice!
That is awesome!  I hope he gets the chance.
It's good that he's doing well in soccer.
I bet you are relieved to see them go back to school.  How long have the kids been in school?
That's so sweet.  What are the kids named?
I love ice cream for breakfast.
That is sad. What do you do for fun?
Oh I'm so jealous! I've been wanting to go on vacation for months but I'm too lazy to get up and go. I'll probably just take a sick day and go home and play video games.
I would be scared.  What did you do?
Yeah I've heard of that happening before. It was pretty scary.
I'm so sorry.  How did it die?  I'm so sorry you lost your little sweetpey.
I am so sorry for losing her.  I had no idea she had such bad health.
Oh no, I am sure she was frustrated.
That's so cool. I'm glad she's learning to adapt.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you try to find out how much it cost to find out?
That is frustrating, I hope she doesn't mind you going over there to pay off the fees. I'd feel like that's a necessary step for her to get a good education.
That's so nice of her.  I hope you are doing okay?
That's good to hear. I've been going through a lot of my own stuff, my parents have been helping me out. I'm trying to get back to normal life as much as possible.
That's so sad. What happened?
I feel you.  I am a very quiet type of person, and I love the peace and quiet.  I am a very introvert and I love my alone time.  I think I would be a little crazy if I was in a busy city all the time.  I would probably be a little crazy if I was at work all day.  I think I would be a better introvert if I was at home all the time.
I bet you felt bad about that.
That's so funny! I bet it's funny looking at the check now!
It is always better to wait for a better time to watch the movie, I think.
I'm sorry, I have heard that movie was terrible. I'll try to avoid it
Yeah, that's not good. You can't just leave your work without following the proper procedures, that's not good.
That's terrible.  What did you do?
I know, I hate working from home too.  It can be hard to get out of the house.  Do you work from home?
I know the feeling. My kid is always playing video games.
It can be hard to have butterflies about it. I'm sure it'll all be alright.
That is great! You will be fine!
That's disgusting! Did you throw it out?
I know, right?  I was so grossed out.  I thought it would be a worm in my water.  I was so grossed out.
Oh my, that's scary!  Did you get to watch them?
That is a pretty scary situation, I would be very scared too.
That's really great. Do you have any pets?
I love a good dog story!  I've got a couple of pets myself, so I know what you're talking about!  What breed is Charlie?
I would feel bad too.
I would too. You should try to make up with her. I would.
I'm not even going to the park today.
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope the snake is not still around and is waiting to strike again.
I am sorry.  That is a scary experience.  Did it happen recently?
It is always nice when you get a bonus.
I bet! What kind of job is that?
That sucks, I hate when that happens
I know how you're feeling. Sometimes you just can't go without them. Maybe next time they'll be back on your side.
I love photography. Did you get it with a good light?
That's so cool! What kind of camera did you use?
I would have been so grossed out.
Oh, I'm sorry! What happened?
It is annoying when the pets keep playing with you.
That's a bit annoying. I'm a cat lover, but I don't want my cat to sleep with me.
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.  Are you sure you got it?
That's good! I'm sure you'll get it.
That's no fun. Was it scary at all?
It's always a little scary when you're flying. But it's usually not as intense as it sounds.
I would feel bad for you, that would have been so bad to do.
That's so sad.  I hope you both got away with it.  Did you guys laugh?
Oh no!  What happened?
That is terrible. Did you report the crime to the police?
That is terrible. I am so sorry.  I know how hard it is to lose our pets.  My cat passed away last month and I still feel so much loss.  I am so sorry you lost your pet.  I know how hard it is to lose our pets.  I know how hard it is to lose our pets.  I hope you find some comfort in the memories of the time you spent with your pet.  I hope you find some comfort in the memories
Yeah it was hard. He was my best friend.
That's cool. I've never done karaoke before, I'm not very good at it. I hope he didn't sing too badly!
Oh wow, that is cool! Did you guys have fun together?
It's good that you passed. That is great news.
That's great, you must be proud of yourself!
That can be frustrating.
That sounds annoying!  I hope she doesn't get it stuck in her head and start singing it in the car or something!
I am happy for you
That is great! What will you be doing there?
Oh no! That must have been very unpleasant! Did you get in trouble?
That's a little embarrassing, but you're right, it's not a big deal.
That's good of him to do that for you
Oh no, I hope he didn't get into trouble.
I am sure there are plenty of options out there.  What are you considering?
That's a tough one!  What are your thoughts?
That's so thoughtful of you.  I love Christmas and the time to get all excited about it!
That's great! It's good that you are thinking ahead. I'm sure you'll do just fine.
It is unfortunate that things don't always go as planned, but it is good that it didn't ruin your plans.
I bet it was stressful.  I hate it when that happens.  Did you find anything?
That's nice. What do you think?
That's very thoughtful of you. It's great that you are looking out for each other. I'm glad to hear that you are in a healthy relationship.
I understand.
I completely understand, I always have to be careful with my money.  It is always good to be frugal.  I hope you have fun with your friends and that your financial situation doesn't worsen.
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope they understand how much you care for your family.
That's horrible. They are probably trying to get attention from you.
That's pretty frustrating.  What do you do?
That's great that you can relax.  I hope you can relax and enjoy the day.
Oh no. That must be very difficult.
Yeah, I think that is the best way to deal with the situation.
I'm glad you have someone like that in your life.
Oh, that's a sad thought. I hope they are happy.
That's so sad. You should try to have a talk with them and see if you can find a solution.
I'm sorry to hear that, that's awful. Did you have a C-section?
Oh, that's terrible! I hope you're all okay now!
I love that game too.  I love playing it when I have some free time.
Oh wow! Congrats on finally beat level 150! That must feel so good.
That's a little spooky. Did she make it?
Oh wow, that must have been gross.
I am sorry to hear that! Was it a long bus ride?
That is awful! Did you get help?
Oh no!  Did anyone know what you did?
Oh no, that's a bummer. What were they saying?
It's nice to hear.
I bet. Congratulations.
I am sorry to hear that. How is it treating you now?
I'm sorry, that is awful.
Oh no. How old is your youngest child?
That's sad.  How old is your youngest?
That's so sweet of you. Did she get in an accident?
That's not fair. She's a new driver. She's not going to be responsible. I should be the one to take her car.
I hope so! What are you studying for?
That's great! What test is it?
That's cool. Did you go back and see your old friends?
That's nice. I like that.
That is sad, what happened?
Yeah, that can be a hard thing to deal with.
I hope she recovers well. I am sorry to hear that.
That sounds really bad, I hope she is okay now.
That's great. What did you have for dinner?
Oh, I love a good skirt steak!
I know that feeling. I was nervous about proving myself too at first.
I can understand that. I had a hard time trusting my coworkers at my new job too, but it took me some time to get used to
It's not easy quitting anything but it's worth it to feel good. I know how you are feeling.
It's a tough struggle, but I know you can do it.  I've quit drinking too, it's hard but worth it.
It's okay, just relax and you will get the job
That's good, you'll get there.
That's terrible. Did you get any toys out of the catch?
Yeah, that's a good idea, they need to know what to do with them.
I'm sorry you had such a rough night, but I'm glad you were able to sleep eventually!
That's a good excuse. I know how it is.
That's not good.
I am sure you were not.
That must have been scary.
That is a scary thing to see, especially if he is not a friend of yours.
I'm so glad you got them!  That is the best feeling in the world.  Did you have a big celebration?
I have two. They are both 5. They are going to be in college soon.
I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do to make her up for it?
That is so good of you. I would have felt the same way. I have a grandma as well and I forgot about my grandkids birthday a couple years back and I called them. They are 6 and 8, so I called them both at the same time.
I bet that brought back some good memories.
Yeah I know how that feels.
I would never do that!
I can understand that! I'm afraid of heights myself.
Yeah, that's a good story.
I bet you did. I had a dog when I was 10. I was so mad when she was sick, and she died too.
I hate when that happens.  What happened?
That is so funny. I would have been mortified.
It's nice you can still look at it now and see how beautiful it is!
That's great! I love it when you have those kinds of memories. Did you go shopping after?
I love winning awards.  What award did you win?
That sounds like a lot of work.  I would love to have a yard.  It must be great to have a yard like that.  I bet the neighbors love it!
That sounds like a great time.
That sounds like a fun event
That sounds like fun. I love hanging out with friends, especially when there's good food to eat.
That is not good.  I hope you don't eat all of it.
I am so sorry. I hope she doesn't find it too hard.
Yeah that's a bummer.  You should probably check with your friends to see if they have any information about it.  Maybe they've found it.
Yeah I've lost a few things before. I hope your friend gets it back!
That's awesome! I bet she had a blast. How old is she?
I bet. I've never let her ride without a helmet.
Yeah I feel bad for her. I hope she is okay.
I am so sorry, it is terrible to hear.
That is nice of her, I bet you felt better after seeing her.
Yeah, sometimes the people we care about the most can really make a big difference in our lives, and that makes us feel better.
That sucks. Did you get any compensation for it?
I hate turbulence. It makes me nervous. I hope it was a short trip.
That's terrible! Did they reschedule for another time?
That's so frustrating! What happened?
It sounds like a great time!
That sounds like a great trip! I bet you had a lot of fun times there.
That is a pretty cool thought.  Are you going to go for a new set or just upgrade to something new?
I understand, I have to deal with having a rough ride on the road too. But I think it would be nice to have softer wheels to ride in.
Yeah, I'm sure that didn't end well for your poor dog.
Oh my god! That is terrible! I'm sure your husband is not going to be too mad about it.
It was very bad. I hope she is okay now.
I love tomato soup!
Oh that is great! I hope you have a wonderful time!
Yeah, that's always a special occasion!
Oh no! What happened?
Oh, wow! I've been wanting one for years. I'll definitely have to check into it!
I bet that was terrifying!
I bet you were worried about it!
That sounds awesome! What kind of programming do you work with?
That is very impressive. I am a programmer myself but I am still learning.
It's good that you got the promotion. What is it?
That's great, I hope you get it!
It's great to hear that! I hope you do well!
That's really nice, you're a very generous person.
That's awesome! Where was it?
I love it when you surprise your spouse.
Oh that sounds fun, I have family up in the Carolinas. What are you going to do when you get back?
Oh, that's awesome! What is the reason for going back to Alabama? Do you have a big family or friends there?
That's so exciting! I'm sure he was nervous!
I am sure it was a little scary! What did you do on the bus?
That sounds tough. I wish you good luck.
Yeah, I know you are studying hard for it, but it's good to feel confident.
Oh wow! Congratulations! What kind of job is it for?
That is great! I bet you got the job!
That's nice. What movie was it?
Oh man, I loved those movies! I used to watch them all the time.
I hope you found a new job.
Oh man, that's terrible! I hate that when that happens. Hopefully they pay up soon.
Oh that is terrible! What happened?
That's terrible, I would have been upset if I had my wife leave me like that. Did you find a new one for the dog?
Yeah thats a bummer, but you can always try to fix it yourself, or just wait for them to fix it.
I'm sure it's frustrating
I love candies!
Yeah, I would love to have that.  I have to be content with the candies and toys.
That's terrible.  I'm sorry he's got that.  Is it something that will affect him in the future?
It's a tough life. I'm sure he's doing well.
That's terrible! What kind were you talking about?
That's a good strategy, but you should have been more careful.
I hate when that happens.
I bet he's just a little bored, or maybe he just had to go.
That's great! What's your target goal?
I wish you luck!
Wow, that's awesome. What did you do next?
Oh man that is awesome. I can barely do that. I'm sure it took a lot to do that.
That's nice. What are you doing at the beach?
That sounds like a great time. What do you plan on doing while you're out at the beach?
Oh yeah, I am going to a bar.
That is terrible. Did you get it back?
That's horrible. Did you get your luggage back?
That's awesome! I've been thinking about getting one for my husband, but he's not really a tech guy.
That sounds cool! I've been wanting an apple watch.
I love going out to lunch.  What kind of food did you have?
I love taco places. I have been going there for a year now.
That is awesome! I love when that happens. What kind of job do you have?
That is awesome, how much was the raise?
I am sorry to hear that.  What is it?
It is tough.  But I would not have it any other way, I love my wife.
Oh yeah, that's the problem. We are not proud.
Yeah, I used to have a lot of those, but I don't see them as much these days.
Yeah, I had a bunch of them. I used to play with them every day.
I have never had to do that. What happened?
It is very unfortunate that it happened.  It can be frustrating when it happens.
That sucks. I'm sorry. Did you go to church?
That is nice. I wish I had that day off.
That sounds good! I'm glad you got a bonus! What kind was it?
Yeah that must be a lot of nervousness.
That's great news! I hope it goes well!
That sounds fun! What position does he have?
Oh, that's great! My son is in the 5th grade and he's never been to a game.
I hope you get it!
I bet you are.
I'm sorry to hear that.  That's a great opportunity.  Did you get the job?
Oh, nice. You must be excited!
Oh no! That is terrible! Did he get a bath?
That must have been very scary for the pet store clerk to deal with. Did you see the clerk's face change?
That must have been nerve wracking!
It was okay, I hope you did good. I hope you got the job
That is a good way to put it. I think I would have been a little upset.
That is awful.  Are you looking into anything else?
Oh no, I hope you are able to get some more treatment.
I am happy for him.  I am not sure about you.
That's awesome, I bet he's excited!
I'm sorry that happened.  How old is she?
That's hilarious.  She is such a smart one.  She can do all sorts of math and read.
I am too, she is such a smart and creative one.
That was a great time, I used to play that all the time. I had to go to work to pay bills, but I loved it.
I bet you were a good babysitter.
That is a terrible thing to do.  What is going on?
I don't like it when I wake up to a wet bed.
It's not a problem. You just need to go to the bathroom.
Did you drink the concoction?
I can't believe you have a uncle that is that kind of person.
Oh, that's not good. Did it come home?
That is so good to hear!  What was the minor problem?
That is terrible. Did you get a good deal on the car?
That sounds so scary. I'm glad you are okay.
That is not a reason to be grounded.
I can't even imagine having to deal with that.
That sounds like you're a bit anxious. What makes you so anxious?
That is so cool!  You must have a lot of money!
Oh no! That's really scary! I've never been near the water in my life.
My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer. She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.<|endoftext|><|eot_id|>
Yeah, what happened?
Oh no.  What plans did you forget about?
That is very interesting. What does he tweet about?
That's so annoying! What is wrong with people in this age of social media?
Oh that must have brought a lot of back memories! What did they do?
Oh, that sounds great. I have a lot of old stuff that I found too!
It's so cool to see how much different the city is in person.
I love Chicago!  I went there last week.  I was there for a week.  I think I had a great time.  I think you should go there.  It's a really nice city.
I am sorry I missed out on that. What were you studying?
I love traveling. I've always wanted to visit Europe.
Oh that's nice.  Did you find a good price for it?
Yeah, it was a lot of fun, but now she's gone and I miss her so much. I wish I could see her again.
That is awesome. I love Halloween! What are you planning?
That's so cool. I've never been to any of the Universal Studios locations. I hope I get to go next year!
Oh no.  What happened?
Oh, I'm sorry.  How are you coping?
I'm sorry.  What was it?
That's a tough situation. Did she believe you?
That's great, I hope you can keep it up!
That's great! You must feel happy and relieved!
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing alright.
I bet that was scary!  What happened?
I'm glad you had a great time!  What did they do?
I'm glad you were able to celebrate your special day with family.
That sounds awesome. What did he do?
That is great! You must be excited.
Oh wow! I hope you were able to get it back.
That sounds scary! I hope you were safe!
That is nice. I hope you win!
That's nice. I don't have any money to buy raffle tickets.
That is so nice of them, I am sure they were happy to help.
That sounds like a good time. Did you have to do the moving yourself?
I know, it's always disappointing, but you have to keep trying.
I am sorry to hear that, but I am sure you will win soon! You never win on powerball!
That is a great game.  I have been playing it for months now and I am addicted.
I have played that game before. I was also wondering that.
That is terrible. I am so angry about that.
That's really sad.  I don't know how you feel.  But I think that they should try to stop Russian hacking.
It happens to the best of us. I'm sure he was a great fish.
Yeah I've had my fish die too. It's always a sad day when that happens
I know how that feels.  What happened?
That sucks! What happened?
Oh, that is bad. What happened?
That is so frustrating. What did you do?
That's awful. I can't believe that happened.
That's terrible.  What team is it?
I hope you can get it under control.  Is it a cold?
That is terrible.  Is it going to be okay?
That's really cool. I've never seen anything like that. What kind of show was it?
I love magic!
I'm sure you will do great! What is the job?
Oh, you're excited about it! That's good!  What kind of job is it?
That's awesome! Did you feel confident about the results?
That's cool! How did you do?
That's really nice of her. How did you like the food?
That's nice of her. I have a similar mother too. She always comes over and brings food, and she's also super helpful.  I wish she had kids of her own.  She's a very nice lady.
I am sure it is.  I moved away from my parents a few years back.  It was very scary and lonely at the time, but I think it was good for me in the end.
That is sad. How old are you?
That's horrible. Did she get the treatment she needs though?  I have heard that is a big part of the deal when you're trying to get the insurance to cover something.
That must've been really tough. I'm glad your aunt was able to help.
I bet you were exhausted! How old are the kids?
Oh, that's wonderful! That's always nice to have that kind of time with the family
That is a long time. How did you manage to keep it that long?
That's great! I wish he would come back more often.
That's really generous of them.  I don't have a family to speak of, so I wouldn't have done anything like that.
That was so nice of them, I'm sure they were happy that it was their car.
It's nice that you went back there to pay your respects.
It's okay to feel sad about the loss, but I know that she is in a better place. I hope you are able to find happiness and peace in your future.
That is a terrible thing to see.  I would have been mad.  Did they steal it?
Yeah that sucks! What are you gonna do?
That is so cool. What is your sister working on?
It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her
Oh that's great. What was it?
That's so cool. I've never been to Hawaii.
That sounds great!  I am not a cat person, but I love dogs.  I have never even been around cats.  I know they can be a bit more challenging to take care of, but I have heard good things about them.  I think I would be okay, but it would be a lot of work.  I would have to do a lot of research to learn all the right things.  I am sure it was a bit overwhelming.
Yeah, that must be a lot of fun!
That is terrible, how did they do?
That's good, I hope you can get them back soon.
Oh, I'm glad you were able to take your dog.
i bet you were a little nervous for your dog.
I know how that feels.  What did you do?  Do you know how he felt?
That's a pretty good excuse for being a jerk. I'm sure you're a good brother in the end.
I know you mean to go back to college.
I'm glad you are.  What is it that you want to study?
That must have been very emotional for you.  Did you keep it?
It's always good to remember where you came from.
I'm sorry to hear that. That's not how car repair should work.
That is awesome. I hope you get the car back soon.
I'm sorry he is having a tough time.
That sucks.  I'm sorry that he's going through all that.  I hope it gets better.  Maybe they can learn from this.  Maybe it will help him in the future.
Oh no! What happened?
Yeah, it is nice to have good friends
That is terrible.  What did they do exactly?
That's awful! I am so glad that it was discovered! I hope that the company is able to take action.
That sucks, what was her name?
I'm sure. What did you do during that time?
I am sorry.  How long did you and your friend know each other?
Oh, that is so sad. I hope you can make some new friends to keep you company.
I've been in this situation before, but it's always a shock.  Did you try calling anyone to borrow them?
That is a funny story.
It is always good to see a friend over. I hope your roommate is friendly and you have nice conversations.
That is good to hear. It's always nice to meet new people, and to be able to socialize.
Yeah that happens. I've heard of people lying to get a promotion, or to be in a certain group.
That makes a lot of sense. It seems like you're not being too friendly with your supervisor.
That's an understatement, I don't know what to say. What did you do?
That's really cool. Did you ever see him perform live?
That is amazing! Congratulations!
That's awesome! Congratulations!
That's really sweet of them.
That is awesome. Did you have fun?
I love looking at old family photo albums.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they have lots of them.
I bet you felt pretty uncomfortable!
I am glad you were okay.
I bet you did.  What did you do instead?  I used to rollblading.  It is a great way to get exercise!
It was a good experience though.
I bet you feel lonely sometimes?
I am sure you can enjoy alone time and not have to think about your family. It's nice to have time for your self.
That can be scary, do you think you'll get the job?
Oh, I hope you do well. I'm sure you will.
Oh no. What are you moving to?
It can't be that hard to get used to.
I am so mad!  What did you do?
That is awful! Did you see the dog?
Oh wow, I'm so nervous about my first time getting a tattoo.
Oh, I can imagine. That's a scary feeling. But it's good that it turned out good in the end!
That's nice. What is he like?
That sounds like the perfect day!  I'm sure he knew you needed it.  What did you do today anyway?
Oh that's so great! How has your week been?
Oh, that's good news! Congratulations!
That is so true, I have always loved music.
That's awesome. It's nice to have memories of loved ones that are no longer here. I'm so sorry about your dad.
I know right? I used to love that stuffed rabbit. I have a few that my grandma gave me.
That's a great story. I have a stuffed bear too. It's my baby.
It sounds awful. I hope he's okay.
That's awful. I'm so sorry to hear that.
That's weird. What were you going to do?
I can't blame him, he was doing his job and I was a bit grumpy.
That is terrible.  I am so sorry.  My family has lost a few family members recently and I know how that feels.  I am sure you are feeling a little down right about now.
That is so sad. What did your dad do to make you all so close?
That sounds like fun. What shows?
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a funny show.
i know, i was so upset. i thought i was going to fail.
I'm sorry, I understand that you're having a tough time. But it's hard not to be worried about the future when it's so hard to make ends meet in today's economy.
I can imagine how embarrassing that was. I've tripped so many times in my life. I'm sure it was embarrassing for everyone watching you.
Oh no, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. I'm sure it didn't help.
I'm sorry to hear that! Hopefully it doesn't last long.
I bet that was very helpful!  Is he feeling better now?
That's so frustrating, I can't believe they didn't say anything
That's not good. Did they tell you why?
That is good, you will do well!
That sounds exciting. What kind product are you presenting?
Oh wow, did you confront them about it?
I would be upset with him for that.  I don't know how you can handle that.
I know that feeling.  He can be really annoying.
I know you feel that way too but you should try to get over it. It's not going to make you happy
I hope you got all A's too!
I am sure you will do great. You have put in a lot of effort.
I'm sorry, what happened to the kitten?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you take him to a vet?
It is a wonderful place. I visit my grandmother's home every month.
Oh that sucks.  I don't really visit the nursing home either.  I'm afraid they have a lot of people who don't want visitors.
That's so sweet, what type of bakery do they make?
That's awesome. I've never baked anything myself, but I'm sure you're a great mom.
I know, I feel so much better now.  She is so caring and supportive.
I can relate, my sister has been keeping some stuff on the down low for years, and I've been keeping some stuff on mine too. But my sister's been keeping it on her for years and I've been keeping it on mine. It's hard to deal with, but I'm glad to have a sister.
Oh, that's exciting. What was the wait like?
It is great. I have one son who is 4. He's in his 3rd year of college.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you ever get to say anything about your feelings to her?
That's so cool! How old is he now?
That's great, I bet it's a lot of hard work. I hope he does well and gets where he wants.
That's so nice. What did you do on vacation?
It is so important to take time for ourselves and enjoy the simple things in life.
That sounds like a nice time to have your husband back! I hope you have a wonderful time together!
That is so exciting!  I am sure you will have a great time! What is it?
I'm sure you'll have a great time.
It sounds like you two are really committed to each other.
That's so cool, how old is your son?
That's so true! I remember when my daughter was young and we would go to the park every day to play and she would get so sick and tired and then we would go to bed with her and she would sleep for a week. It was like she was just going to sleep and then suddenly wake up and be all "oh no, I'm so sick again!"
I hope you do well! I hope you get a promotion too.
It's great that you feel confident in yourself!
I hate when people do that to kids.  That is not right.  What did you do?
Yeah, and I was not able to tell him that she was making a joke.
It's normal to feel that way, especially if you have a history of anxiety.
I'm glad she did well! What did she start at?
That is terrible.  Did you plan anything?  I always try to be prepared for anything.
It was fun! I'm so sorry you had such a hard time! I would be so upset if I had to forget everything!
Oh wow, I would have felt the same way.
I'm sorry to hear that, but at least he is a good guy.
That would be so frightening.
I would have been a little worried, but I'm not a scared person. I'm sure they just didn't know what they were doing and just didn't mean anything by it.
I love surprises.  I'm not a fan of birthdays.  How did you like the surprise party?
It's a good thing that you were not expecting it.
That can be tough. Did you apologize?
Yeah, I can understand that. It is always good to take a step back and think about how things might sound to others. I hope it doesn't come to that and you both just can't agree.
It would have been so terrifying. Did you ever find anything out?
I'm glad that it turned out to be just your shadow. I would have been so scared!
It's always good to be considerate of the people that are less fortunate than us.
I agree, homelessness isn't common where I live either, so I feel it's my part to give.  I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed.
That's great! How many kids do you have?
That's so wonderful.  Do you have any kids?
I can relate to this situation. I had to walk away from a group conversation because one of the people in the group disagreed with what I believed. I didn't want to conflict with them.
I agree, I think we should all be treated equally, regardless of how they came to be here. I'm a Muslim, and I have a friend who's a Muslim, but we both work together in the same office and are friends.
That's so exciting! Did you drive it safely?
That's terrible. Are you driving it in the rain?
That's great! I've joined a few groups myself, but I've never joined one that's specifically for weight loss. What kind of group is this?
That is awesome!  I hope it works for you.  I have been trying to lose weight for a long time, but I have been having trouble sticking to my diet and exercise plans.  Maybe I should try to join a group too.  I am sure it would make a big difference.
I have always been nervous about it. I'm not a good test-taker.
Oh wow, that is a lot! But I bet you were proud of yourself!
That's a nice way to look at it. I'm sure it brought some good memories for you.
I think that's a very good point, but I guess I've thrown some out because I thought it was too much effort to keep them.
That's very nice of you.  I have a lot of old cards and papers that I keep.  I'm not sure what to do with them all of the time.
I'm sorry I don't have the time to read a lot of books. I just have a lot of work and family.
Oh wow, that's a pretty scary thing to happen. Did you trip?
Oh wow, that's crazy! Did anyone see you?
I know how that feels.
That's a pretty tough decision to make.  Do you feel like you're doing the right thing?
That's a bummer! What's the play about?
Oh, that's a bummer!
Oh, good!  How is it going?
That's great!  I hope she enjoys driving.
That is so awesome. You are so lucky!
I'm glad to hear that you guys are working towards this.  It's great that you're both supporting each other and working together to get her to drive further and further away from home.  I'm happy to hear that you're working hard to get this done.  I bet you'll both be proud of each other when it's all done!
That is a bit stressful.
I bet you're excited to see what they bring!
That's very cool.  My brother and I also sold a house, but it was a lot more complicated.  I'm glad you have someone to lean on.
Yeah, I've got a brother too. I'm lucky to have him.
Yeah I've been there.  My older brother is like my best friend.  We've been through a lot.  He's always looking out for the younger brother.  We were always fighting.
That is a great relationship. I am glad to hear it is not typical of everyone.
that's awesome! i'm so proud of you!
I am so proud of you and your children. You have a lot to be proud of.
Yeah, you can get lost. But I'm sure it's just a little bit.
Yeah, that's a good idea! You can always ask for a map or a GPS.
I am sorry.  What happened?
I'm sorry to hear.  I hope you're okay.  I know it's tough losing loved ones.
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope they have a good funeral and are in heaven.
That's awful. I hope you're doing alright.
I have never owned an Xbox either, but I have played a few times.
That is awesome. I am excited for that.
That is so kind of her.  I hope she continues to take care of herself and stay in your life.
That's a great point, my mom is always there for me and my family, and I appreciate that.
Oh wow. What's the weekend for them?
Oh, wow! I can only imagine how you feel about it!  Are you going to go hang out with them?  Or are you going to stay home?
That is awesome! What country?
That's awesome.  I love voice acting.  I've been doing it for years.  What kind of character do he do?
Oh that is so sad.  What did you do?
Oh that is great, how old is he now?
I'm glad you felt the need to help!
That's so kind of you. I would do that too.
That is bad. Are you going to college?
I'm glad that worked out for you.
That is horrible. Did you call her?
That must have been really tough for you.
That's the worst. I hate wearing pajamas at parties.
I can understand that, I wear pajamas at work too.
I bet you must have been very scared
It's always weird to hear about the past of dreams.
I feel bad when I do something wrong.
Yeah, I've done it before too. It really makes you realize that it wasn't right.
I love meditation, I do it every week. It's so calming.
I have never been to a meditation retreat before.  What is it?
That's great! What's your family like?
Oh that is fun. I am sure the kids will enjoy it.
That's awesome, did you get a letter from a college or university?
That is great news! You will make a great lawyer!
That's so exciting! I've been waiting a long time for my cookbook to arrive! I hope it's not too long.
You're right, I've always been a bit of an adventurous eater. I've never really been to China, but I've heard great things about the food. I'll have to try some of the recipes.
I'm a little jealous that I never get to see those things. What happened?
That is pretty cool, what did you do next?
I'm so glad to hear he's healthy and doing well! How long has he been home?
That's great! I'm sure he's going to do well.
That's awesome, I hope you're together for life!
I am happy for you.
That's terrible!  Did you get mad?
That's terrible! I'm sorry that you had to deal with that!
I am sorry to hear that.  Are you going to call a collection agency?
I would have done the same thing. I would have been angry at him for being so bad. I would not have done it to my brother or sister.
I'm glad that it was not your car.
Oh that is so nice of you.  I am sure it was frustrating.  I hope you were able to get the tire fixed and that you are okay.
That's so sweet of her.
I love my friends as well, I am glad you have a good relationship with them.
Oh, I'm sure it's a minor mistake.
That's not good.  I'm sorry you feel that way.  I'm sorry I made a similar mistake.  I was a little kid.
I'm sorry.  I hope he is okay now.
That is great news.  How old was he when he passed away?
I know. I have fond memories of that time too
I'm sure that's true. Life is good, but it's always nice to look back on it.
That's nice! Did you have a problem finding them?
What cats?
I love how much people love to share their life on social media. It's like you can't turn on the lights without seeing someone posting about their vacation or their adorable cat.
That is awesome! Congratulations! How did you do?
Oh no, that is bad. What did you do?
I bet. Did you guys get your trunks back?
I was drinking 4 gallons a day.  I had a stomachache for weeks.
I would have done the same!
I would feel the same way
I understand. I would probably tell him I didn't know and see if he would do it for me instead.
I understand, I have been in management for a long time and I know how to let people do things.
I understand where you're coming from, I feel the same way.
It's like my dentist says, they're a lot of work.
Yeah, it's hard to take.  But you have to do it.  I've had a lot of dental work done, and it is hard.  But you need to have clean teeth.
I am sure it has to be something.
i have that too. i think it's the brain.
That is true. Sometimes you need to be in other places to see where you need to work on.
Yeah, it's fun to see how much you can conquer yourself, and it's nice to be able to see how you're changing
Oh wow, that's a very adventurous thing you did. I have never gone skydiving. How was your experience?
Yeah that was pretty cool. I'm not really adventurous but I love the rush of adrenaline when I'm skydiving. I hope I'll get the chance to go again!
I love your optimism! I feel like it is very hard to be positive in the world right now, but it is good to have someone to share your optimism.
That's awesome! Congratulations! What kind of music do you make?
That is awesome, what do you want to do?
That's the best part of the world.  It's always good to have the world at your fingertips.
I'm not really good at meditation.
I meditate every day. I think meditation is very good for your mind and it helps you to be more productive.
That is good. It is a normal thing for many people, especially when they have a job to support their family. I am sure it doesn't bother you much.
That sounds like a really tough feeling to deal with.  What are you doing to try and get out of it?
Oh, that's good, it's good to not be so controlling.
That makes sense. Sometimes you have to let go of control and trust that everything will work out in the best possible way. It's hard sometimes but it's necessary
That's great! I wish you the best!
That's awesome! You're a rockstar!
It's going to be fun! I love camping.
I hope so too! I love camping, especially in Florida! I'm not sure if it will get bad though. I don't like getting sick when I'm sick.
I am sorry to hear that. What was it?
I am sorry to hear about that, did you lose anything?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get to the tire place?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you take it to a tire shop?
That sounds pretty scary.  What happened?
I bet.  What kind of cat was it?
That's a great perspective. I think that's really important to have.
That's great! I love how you put it. It's like if you don't have God in your life then it's like you don't have anything in life! I love that.
Oh, you feel like you're drowning in work or something?
That's the point of a break. You need a break to take a breath and relax
I know, I felt the same way, I wanted to be popular too
I am sorry you were envious, but it's not your fault.
That is very scary!
That's not good. Did you get sick?
Oh no, what kind of weight are you lifting?  I am trying to get stronger and lift heavier.
That's awesome! You must feel good to be lifting that much weight!
Oh I know what you mean. I have to be careful with the people who try to sell me things that aren't really what I need.
I agree, I hate those scammers
Oh no! Did you get in trouble for it?
Oh wow!  That sounds awful.  Did you have to go to the bathroom to get it out?
Yeah, I like that one.
That's awesome. They're so underrated!
That's great. How long has it been?
Oh man!  I'm a truck driver!  That is the best thing in the world!
That is horrible.  What are you going to do?
Oh no, that sounds terrible.  Are you in contact with the bank?
Oh yeah? Why? Because you get to talk to people who just don't care?
That's a terrible thing. I'm glad you are aware. What kind of sales?
That is terrible, I hope they are all okay and that is not a habit for them.
It is hard when you want something and it keeps getting pushed back.
I know it makes people feel bad. I don't like the way people take advantage of each other.
I agree completely. People need to be taught that the truth is not always what they're told. I'm not sure what's worse though, the people taking advantage of them or the people telling them they're right.
Oh, you're nervous about it?
That is good to know. I hope it goes well.
It's always a good idea to leave your key in a safe place so you don't have to worry about it.
Yeah I know it happens. I had that happen to me last year. I left my keys inside a parking lot.
Oh no! Did you finish all your courses?
I'm not sure how you feel about it but you have a good chance of getting good grades if you study hard
That is so scary. What happened? Did you get out of his room?
I'm sorry to hear that!  What room do you live in?
That is so bad, what did happen?
That was a good one, I love it when people try to steal from others.  How did you feel?  Did they catch you?
It is exciting. Do you have any children?
Yeah, that is a lot of responsibility, but it is great to see that you are ready for it.
That is so true, Christmas is a magical time of year.
That's true. I'm a little worried about the cold weather though.
I hate it when that happens
Oh wow.  What did he say sorry?
I am so sorry! Did you get your car back?
I know right! I was so upset! I was walking down and they hit me.
I love candies.
I love the stuff you like! I love sour s'ghetti too! What was it like eating it as a kid?
I'm so sorry to hear that.  Is she better?
That's great! I'm so happy for you! How old is she?
Wow, that is so awesome! I am really into Minecraft right now.
That is awesome. What was the name of the world?
It's always sad to have to cancel plans.  I know you were looking forward to it.
That is a terrible work place. I would not take a vacation at all
It's nice. I like that.
I agree! I feel very lucky to have such a wonderful life.
That's not good. What were you going to do?
That is so gross, I hate cockroars too!
Oh no, are you studying for anything?
That's great. I hope you study well.
