I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him!

Honestly, it's probably because I spend too much time on the Creepy subreddit; I should know better. A few nights ago, after reading through a few particularly disturbing threads, I was out smoking a cigarette in the street at 3am. After a few minutes, I saw what looked like a drone flying straight toward me, and I swear my blood went ice cold. Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.

A few nights ago, after reading through a few particularly disturbing threads, I was out smoking a cigarette in the street at 3am. After a few minutes, I saw what looked like a drone flying straight toward me, and I swear my blood went ice cold. Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?

I would be angry if a truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my room right now, if I'm being honest. Not only would it destroy most of what I own, but it would also make the place smell awful for months. And I mean, the smell is a bit more important, let's be real. I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.

I couldn't believe it when my dog died a few weeks ago. I honestly thought I was going to stay lonely forever. When my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to go look at dogs to cheer me up, I said no.
