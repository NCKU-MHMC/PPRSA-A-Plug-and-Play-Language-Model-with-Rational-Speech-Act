wow that ' s pretty terrifying . do you still stay safe these days ? do you even still live ? <|endoftext|>
oh dang . well , i ' m glad it didn ' t affect you that much . i hate when someone doesn ' t pay attention to where they are going . i hope you guys get sober some day . <|endoftext|>
well , the first time we went back to my house we moved from my childhood home , to this new house we are now living in . . <|endoftext|>
it was a two year ago and yes he was indeed punished . i was so scared . it was very hard to watch and i really don ' t miss him like i used to <|endoftext|>
that is rough , just suck it up and move on . don ' t be sad that happened to you . <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds like a wonderful experience . congrats on the new position . i hope you both enjoy it ! <|endoftext|>
what concert was it ? ? was it a great time ? ! ? ! what concert ? ! <|endoftext|>
how awesome ! the u2 are really good music . so good . and a great group too ! ! <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never read that one , but it ' s so sad . i hope she is going to make up her mind soon . <|endoftext|>
do you think she had cancer or just went to the doctor ? it sounds like she was close to her , i would be very sad to see her go . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! was the baby okay ? was his knee alright ? that is so sad that he was put down . <|endoftext|>
so cute . where do you write ? i love singing happy birthday by the way ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
oh no , that ' s so sad . has he had any interviews ? i know sometimes things can get tough for people who have two jobs <|endoftext|>
you should also ask her why she hasn ' t shown you her body yet ! don ' t want to scare her away ! <|endoftext|>
oh my , how did you find out that ? that must ' ve been scary ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that is so important to all of us . i am truly glad that you care about that . <|endoftext|>
wow ! that ' s exciting . i can ' t wait to see them too . what are you guys going to do ? <|endoftext|>
thats amazing , congrats ! do you get any gifts ? ? ? ; ) ; <|endoftext|>
what a jerk ! i would be pissed too ! how do you plan to get out of that situation ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! is the picture taken with a good photo or with a bad person ? the first thing i would do if i was in your shoes is not go out with either of those people . <|endoftext|>
thats the same reason i wouldn ' t wait any longer for a new tv . i would be so upset if i bought something that was not worth it <|endoftext|>
well , i hope everything turns out better for you eventually . i would be very sad if it did . <|endoftext|>
that was very nice of you to do and i bet he appreciated it ! was there any reason for that behavior ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s such an amazing friend you had . i would be so devastated if i had had to go through the same thing . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great , i love being able to get a bit of quiet from time to time <|endoftext|>
we just need a better world to live in . i work from home so i know my mom will always have my back . <|endoftext|>
wow that must be a drag . have you thought about making a move to another country ? i ' m in the same boat . <|endoftext|>
you could also try joining some sports groups . i like watching games with my kids . it can be a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
that ' s not good . is she going to punish the child at all ? i have a hard time seeing people break things like that because they are undestandable . <|endoftext|>
yeah , and now it ' s all kids ' problem . . and it ' ll be all over him . <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness , i would ' ve screamed ! are you alright ? ! did you call the police ? <|endoftext|>
thats great that you had a conversation ! i wish i had a similar conversation with my ex <|endoftext|>
i bet you miss her so much ! sounds like you and your daughter can hang out often ! <|endoftext|>
i can imagine it , i felt my heart skip a beat just thinking about it , what a moment . <|endoftext|>
i remember when my wife and i moved in together and we had a boy that turned out to be just a boy , the girl i just met as a teen was really similar to my boyfriend , but he was older , too . <|endoftext|>
wow , really ? i ' ve never even used it before . what happened ? if you are going to do it use the same exact word ? <|endoftext|>
exactly ! i think we all need to look at our circumstances as another persons business . life is a journey but we make our own decisions ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s great that your family was able to get involved with it . how is it over now ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s very sad ! i can ' t imagine the grieving that must have been done . i ' m so sorry . <|endoftext|>
it ' s good to hear someone who has good opinion of yourself . i guess if you think you ' re right and you do believe in something , then it makes sense . for others , it ' d probably not seem right or fair . <|endoftext|>
it ' s very beautiful ! i like to watch movies and read books too . it gives me more emotional feelings then in real life . <|endoftext|>
aw , that ' s so sweet ! it sounds like you have some really good friends . congratulations ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! that must have been a nice surprise ! what did you do ? was it just your parents ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s sad . do you feel lonely when you don ' t have any friends ? i would try to be more aware of yourself and find some quiet time so you feel like you have some company . <|endoftext|>
i totally understand that . maybe you can invite some friends over to watch some netflix with them . that ' d be a bit funnier than a regular dinner . <|endoftext|>
that is so true . i was really shocked to see that my son is still alive and running . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , where these were due to their birth ? i know quite a few people who hold on to their old songs and lyrics , and i can see why they were used in such a way . <|endoftext|>
do you like the french fries , the french bean dip , or just the chicken ? i love both ! <|endoftext|>
lol . you could probably schedule it for another day , though ! we are human beings , and should know that ! <|endoftext|>
being an child myself , i always miss that moment . what made you visiting it so surreal ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s always the best way to learn . i think parenting is important . what did you do that was inspiring you ? <|endoftext|>
i bet it will and i ' m sure she will feel the same about you guys as you do her ! <|endoftext|>
she was trying to be , but her boss told her it was bad and she got fired . she had to make a change , but now she is selfemployed , full time full time , and having a baby girl , all in one place . it was a big transition , but it was worth it <|endoftext|>
i see . do you feel bad now ? and why did you treat her like that ? because i know that can be really hard . <|endoftext|>
i am sure you have a deep rooted sad feeling . hopefully everything works out for the best . <|endoftext|>
did she have a good cancer ? my grandma used to cancer her whole life but she was all the way with cancer . . <|endoftext|>
i bet that ' s very admirable . most people don ' t have that kind of confidence . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you were able to feel that way ! i ' ve been trying to be more confident and content about my abilities . hopefully , my words will be the true power that i ' ll forever hold . <|endoftext|>
i try to stay positive and put myself out there ! she could do with some more discipline ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s amazing , how much has it grown ? i bet she ' s excited ! . <|endoftext|>
my friends fiance and i usually go out about a month and a half early , so i understand . i know how that feels . <|endoftext|>
congrats ! i would be proud as well ! ! hopefully you keep that habit alive for the rest of your life ! <|endoftext|>
how long did it take you to win that either ? i mean you must have been very strong to do that and do it in such a long distance . <|endoftext|>
wow ! where were you living at the time ? did you win the marathon ? where were the other competing <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i ' ve never been into the artistic scene of art . is that what you do ? <|endoftext|>
well thats terrible . i hope everything works out and things get better . sorry for your drama . <|endoftext|>
me too , i hate when kids bullying on the playground . makes me want to kick them dead open . <|endoftext|>
sometimes it ' s hard to channel anger when you live with your parents . maybe talk to them ? it may help a little . <|endoftext|>
that is so awful i ' m sorry to hear that . did she know who hit the cat ? <|endoftext|>
thats such a nice thing to do . im sure she cant ever mess it up again . <|endoftext|>
disne? what ' s that ? some sort of amusement park ? i haven ' t been there in ages , when i was a teenager . did you enjoy it ? <|endoftext|>
i can imagine it was ! it sounds like a wonderful time . what a wonderful place tucson is ! <|endoftext|>
does he live far away ? my dads always talk about his childhood and the distant past . <|endoftext|>
oh , well thats good then ! that is not something to be sled into haha <|endoftext|>
my husband and i try to do that as much as we can . he ' s not a big fan though <|endoftext|>
yea i feel happy for him . . just wish i kept him , he has been with us forever <|endoftext|>
i ' m the same way , it can be very irritating ! especially if they don ' t appear to be responded to . <|endoftext|>
exactly ! text or impersonal mail is the best way to go about meeting people ! especially if it ' s work ! <|endoftext|>
oh no , what was the fight about ? what made you upset ? was it an argument on your own ? <|endoftext|>
i hope you two can work it out . don ' t waste your time on a dumb argument . just be yourself . <|endoftext|>
you are so right ! i get lonely all the time being with the kids ! how did you like traveling out of the country for business ? <|endoftext|>
that is a fantastic adventure , i would love to do that myself . what do you enjoy most about hong kong ? <|endoftext|>
i see that too sometimes ! i guess the statistics don ' t show it was close , but that is a shame <|endoftext|>
thanks . i just miss her so much . i was just so happy to see her again . <|endoftext|>
what did your mom do after you told her ? did you tell her anything about the situation ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , i get that . sometimes people don ' t seem to understand that we are human , and we ' re just human . <|endoftext|>
dang , that must have been rude . that must make you feel bad . sometimes kids will just forget things and try to forget all about them . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good , you should do some fun activities with her ! i don ' t like bad surprises . <|endoftext|>
i think we should exercise more often in general to help make sure we don ' t get injured or in danger of injury . <|endoftext|>
yes you do , it is a sad thing to be alone sometimes though . but you have to make the best of it and do what is best for yourself . <|endoftext|>
i know that feeling , too . it ' s a good feeling to look back on the good times . what do you like to look at the most ? <|endoftext|>
they are . . still ! it ' s hard for them to get their independence and responsibilities all correct . <|endoftext|>
wow . you must be quite the sight on the face ! i can see why that would be hard to have confidence in yourself . <|endoftext|>
i bet it is , we have to try more and hit those milestones more often . <|endoftext|>
it is amazing that you two both work for yourselves and can so independently well . i bet you both have a great life together . <|endoftext|>
well if you can ' t spend money on medical or sick time then it ' s time to put yourself out there and make the most out of it . <|endoftext|>
oh no that is horrible what happened ? ? ? he or she was not able to make it ? <|endoftext|>
really , that ' s awesome ! you must be very happy for her ! i know how that feels . . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a nice place to live , i would love a vacation ! how long are you staying there for ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds awesome . i wish i could stay at miramar . i ' m sure your husband will love that , and be able to see all the things he ' ll do there ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s nice , sounds like a fun plan ! maybe you can go today to celebrate ? <|endoftext|>
oh , that sounds like trouble . was she upset at you ? or did you get a replacement ? <|endoftext|>
oh my god ! what a creep ! did you call the police ? did the police ever come out to help ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s really scary ! i can ' t believe you didn ' t get killed . did you get a cab ? <|endoftext|>
what happened ? what happened , tell me . i am looking for you . don ' t tell me about anything . <|endoftext|>
wow ! that ' s awful ! did you call to complain ? or do you still want to date ? <|endoftext|>
what did happen ? was it some random thing ? or what happened ? hopefully she didn ' t affect you much . <|endoftext|>
yeah , that seems like a huge binge , and how did everyone react to it ? did everyone say anything ? <|endoftext|>
no , what happened ? ! ? are you going to tell me ? lol ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that really stinks , hopefully beyonce can come back and do something good . she has been a big influence on the show ! <|endoftext|>
who was sleeping on the couch when you got home from new york ? did you punish yourself ? <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds scary ! i bet he was happy ! i would be too lol what car did he have ? <|endoftext|>
that must have been very exciting . i hope you ' re having fun ? i don ' t have much family , but i know what i would do if i did ! <|endoftext|>
did he give you a lot of stuff ? was it a lot ? ! ? ! ! ? : ) <|endoftext|>
oh hey ! hopefully they are well prepared for the interview ! what job did you interview for ? <|endoftext|>
i love marketing , you must have had a great look at his face . congratulations ! i know that was an intimidating moment for you . <|endoftext|>
no , did you ? are you saying you didn ' t have a wife and all the responsibilites ? <|endoftext|>
that is extremely scary to hear ! i am glad you were brave to brave your own shot . <|endoftext|>
did your friend laugh it off or what ? did he do it in public ? it ' s just so uncomfortable , to be so close . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good you realized you shouldn ' t have done that . it could have ruined your friendship . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that ' s always horrible . you must have been very glad you didn ' t have to deal with that ! i have a super closed off fridge . you can get cold winters where i am so i ' m always ready to run it by the end of the weekend ! <|endoftext|>
it can be hard to tell when someone is so confident about themselves and all of a sudden not one person knows what it is . <|endoftext|>
oh , that is so sad ! have you talked to your friend about it yet ? you should have told him , so he doesn ' t feel as bad about it now . <|endoftext|>
oh . i am so sorry you had to go through this . do you think she will ever be able to get what she can from you ? <|endoftext|>
awwww how sweet of her . . . where are you guys now . . ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
don ' t worry about it . your mom is probably glad that you weren ' t doing such a good job . <|endoftext|>
sounds great ! i hope you have lots of fun ! ! ! where are you going ? i live in south texas now and would love to go on vacation to the beach <|endoftext|>
well , that sounds fun . i have been there before and it was fun , too . i am sure you will have fun , and it ' ll be cheaper than going to hawaii . <|endoftext|>
you must be so proud ! it ' s so great when your kids work and enjoy their own time . <|endoftext|>
oh , i know . my mom had to buy me a laptop for christmas . my life is better now than it was back then because i spent my money on shopping , and i had to work . <|endoftext|>
that is such a silly thing to do . . . i don ' t see why people would do it . <|endoftext|>
yeah , that does the trick . i wish i could do that and not have to deal with that annoying cashier ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s so sweet . was it an exciting surprise or was it painful ? i am sure you were happy ! <|endoftext|>
wow , i am so glad you have some happiness in your life , i would be too ! ! <|endoftext|>
it is so great to help people when you can . not too many people talk today . very exciting . <|endoftext|>
i haven ' t heard of it ! you sound very talented . i ' m sure you must be very proud ! i can never get involved in visual video production . <|endoftext|>
absolutely . if we ever had a world with more than a few people in it , we ' d all be better off . <|endoftext|>
i agree that it is a trap but they have started moving in that direction since the beginning of time . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i love belugas too . what kind of aquarium ? and how old is your belug now ? <|endoftext|>
ha ! you just made my day ! now i need to watch the movie with my daughter ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s really nice ! what did you get ? was it something that had you all by yourself ? <|endoftext|>
i always cry at the gifts and card ceremonies at my wedding . it ' s so hard to think of how sweet and thoughtful the gift was . <|endoftext|>
apparently the dims kept telling me i wasn ' t allowed to use the machines . . . i thought i could finally get it working once we moved . i don ' t know how i ' ll feel about it later . . <|endoftext|>
well they were like they want recommendations and recommendations and then give me a hard time . so not very helpful <|endoftext|>
i know . i learned my lesson . but at the same time i feel i can ' t trust anyone again . <|endoftext|>
i have a friend who had her son a year ago and her husband has a baby boy ! it is such a crazy time for everyone and very hard work to create a healthy baby ! <|endoftext|>
well , sometimes people just don ' t understand when they ' re trying or are just not happy with the result . you have to be a good friend to not be so closed off . <|endoftext|>
no but i have hulu and i didn ' t know there was netflix . the show is getting really old <|endoftext|>
how was that ? i ' ve heard it ' s really good ! did you enjoy it ? <|endoftext|>
i really like those kind of shows . i ' m sure that will help you when you get back in the groove of it . <|endoftext|>
it ' s a good feeling . it would make things a little easier for you if you quit now , right ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! did you get any of it back ? or is unemployment just included ? <|endoftext|>
ugh so agrate you get out of the car and just take it there ? ? <|endoftext|>
people are rude . did you honk your horn ? i ' ve never honked before . <|endoftext|>
i remember that movie . it was pretty scary when you were a teenager ! i can ' t ever watch it now lol <|endoftext|>
you should look for a new hobby , or get a side business . that is what i did a while back and found to be easier . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really impressive ! have you been watching her ? it must have been an incredible moment for her . <|endoftext|>
you seem very proud of her . i ' m not a nice person , so i have no say in the gender of the flowers <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty weird . it ' s nice to notice things like that sometimes . did you have a taste for it afterwards ? <|endoftext|>
yes , be careful . my mom had to get her garden taken care of with a rea- she ended up being stuck between two walls . <|endoftext|>
cute . what type of puppy is it ? does it look small ? i like puppies . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome , i do enjoy finding good deals online but if it was meant to be it would have been annoying . <|endoftext|>
wow , that was generous of them . my parents didn ' t get me much either , we only had one car . i did get some groceries during the week , but nothing really useful . <|endoftext|>
i like your attitude u sound like it is going to do well . you are a good kid . i wish you the best . <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! i ' ve heard about someone getting that achievement . he is very proud . i bet you worked really hard . <|endoftext|>
oh i am glad to hear that ! i wish you the best of luck . it seems like 5 more years is enough to go by . <|endoftext|>
yeah i can understand being jealous . does he know what hes doing ? i would be too . <|endoftext|>
yea or has some type of medical emergency that could cause him to loose his insurance if he leaves too much too late <|endoftext|>
oh yeah ? what did they talk about ? what ' s new in the world ? is it everything you wanted it to be or are you scared ? <|endoftext|>
hey good luck to you ! i ' m sure that is a very hard thing to do . <|endoftext|>
nothing . they aren ' t going to clean it up . they ' ve been up there with garbage and gross druggies all by themselves . <|endoftext|>
well i can but they always give me a hard time . i guess it ' s just frustrating that i have to fight over a policy that i didn ' t even abide by . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a relief right ? did you stay with her ? did she want to be with you ? <|endoftext|>
i hope you guys enjoy it ! my girlfriend and i moved out about a year later . now we just have one . <|endoftext|>
wow that sounds like a lot of fun . i would love to have a roomate . it ' s the only thing i have that can keep me busy ! <|endoftext|>
oh i remember that , they have some of the best toys in the country . i hope they don ' t close here . <|endoftext|>
wow . the era is definitely not the right place for your husband . what kinds of toys did you have ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds fun ! i love looking through old albums from the 90 ' s and looking back at the good times . <|endoftext|>
wow ! it must have been fun to see all the old trends . how old were you at that time ? <|endoftext|>
i was a child in the 80s . you kids have it all figured out and it ' s great ! <|endoftext|>
i agree with you , but that ' s not all people in this world . some people are just inmature and stupid . <|endoftext|>
you have to train them better . its hard to have those kinds of conversations in the day time with kids . <|endoftext|>
did you pick up on some new speak in the theater ? in any case i ' m glad you had a good time . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i don ' t know if i could do it . i don t know how they make money doing this , but you always see stuff that is good but not worth it . <|endoftext|>
i bet they will when they prove their innocence ! lol . . . i bet you are just scared and excited for some new day <|endoftext|>
do you have any other hobbies that you could do with it ? maybe you can take them to lunch . <|endoftext|>
i have no idea , who does that ! ? ! ? ? ! ! ! ? i hate it when people do that ! ! i think the more people there are , the easier it will be for them to clean up after themselves ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m right with you ! i mean . . i don ' t want any of them out of the bed and i certainly don ' y want to risk it . . . but i can ' t help it ! <|endoftext|>
that must have been so hard . i am so sorry . i lost my father on christmas . i can ' t imagine what it must have felt like . <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness . poor little thing . i hope you took her to the doctor . . . i know how hard that can be . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a very close friend . i have two daughters myself , and i know how hard that can be . i know that ' d be tough for someone like you to help you move on , but you ' re a good person for being so considerate . <|endoftext|>
that is good . i should try that myself . do you do yoga too ? i ' ve heard it can help with healing . <|endoftext|>
sounds like you had a pretty tough time before . do you know if you ' re able to get a loan ? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome . congratulations on the good job ! take care . it will heal in time . <|endoftext|>
people like that can be so helpful ! i hope your day goes better now ! : ) : ) <|endoftext|>
yes , i have . it was a lot fun . what did you do ? did you have fun ? <|endoftext|>
yeah . she won 50 50 gift cards for it ! i ' m so thankful . <|endoftext|>
i bet it did ! i get pretty spooked about raining hard , especially when the power is on . that is not good at all . <|endoftext|>
lighters ? i ' m not sure what that means . but anyway , i ' d say a lot of people are fairly stock stocked , so that should help . <|endoftext|>
how did you do ? did you end up passing ? i ' m sure you did great if you did all the rest of your research . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great , congrats ! ! ! : ) that ' ll show ' em . <|endoftext|>
i don ' t , do you ? is that what you ' re talking about ? how can you say that ? <|endoftext|>
oh man that sounds super annoying ! do you think you can motivate your body to be more engaged in your physical activity instead of just focusing on the talk ? or are you worried too much about his noise ? <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! what type of a graduation ? and do you want him to graduate in the future or just the now ? <|endoftext|>
ohhh , that ' s fun , but a bit boring , i bet . what are you planning to do now ? <|endoftext|>
i can imagine , i remember times like that , its hard to stay with a partner for very long , it makes you want to quit , leaving them . <|endoftext|>
that must have felt strange . i am sorry to hear that . it would have been a lot of fun though . <|endoftext|>
what type of business ? does it only run for him or also for other people too ? congrats to him ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow . he sounds pretty successful . how does he take on such a large business ? you hear about those guys all the time in the news . <|endoftext|>
do you know why ? maybe she noticed ? if she does , you should talk to her and tell her why you don ' t think you should be able to keep things that have gone away . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s kind of a lame explanation , but yeah maybe that is a pretty dumb move . i wouldn ' t beat yourself up about it . those kids don ' t pick up things like that and don ' tfeel like they should ! <|endoftext|>
thats great then . she has a bright future . : ) goodluck for the other folks who don ' t have money to throw away . <|endoftext|>
yes ! i think of what it ' s like when you ' re driving an car and it ends up being the same thing . . or you drive slower ! <|endoftext|>
you can always go back and try to have a better time . but dont let it bother you too much . <|endoftext|>
oh , sorry to hear that . they can be like family members sometimes . are you doing okay ? <|endoftext|>
thats terrible , poor little guy . i hope he finds his way back home . is the name of the cat ? <|endoftext|>
i felt so awful for losing her . she was so tiny and i had never been close to one before . she had to die in a car wreck . <|endoftext|>
yeah it makes me really nervous just the thought of it . . or lack there of can ' t remember . <|endoftext|>
oh , that is actually a thing ? that must ' ve been really gross . . . and awkward . <|endoftext|>
i have a thing for sushi , it is the one i think of the most . don ' t like it in general , but it is good <|endoftext|>
oh my god ! that must have been so funny ! you must have devoured that friend ! <|endoftext|>
oh i ' m glad . i usually do that . but , i can ' t do it ! <|endoftext|>
don ' t worry . soon you will find someone who will love you like you did with your previous partner . <|endoftext|>
i see . well , i hope it works out for him . i doubt that you are living at his parents ' house every night waiting for him to come home because you don ' t think you would enjoy the peace and quiet while you are in the house . <|endoftext|>
i get you , i moved away from my mom when i was in middle school and she moved a long way away for school . try to focus on your passion and you will be in great shape ! ! <|endoftext|>
haha sounds like ! ! i hope you have a great life together ! ! take care and be safe <|endoftext|>
that is sad but how did you find out ? just wait and it will happen . enjoy the moment and do your thing ! <|endoftext|>
are you going to go on one now ? i think you can . look into the offers of other jobs that offer the same benefits . <|endoftext|>
are you going to ? does she offer you anything in return ? or is it just a chance ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good idea . i think if it works out for you , then you can use the opportunity for a future date with her . <|endoftext|>
mine was certainly not mine ! i was a senior in highschool , but all my friends decided to surprise me with gifts the day after my birthday . it was really fun . <|endoftext|>
margaraha ! ! i ' m so excited to see her ! ! thanks for the rec ! <|endoftext|>
5 ? i thought it was more than that . i mean you can ' t just put a number on a ticket . that ' s just stupid . <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that , why did you both argue ? did you convince your both of you to have a seat in the aisle ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful . are you ok ? what happened ? do you have insurance ? how did the shooter react ? <|endoftext|>
ah that is terrible . i ' m glad that it wasn ' t serious . what makes you so sure ? <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds delicious ! it is so nice to get a day off from work so suddenly . <|endoftext|>
sounds like a fun experience ! my problem though is i have to keep everything inside for a while , it gets too cold <|endoftext|>
that is great that your mom is such a good mother ! it is quite rare these days . <|endoftext|>
aww , that ' s really sweet . is she distant from you specifically ? i don ' t mean to be condescending , obviously i ' m an introvert lol . it ' s always amazing when you can create something that makes your friend happy . <|endoftext|>
nothing , i ' m just happy he is doing well now . i was just really not happy i had just gone through with it . <|endoftext|>
nope ! i don ' t like when people leave the trash out on the test because it is left over from the last week . it really ruins the whole thing . <|endoftext|>
that was very nice of her . i ' m sorry that you ' re car payment was so expensive . <|endoftext|>
i do , and she bought me some nice gifts once ! i want to get back to playing that game ! <|endoftext|>
do you think it ' s the case ? or are you more hopeful that they will meet another woman ? <|endoftext|>

i ' m a math major . i ' ve got my fingers crossed for this year . i love math . <|endoftext|>
yes , i am making enough to take the job . i just don ' t know anyone in this building so it feels like i ' m on my own there . <|endoftext|>
when is the final date ? do you think its a good idea to wait until its over to make sure everything is fixed ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty cool . i think it ' s very hard to get into those areas , so that ' d be great for you . <|endoftext|>
i think that ' s because we have to do it for the thrill of it . i like to sleep with scary movies too ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that ' s awful . i hope you find a solution soon . i have friends that have lost their pets once and it was awful . <|endoftext|>

i hope you have many more years of that experience . be safe . may he rest in peace . <|endoftext|>
i love going through my old photo albums . it ' s brings back memories of all the good times <|endoftext|>
i bet that is such a heartwarming story . it is very admirable to hear that stories keep coming through ! <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s so sad ! i know how you feel . i ' ve been in a similar situation as well . maybe you should try to find a way to make your mind up on it . <|endoftext|>
it ' s not the least thing that matters . she ' s one lucky girl ! take your heart with this baby . <|endoftext|>
a few years . i was working at home , and i was doing a lot of overtime . <|endoftext|>
money in my bank statement ! i am so thankful i have this place of selfcontrol ! <|endoftext|>
i love my mom too ! what did you do with the money ? and what will you do now ? <|endoftext|>
yeah ! i try to empathy all the time because i always make sure i always show them the best of my best . <|endoftext|>
i ' m very sorry to hear that i ' ve been there and it is devastating . <|endoftext|>
i ' ll pray for ya ! i ' m sure you ' ll do great ! just gotta keep on the hunt : ) <|endoftext|>
do you already have a new one ? : ) it is a necessary evil ! they always think you are busy with something . <|endoftext|>
it can be difficult sometimes . i believe in oprah : ) just do whatever you can to keep yourself from falling into a plausible trap . <|endoftext|>
how long have you known them ? are you thinking about proposing to them ? do you feel you gave them your love and care and also brought them success ? <|endoftext|>
yes , my partner . i ' ve been together a year . what about you ? are you getting married ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . family is important . that ' sa the word for it that you ' re using . <|endoftext|>
our whole family is really close to our mom and dad . i hope i get to be one of them someday . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i ' m guilty of doing the same thing . what kind of card did you steal ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow . are you really happy about it ? i think so . i would love to have a new rug . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that ' s unfortunate . hopefully you didn ' t have to go to the pool after that ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s so smart . where at ? do you live with other people ? lol . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! it ' s always nice to see a positive attitude from a student . <|endoftext|>
is the east better for the people ? i think i would like to live on the east coast . <|endoftext|>
how did it go ? what happend ? were you alright ? is she better now ? why did you guys go ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool . well at least everything went well and you guys had a good time . congratulations ! <|endoftext|>
true ! it ' s nice having just one place to hang out but i prefer the house to be live . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you can find some good friends online . hang out in the college or work area ? <|endoftext|>
i bet you are so happy ! ! ! have fun ! ! what are you going to play on it ? <|endoftext|>
great to hear ! i hope you can win the final round too ! we can only hope your luck continues ! <|endoftext|>
how old is he ? ! ? ! tell him to stop eating so much soda ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
have you always been a hermaphortist ? i hear that ' s actually a good hobby . <|endoftext|>
that is pretty nice . how did she get back ? any ghosts ? i hope you get to spend some nice time with her ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s a shame . i hope you have friends you can talk to about it . it ' s hard sometimes when you ' re trying to communicate through text or calls . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! do you not like seagulls ? ! are they gross ? ! i wouldn ' t take a chance on one ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it was a lot worse for you ! i bet that was so frustrating ! <|endoftext|>
i am sorry , that must be very disappointing . i think being qualified for things like that makes you more qualified for the job than just yourself ! <|endoftext|>
yes . in past years , we had to leave the house to go out . but this year , i ' m on vacation and missed out because of that . <|endoftext|>
awww , i ' m sorry to hear that . do you think you can reconnect ? <|endoftext|>
i though it was that you didn ' t want to go . sorry to hear about your loss . <|endoftext|>
i hope you are right . that will probably be the best present i ' ve ever had . <|endoftext|>
nice ! maybe he will open up some sort of new technology now that he ' s got the guts to do so . <|endoftext|>
wow . you might have to move on . it is probably for the best . good on you for standing up though . <|endoftext|>
maybe you just need time to process things and move on . being alone is a good place to start , sometimes we forget that . <|endoftext|>
well that sounds like a treat to watch . i need to get into them . are they doing any cool shows now ? <|endoftext|>
rascal is a great word for that ! well you can call him that : ) lucky for you <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! ! i wish i could get my son some of that ! what are some of his favorites ? <|endoftext|>
why does it matter what you think ? it ' s your life and if you think you ' re looks will make him unhappy , let him enjoy his beauty . <|endoftext|>
that makes sense , i don ' t follow knawby much lol i know she was one of the fame girls on youtube though <|endoftext|>
about what ? i am curious . are you scared ? lol joking . joking . i am so glad i was able to go and get one last year ! ! <|endoftext|>
he was 16 . it felt terrible . i have never felt so sad in my life . he was such a sweet fellow . <|endoftext|>
have you tried calling them and telling them to take it back ? ? ? that ' s what they do . <|endoftext|>
i like vodka with mixed lime . its really good with lime . how bout you ? i like that its so sweet <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome , congratulations . is he going to get into college ? that ' ll be such a learning experience . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure there will be . good doctors are so much needed these days . just stay positive and always worry and be safe ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful ! was it by fault ? or is it a little delayed ? ! i ' d be so mad , since pizza is my favorite ! <|endoftext|>
was it a special occasion ? that ' s always so disappointing . . . no ice breaker . <|endoftext|>
that would drive me nuts too . that ' s so annoying . you should complain to the manager . <|endoftext|>
what makes you think that ? it sounds pretty gross . especially since you have a child and they are probably just seeing it as gross . <|endoftext|>
why did you eat so much ? are you sick ? ! ? ! how did you feel when she told you ? ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s good that you appreciate things as much as she does ! i have some bad news for you . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! was there anyone there at the time ? i hope you didn ' t have to clean it up for yourself . <|endoftext|>
ewwww i hate shoes . i would ' ve went shopping just to spite you ! but if you do ' t have shoes then don ' t say something ! <|endoftext|>
that is exactly right . i am sure that you will do just fine . i love chicken . <|endoftext|>
good idea ! i know exactly what you are saying , because i ' ve done this many times . my mom taught me how to cook . you ' re so brilliant ! <|endoftext|>
wow , thats amazing . congratulating your husband and his wife with a healthy baby ! i wish you the best . <|endoftext|>
hahaha i bet you are so excited ! congratulations ! ! ! is this your first ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! what a bummer . has he been on an easy test ? and what was the reason ? <|endoftext|>
i guess the smartest kid in the family is probably thinking he ' s smart . . . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s good luck with that test ! ! congrats ! ! ! i pray for you <|endoftext|>
you should be proud of yourself . that ' s quite the test ! how did you do ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds so fun . blind people are interesting in that way . they learn the language and music , but don ' t actually learn it . <|endoftext|>
have you talked to anyone at all about his time and life ? maybe they could relate or see how much they love him . <|endoftext|>
i hope it didn ' t take a long time to get fixed . sounds like it was a scary thing to happen . <|endoftext|>
do you know what ' s wrong with the car ? the car just may not have been mashed up right ? <|endoftext|>
wow thats awesome , i cant believe you gave that many kids a chance ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
for the record i never understood how those milestones work because they never last very long . how long did you have to stay for ? <|endoftext|>
oooh i bet that would be frightening . i would just not watch that show . maybe one day . <|endoftext|>
i had no idea that he had a weapon , but if it is now he is definitely out of the game . <|endoftext|>
oh that is intense , i ' m sorry to hear that . what happened ? is he in a new city ? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry . how long is the visit at this point ? can you check to see if i ' m missing anything ? <|endoftext|>
he worked very hard to be famous i bet ! how big is he ? have you been playing him long ? <|endoftext|>
wow . how good is he going to do ? can ' t even imagine the training for that . <|endoftext|>
are you already working or just excited about having a new place to live ? i am also having a boy in a few months and that is going to be such an amazing experience and you will probably be the same age you are when he comes . <|endoftext|>
that is good to hear . where did you move to ? did you get a job ? maybe i can go there if i have one . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s crazy ! what did you do ? did you run away ? did it take you or hurt you ? <|endoftext|>
hahaha ! if it was the batman , you could have went splat him and called the police ! <|endoftext|>
well i am happy for you . he can be good or bad sometimes . how many days in a week are you gonna pray ? <|endoftext|>
that is so true . i bet you are so proud . i wish i was your brother . <|endoftext|>
that must have been embarrassing . did anyone see you fall ? it ' s always the worst when your entire team is counting and you are all just looking over and laughing at each other . <|endoftext|>
wow , thats actually pretty funny . maybe it isnt the same anymore ? im not sure . <|endoftext|>
it is fun . tututut intended . i use to listen to listen tututtover <|endoftext|>
oh yeah ? what hit ? was it hip hop ? what ' s the word ? please share ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry about your dog . . i feel for you i know how you feel too <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! good job on you for not letting the system clean things up . what caused this ? <|endoftext|>
i agree , it ' s hard to be thankful for something when you didn ' t win anything <|endoftext|>
that is the best advice ever ! i try to always do that every year . if only . <|endoftext|>
how did you manage to hide that ? was it embarrassing ? or was it the only thing you had ever told anyone ? <|endoftext|>
i ' ll pray for you . if she doesn ' t forgive you then there is something really wrong with your heart . <|endoftext|>
oh no , that is rough , are you hurt ? are you doing okay ? i hope your son is ok . <|endoftext|>
your mom is lucky to have you in her classroom . i ' ve seen so many people get smacked and injured because of their bruised ego . <|endoftext|>
oh god that is terrible news ! that is horrible ! did you confront her about it ? maybe she found out from you . <|endoftext|>
why would you need to rip her apart ? do you not see how your girlfriend can be mean ? <|endoftext|>
wow . thats quite a feat . i hope that they work hard but it can be hard to afford . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really nice of them . i have never been homeschooling my kids , so i couldn ' t really help them with that . <|endoftext|>
that is a lot , i am sure he wont take any vacation the following year . i hope he gets all his rest . <|endoftext|>
man that ' s a real surprise , i would be so embarrassed . but i ' m glad you ' ve come to that decision . <|endoftext|>
i would be mad too ! ! hopefully you guys are still good friends . i wouldn ' t be able to trust people anymore <|endoftext|>
i have done things i thought were wrong before too . . and i do it because it ' s much easier . i hope things turn out well for you and you find happiness . <|endoftext|>
how long will you be staying with her ? i hope you find some new friends . she sounds awesome . <|endoftext|>
that really blows . my girls were never that far along . maybe you had more than one year . <|endoftext|>
i understand . that is something you can never really replace . i hope it gets better ! it sounds like you are in good hands . <|endoftext|>
sounds like they did their best . did they improve their grade ? or did they just not care ? <|endoftext|>
sometimes if the doctor has a good attitude they will consider turning you down ! i ' ve had many coworkers who have turned me down and it ' s so frustrating . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that he passed away . i have lost all of my family members at one time or another . <|endoftext|>
he isnt but that face is pretty funny though ! i want them to make a new one , just dont give me these weird looks anymore <|endoftext|>
glad to hear that you feel better now . i always try to avoid going to the movies if i can . <|endoftext|>
that is so awesome of them . it ' s wonderful that you have a friend like that to remind you of what is important . <|endoftext|>
are you serious ? you people are just disgusting , no matter how much money you save , you can do nothing about it . <|endoftext|>
i understand . i hope you can work things out . i would be furious too . how did you react ? <|endoftext|>
some people are just too dangerous . some people don ' t even know it was a accident . <|endoftext|>
there ' s definitely some ways to make that up . just try to be confident in yourself and never worry about what other people think . <|endoftext|>
how did you do that ? do you still have to teach ? that ' s amazing ! ! <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never even tried , i ' d probably look like a brick wall . good on you ! <|endoftext|>
thats what life is about hoping and hoping and also getting what you want . i wish you the best ! <|endoftext|>
that is so cool . are you planning on buying anything new ? ! i don ' t mean ask just ask if you haven ' t built that house yet ! lol ! <|endoftext|>
well , it has definitely paid off . i wish all the best for you ! : ) just remember that determination and sacrifice paid off and you ' ll thank god for that . <|endoftext|>
that was nice of you to do . everyone does that . a part of me wants to hit her since my daughter won ' t let me sleep tonight . i wish you and her the best <|endoftext|>
did you have your water on while the ran ? that is the next thing you should do when the water is scary . <|endoftext|>
oh i love music too ! what kinds are your favorites ? some that you ' re into ? <|endoftext|>
nah , sometimes they can be good , but sometimes they aren ' t , it depends on what kind of music you are talking about . <|endoftext|>
nice ! what game are you waiting to get ? lol what game is it ? i ' m excited for you ! <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s coming out soon ? that would be fun . why is it preorder ? <|endoftext|>
congrats ! i ' m sure you were happy and joyful ! it ' s always tough to find your own job so congratulations ! <|endoftext|>
we all have struggles and struggles but don ' t look at it like they are out for you , that ' s a tough thing to say . <|endoftext|>
nice ! i would be excited to become a senior too ! good luck ! ! ! if you have any leads to any leads in it , you ' re lucky . <|endoftext|>
you can always try again . i am sure you will , you will find a place soon . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry that happened to you . were there other people at your wedding ? there ' s always one more person to help you out <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a crazy spell . what do you practice in general ? i just started learning scl about a month ago . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so happy for you ! what makes it so special ? : ) i think the most important thing is to cherish the good times because that can do so much good ! <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! its always a good thing when our parents succeed when we are young . i am glad that you are making it through . <|endoftext|>
congratulations . you must be so proud . i am glad to hear that you did well . you should be in my class this semester . <|endoftext|>
dang ! that must ' ve been awkward . i would ' ve smack him upside the head with a shovel <|endoftext|>
that is creepy . did you try to talk to her ? she might have the ability to get you . <|endoftext|>
i am sure he will get it ! i know they aren ' t always the best but i believe he will ! <|endoftext|>
hahaha ! do you have to wear a mask or are you just comfortable with the security at home ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds terrible . i ' d be very scared too . was it your first day there ? <|endoftext|>
that is terrifying . i am glad you were ok . sounds like a scary school day ! ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! that is amazing , best of luck in your future ! marketing is a tough job ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . do you feel better now ? have you been working at it for long ? <|endoftext|>
no , did you ? how bad is it ? ? ? - ) i don ' t think so , do you ? <|endoftext|>
i would like to say that those kind of accidents can kill , but you are lucky no one was hurt . i was driving home from work late but someone hit one of the cars in the driveway , all i could do is call the police . <|endoftext|>
no , but i do not like it when people are in close situations . it is very uncomfortable . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! was it one of those where you could go and hide ? was that something you could take on eventually . <|endoftext|>
no , i haven ' t . why ? is it like it was in your specific period ? <|endoftext|>
i love those games . i also loved mario brothers1 when i was a teenager . <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never been but i ' m not quite familiar with what it ' s like . i like to think they serve fast food because they think it ' ll be just as good , if not better . but i do love visiting there too . <|endoftext|>
i guess i will have to keep looking for a new one then . i have a feeling my kids will love it ! <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never had one but i ' d imagine that would be really scary . do you know what that ' s like ? <|endoftext|>
did you tell someone or someone you knew about it ? or did it make you so scared that you almost didn ' t even go inside ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , i was really afraid of the roller coaster . did you ? d i love rollersters ! <|endoftext|>
oh , is it easy to understand what you are saying ? what did you learn in order to be more excited about it ? <|endoftext|>
thats terrible . why did you do that ? did he do something mean to you ? did you say anything to him about it ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry , that kind of behavior can be very upsetting . hopefully your dog can be trained to clean it up better . <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds nice i ' d love to go somewhere like that . where ya going ? and how long are you staying there <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! i ' ve never been to that country . what a beautiful place though ! it sounds like a really wonderful experience and i bet you ' ll miss them so much . <|endoftext|>
good for her ! did she like the new job ? or does she not like the find a new one ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . did you let her know that ? : ) how did you feel when she found out ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s really sad . i ' m sure she will be an exciting parent ! it ' s great she is learning , teaching and teaching at the school you are going to school for ! <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s awesome ! how cute ! a puppy is always so cute . : ) what kind ? <|endoftext|>
nice , i have a german shepherd myself . how ' d he run away ? did he run with you ? <|endoftext|>
did you give her your phone number ? i would assume it was her . . . but who knows . sometimes we all have our issues , it was no ones fault . <|endoftext|>
hard work pays off ! i hope you feel better tomorrow ! you must be so proud of yourself ! <|endoftext|>
i hate when that happens ! did you end up going ? how was the service ? did you ask her or wait in a line ? <|endoftext|>
well i ' m glad that you guys were able to get out of this situation and do something nice for each other , i hope the next time you see each other . <|endoftext|>
me too ! what ' s happening on friday ? do you have plans ? are you going anywhere special ? <|endoftext|>
i get that . but kids can really pick up on those little things . hopefully they pick up soon . <|endoftext|>
it snowing very hard where i am . was he upset ? i could really use some of your time . <|endoftext|>
oh no that must of been terrifying . do you remember what happened ? did you get to the store the next day ? <|endoftext|>
i don ' t blame you at all . i was in florida last week , and when i was driving my mom was trying to pull over and it almost hit her . she was mortified , even though she ' d never been in a dangerous situation . <|endoftext|>
oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that . when my parents got divorced i was a mess . <|endoftext|>
it is a big part of the life you have now . i am glad you are feeling good . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a pain ! it happens when you ' re driving and there ' s rain on the road . were you able to get it out without rain ? <|endoftext|>
that is good . i have never been to the mountains so i am sure it was nice . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like fun ! was it a fun surprise ? did you go ? ! ? ! i bet you were so excited ! <|endoftext|>
was it your birthday ? did you have all your friends over ? did they take the kids ? <|endoftext|>
what kind of shirt was it ? maybe it ' s not so bad , and you should be able to laugh about it . <|endoftext|>
that is very nice of you . i wish i could come over and spend some time with you guys , i would love to go . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s sad . . do you have any company ? will you still be able to talk a little bit ? <|endoftext|>
i love watching tv . i have done it so many times lol . what kind of video games do you play ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s not an easy decision . how did you feel when you gave her up ? <|endoftext|>
have you tried searching on facebook ? some people have found some really great dating apps . i use facebook . <|endoftext|>
that was sweet ! what was the gift for ? did you buy her anything interesting ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
wow that must have taken long . you must be really happy with it . are you going to get it for work also ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow . i cant even imagine . i can never get that high up , and i am scared of the roller sters . <|endoftext|>
how did you do that ? ! ? ! ! ? i would have freaked out . . assuming you didnt get burned by one : ) <|endoftext|>
haha ! why did you come out of the bar with her ? did you get her number ! ? <|endoftext|>
well it ' s better for you to be sure , than to risk messing up a friendship . <|endoftext|>
is it a small dog ? that ' s got to be frustrating ! did you punish him ? <|endoftext|>
that stinks . it ' s really nice to have an extra room for pets . i have a roomate who lives on the top floor . <|endoftext|>
it sure did . did you graduate ? you must be so proud of yourself . how many years have you been there ? <|endoftext|>
when was the last time you got a promotion ? maybe you can go back to school and do something new : ) <|endoftext|>
ouch , that ' s rough . was she at least impressed ? did you feel guilty for even going to the bar with her ? <|endoftext|>
well that is good at least . i know the feeling . but don ' t feel bad it happened to you in the past . . it was a mistake everyone makes . <|endoftext|>
wow ! that is a huge step in the world . i bet he felt so cool doing it . <|endoftext|>
yeah , you should definitely learn first ! you want to make your balance a little easier on the road for me . <|endoftext|>
how did that make you feel ? that must have been heartbreaking for you . i am so sorry . <|endoftext|>
oh , i bet that was a relief ! i love animals so much i ' d probably be crying if i lost one right now . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! what are you gonna do about it ? keep it clean by not spending money on the carpet ? <|endoftext|>
yes ! ! the ac in my apartment really messed up my fan and caused it to run out of v in the fan ! <|endoftext|>
i think its a difficult thing for anyone to have to go through at some point in life . <|endoftext|>
oh no . have you apologize to her ? that sounds more personal . hopefully she will understand . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a great time ! was the weather nice ? how old were your kids ? where was the party ? <|endoftext|>
well , there are plenty of people who share in your situation and it should not be too hard to deal with . i hope you can deal with it as well as it sounds like you can . <|endoftext|>
i agree . i wish i could go there someday . i love to see the open world of the world ! <|endoftext|>
people don ' t notice how much you like your favorite cafe or your favorite hobbies . <|endoftext|>
what happened ? tell me more ! sounds interesting ! ! ! hows that ? ! ! do you know <|endoftext|>
nope , i ' m the one that ' s or* , not him . he just told me . so i can tell you it ' s not fair for your father to spend ely on someone while you ' re younger . <|endoftext|>
i am sure you were terrified and the warnings were just a bit fake . lol ! did you get hurt doing through ? <|endoftext|>
yeah that ' s pretty common where i ' m at , especially since you need to keep the roof low . there ' s also the whole need to have light fixtures on the fence so you can see the downstairs . . . how about a tv or playstation ? lol ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! that is a wonderful mothers such as your mom ! that must have been a burden lifted for the little boy ! <|endoftext|>
maybe it ' s time to cut your hands and make new neighbors ! d kids are crazy , and i bet it makes the adults mad as well ! <|endoftext|>
i see . now i understand . so it ' s not just about the past , but the present , too ? i really appreciate your communication . that ' s so important in movies and tv . especially . it ' ll help your style of writing grow too . <|endoftext|>
i can imagine ! i never had the time to make an overseas move . how did you afford it ? <|endoftext|>
thanks i am really envious of you . . i will go check it out ! <|endoftext|>
i was afraid but i ' m actually fairly good looking . i have beautiful girls ! i ' d be fine with it . <|endoftext|>
oh nice ! ! have you been using it more than one time ? or did you get it as a gift because you had one before and it fell into the dumpster ? <|endoftext|>
yes , you should go buy them something nice for them . wouldn ' t that be good ? <|endoftext|>
aww that is sweet . is he also a great mom ? i mean obviously not , but still ! <|endoftext|>

not really as i am still a pretty young person but i still miss those days . i always came first . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! is it going to be a good experience for them ? just the material situation ? <|endoftext|>
thats awesome , mine also have some learning disabilities . its awesome to see what they can do for each other . <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty impressive ! have you been doing pretty well this year ? ! ? ! ! <|endoftext|>

he sounds like an inconsiderate bum . maybe you should cut his losses . don ' t pay him any bills ! <|endoftext|>
oh yeah , that definitely makes him a little annoying ! have you considered joining the music community to find new fans ? <|endoftext|>
how did it go ? i hope you passed ! did you drive at all ? did you have to study for a test ? <|endoftext|>

oh great ! i do tomatoes too ! i might have to try this too . i love all the tomatoes ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s insane , how long do you drive for ? sounds like driving is a bit overrated <|endoftext|>
people do not realise how dangerous driving is but how it makes everyone else more nervous ! lol . i ' m from louisiana . i am a fan of drinking and playing with my kids . what about you ? <|endoftext|>
ah i see , was it like online video games did you ? i ' m on the downloadable video games side . <|endoftext|>
we were just met at a bar and it was pretty interesting . but i can ' t help but feel a little sad about it , i get sentimental about it sometimes . <|endoftext|>
you sound very care about us . i have cared for all my siblings and parents . it is a good thing to feel loved . <|endoftext|>
and the way you start , it will just be a matter of getting over there and putting more efforts . <|endoftext|>
really ? what happened ? ! ! ? ! ? how did that go ? ? ? did you guys have a huge meeting ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s too bad . i really miss my family . what was interesting was how they ' d changed . <|endoftext|>
well that is amazing ! that must have been a lot of work . i bet she was very grateful . <|endoftext|>
exactly . just show that you are smart also . it shows a lot of things . she is showing her true self <|endoftext|>
i would ' ve been so upset . did you pick her up ? dog can poop everywhere ! <|endoftext|>
i guess she ' s determined to be a good dog person . the age old parenting error . good luck with that <|endoftext|>
why is that ? just having fun ? or do you feel more trusting ? is there something wrong with you ? <|endoftext|>
well , that ' s good , because i think you should definitely get a new dog ! don ' t let fear make you lose him ! <|endoftext|>
i understand that . it can be very scary to leave without one for sure . where did this happen ? <|endoftext|>
oh my , how could a dog run into a mountain ! ? ! ? ? i have two little dogs and they love to escape when they fall off the cart ! <|endoftext|>
that is great ! what are you doing to enjoy life ? ? ? any fun plans ? : ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s definitely a plus . sounds like you ' re doing a great job ! you ' ve earned it ! <|endoftext|>
that would be so nice . and it would be a good exercise in not feeling so lonely . <|endoftext|>
i would have been quite embarrassed . was it your friends birthday ? or did they make a plan to surprise you ? <|endoftext|>
hahaha no wonder it was fun to go with them ! sounds like a great planned trip ! <|endoftext|>
yeah it ' s hard when you ' re doing something you should have done when you were young and just forgetting it ! <|endoftext|>
what was it a tshirt of her ? it sounds sweet . did you repay her ? i ' m sure you guys have a long talk . <|endoftext|>
yea did you go to the zoo ? or just visiting the city for the zoo . thats what i was doing <|endoftext|>

i hope that is not the case ! that sounds awful . you are doing everything you could for him . <|endoftext|>
did you pick it off with your shoe ? that would have scared me so much if i was going to do that ! <|endoftext|>
i don ' t blame you . i would have yelled at them so hard i may not even have a child now . <|endoftext|>
what is that ? a soul food restaurant ? a museum ? some kind of music ? i can just image you saying the words . <|endoftext|>
that sounds really good , i ' ll have to try that sometime . i hope you guys had a good time and enjoy yourselves ! <|endoftext|>
wow that is impressive , i know one of my sister ' s daughters could speak three at that age <|endoftext|>
oh wow , that ' s awesome ! i ' ve never heard of that one . . i watched the movies <|endoftext|>
how long have you been married ? if you don ' t mind me asking . . it ' s nice to have someone who can get you out of a situation fast . <|endoftext|>
did he win many league cup competitions ? or was that a small amount ? i hope he wins some . <|endoftext|>
that ' s amazing ! your dad must have been thrilled ! did he play for the team ? <|endoftext|>
i am sure you both have a wonderful life together ! he should be proud that you did that for him . <|endoftext|>
it ' s not everyone ' s cup of tea , but everyone has their faults ! do you think there are other people in the world who have the same issue ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . i think everyone needs a chuckle . that ' ll keep them up for sure . <|endoftext|>
wow , that must be a wonderful time ! how long did she take the language course for ? <|endoftext|>
yeah it ' s always a good idea to take care of your dogs and socialize them . <|endoftext|>
that was nice of him ! was there a special occasion ? and what kind of flowers did you receive ? <|endoftext|>
i hope you get her back , that is a very good man . you are very lucky . <|endoftext|>
that would make me so angry ! have you talked to her about getting it stop ? it would stop her from getting too addicted . <|endoftext|>
what happened to this dog ? i am so sorry . that is no good . im sure it was beautiful though . <|endoftext|>
what happened ? is it a big firm ? just kidding . maybe its a big company ? im sure they know what it is like to have to wait for call <|endoftext|>
stay positive and do everything you can to try to make it up to her . it ' s not easy but maybe it ' ll work out ! <|endoftext|>
do you guys still hang out ? why do you have to go back to the wedding ? it is so beautiful ! <|endoftext|>
i hope you both have a long and happy marriage . grad school is important , but don ' t worry , you ' ll make plenty of friends . <|endoftext|>
aww , i ' m sorry to hear that . how old was she ? i know how hard those things can be . <|endoftext|>
you ' re welcome . i am grateful for the very abundant resources my family have . i ' m a farmer though , so technically i ' ve not farmer but i try my best . <|endoftext|>
how long did it take to hear back from the company ? was there a good reason for the wait ? <|endoftext|>
hopefully you continue to work that way . hopefully in the future you will be able to get the good paying jobs like that . <|endoftext|>
thats a tough one . kids say things like that when they are sure they will get it in the end . <|endoftext|>
i am sure she will do fine . we have two little boys . they can always look back and see that they were better than us for a change . <|endoftext|>
hey ! that ' s great ! have you prepared for it ? or just tried to study ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds amazing ! you are so lucky ! what would you eat ? i hope you have some great ideas . <|endoftext|>
how big was it ? ? ? i am happy for you ! ! ! is it a big amount ? <|endoftext|>
i could only stand to listen to a few minutes of music to listen . . . then be back to work . <|endoftext|>
angels are very good . what do you do with your god money ? do you have much support from god ? <|endoftext|>
that is great to hear , i am sure he is had a good life ! best wishes to you guys <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds awful ! how did you reward him ? were you just having a bad day , or was he always doing that ? <|endoftext|>
i sure hope so , that is a really special memory . you must have been blessed with it ! <|endoftext|>
its frustrating as it seems all you can do is stay strong . i know it is hard to keep up the same energy when your brother is already acting the way you want him to be <|endoftext|>
i think the only way to overcome that is to keep trying . if you ' re really good at it , then that ' s even better ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . how did it go ? was it great ? : ) congrats ! <|endoftext|>
hopefully you will find something in the bag for yourself . it is difficult to predict what things will bring back into your life . <|endoftext|>
oh i love blanket that was a blast from the past for me . did you get to go through everything ? <|endoftext|>
oh thank god , that would ' ve ruined the whole thing . i ' m so sorry ! <|endoftext|>
they really do ! i hate when kids go back to school at once . . . you just want to wear a dress and a few classes and go . <|endoftext|>
i understand , but kids should also be able to dress the way they want to go about life . <|endoftext|>
wow , it must be a beautiful little kitten . how did you do it ? by force or by people ? <|endoftext|>
what an amazing name ! ! how long has he been between puppies ? ! i have a cat with the same name who just got hit by a car . <|endoftext|>
i bet it can be tough , how old are they ? i ' m sure it makes you appreciate the little ones <|endoftext|>
i used to want a house like that too . good times . . . i miss it . <|endoftext|>
wow ! that ' s so good ! congrats , ms ! you ' ll be making me proud ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . maybe she should work on getting her own company and give it to you . <|endoftext|>
i hope everything turns out ok . dogs can be annoying . i hope you took him to the vet . <|endoftext|>
i hope he feels better soon ! side effects can definitely leave him feeling ill . i hope you can continue to help him . <|endoftext|>
oh man that sounds really bad . why don ' t you give it to her back ? is she upset ? <|endoftext|>
yea ? its not the worst though , i think its better for everyone involved . it has good effect on your health and you have a great look in the future if you ' re concerned about getting back on your feet . <|endoftext|>
yeah . . i know the feeling . . when you get in trouble and you ' re told you did something wrong and they make it up to you <|endoftext|>
you should report them for animal abuse . animal abuse is a real problem . they should really teach you <|endoftext|>
oh awesome ! that ' s awesome . i ' ve been on a lot of trips in the past , and i ' m not sure i could ever go on a cruise . i do love to love my time on the receiving end though . you ' re gonna be so excited ! <|endoftext|>
i am sure you won ' t get sick , just relax and enjoy your time . be safe . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure she will thank you for it ! i hope she is having fun with friends while she is at it ! <|endoftext|>
that is terrible news . i am so sorry . losing a family member is never an easy thing . <|endoftext|>
i think some people can , i ' ve never even been able to . but good for you on your career ! <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s kinda gross . well , at least it didn ' t hurt your dog too bad . <|endoftext|>
what can they do without their partner ? ! ? ! i hope you don ' t feel sad for her . <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . cancer really does not kill . mine died 5 months ago . still hurting from it . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a great day ! what did you find ? ? : ) ? ! ? what was it ? <|endoftext|>
ah , well at least he ' ll be at least able to enjoy it a little ! 2weeks is a long time , but he ' s also going to have to spend a lot of time with you ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! do you know what it was ? i can ' t help but feel the same way . <|endoftext|>
maybe she can get you one just to surprise you . or she could just buy it all herself if you want . <|endoftext|>
well , it ' s an honorable effort . what did you do to deserve the awards ? also , what did happen to the dogs ? <|endoftext|>
oh great , good luck ! you must be very motivated ! : ) i ' m proud of you ! <|endoftext|>
thank you ! yeah , i was kind of worried i might die , but i guess it kind of serves me well that i should be comfortable . <|endoftext|>
thank you so much . i needed to stress out a little bit last night . i know i will soon . <|endoftext|>
i have been there once . but i think you should never be too nervous and i am sure you did a great job . <|endoftext|>
once when i was younger and it was really bad . i think i should have done something like this with my younger brother . what was your experience like ? <|endoftext|>
i am sure they have a lot of problems but are not the worst either . i have one and two kids <|endoftext|>
wow that is so annoying . kids make that huge mess when they are young . i don ' t know why they don ' ts more responsible with their activities ! <|endoftext|>
have you tried using speech therapy ? it can help . do you have any family members that can help ? <|endoftext|>
that really is . i am sorry . maybe try therapy or medication . it might help . i have hear some great horror stories from friends and family . <|endoftext|>
is she getting to the age where we can meet ? i ' m excited for you guys ! <|endoftext|>
nice , it is good to enjoy hanging out with our family . did you enjoy your time alone ? <|endoftext|>
cool , where are you going ? vacation ? ! ? : ) how far are you moving ? <|endoftext|>
wow that sounds awesome ! when are you coming ? ! ? ! i bet you ' ll have such fun ! <|endoftext|>
that is so awful ! that isn ' t good at all . i am so sorry that happened to her ! <|endoftext|>
that must have been awful . poor little thing ! i hope she gets better soon ! i need to teach my dog to use the extra soap next time he is on the road ! <|endoftext|>
aw , that sounds like a good time ! there ' s nothing quite like a cat snuggle right ? it ' s always great to have some relaxation time . <|endoftext|>
oh nice . i ' m jealous , i need to work on my sleep schedule . i always think that but it ' s not so great . <|endoftext|>
how did it go ? did you get it ? did everything turn out okay ? ? ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
wow . . . that ' s impressive . what kind of lab is it ? i ' m sure you got a good story to tell . i hope everything goes well with your application . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good to hear . being faithful makes you a great person . good luck in your future with your relationship ! <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that , you just have to live with it ! but i hope you find love ! <|endoftext|>
i know where you are coming from . have a safe trip and be safe . go play chess ! <|endoftext|>
why you want to make it up to them . are you religious ? i pray every day to god to bring this country back into that blessed place . <|endoftext|>
where do you work ? i hope you find a good job ! good luck ! what are you most passionate about ? <|endoftext|>
i was about to say that is not good . maybe you can make an offer to pay . <|endoftext|>
well that ' s good to hear . what are you gonna plant ? i can ' t plant anything for a long time . <|endoftext|>
your very welcome , good luck with your new computer ! ! ! i hope you have a wonderful time ! <|endoftext|>
i have had siblings that were that way . you know how bad it is when you have those close friends that just completely lie to you about nothing . it ' s so hard to be around someone who lies to you . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! maybe you should switch places . they will have it soon ! ! ! go in search for it ! <|endoftext|>
i hope so too . they are getting even worse every year ! i hate that it ' s so much worse than it should be <|endoftext|>
yes i would be too , it is a lot to go through if its like that , you should be grateful for the time and effort you spent with her . <|endoftext|>
that sounds awful . . . i hate going to grocery stores . too many overwatered traffic . <|endoftext|>
how long have you two been together ? if you ' re still in college , i hope you guys were really close . <|endoftext|>
nice ! do you think you had a good representation in the association ? or was it just a bad showing ? <|endoftext|>
you should make an effort to talk to her and show her who ' s boss . i ' m sure you ' ll make new friends <|endoftext|>
i can understand that . having company is key to making a happy life . keep it up my friend ! <|endoftext|>
i live in south texas . i love take out . you will still find great take out in the south . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a long time to wait . i hope you have fun ! ! ! i don ' t know if i could do that . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! a pool is always so useful . and you can do so much with it there ! <|endoftext|>
i wish i had a vacation like that . it would be so worth it ! hahaha ! <|endoftext|>
well that ' s really great of him . my boyfriend did that with us a few years ago . <|endoftext|>
well at least it wasn ' t as bad as it could have been ! sometimes things can change unexpectedly . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really awesome ! what breed is she ? ! ? ! ! ? : ) i ' m thinking about getting a cat , it ' s so hard . <|endoftext|>
what did you guys end up doing together ? did you catch up ? i hope you guys had a good time ! <|endoftext|>
it is really , it will get better . treasure it knowing you have her forever . it will be cherished forever . <|endoftext|>
thank you as well for your blessings ! how is your day going ? do you have any plans today ? <|endoftext|>
i bet ! the ultrasound does sound pretty amazing ! where did you find out ? ! <|endoftext|>
ah congrats then . is it a boy ? what are you most excited about ? ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . i hope things stay stable for you . i assume she ' s a good person . <|endoftext|>
you must be a strong person to tell her . i am sure she would understand if you left her . <|endoftext|>
what kind of truck is it ? maybe it is worth more than he will afford . envious of him ? <|endoftext|>
if you work hard you can get one for cheap like me ! haha . we just moved to a new state and when we got the truck back we bought it after years of payments from our insurance and car payment , everything was paid for ! ! <|endoftext|>
thank you , i like to enjoy days like that , its a good one . what do you think is going to happen ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good feeling i think . i like positive thinking . not being able to find the answer and finding the right answer always help . <|endoftext|>
that is a horrible feeling . has she been feeling better lately ? how is she doing ? ! <|endoftext|>
i know the feeling . i ' m kinda sick all day today too , just dealing with the crazy neighbors . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad that you are able to realize that he does ! i ' ve seen so many people lose their faith in things just because they have a certain faith . <|endoftext|>
i think you ' ll be okay . just gotta be careful and drive safe ! haha . <|endoftext|>
i love how little they can sound ! i really can ' t sing , i only know guitar . haha . what a lovely thing to discover <|endoftext|>
sounds like she is a good girl . i miss my mom so much . congrats on raising a happy girl ! <|endoftext|>
oh i feel for you ! i know that is very tough ! what has made you feel hesitant ? <|endoftext|>
well , i wish you luck ! i ' m sure you will make it . i ' ve made it in a couple years . <|endoftext|>
that is great , good luck ! sounds like you have a good job ! ! ! keep your head up . : ) <|endoftext|>
oh cool , i ' ve been trying to get into tech support lately . you get a lot of talent there . <|endoftext|>
maybe you can go on a date ? or maybe just chill and have a good time with her . <|endoftext|>
you are free to do whatever you want with your life . if you are not happy with it then try to find a different hobby . <|endoftext|>
please dont feel bad . i know it was a terrible mistake , but forgive him for it ! <|endoftext|>
lol . . i guess that happens to everyone . i would take the risk and just try not to feel stupid . <|endoftext|>
that sounds terrible , but i understand . it can be a dessert too , that ' s for sure <|endoftext|>
you can , just don ' t eat as much ! calories aren ' t important , you need to enjoy your own life . <|endoftext|>
wow , how are you feeling about that ? i hope he gets the good stuff soon ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
thats nice . i bet he is so happy . : ) enjoy yourself . i know it is hard to lose those kinds of friends . <|endoftext|>
that is rude . did you try to tell her to get back in her place ? ? i would ' ve been so upset . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good choice , not too loud though i can ' t even fathom ! <|endoftext|>
dang i hope you can find it . are you looking for another one ? maybe you can ask a friend to take it back and get it together for you so you have more time to store it . <|endoftext|>
yes , i am trying to save money now so i can do it . you should try it once ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s a long time to not have seen them . you are lucky to have come that long . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a wonderful surprise ! what is the special occasion for this ? ! ? ! ! <|endoftext|>
aww that ' s such a lovely surprise . did she do anything exciting ? : ) i bet that was a nice surprise . <|endoftext|>
i would be the same way . i don ' t really go out much either . i hope you ' ll get to meet some cool people . <|endoftext|>
i hate when that happens ! it ' s so annoying ! what did they do ? ? did they tell you ? <|endoftext|>
that is terrible . are they trying to raise rent ? or maybe just cheap ? that is just terrible . <|endoftext|>
oh no , that ' s a terrible thing to have happen . did you cry ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great , is there someone else with that now ? ? ? you should tell her to keep her head up ! <|endoftext|>
why ? were you angry at her for missing a trip or were you happy she took you to dinner ? <|endoftext|>
i understand . i have been in a similar situation . the best thing is your mind will start to adapt to the moment . <|endoftext|>
good . that means you must be feeling good . what are you feeling ? all that means is your a very good person . <|endoftext|>
i am glad you found it . how did you learn ? it sounds like you have some great talent ! ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s really true ! what did they do ? maybe you deserved it ? : ) ) <|endoftext|>
ah so it was just some spiritual service ? i ' ll need to read up on that . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . i lost my mother in breast cancer as well and can absolutely understand . it is hard and the worst can ' t be easy . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear you ' re going through this . you ' ve got to give yourself the strength to be in a relationship that will support you through this tough time . <|endoftext|>
i like california , but i could understand moving to florida to be a little more cold . have you tried the temp trap ? <|endoftext|>
i didn ' t change my mind at all . i think we will all one day move on . <|endoftext|>
those are all good ideas . i wish someone would tell me how to feel everyday . i ' m trying to learn how to be happy everyday . <|endoftext|>
it ' s good you care , but you seem very selfish and careless . i wouldn ' t try to do anything about it . <|endoftext|>
that would be nice , do you have anyone in your life ? maybe you could work online and meet people that way . <|endoftext|>
don ' t worry , those are normal things to be good at . everyone has those moments , i can relate : ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s really exciting ! is she coming back quickly ? ! have you ever gone to an airport ? <|endoftext|>
i got an email saying i will be coming back . i have the money , just need a phone number . <|endoftext|>
vacations are the best ! what are you gonna do with all your free time ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
oh thats cool . do you think the children would be ok with that ? lol <|endoftext|>
that is so annoying , did you call her to say something ? ? : ) ) ) did you ? <|endoftext|>
ah , gotcha . i ' ve heard of some creepystalkers who follow famous people online . weird . <|endoftext|>
domino ' s is delicious . you can get your pizza at their deli in lots of different places <|endoftext|>
sometimes when you order from a restaurant , they aren ' t ringing up for free , so it ' s good to ask <|endoftext|>
it was very good . i was able to relax and feel loved . how was yours ? ? <|endoftext|>
my name is chris , but i will be playing tennis in a month . do you have any friends that will let me know ? <|endoftext|>
i enjoyed it a lot . how about you ? ? ? whats your day like ? ? <|endoftext|>
thanks . . how was your day ? ? what was a good weekend ? nice to talk about it , to each their own ! <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh , that is so embarrassing , i can not imagine how that must make you feel <|endoftext|>
i bet that was fun . were you all able to make it through the night ? or did you have to stay late ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great , i bet that made the interviewing easier . just be confident . and you ' ll land a job in a bit . <|endoftext|>
yes hopefully . just make sure they have time to themselves so you can hang in there . i would also keep checking everywhere . <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that . . . it must be tough ! i hope you two will be able to work it out <|endoftext|>
i bet it is . did you get out and meet some new people ? maybe they ' d like to meet . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a bad trip . why did you feel bad ? are you going to miss her ? <|endoftext|>
i guess eventually it will just be among friends . maybe you ' ll see a talk to the dogs about" video <|endoftext|>
what ended up happening ? were the people involved okay ? are you in the process of fight ? <|endoftext|>
wow ! i would have gotten spooked ! i ' m glad you guys matured as a couple ! <|endoftext|>
was the boat still on ? do you know if it was yours or a different one ? how old were you ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad nothing too bad happened to you . just something to think about . thanks for the great service ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s nice , i was thinking about those good times too . are you going to look back and see if there was any fun things in them ? <|endoftext|>
i understand . it might seem trivial but things that remind you of your childhood can be really exciting ! <|endoftext|>
lol , oh no ! did you call the police ? sometimes it can be helpful to call the cops if you are scared . <|endoftext|>
oh that really irritates me to no end . money issues can be really difficult especially when you are poor . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . i wish i was more hopeful about my chances . will you be coming up with the job offer ? <|endoftext|>
well thats great and i wish you the best of luck . i hope you get the job . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! well , you can ' t really change their memory . all you can do is ask them to look at the photo and figure out what they said . <|endoftext|>
i know how you feel . it is not fun . i have done it many times . the only good thing is insurance will cover the expenses . <|endoftext|>
why would they ? they are a police force . . that is what they get for being corrupt . <|endoftext|>
what heavy things ? i ' ve only ever ordered big stuff from the uk . we have ups . <|endoftext|>
what kind of results ? did you get a good check up ? were you worried ? i hope so . <|endoftext|>
i am so sorry to hear that . must be very scary . are you better now ? how are you holding up ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s wonderful ! i love memories like that ! are you a nostalgic person or do you like to remember good times ? <|endoftext|>
those were the good days , i used to get so excited when i got to go to the icecream source <|endoftext|>
thats amazing . . it would make life so much easier without a car . . that is such a wonderful gift from god <|endoftext|>
they will change their ways someday , but right now , they are only consequence for you ! you are the one that got hurt <|endoftext|>
that ' s a very good attitude you have there ! it ' s important to be able to focus on yourself and your problems and to focus our problems on the things that matter . it makes it easier to be successful . <|endoftext|>
thats very reassuring . ive always had that line of thinking . i cant stand being in a hurry <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful . i would really be upset , too . what do you think about the interview ? <|endoftext|>
oh yea i know the feeling completely , it ' s like all of your dreams are fulfilled ! <|endoftext|>
i do , but i don ' t want to seem like i ' m being treated like a bad person when i ' ve been there before <|endoftext|>
yeah , it really is . i ' m sure that helps me with my self esteem . do you have any ideas on how to improve ? <|endoftext|>
aw , don ' t feel bad . puppies are so independent . you could have kept him a little longer . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good at least . at least you are keeping him entertained . do you have any pets of your own ? <|endoftext|>
it really is wrong . i can ' t even get a shirt now . they bought it for me at the office . i will never buy again <|endoftext|>
i agree . its a shame they felt that having an kneecaps against anybody is ok , but it certainly is a shame if someone else is being forced to do it . <|endoftext|>
awww no ! did you find it ? did you look for it ? hopefully , it is still missing and you can find it . <|endoftext|>
that is terrible . are you still looking for her ? is she okay ? how did the person make it out ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a lot of fun ! are you a little homesick ? i have friends who have a lot coming up from there . <|endoftext|>
i see . well , it ' s good to see her happy though . it means she ' s moving forward a lot . <|endoftext|>
you definitely should ! it can ' t be that bad ! hopefully it ' s nothing serious ! <|endoftext|>
a general one , he helped me with my back and hips and fitness and knee health . i wish i could have done it over the summer . <|endoftext|>
yes , she has been working really hard . i think it ' s her 3rd full time . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . it ' s like how my parents worked in the military . when they graduated i worked in law . it pays great but the effort is overwhelming . <|endoftext|>
that ' s very inspiring . what are you most grateful for ? are you still able to see it ? <|endoftext|>
thats terrible , i hate to hear that . do you have plans to change ? sometimes things seem to go better when there are more people around . <|endoftext|>
wow ! i bet that was scary ! are you ok ? did the trees get into trouble ? <|endoftext|>
i am so glad it wasn ' t important , but at least it was . well , i hope it was only a 50k hit . if it ' s only 1k , then yeah , that might be too much for a lawn . <|endoftext|>
what did they look like ? and how did they do it ? it sounds like you are very close to them . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really unfortunate . i really hope she gets the help she needs ! i know she didn ' t exactly say she wanted to do it just because she was a singer . but still , it ' s kind of annoying when people get so personal . <|endoftext|>
yeah , what was your favorite thing to do ? i love those things too , but spending time with them can make you feel as if we ' re so grown up ! <|endoftext|>
not according to my personal experience , no . i ' m not sure where you were when it came to money . <|endoftext|>
that stinks ! did you call the police ? i ' ve been in the same situation , and i know that can be a scary thing to experience . do you have a security camera ? <|endoftext|>
i hope you get your tv back . that is not ok . your tv was stolen too . <|endoftext|>
wow , that is insane . did the teens get back at you ? i ' d be really mad ! <|endoftext|>
i hope they do too . what do you think about his behavior ? do you feel bad ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i am so sorry to hear that . did they give you a chance to talk to them today ? <|endoftext|>
ah , i see . keep trying ! i ' m sure there is something you will do that will make more money , i bet ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds painful . what did you do ? are you wearing long dresses ? or were you just too much of an embarassing sweaty mess to remember ? <|endoftext|>
you shouldn ' t do that during the day though . it could end up in injury . they laughed about what ? <|endoftext|>
oh man , that sounds terrible ! i have the same thing . it ' s so annoying . have you tried rubbing it in to her room ? <|endoftext|>
i know . it is so awkward . i have that happen to me too . i feel like she is just trying to be mean . have you talked to her about it ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! where are you going ? i ' ve never been on a vacation before . . except for vacation that i went to this summer . <|endoftext|>
sounds beautiful , what a beautiful place ! i ' m sure you all have a great time . <|endoftext|>
did you feel bad about it afterwards ? maybe she should have seen it happen and maybe told you ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope that you can get over it soon , especially if it ' s going to become a regular part of your life . <|endoftext|>
congrats ! what was the prize ? i haven ' t been able to win anything as far as i know . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s impressive ! you must be very good at chess . congrats ! <|endoftext|>
that is no good . i have a friend that does that . it is terrible . maybe you should talk to him about that <|endoftext|>
don ' t give them any ideas . . always keep it simple . . . just politely say excuse me . <|endoftext|>
i do not like surprises like that . always worry it could be a package that someone sent you to take care of it or something . <|endoftext|>
it ' s a bummer that it didn ' t last . better luck next time . : ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s really terrible . are you okay now ? what the heck happened ? hopefully you didn ' t hurt yourself . <|endoftext|>
it can be a learning experience . you never know what to expect . just be carefree and make your best ! <|endoftext|>
that is awesome ! has there been any special way to meet them ? and did it make you feel good that they are still around ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s so true . it seems like each week has a new twist at every rut . <|endoftext|>
no way ! that is crazy ! i bet it made you sad . i don ' t blame the baby though . i just can ' t imagine being in a situation where i could be riding a dog like that ! <|endoftext|>
my girlfriend is older and almost never uses her phone , let alone uses her computer ! ! : ( <|endoftext|>
that ' s too bad . did you try to reschedule and then make it look a lot better by showing up late ? <|endoftext|>
i wish you the best of luck with that , i hope you ' ll get better results . <|endoftext|>
that is so nice of her . i would be worried too . she might not be answering her phone ! <|endoftext|>
well , i ' d say ignore her for now . maybe go to the bar and get drinks . i ' m sure she ' ll be flattered if you ' re there . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that , maybe one day you can be rich . i hope you can get there one day ! <|endoftext|>
yea . i know . i hate cleaning up after others though . gets me in trouble . it ' s pretty gross . <|endoftext|>
i feel your pain , i was abused for about a year , and have finally had a change of heart since then <|endoftext|>
oh no ! were you able to move with the family ? or were you worried ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
oh gosh ! that really is hard ! are there any hobbies or activities to make you feel better about yourself ? <|endoftext|>
no , i hope you have an ulhobby . we all need new hobby ! i went on a date with a girl a few days ago and when she wasn ' t talking to me , i thought she was talking to someone else . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . it ' s always nice to have good support and help ! how long have you guys been together ? <|endoftext|>
somewhat . i ' m more intro. i often talk to people about my past , and sometimes they take me for granted . but , sometimes i talk to myself about what i ' ve done and what i have done , and it does feel a little surreal . <|endoftext|>
that is wonderful ! i ' m really glad that you have a good friend . and they are able to come over and help out ! <|endoftext|>
it ' s nice that you have someone to support you when it ' ll be hard for you financially , but i ' m sure she was just lucky to be you in the end . <|endoftext|>
wow , that is impressive . i can barely even do a bumper sticker . lol i wonder if that kid will do that ever . <|endoftext|>
i ' m a bit like you man . fell a few times , then just keep going , but when i finally get to the point where it ' s just not fun anymore , i ' ll just get over it and quit . <|endoftext|>
yeah , my mom is like that too . it ' s so annoying ! i think people who have kids should be more considerate of others as well . <|endoftext|>
yes we all need to be more kind to others as well ! i ' m glad you found it . <|endoftext|>
how old is he ? teething can be really stressful . do you think he ' ll be good to go ? <|endoftext|>
i would feel similar , but i think he will be fine . sometimes kids grow up so fast . <|endoftext|>
oh no that ' s so dangerous ! i ' d be so scared . is your dog not okay with the dog on the leash ? <|endoftext|>
that is good , sometimes dogs can ' t keep separate personality types . did you try to talk it out as one or did you just let the other one pick you up . <|endoftext|>
what kind of dog do you have ? my son ' s is a small dog and has potty trained a bunch so i would like to get him into that <|endoftext|>
do you have a pet to help ? what would you do if you had a rescue ? i want a cat <|endoftext|>
oh no , were you able to take him to an emergency vet ? my dog is getting sick . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good to hear . hopefully it wasn ' t anything serious . he ' s always a good guy . <|endoftext|>
yeah a few i went to college for and a few that i just went back to my hometown for <|endoftext|>
it does , i used to be a very pitiful person and really loved being out in nature , learning about everything , it brought a smile to my face just thinking about it ! <|endoftext|>
i hope it turns out as well , good luck ! did you get the job ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
that does sound promising ! good luck . . . and i wish you all the best ! ! <|endoftext|>
yes , i have . it can be very stressful . have you ? have you had anyone help you ? <|endoftext|>
it seems like it . has it rained really often lately ? i ' m sorry . that seems to always bother me as well . <|endoftext|>
i don ' t have kids , but i can kind of see that you are trying to relate to me . <|endoftext|>
oh , i used to love that game growing up . it ' s not for everyone ! i always played the previews before going back to playing the actual game <|endoftext|>
are you more of a social butterfly or do you just like to be around other people ? it ' s a lot easier to be in a position of peace with your own abilities if you know what you ' re doing . <|endoftext|>
good for you . you are a good mother . . . do you know what caused the sick ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good ! it never hurts to encourage yourself . you will do better next time . <|endoftext|>
that is great , i failed a few classes , but i am glad to hear of your success <|endoftext|>
haha i bet you were so disgusted . i ' m guessing you left immediately ? it happens . <|endoftext|>
i know the feeling . i left my food there once and my dog came back to eat . so disgusting ! <|endoftext|>
yeah they do . she loves baseball , football , and basketball . she ' ll be playing baseball later in her life . <|endoftext|>
i bet that is so cool ! how old is she ? ! ? ! what did she do ? <|endoftext|>
omg . was it a long time trip ? i bet you feel bad . did you have to leave the house ? <|endoftext|>
how ' d they react ? did they forget to put them on or did they just assume you forgot ? <|endoftext|>
so she is the last one to get in ? that ' s so sad , i don ' t know why people do it ! <|endoftext|>
the cashier should have been fired right then . that ' s the only time i ever forget to pay my bills ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a lot of fun . what kind of puppy did you get ? i have two dogs myself . <|endoftext|>
i ' m a teacher and it ' s like a dream to have my own class and go into the classroom and have a whole new class of students who want to go into it . <|endoftext|>
me too . life is really not easy these days . we need more people willing to go out and meet people . i hope we can make that happen some day . <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean , i still worry about the day to day life , all the time <|endoftext|>
science fair is one of the most special things , i remember when mine happened , i played so well <|endoftext|>
that is awesome . i can see why it was easy to find the energy from that . it must have been very compressive . <|endoftext|>
why you feel bad ? he will learn eventually . it ' s the human nature . if you don ' t do it everyday , the animal will learn to cope with it eventually . <|endoftext|>
i was just able to cope with it . the first week was rough , but it gets better . when she ' s in first grade i gave her her daddy ' s name and she went nuts ! ! <|endoftext|>
conos are the best ! i can ' t wait to go back ! how ' d you afford it ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty cool ! i hope you guys had fun ! ! ! i ' ve never been on a vacation so i can ' t really judge , but it sounds like you guys did a lot to make your schedule perfect . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure ! time really does fly . . . can ' t wait to see how he looks tomorrow ! <|endoftext|>
i can imagine that . i am happy you can focus on him now . i miss christmas ! <|endoftext|>
oh no . what don ' t you want to go on ? not your time ? where are you planning ? <|endoftext|>
that sucks ! i hate working in a place like that ! are you alright ? does he have to get off soon ? <|endoftext|>
thats awesome i bet hes going to love it ! are you celebrating anything special ? ! ? ! <|endoftext|>
do you think he will be a good achiever though ? : ) i hear a lot of good things about him <|endoftext|>
glad to hear it ! i hope he continues to get better and he regains health advantage . <|endoftext|>
i do not yet i wish though . i can not imagine my kids after such a long time ! <|endoftext|>
oh i love the flea market ! what did you buy ? did you get anything cool ? <|endoftext|>
oh well i guess it ' s kinda funny now ? lol it ' ll be okay . <|endoftext|>
that ' s impressive ! i bet she was pretty tired at that age . was she tired when she passed ? <|endoftext|>
that is a shame , she may be struggling to afford the hotel now . lol . it ' s too bad she don ' t at least have a backup plan for when she needs it most . <|endoftext|>
what did you do about it ? i hate when animals are so little ! i bet she was a rescue . <|endoftext|>
that is terrible ! i hope they were okay . was this a large child ? how old was the baby ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s really hard to imagine she ' s going through something she shouldn ' t be . i ' m glad to hear she ' ll be better ! <|endoftext|>
i know right ! i hope she continues to progress like a normal dog . she deserves it . <|endoftext|>
that is very nice of you . i hope it is not too many . my neighbor had an accident and it took him 6 days to clean up . <|endoftext|>
it is nice that the cat is okay , but yeah , there ' s always some pensish in what we say . <|endoftext|>
that is awful , what did you do ? maybe i will try it one day . . . <|endoftext|>
that ' s quite scary ! what happened ? did you have the courage to ask for help ? <|endoftext|>
that is great ! what a lovely lady you are ! you must be very proud of her ! <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that . what happened ? anything bad in your life ? anything that could be considered wrong with you ? <|endoftext|>
oh sorry about that . losing a pet can really hit you with the feeling you don ' t want to lose . <|endoftext|>
that ' s understandable . i know how frustrating that can be when you have an away to hold on to . <|endoftext|>
yea , i don ' t envy you at all . i ' m more of a homegoer myself . <|endoftext|>
yay ! what is his name ? good luck with his antics ! ! ! i know it probably won ' t be the first . <|endoftext|>
awesome , i hope you guys have a great time together . you deserve to see him once in awhile . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a good dieting method ! have you been doing keto for a good amount of time ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! i wish i had a kindle . i only have a phone . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it would be great . congratulations ! what is the gender ? congrats ! ! <|endoftext|>
i do . it reminded me of when i had to work during the summer break and i was running late and it rained too much but it was really just my mom and dad baking and stuff <|endoftext|>
sounds fun ! did you have a lot of fun ? too many things to enjoy ! lol . <|endoftext|>
ha ! i guess that means you ' re happy with what he has and not unhappy with what you have . <|endoftext|>
oh nice , what are you planning to study ? and where do you go ? i hope you enjoy it ! <|endoftext|>
congrats ! ! you should have a blast , i am sure you are exhausted already ! <|endoftext|>
how has it been going so far ? i am sure your health is important too . how are you doing so far <|endoftext|>
those are all important to begin with , but it is also important to realize that we are living in a cruel world and that there are ways to achieve an achieve result in life , even if you ' re not happy with it . <|endoftext|>
oh really ? why would you want to taste that . is there a reason ? anything specific that makes you prefer it ? <|endoftext|>
what do you like about it ? didn ' t he notice something wrong with the milk ? that might be a reason for the taste not to love it . <|endoftext|>
i hope you enjoy it as much as you can ! it ' s always a good idea to take time to think about all the good times you had together . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i wish i could afford a car ! too bad it is only going to cost a couple of hundred . <|endoftext|>
it ' s never an easy thing to drive with that kind of attitude . it can make you a danger to other involved parties , the driver , etc . <|endoftext|>
i can imagine so , maybe they should get you one of those cameras so you can see what happened after that drive . <|endoftext|>
so sorry to hear about that . . do you feel sad now ? why did you not talk to him ? <|endoftext|>
i imagine . i can just imagine how that would make you feel . i hope you ' re getting some relief from this . <|endoftext|>
that is too bad they didn ' t send you an email saying you were underpaid . they should at least pay you for the time you spent on those booths . <|endoftext|>
it is always nice to overcome overcome fear . congrats on the promotion ! ! ! : ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s so sweet . you sound really sweet . robby got you some good flowers today . <|endoftext|>
thats awful how did you forget ? and sorry about that ! lol . i bet you regretted your decision <|endoftext|>
are you ok ? how old are you ? was it a big deal ? did you cry ? <|endoftext|>
oh lord ! i bet that was painful . i bet you didn ' t even know she was married . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! is it a basement ? my apartment would be so lonely without one . i guess we ' d all be gone by monday ? ) <|endoftext|>
oh how random . i was born years ago and my family was a little woundle . <|endoftext|>
what happened once you found out ? i was just in shock . and i know it isn ' t good to have children , but i know so many people who have and they are amazing <|endoftext|>
well that ' s definitely a good thing . double the pressure doesn ' t always help . you ' re better prepared for the big change than you were in the past ! <|endoftext|>
ah that ' s usually when i feel most anxious . what happened next ? did everything turn out okay ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds terrible . i hope you are feeling better now . your experience must have been terrifying . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . death is always hard . sometimes you just need a resolution to this problem . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that , i ' ve had dogs of my own before as well and it ' s such a tragic experience . <|endoftext|>
oh ok , maybe you should have sat on the ground and watched the whole thing . haha <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear about the loss , you may want to give him a small reward . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , that is such an exciting time ! is your son going to have a good college ? <|endoftext|>
true , sometimes hard to tell , but i feel the kids deserve more appreciated time . i hope everything goes great for you guys <|endoftext|>
that ' s very nice , did they enjoy their walks ? dogs can be so sassy . . . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear about your loss . that ' s a very hard thing to experience . <|endoftext|>
blue is good . keep everything blue ! it helps to relax and feel good about yourself . have you gone to a doctor ? <|endoftext|>
oh ok ! it ' s alright if you find another puppy first i ' m sure your parents will love it ! <|endoftext|>
good for you ! i wish i could go back to the way my skin looks ! how long did it take you to achieve this <|endoftext|>
i have heard that as well . i think keto might help a little too . it ' s all about what you choose to do . <|endoftext|>
how fun ! did you have a time trying to find a sightstyle dress ? i hope it turns out super beautiful . <|endoftext|>
did you complain to the company ? maybe they have some issues with their product . just try to get a different item next time . <|endoftext|>
same here . i still keep my pjs with mwii and gamecube games . those games brought back a lot of childhood memories <|endoftext|>
oh yes , they are great games ! i think it ' s time to buy one of those , it seems like it ' ll be really good <|endoftext|>
what ? what did you do ? ! did you find out what it was ? ? ? how did you ? <|endoftext|>
that must have been terrifying . i ' d be very skeptical if that was my dress as well . did you figure out what it was ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i ' m proud of your daughter and i ' ll never be as good as her as my parents were . <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty amazing . congratulations for her . do you think she ' ll do well in school ? <|endoftext|>
sorry about that . i ' m trying to save money so i won ' t have to buy food on the side . <|endoftext|>
oh , tell me more ! ! maybe i can help you out ? ? how do you feel <|endoftext|>
awww . was it ok ? did you ever find him; the kitten was in good place . <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! that ' s so sad , but there are great cats out there . what kind of cat is she ? <|endoftext|>
oh man , that is impressive . good luck to her . is this for your children ' s class ? <|endoftext|>
haha so what a coincidence . . i was just looking at your account , i feel really lucky to be you . congrats ! <|endoftext|>
was it a strong one ? did you get many damage ? were you well prepared ? i am anxious to move in with friends and family who will be around for a while before it goes past its toughest phase . <|endoftext|>
hopefully you aren ' t to scared to go and get it . we have a cat that lives with us that has done that . <|endoftext|>
how exciting ! is the first date going to be ? have you seen the ceremony ? do you want to propose too ? <|endoftext|>
wow . what a jerk . im guessing your husband is not very nice . hope things work out for you guys . <|endoftext|>
what kind of car are you getting ? what brand is it ? ! ? ! ! ! ? <|endoftext|>
i don ' t think i have ever owned a toyota . i love exbut i want one . <|endoftext|>
i bet you ' re really looking forward to that . are you going to have any help ? <|endoftext|>
i will definitely not start for a few weeks . you will feel better but i ' m sure you will regret it in the long run ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s unfortunate . i ' m sure you ' d be able to figure it out , though . <|endoftext|>
i can ' t even imagine how frustrating that is . i would hate to be able to order things online for little use only . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a trap ? ? what ! ? did she not even give you the part ? ? did you not even need it ? <|endoftext|>
maybe you should try and join some sports teams ? it will help you forget about him . hope your friends find someone better . <|endoftext|>
i would probably sit too long if i were you . i can ' t afford a repair . <|endoftext|>
that is no fun at all ! maybe you can buy a new one with your money again . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s a long time . why didn ' t you move in ? ? ? how did you get back on your feet ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s nice of her to move in with that much money . i hope her life never seems like that again . <|endoftext|>
yeah , that sounds like a bad situation to be in . hopefully , it turns out well for you and her . <|endoftext|>
well she should practice before hand then . or don ' t and don ' r ' t . <|endoftext|>
traveling alone can be wonderful ! did she get any cool assignments ? she must be getting good ones . <|endoftext|>
oh that is such good news . i love babies . are you having one or two ? how old is the baby ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! take advantage of your time and make arrangements to go . hopefully you get some rest . <|endoftext|>
that is bad news . maybe your boss can explain it to you . he must be a little upset about it . <|endoftext|>
uh oh . . . i guess she loves you a lot then . . or she ' s jealous . either way , i ' m sorry that happened to you . <|endoftext|>
well if that ' s the case you ' re probably going to have to let her know ! <|endoftext|>
i understand . what did you end up doing though ? are you upset at her ? and did you tell her ? <|endoftext|>
that is nice , its hard to watch them grow up , but its better than to worry about it now <|endoftext|>
then get pregnant when the baby is older . thats what my sisters did . she gave birth to an accident that ruined her planned program . <|endoftext|>
good luck with that , will it be a long process to build that determination ? or will it happen at a time ? <|endoftext|>
maybe you can get it on nintendo wii wii wii u or another wii game ? lol joking <|endoftext|>
that is so awesome ! i wish i could go back in time like that ! did you ? <|endoftext|>
did you find out who it was ? ? ? i know they are people too , but who knows if it was really them . <|endoftext|>
tomato for the voooky taco ? ! you ' re so creative ! d <|endoftext|>
i would be the same way ! its so hard and there are times when you can ' t find anything . <|endoftext|>
did she see it as an accident ? it happens , and if you ' re right , she will be mad . <|endoftext|>
what if it breaks her ? how close is she to a child ? if it ' s young enough you should tell her ! <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . losing a parent is never easy . i am so lost to this day , it doesn ' t even sound like there ' s a pain in the heart . <|endoftext|>
what did she do ? is it going to be like a family reunion ? or is this just another fixation for you two . <|endoftext|>
that ' s so cool . i bet she is having a great time doing that . was it a special occasion ? <|endoftext|>
i bet , thats great . i am so glad you and your family have someone that can turn their corner <|endoftext|>
why did you lie to them ? honest mistake ? i ' m sure they couldn ' t care less if you did it on purpose . <|endoftext|>
sometimes that feeling can be part of a good life , like the one you gave it . it helps with the sadness . <|endoftext|>
do you go camping ? that is what my daughter always says when she tells me i should be prepared . <|endoftext|>
more detail oriented ? hahaha i suppose if you work in detail , you ' re probably closer to a man . . you can get into trouble with the women around you <|endoftext|>
that is a very loyal feeling . i hope you work it out . why do you feel like you are soulmates ? <|endoftext|>
what happened next ? ! hope you weren ' t hurt . i hope you took it easy . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that ! losing a pet is never an easy thing . you must be very happy with your life . <|endoftext|>
i bet she isn ' t going to even notice ! ! ! don ' t let it bother you <|endoftext|>
you should report it to the police . they should have to do something . you know ? maybe it was a distracted driver . <|endoftext|>

hey , that ' s pretty cool ! i ' m sure you ' ve studied a lot , right ? that ' ll help you relax and get settled in , right from the bar . i ' ve heard if you stay calm and patient , you ' ll end up doing great ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds great ! i liked the character that phoenix was in . did you play the game a lot ? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that what happened if i may ask ? what is the reason for your loss ? <|endoftext|>
i am so ashamed i did that to him . i was one of the main ones that got him to the hospital ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! were you on top of the class ? hopefully they have the best comfort and safe way to let you know ! <|endoftext|>
sweatpants are pretty comfortable . i ' d be the same way and i would just have a sweater . i guess you could always buy one at the dollar store . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! i am sure he will have a wonderful time at your visit ! when is he coming ? <|endoftext|>
nice ! that is so fun ! we always play bingo in the car with friends too . i am so excited for it ! <|endoftext|>
yeah i ' ve had some that are terrible . sometimes you just can ' t go back , they ' re gross . <|endoftext|>
oh man ! is it a serious issue ? can you just talk to them ? hopefully they will understand and you won ' t have to worry . <|endoftext|>
it was great because i actually got to spend time with my dad today . how was yours ? <|endoftext|>
what are you having for breakfast ? i like to snack when i have a good day . its got to be a good snack . <|endoftext|>
it was great , even more so since she was in peru . i am so glad that she is moving to america ! <|endoftext|>
oh man ! how did that happen ? haha . i know it ' s worse when we don ' t even know what was going on . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s embarrassing . i hate when that happens . did anyone let you know ? and what happened ? <|endoftext|>
why do you say that ? isn ' t trust better ? or is it just that you can trust her more ? <|endoftext|>
i need to get myself some one to watch my tv again . time goes by so fast ! <|endoftext|>
i bet , why are you so nervous ? are you prepared ? : ) just relax . it ' s what matters . <|endoftext|>
that sounds very difficult . are you already a math wizard ? ha ha . do you think you ' ll pass ? <|endoftext|>
oh thats really cool , i hope you have a great time there ! ! ! did you see any animals that you liked ? <|endoftext|>
so they are a very bizzare type of animal and so brave ! i bet that is very exciting . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s a bummer ! are they able to take care of it themselves or did you have to have them do it on your own ? <|endoftext|>
no . . . i wouldn ' t . . it seems like it might ruin the whole situation . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! how long have you been together ? how long has it been since you ' ve seen her ? <|endoftext|>
i am sure that is awesome ! is it your first house ? im happy for you ! ! <|endoftext|>
i remember getting so stressed out about that . now i just wait for school to end and then cry . <|endoftext|>
yes it is ! i am glad that things worked out well for you ! ! i cant wait to get my kids back on track <|endoftext|>
oh , how ' d you like them ? and what kind of tv did you watch ? it ' s always good to catch them in the big events and have a chance to see them end . <|endoftext|>
did you win a contest ? sounds like a fun thing to do ! ! ! . you have my respect . <|endoftext|>
thats great to hear , what made you feel happy ? ? ? : ) ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
oh ! congratulations ! that ' s wonderful ! what did you build ? a big project or what ? <|endoftext|>
that is good . what kind of car did you get ? and did you save a ton of money ? <|endoftext|>
that is a nice car ! what color is it ? model ? heels on the car ? ? <|endoftext|>
she sounds like such a wonderful woman ! it is great to have someone so loyal . did she buy you something special ? <|endoftext|>
i would be the same way , but there are always other chances for your future wife to notice you - ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s great , what did you study ? ! what are you going to school for ? <|endoftext|>
you ' ll find something eventually . but stay confident and you ' re going to have great time ! <|endoftext|>
oh that must be so nervewracking . i hope you get a good grade . <|endoftext|>
i ' m trying to get my grade on time now . you never know when a class might become unfair or not . <|endoftext|>
what is being with them ? and you ? why did you lose contact ? do you not know their name ? <|endoftext|>
yeah i feel your pain . i would be mad too . hopefully it wasn ' t someone you didnt want to deal with at all <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that . my mom was really sick too so i understand . at least you are making sure she is doing better and seeing you . <|endoftext|>
did you ever make your friend a date with you ? i bet you could ' ve caught up with her <|endoftext|>
that sounds super gross . are you going to go back to that restaurant again ? maybe ask the waitress for a new one ? <|endoftext|>
did you at least take a bite out of your lunch and then return it ? i would if i were you . <|endoftext|>
that ' s amazing . what kind of memories did you get ? did you find them all again ? <|endoftext|>
yes , we have been friends for quite a long time . they were very reliable and funny , and well deserving of our love . <|endoftext|>
oh no , i can imagine it can be nostalgic . do you think its good that you kept them ? <|endoftext|>
i know right , good ol ' days . what kind of food do you like ? ? sweet chitabbies are the best . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that sounds like very scary . i ' m glad you packed so much . i can ' t imagine the stress that must have been in that house . did you make it out safe ? <|endoftext|>
i was fine . we evacuated safely . it was an ordeal but we have memories of it . <|endoftext|>
are you in the process of getting better ? did you have to see a doctor ? if not , i ' m sorry . but i hope everything is fine ! <|endoftext|>
i hope it all turns out ok for you . it ' s always nerveracking when the test is wrong . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . it takes me forever to complete a project sometimes . did they finish it ? <|endoftext|>
i sure haven ' t ! did you ? is it fun ? i ' ve always wanted to learn to be a lawyer . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , i hope it was a fun day for you . i want to go too , but i have to work . <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . death is hard to deal with . it ' s like losing a family member really . <|endoftext|>
that would have made me mad , what did you do ? did you get a bill ? and was there someone else to walk in with you ? <|endoftext|>
i don ' t blame you at all . no one should have to get stressed over what one coworker should or shouldn ' t have control over . <|endoftext|>
did you call the police ? ? ? maybe they should do something about that annoying guy ! ! <|endoftext|>
what is the test about ? sounds rough ! ! i wish you the best of luck and prepare for it ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure you ' ll do well as a friend , you sound well prepared . will you be able to get a good grade ? <|endoftext|>
sounds wonderful . i ' ve been to florida before , but never alabama . i want to go to alabama soon , i heard . <|endoftext|>
i have and it was fun . i don ' t like the deep end so much though . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s so nice ! your ring sounds so sweet and sentimental . what did you get from your husband ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow that is a long time . i only have been married for five . how do you guys find time to be together ? <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean ! is it a key you need to play over and over ? ? <|endoftext|>
do you remember who bought it or someone bought it for you ? i would have loved to get a keepsake like that ! <|endoftext|>
oh no . . what happened ? did something get stolen ? ? did anything wrong with the sodas ? <|endoftext|>
whoa . that was fast . how did you manage to run in there ? ! ? ! lol <|endoftext|>
well that might make you suspect he ' s fixed a lot . is the party more of a hassle or just fun ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good , better safe than sorry . i wish people were more cautious when they go out . too many wreckless drivers . <|endoftext|>
sibling is a tough way to see someone else doing something you do not like . does your sister do the same ? <|endoftext|>
i think so , if it doesn ' t work out . but for now , i wouldn ' t stress too much . i have a son who has a girlfriend . . . it ' s hard for him to have space to talk and get on with other guys . i hope things turn out for the best for you though ! <|endoftext|>
what did you do ? did he told you ? ? ? ! ? ! ! ? i would be so proud . <|endoftext|>
thats awesome . . . good for you for getting your raise . . i am sure you deserve it . . <|endoftext|>
that is crazy ! did you say anything to them ? it could have been a lot worse . <|endoftext|>
yea i understand , it can really cause some trouble for you in the future , just try not to focus on too much what you are doing , and focus on the good <|endoftext|>
how did it turn out ? loyalty is quite important , if you don ' t mind me asking ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that sounds amazing . that will pay you a large bonus in the future . did you ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . what did you make her ? she must be really nice . : ) <|endoftext|>
she is leaving because she is unable to work and is unable afford to support her kids . but she has a plan for her kid and they don ' t have to see each other much at all . <|endoftext|>
oh my , my condolences to you all . i hope you are ready to move on . it is all we can do is prepare ourselves <|endoftext|>
yeah they are ! hope you don ' t get more again one day . tornadoes are one of the worst things to experience ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s nice , i like to plant all sorts of things in my garden , even when the flowers are suffering . <|endoftext|>
it must be nice to feel this certain way every once in a while . what do you like the most about nature ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a great plan . did you have a great party ? / ? lol <|endoftext|>
that is sounds like fun . you sound happy for her . i wish i was more open to friends . <|endoftext|>
do you have any plans to get to see her again after school ? ? ? i am really looking forward to it ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s a funny way to end a day . sometimes they do things we wouldn ' t want or need . <|endoftext|>
yea , it ' s hard to tell sometimes ! you really don ' t know . i ' d say you ' re probably better off staying at sleep and not talking to him in the moment . <|endoftext|>
oh my word , that is absolutely terrible . what happened ? ! ? ! ! ! ? you should be fired lol <|endoftext|>
that is quite a nickname . are you a guy or a girl ? hopefully you guys have been friends for a long time . <|endoftext|>
that is so gross ! what did you do ? did you take a bite at that restroom ? <|endoftext|>
omg , that has to be horrible ! i am glad you are getting to that point though . the experience is worth the wait <|endoftext|>
hey , it ' s cool . i wouldn ' t feel guilty . we all make mistakes . we need to learn from it <|endoftext|>
i think it is good to leave the tv out at night to play . don ' t be too hard on yourslef <|endoftext|>
some people just can ' t get it out of them . it takes a lot of work to remove that feeling from your own body ! <|endoftext|>
yeah , that ' s a great way to think of it . it can strengthen communication in a way that you can make it through a specific situation without being lost in a bad experience . <|endoftext|>
good , that sounds like a wonderful weekend ! did you drink a lot ? i did a lot of stuff that weekend with friends . <|endoftext|>
that ' s always the best time of the year for a catchup . glad to hear that he ' s made it this far ! <|endoftext|>
oh thats great ! i was never an easy or easy person lol . . i enjoyed my work but i wouldnt dream of going back <|endoftext|>
i love when he is wrong . or it ' s just so easy to see when he ' s wrong . <|endoftext|>
i know that feeling ! it ' s amazing how far you can go now , if you know what you want in life . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i do plan to move later on in life , when i ' m not so busy ! <|endoftext|>
i appreciate that . i hope that things get better for me soon . i ' ve been feeling pretty down . <|endoftext|>
i agree , it ' s cruel and dispicable . what are you suffering from ? i understand you ' re worried about them <|endoftext|>
oh wow , was the window broken ? how big was your house ? was anyone hurt ? what happened ? <|endoftext|>
wow thats a big event . im glad you made it out of it okay . i can only imagine how bad it was . <|endoftext|>
have you thought about finding a new hobby ? i ' m sure you can learn to make your own friends ! <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that . i hope you can find some relief soon . maybe you will still get a positive positive news from the research that is going on . <|endoftext|>
how did you guys meet ? i ' m so sorry . that is not cool . i hope you have someone to lean on . <|endoftext|>
why is that ? i ' m sorry you ' re having a bad time . i hope you guys have a good year ! <|endoftext|>
were you baking ? maybe thats what it was . i hope its not any bad for you . <|endoftext|>
oh y! were you able to get it out ? did you have to wash it ? <|endoftext|>
where did you go ? did you guys go on a trip ? where did the other people go ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s too bad . it ' s a great feeling when you put in the work though . <|endoftext|>
i have the same problem . i ' m so guilty of not getting ready for bed at 4am . . or i get up at sunrise . i feel your pain . do you think you can resolve it with you upstairs neighbour ? <|endoftext|>
i tell them leave the talk to the babysitter . you are being rude and i am not helping . <|endoftext|>
that is true , but they would have to realize they are making a big effort and that it is not healthy for them to raise a child without them growing up . <|endoftext|>
i would be too . hopefully they gave you a discount next time ! ! ! good luck with the next one . <|endoftext|>
oh , he ' s probably just following the advice of your doctor - i ' m sure that he will be fine . the suspense on its own is so important to me ! <|endoftext|>
ah i remember the repair . i had that done too . i can walk now ! are you alright ? i ' ll cross my fingers . <|endoftext|>
i had an important meeting with someone and they decided to take my case to court . i felt so bad but i feel like my case should have been rejected . <|endoftext|>
he already came back as the devil with the jniost . now i just have to deal with the pain <|endoftext|>
is it the summer , or is it summer all over again ? either way , my husband and i are thinking about moving to a new state . <|endoftext|>
i wish i had a yard like that , i need some . i bet it will look great on a model car ride ! <|endoftext|>
really ? i feel like the anxiety from doing it can be overwhelming , but if you really think about it , the what i did today to relax from a big meeting can ' t really be avoided . <|endoftext|>
yeah there ' s actually a lot of math and science that goes into how the brain works . <|endoftext|>
it ' s always nice to be able to remember the past and still enjoy it . what were your favorite kids movies ? <|endoftext|>
i know right . i ' m such a rewatch watchingfirst time mother lol <|endoftext|>
yeah , well back in my day we would ' ve known that we were in our twenties ! ! <|endoftext|>
exactly , they dont learn anything and they are so afraid of everything and everything . they are disgusting . <|endoftext|>
getting your first job felt like it had a lot more freedom with your life , that ' s for sure ! <|endoftext|>
ah , i ' ve never had dairy queen . they ' ve been around a long time , are you excited ? <|endoftext|>
but it still had value to your friends- you earned it ! that ' s something that a lot of people don ' t seem to realize . <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool . what kind of job is it ? some kind of promotion , something fun ? <|endoftext|>
i agree . it ' s great when communities help each other out . it shows a lot of character to see people do the best they can . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s really cool of him . that shows how much of a good he is . <|endoftext|>
that sounds very scary . are you okay ? i hope you were okay ! ! ! were you okay <|endoftext|>
were you able to find it before sting down the hill ? sometimes it is difficult to find good find bike . <|endoftext|>
ugh , that would have been gross ! i don ' t mean to be ignorant , but i don ve never had any reason to take my towel off or use it for anything . is it a thing that happens at the sauna ? <|endoftext|>
you should be though , if someone is going to get you , it ' s not you ! <|endoftext|>
congratulations on that ! what grade do you give yourself ? i am sure you will ace that test . <|endoftext|>
i love sunshine , what are you going to do about it ? you have to work hard for that <|endoftext|>
just about 6 years . i ' ve hated every minute of it , but i ' m ready to leave . <|endoftext|>
well , yeah , you know ? i think that kind of thing is really difficult for me . even for people i know that really like me , it can be difficult . for them , it ' s like , we don ' t have any real value for money . . but , when you have a reason to believe it , there ' s no reason to be humble and kind of dissappointed . which is kind of dumb , but , kind of lazy , if you ask me . i guess that ' s how it goes with people i meet at school , though . i can get tired of talking about them . <|endoftext|>
that is good . you ' ll get it back later . i had to spend a large chunk of my winnings on a mistake that my credit card company told me was an error . <|endoftext|>
you should definitely save it , it might save you a few days of work , which is worth it ! <|endoftext|>
awesome ! i am happy for you ! you must be a great performer . what do you do to pay off your sholarships ? <|endoftext|>
good job , you can learn from our mistakes . i wish i was more stars . . . <|endoftext|>
i hope your cog in the wheel soon ! : ) that ' s a great accomplishment ! <|endoftext|>
oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that . did he not eat them ? sometimes things just don ' t work out that well , i know it . <|endoftext|>
it ' s good that he remembered that . they ' re really easy to forget . i hope your mom isn ' t too frustrated with you . <|endoftext|>
my son was the same way , but as he got older , he got more interested in the board games and playing . <|endoftext|>
lol ! so true ! it ' s like when you start grocery shopping and when you look in the shopping list and there ' s two different people there with a big stick pointed at their head . lol <|endoftext|>
oh no ! how did that end up ? did you make it back and ask for a replacement ? <|endoftext|>
well , he will most likely be fine after that . he was probably just not expecting it . <|endoftext|>
oh man that sounds amazing ! i hope you win ! have fun ! you ' re lucky ! <|endoftext|>
was that your first time ? that ' s very understanding . i hope your renter is nice ? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that . i am sure she is probably a little frustrated . i hope she was understanding and you were able to talk to her anyway . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! are you confident you are gonna do great ? ? ? ! ? ! ! <|endoftext|>
aww , what did you guy explain ? i ' m not sure i even know whats that means lol <|endoftext|>
oh no , how did it go ? did you hurt him ? or both ? how are you feeling about it ? <|endoftext|>
it will be fine . i am sure you ' ll find someone . i know i did . <|endoftext|>
top feedback very nice , congratulations ! i bet you love your district ! ! ! i hope to get there one day <|endoftext|>
interesting . if i was in your position i would write a quilt about how i wish i were still that rich . <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! it must have felt like a very happy joyful moment for you both ! you must be so proud of yourselves ! <|endoftext|>
i hope so , my son is almost grown and already a dad ! lol . and yes , this journey can be quite amazing ! <|endoftext|>
yep . i was counting down the days and found a 10 dollar bill . never know how bad the bills will be these days <|endoftext|>
we just started to use less electricity and i ' m so glad we did so that things would be a little better in the future . <|endoftext|>
that is exciting ! it is nice to get to spend time with them . how old are they ? <|endoftext|>
notebooks are definitely not for children that need everything in their lives ! good job ! lol <|endoftext|>
sorry about that . do you feel better now ? i know how that is . my thoughts and feelings mostly . <|endoftext|>
did anyone else see ? it happens to the best of us . i ' d be embarrassed at myself for laughing . <|endoftext|>
what were you wanting to do specifically ? what was the plan ? i hope you didn ' t make a big mess . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i hope you get a good grade ! try hard not to overstudy too much ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m happy you got to see him speak . what was the conference about ? do you attend one ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool . it ' s always good to think bigger my foot ! ! ! we use to have a larger team and the same year it fell apart ! it really sucked cause they had a lot of good players and a lot that didn ' t <|endoftext|>
just do it . whatever happens , happens . nothing is worse than getting the things you need but can ' t even leave home ! <|endoftext|>
that is great news ! are you excited ? i know that will be a nice change of pace . <|endoftext|>
it will be fine . just study hard and your nerves will go off ! i ' m sure you ' ll do great . <|endoftext|>
do you have a good relationship with the spouse ? ? ? if so what are your weaknesses ? <|endoftext|>
i can imagine . i hope you did a lot better . that would be so hard . do you feel relieved now that you did well ? <|endoftext|>
what ' s big in the heart ? i ' m not asking for anybody ' s advice . <|endoftext|>
double the number of people is amazing , hope you had a great time ! ! ! i hope it was a great open up for you <|endoftext|>
is it in a big town ? if it ' s in a city center i would be so excited to be there ! <|endoftext|>
you should be happy you have an alive life and not try to settle down for someone . it ' s just not healthy but , i am glad you are happy . <|endoftext|>
that sucks , i know you will miss your health sometimes though , i am sure it was a good thing your friend returned the favor <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . i hope it stays that way for you . change is always good in my opinion ! <|endoftext|>
i have issues with gluttony . i wish i could fix it but it is something that i do not seem to be able to . <|endoftext|>
you must be feeling really good about yourself , thats really awesome . what kind of program will you be doing ? <|endoftext|>
do you mind explaining what you mean by that ? i ' m not too familiar with this . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , i had no idea . i hope he is coming back soon , it is a scary situation . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! how are you adjusting ? you must have worked really hard to get a place like that . <|endoftext|>
aw , did you get him a new dog then ? sounds like he ' s like your little angel ! <|endoftext|>
maybe he ' s homeless . who knows . i just don ' t know if it ' s healthy . <|endoftext|>
what a nice surprise ! are you happy ? is she coming ? ? ? ! ! ? ! <|endoftext|>
that was nice . i hope you have fun . i ' ve had great girlfriends who did that for me . <|endoftext|>
hmmm . . i hear earplugs are good . . . but maybe using headphones too ? <|endoftext|>
are you going to be able to do that soon ? it could be a good way to have some time away from family . <|endoftext|>
congrats , how old is he ? do you know ? : ) how old will you be ? <|endoftext|>
i hope you still have the clothes . sometimes that happens to be a good source of success . <|endoftext|>
yeah , that can be scary . do you have any family that needs help with that kind of worry ? <|endoftext|>
make sure to buy tires and tune up . that will cost you quite a bit . i just fixed my old toyota camry . <|endoftext|>
oh man , hopefully you apologized to her . that ' s not a good sign when someone can ' t take a joke . <|endoftext|>
that is crazy . . . especially when they are innocent ! just have to be careful what you say to her when you are kidsof course ! <|endoftext|>
it happens tho , but its still a stupid thing to do . you could have told your roomate instead . <|endoftext|>
ah . i see . well , i hope you keep the practice alive , and hopefully this issue won ' t be as big an issue . <|endoftext|>
thats awesome ! you must have been so proud of her . how old is she now ? <|endoftext|>
oh no . i cannot even imagine . i am glad that she is okay . i just would have scared she would be hurt . <|endoftext|>
how far did you manage to run ? do you feel prepared ? how did you do in the end ? <|endoftext|>
you better keep it up ! that takes forever and is even more frustrating ! it ' s the first day you have to put your hard work towards . you ' ll get there ! <|endoftext|>
that is crazy , do you still play ? i miss those days . my cousins and aunts and uncles used to play those games with me all the time . <|endoftext|>
oh cool . i loved sega as a kid . i used to play old sega games from the years . i believe they were the first games sega made ! <|endoftext|>
why were you scared ? i can understand how that can scare you but i ' m not too fond of trains either . <|endoftext|>
i get that . i hope you were ok . i would have freaked out . . . i hate going out fast <|endoftext|>
nice ! what kind of car is it ? is it a bigger one ? bigger vehicles are sometimes better . <|endoftext|>
nice ! you ' ll have to search for a nice deal then ! i know i sure did . the new kesla here is crazy ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
oh really ? how did that go ? it ' s a pretty good movie . how old is she ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds so awesome ! you are a very sweet lady ! ! : ) sending positive vibes your way ! ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . how often do you have days where you are happy ? do you like to do things for happy moments ? <|endoftext|>
what ' s the point of that ? to be in the present ? are you in a situation where you ' re worried that your life is going to be meaningless ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s so gross ! hopefully it wasn ' t a nasty hair in it though ! ! <|endoftext|>
what a pain in the ass . it will cost you a lot to put up with that for another time . just have to keep waiting and it will happen . <|endoftext|>
thats awesome . is it a new bike or just new to you ? which one did you get ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s a good feeling to take an upgrades to a new bikedbike . it always feels great to upgrade . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s quite a jump , you must be excited . are you gonna homeowner or buy any new house ? <|endoftext|>
maybe a yard sale . that way you can experience the real cost of doing work . what kind of places will you plan on taking down ? <|endoftext|>
well i think many of us care . many of our parents don ' t though . it ' s a family thing <|endoftext|>
i know how it is . it ' s hard to set an excuse to just kick back and eat junk food when there ' s a busy weekend . just get a handle on it . no sense in being lazy . <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! what a great name . i hope she ' s not scarred for life ! your cat sounds great . <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that ! i hope you find her and show her love soon . it ' s so hard to lose a pet <|endoftext|>
oh well , that happens sometimes , maybe you should try something simple like pizza ? that would help , maybe even stay for a month . <|endoftext|>
yeah , as long as you keep on taking the credit for the assignment , you ' re doing the same thing you ' ve been doing for years , i ' m sure the judge doesn ' t mind . you just have to keep working hard ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! was it anything interesting ? do you know what it is now ? treasure them if you can . <|endoftext|>
i get that , it ' s a pretty amazing thing to see family members so young ! congrats . <|endoftext|>
oh that is so cool . is it you sending it or someone you know sent it ? or is it yours . <|endoftext|>
nice , enjoy the trip ! family time is always very helpful . . . but i am sure that both of you will have a blast . <|endoftext|>
oh no , what happened next ? did someone get in trouble ? did you feel like you had a right to be nervous ? <|endoftext|>
no problem , but you ' re welcome . your health is a lot more important than your shirt . <|endoftext|>
wow , that sounds like a rough situation . i don ' t think we should take for granted the fact that we were young back then , and we probably acted like we didn ' t know things . i guess we ' re all human and learn from our mistakes sometimes . <|endoftext|>
he doesn ' t sound like a very good friend then . i ' m sorry that happened to you . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that ! did you ace it ? ? ? don ' t feel so bad . <|endoftext|>
yea but if you dont then who will ? u must be really good at something . u cant just be there for the 1 in a million . u need to find a way to make everyone think u have perfect timing . <|endoftext|>
what did you do ? what did they do ? i would ' ve been freaked out . what happened ? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome that you were able to get away ! what kind of fish was it ? were you scared of what it could be ? <|endoftext|>
i know that feeling . i wish i could find my old cards . . . i feel you on that . <|endoftext|>
yes i love seeing old toys that i havent kept in awhile ! i have an old teddy bear i sold to pay for my childhood heirloom . <|endoftext|>
that sounds great . were you nervous ? what do you do there ? are you a manager ? <|endoftext|>
you should make it look professional . that way it doesn ' t get too pricey ! <|endoftext|>
i haven ' t seen him in ages . i ' m glad you enjoyed yourself . what was the instrument he sung ? <|endoftext|>
oh ok . well i am glad you enjoyed it . hopefully you get a piece . i like seeing shows . <|endoftext|>
it is . i love swimming . what beach did you go to ? i go to the beach every weekend . <|endoftext|>
yes , i agree . i love looking at the bright light and the freedom to relax and have fun at the beach . <|endoftext|>
oh no . what did you do ? did you not understand the answers ? ? ? ! ! <|endoftext|>
yeah i ' d probably pass too . my dog would die in a second if i ' m doing that to her lol <|endoftext|>
that sounds really awesome . are you both going to go on a date ? or is it something where you both go together ? <|endoftext|>
that is unfortunate . you can always check back on facebook and see if anyone you know is having any plans . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry , how old was he ? i have lost many before and it ' s always hard ! <|endoftext|>
were there other cats in the car ? hopefully not a puppy . that is terrible ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . do you have memories of him ? i hope you don ' t have to think about him in any negative way ever . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . i ' ve lost both of my beloved grandparents to cancer , so i can tell you know how hard that can be , even just dealing with it can bring tears of joy . <|endoftext|>
nice ! did you have fun ? a lot of people i ' ve seen go there with friends . <|endoftext|>
i love the beach , you are right . so beautiful there . i love going to the beach ! <|endoftext|>
who was he playing ? i have never been . is he performing or performing in the moment ? <|endoftext|>
absolutely . i can ' t believe he was able to write that . i ' m not a huge reader , but i loved his book las vegas , the spanish prince of texas . <|endoftext|>
did you guys have a good time ? do you have a bunch of family members you haven ' t seen in awhile ? <|endoftext|>
i bet , i could never imagine being in a situation where i was crying over a food . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you didn ' t get jumped ! i would ' ve freaked out ! what did you do ? <|endoftext|>
did your mother find it ? we would ' ve been screaming for her . i would ' nt be able to live without my parents . <|endoftext|>
why is that ? is she always doing that ? or maybe she doesn ' t realize that you are her little sister ? <|endoftext|>
i think that is key to have a good relationship with her . how is your relationship going ? <|endoftext|>
were you not expecting them ? are they not good parents ? why were you nervous ? that sounds like quite a complicated situation ! <|endoftext|>
wonderful ! i ' m glad you had a fun time . : ) that ' s always a plus . <|endoftext|>
was it a dog ? ? did you ever get it back ? hopefully it wasn ' t a real one . <|endoftext|>
you escaped ? must have been a good adventure . good job ! ! ! what happened ? ? <|endoftext|>
there are plenty of other people who can . don ' t wish it will never happen to you . <|endoftext|>
did you end up getting it ? i hope it was successful . sometimes the process can take time . <|endoftext|>
sometimes the instructions are hard to find on youtube . i don ' t like having instructions on how to do everything , and it ' s hard to tell you from what you ' ve got , <|endoftext|>
well , i hope you found someone who is grateful . i know you still look forward to them . <|endoftext|>
oh gross , you had to get rid of them . was it a tasty one ? or a homeless one ? <|endoftext|>
i don ' t blame you ! you shouldn ' t even be surprised at that though ! they are very talented at what they do ! <|endoftext|>
thanks , i really appreciate it . . so many people do stuff like that nowadays . . . <|endoftext|>
hmm , what do you mean ? what about 5 ? are you familiar with 5 , or just curious about the number ? <|endoftext|>
are you sad about it or just excited for the moment ? why not take it easy . it ' s okay to not care <|endoftext|>
that is wonderful to hear ! you guys can always reconnect and go back to our hometown . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! did they have a good relationship ? how long have you been friends with each other ? <|endoftext|>
that seems reasonable . have you confronted them about this ? if not , i wouldn ' t be the least bit disappointed . <|endoftext|>
oh goodness . i hate bugs . did you hurt it ? ? ? it must have been hungry . <|endoftext|>
that sounds terrifying . how did you keep him from jumping ? i bet he wanted to go to your bed ! <|endoftext|>
what are you going to do ? do you have anywhere to put your money ? do things seem easy to cover ? <|endoftext|>
what are you planning to do with the money ? i hope that your hard work is still there . <|endoftext|>
what where you all at once ? did you see a lot ? and where was the best place ? <|endoftext|>
what were you dissapointed about ? i ' m not being harsh on you . i think there is still a place for everything . <|endoftext|>
did you get to eating all by yourself ? i bet that felt really great ! they do have several more locations near me though , so you can get free meals and get food whenever . <|endoftext|>
did you tell her ? if so , you should be . why do you feel so guilty ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! that is terrible . you must feel terrible . . . were you able to recover quickly from it ? <|endoftext|>
wow , thats a huge lie , what was your reaction ? are you mad ? did you feel like being a true friend ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s good that you have good friends . i would not have been able to make friends without social media <|endoftext|>
oh my ! that must have been so awkward ! is she going to do something special next time ? <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds adorable ! does she still live with you ? how old is she ? tell me about her . <|endoftext|>
why were you so nervous ? were you involved with them at all ? or were you just surprised and excited ? <|endoftext|>
i am glad to hear that , you must be very proud of yourself ! ! ! any plans to lose weight ? <|endoftext|>
you will have to give it time . the graduate program does not start till after graduation . so you will need time to get through the process . <|endoftext|>
oh wow . i hope you got to do something fun and have some fun again ! you deserve it <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i am so sorry for your loss . i lost my father 5 years ago and it still hurts so much . <|endoftext|>
the cops that pulled my car over and tow me from my car to my house ! i just ran over the finish line and everything ! <|endoftext|>
aww i feel the same when i see my dog . i am so sorry ! is it a big one or a little one ? <|endoftext|>
did you guys have a good time ? what kind of track was it ? i ' ve never run . <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible . i hate to see that . did you punish him ? or is it not that big of a deal ? <|endoftext|>
it did . it reminded me of the good old days when we had so much fun . it was funny to catch up now with them . <|endoftext|>
you can dance well if you want to . i was shocked that she became a dancer . she also won a dance mvp . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , did you end up getting one ? they are a pretty harmless group . what did you do after you saw one ? <|endoftext|>
i would have probably run as well ! what did you do ? ! ? ! ! ? lol <|endoftext|>
that ' s smart . you will win next time ! scratch off tickets are amazing ! is there a chance of winning ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . blackjack is where my money is at right now ! <|endoftext|>
oh really ? what kind of cake was it ? was it nice or gross ? that sounds gross ! <|endoftext|>
lol . that ' s funny , i am sure that probably ruined a lot of lunch . <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that . my dog passed a few years ago too . it was hard . <|endoftext|>
that ' s wonderful . i ' m sure she ' ll appreciate it . she ' s your father in law . <|endoftext|>
i bet it does . . . but you had great friends that helped to make sure you were at peace <|endoftext|>
you dont really know what happened so just be there for your dog and let the time heal . <|endoftext|>
yeah , and all the fake news that is spread by the other side of the world . so sad . <|endoftext|>
that is true , it is nice to get out to the enws . i like to research new things <|endoftext|>
you are lucky to have a little one . my mom got me a set of totes of chocolate milk because my baby always asks for it ! <|endoftext|>
haha , that ' s funny . so , do you think she will be good at her 4 year old game ? i mean i know she is good at what she is doing , but i ' m worried she will overeat once she ' s in college . <|endoftext|>
how did that happen ? did you lose something you wanted or find a different job ? if the former , i hope you were able to find another job so that you could start looking for one soon . <|endoftext|>
wow , i ' m sorry to hear that . that must be devastating to have all that to lift you up . <|endoftext|>
do you know how the prices have gone so far ? is there a reason ? and did you like aldi ? <|endoftext|>
oh i will ! i just wish they were more dress code friendly , or would i be worried about seeing my favorite hair in them . <|endoftext|>
i am not a big sports fan but i do get excited for some things . why do you say that ? <|endoftext|>
i am a saints fan ! ! ! but i hope the eagles win tonight as well ! ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear about that . . what was his name ? ? ? hope he ' s alive forever . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . that ' s no good . i hope you find peace . <|endoftext|>
have you broken up with her ? it ' s time to start the relationship . that is my advice <|endoftext|>
wow , you were close to her all your life , that ' s some good life remembering . <|endoftext|>
oh yeah ? what are those ? buy me one ? lol . i ' m excited for ya . <|endoftext|>
good luck . i know your hard work pays off . just stay positive and you ' ll be fine . <|endoftext|>
i bet you were so proud . i have never seen a hamilton movie . did you get to ? <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds exciting ! i haven ' t seen it in forever , seems you must be really anticipating it . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s terrible . was she alright ? hope she is ok ! i ' ve had dogs make mistakes before and that can leave you with a bit of anxiety as it comes . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s pretty scary . i hope she is ok . is her leg okay ? will you be okay ? <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never been , but i have heard about them . what kind of stuff do they do to make them striving for that ? <|endoftext|>
cool . i like hip hop , i also like combat sports . that sounds like a lot of fun . <|endoftext|>
sounds like a fun idea ! i would love to do that ! go on a training tour maybe ? <|endoftext|>
you are quite the artform , i would have thought you were the 1000 overall winner at a gym . <|endoftext|>
you must feel really proud ! did you make him feel happy during the school day ? or was it some other sort of planned planned thing ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry . dads are the best . i am sure he was a great man . <|endoftext|>
some people enjoy being left hanging , i get that too . it can be a little depressing when you ' re on a trip and you have to remember all those good times . <|endoftext|>
why were you nervous ? you meet them or something ? was the pressure on ? or was it because you needed to take a car or something so bad ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s amazing . i ' m glad you are alive . i would be so scared ! <|endoftext|>
do you feel jealous of her ? that ' s what jealousy is . feeling jealous of someone else . <|endoftext|>
maybe she will make an appointment with your son . that is what i do when my daughter is running around . <|endoftext|>
did you cry and stuff when she told you ? did you have a bad time ? was it something serious ? <|endoftext|>
hahaha i would have done the same thing ! you should have though about your safety first ! <|endoftext|>
yes ! i love to be out and about in nature ! i ' m glad you do too ! <|endoftext|>
nice ! is it always sunny in christmas time or something ? or is this something that ' s happening this year ? <|endoftext|>
awe , how amazing ! what was your favorite part ? i went to see him in 2004 . <|endoftext|>
you make it sound like a big deal . . . oh cool , i didn ' t know that ! <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s really exciting ! do you usually take her ? i ' ve never done that . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s pretty cool . i bet it was really scary . but that ' ll be fun as hell to do . <|endoftext|>
i agree , it is no fun ! i hope they don ' t get hurt too bad , too ! <|endoftext|>
i guess , but i have always been a faithful person . i am not sure if i will ever go to a church . <|endoftext|>
i am not . that would be terrible ! how about you ? do you have kids ? haha <|endoftext|>
how long do you think it will take you to feel happy if you are just a one ? <|endoftext|>
are you going to go see your doctor for sure ? ? ? could it be a stress test ? <|endoftext|>
at least you could go out and enjoy your alone time . i hate being out with some friends who don ' t invite me . <|endoftext|>
oh i know the feeling ! i was too scared too . . it all makes for so many bad memories <|endoftext|>
i hope you enjoy it a lot now you have the chance to spend more time together . i think it will be a great opportunity to do that . <|endoftext|>
i feel you . i ' m a brother and i am getting close to paying mine off as well . is it alright ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , if you can teach her you can make her start a new chapter in her life as well ! <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s rough . how did you end up finding the courage to end the relationship ? <|endoftext|>
i understand , it is a good way to move forward as well . i ' m sorry he didn ' t understand . <|endoftext|>
thats awesome , how long are you guys there ? ? ? are yall together for vacation ? <|endoftext|>
thats great , what breed is the baby ? a boy or a girl ? ? ? : ) <|endoftext|>
i think you need to be more patient with him . he might be on the edge of his seat . <|endoftext|>
i completely understand how you feel . i have been in your shoes as a child , and know how much it bothers me to be worried about someone else having the money . it ' s sad when you have to do that . <|endoftext|>
i have never been on a diet . what do you eat ? do you exercise ? i want to . <|endoftext|>
what kind of diet was it ? i ' m a huge keto fan . i ' ve lost 20 pounds so far ! <|endoftext|>
wow . i would be so proud of your daughter too ! congratulations ! ! ! what do you think you will get her ? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome ! work is the gateway to life . . . and i ' m sure her hard work paid off . <|endoftext|>
how did you find out ? did you look them in the eye and say hello ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
that makes sense , but still though thats just how it should be . being young has never been easy . <|endoftext|>
yea that is fun . . when is your friend back ? ? ? i love when new friends reconnect . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good to hear ! i ' m glad you ' re reunited ! don ' t stress it too much , there ' ll be plenty more opportunities in time . <|endoftext|>
how do you think you did ? did you get the highest result ? ? ? either way you did the right thing ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure that was a great result . hopefully you did better in the future . be thankful to have such a great teacher . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! where are your friends from ? is it going to be the visiting one or the other ? <|endoftext|>
well , maybe a friend can move to another place for a visit ? it ' s always fun to see friends you haven ' t seen in a while . <|endoftext|>
that sounds really rough . i can ' t imagine dealing with that at all . how do you cope ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s really stressful , i think you will be fine though . you sound very confident . <|endoftext|>
i know how that feels . i had to say goodbye to my cat and i was heartbroken for over hours . <|endoftext|>
i am so sorry you had to go through that . i am sure you will be able to provide a comfort to those who may have to leave home . <|endoftext|>
he ' s on a couch ? damn that ' s not cool . but i ' m not suprised . why is he being on the couch ? <|endoftext|>
oh i see , well i hope he is able to get some help soon ! i know how hard it is to lose a job <|endoftext|>
that is so cool , i am sorry that happened . have you given up fast food ? some people just have so much food and don ' t appreciate it . it takes a lot of dedication <|endoftext|>
i hope they have a lot of fun . that could really change their life . : ) i don ' t think i could have that stress . <|endoftext|>
sounds really exciting ! did you go to many activities ? ? ? did you enjoy it ? ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s good ! it ' s very useful to have a place of your own in a once caring place <|endoftext|>
that ' s the worst . i hope you called and complained to merrisight . it happens . <|endoftext|>
that ' s so frustrating ! what a great company by your side , though ! ! hope they win the case ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s really good to hear . has she returned recently ? and how do you feel about it ? <|endoftext|>
what a great time , i bet you were a great couple ! was there a special occasion ? <|endoftext|>
i could imagine , i am sorry ! have you tried looking for groups to meet with friends to meet up ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a good idea , i ' d suggest watching a comedy too . it can be repetitive . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i hate spiders ! what did you do about it ? i would have been so scared . <|endoftext|>
good . it was someone important you should be worried about . i hope you are alright ! ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure you can if you set an appoitment . florida is a beautiful state <|endoftext|>
i know right ! august feels so much better than march . what do you do for your work ? <|endoftext|>
did you talk to him about it ? or did he not want to eat it ? why is your roommate so rude ? <|endoftext|>
yeah and next time you need to cook a certain food , you should always put it on the fridge - it ' s safer ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible , i can ' t even imagine . how old was she when she left ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that has to be very tough . i ' m sorry . what ' s it that they don ' t want to do ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that , maybe they will respond again . what happened ? you can only think positive about a positive thing . <|endoftext|>
i totally agree with you . life is full of a great experience , and can be hard at times , but a lot of people deal with life without being born in it , so it ' s the lifechanging moment in their life . <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! it should be exciting and scary ! what are you doing there ? where are you moving to ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , winter is very hot . i hope you guys enjoy it ! where did you move to ? <|endoftext|>
ah , thats cool . congrats then ! cross country skiing sounds like it would be fun . <|endoftext|>
i see . how are you planning to prepare ? are you buying something new or just getting in ? <|endoftext|>
i hope so , we need to help people out . : ) how do you feel about that ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s so terrible . has she been getting help lately ? i hope so , because that is absolutely tragic . <|endoftext|>
oh that really is messed up . i wonder if they are just waiting to hear back from their support group ? <|endoftext|>
how exciting ! congrats ! did everything turn out ok ? ? ? what is the secret ? <|endoftext|>
oh yes , those are lots of memories . that makes for a wonderful memory to carry with you . <|endoftext|>
i don ' t know what that means but sounds interesting ! do they have a name ? lol . <|endoftext|>
i hate when that happens . makes my head spin like it was someone shooting into the street . <|endoftext|>
nice i love books with lots of surprises and scares so this is a good one to keep me on track ! <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s a great accomplishment ! how do you feel about the next coming of the new year ? <|endoftext|>
i would be too if i was that rich . you must have a very rich family . so , you must love her . <|endoftext|>
nice , what kind of car ? i need one to be any good with new cars . what kind did they get . <|endoftext|>
nice ! i love hondas , and am sure he wanted to use it as a motivator . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . what kind of degree did you get ? and what was your dream school ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! what was your favorite part about your final season ? i ' m hoping it ' s the same for you ! <|endoftext|>
oh i ' m sorry to hear that . . . how did you cheat ? what happened ? <|endoftext|>
probably not the best idea , but maybe you can go to hr and ask for a severance package ? that way you can have a change of pace when you clean up after yourself . <|endoftext|>
i understand that feeling . are they really excited ? i hope they do a lot of fun . <|endoftext|>
i can imagine . i hope you have a great time with them . it should be a blast <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean . i still have close friends from school . i ' m in college now , though , but i still see some of my old friends . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you find them . that can take some time . do you go to school ? <|endoftext|>
i hate those kind of movies . what was it about ? i ' m curious . . . <|endoftext|>
lol . my mom would babysit us when we were young so it was something we did every year . <|endoftext|>
aw , that ' s so sweet ! sometimes we have to put our hard times behind us . it ' s really sweet to see our loved ones still be there . <|endoftext|>
i love that about bed and breakfast ! the comfort is worth it . i can ' t wait to go back in there on saturday ! <|endoftext|>
aww , i ' m sorry . i have two dogs and they ' re the best : ) they ' ll always be with us no matter what <|endoftext|>
what breed ? is she still alive ? : ) ) ) my cat is a sweetheart ! ! <|endoftext|>
oh , i know . what makes you so excited about him ? i mean , i ' m not either , but it ' s nice to have another to fill that void . <|endoftext|>
the whole world is playing into his hands for whatever reason . i hope it is because of trump that things are getting worse for everyone . <|endoftext|>
how did your nieces manage to break that heal ? ! were they okay ? that would have been an awful lot of money ! <|endoftext|>
maybe you can put your faith in that too ? i am sure if you wait it will heal ! <|endoftext|>
i get that , family vacation can get pretty intense . i am glad that you had a lot of fun though <|endoftext|>
that is good , i bet it was a lot of fun , especially at home . being apart was a big deal for us too , when it come to trips <|endoftext|>
that is unfortunate . it happens . sometimes it is better to pull the positives and just be supportive . <|endoftext|>
i know , i ' m glad you guys got the coverage you needed . i ' ve never gotten so hammered at my work as that . so frustrating . <|endoftext|>
that must be a very sting . do you have any spray or do you try to get rid of them ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a great situation to be in . i ' m sorry you ' re going through that right now . <|endoftext|>
good thinking ! i do hope the weather is ready for that and that you are able to pack some extra clothing . <|endoftext|>
i bet ! hopefully you didn ' t end up in trouble . . . that would be a huge lie ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow . i bet those ranch were fun . did they have horses like that ? those were the good old days ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow thats amazing ! i bet you had a lot of fun . i would be so happy with my dollar . <|endoftext|>
was it a big flat ? that must have been so scary to have your tire changed ! i ' m glad you were able to get it done quick . <|endoftext|>
flat tires are the worst . so you get really bad ones ? flat tires can be a pain in the rear as well . <|endoftext|>
wow ! were you okay ? i bet that was scary ? ? how did it end up ? <|endoftext|>
oh no that sounds pretty horrible ! at least you escaped . good thing you survived though . or maybe that would have been a little embarrassing . <|endoftext|>
oh really ! sounds like nice opportunity . i hope you are happy about it ! ! ! are you ? <|endoftext|>
everyone does rainy days every now and then . i hope that you get some rest , even if it is just a nice day to play . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! was there a change in scenery ? new people always make me think about the old times . <|endoftext|>
wow , you must have visited most of it . how fun . is it hard to make friends there ? <|endoftext|>
i really need to learn how to do it properly . i ' ve been doing it a lot to relax but it ' s not doing so good ! i ' m just so nervous <|endoftext|>
do you have any special plans for the day that you ' re planning ? why no mystic events . <|endoftext|>
oh man . was it a house you had always wanted to live in ? why did you thought that ? <|endoftext|>
ah ok , yeah there has to be a safety first for that ! i would be really anxious too . <|endoftext|>
that sucks . did you tell your friend about it ? maybe you can reschedule . if you don ' t get it , there ' s usually another guy that will . <|endoftext|>
yes if only more people knew how good their money would be , all the while we would all be broke ! <|endoftext|>
how did it go ? did it prepare you for it ? did you have fun ? did the speech make you feel any better ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool that it took you so much personal experience to get so comfortable with your presentation ! i bet you worked really hard ! <|endoftext|>
aww . that ' s so mean . have you been trying to do other things as well ? <|endoftext|>
that is really nice . i prefer theives myself , but nice to have nice people too . <|endoftext|>
nice , i will just get in touch with a local interest to see if it ' s open . <|endoftext|>
what did you do ? lol did you get stung by a wasp ? ? ? . . i do not know how to feel about wasp . do you like them ? <|endoftext|>
oh yeah , that can be stinky ! do you have a bad experience when you get stung ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful . were you able to recover it from the store or did you have to go to a supervisor ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s never too late to return things ! you have your day ! ! ! but seriously , i hope your mailbox came back ok ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s an amazing feeling . it ' s hard to get caught up in the old days , but looking back is always fun . <|endoftext|>
its good that you did though . your parents can take care of you very well . good luck with the baby ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds awesome ! so many people get depressed around here so its tough to get out of bed <|endoftext|>
i bet they really care ! they must ! great job ! keep working hard ! ! ! im sure you ' ll become a great fitness loving person ! <|endoftext|>
i would have been that way too , and i know it can be disappointing to deal with . <|endoftext|>
oh you were happily married ? that ' s odd . did you ever get out and try some ? <|endoftext|>
oh yeah , i would be really mad at him too , what did you do about it ? <|endoftext|>
i can understand the envious . i would have been too . i also am too sad . <|endoftext|>
wow ! what was the share plan . was she planning to share it with anyone ? that seems very odd <|endoftext|>
how did it go ? sounds hard . did you study well ? did you have enough energy to figure it out on your own ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . i don ' t think i would be that smart . i know i would never be able to drive cars . <|endoftext|>
what do you mean ? are you a really interesting guy ? i hope so ! i like nice guys . <|endoftext|>

what ended up happening ? did everything turn out well for you ? ? what was the presentation about ? <|endoftext|>
oh , well i hope they can work it out . what was the technical difficulties ? i ' ve never done any kind of work outside of the field . <|endoftext|>
i think it should be done because it ' s a common greeting . it means something that people should be using more often . <|endoftext|>
for sure . i just don ' t get how you can do that . even getting your information stolen from you . <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! that is a huge career leap ! you must be so proud . are you nervous ? <|endoftext|>
yes i was accepted to harvard but it was 5 years before that and i ended up ending up in a second program . <|endoftext|>
that is terrible ! what was it that caused the storm ? i always get scared of thunder and lightning during storms . <|endoftext|>
i know you made a good impression on me ! thanks , i will do my best ! storms are scary . <|endoftext|>
yes , he was a awful person . he was an amazing person , but he died of old age . <|endoftext|>
i have dealt with it for a little over 2 years . the only time i ever got help was when i was going through a mental illness that i could not take to make it through without help . <|endoftext|>
that is bad . people should be more responsible . are you ok ? . . . i mean i don ' t feel like everyone is just doing it for the hell of it <|endoftext|>
thats great ! you deserve it , he is a star ! ! ! 1 ! ! <|endoftext|>

nice , what does your sister do for a living ? does she live far away ? is she in trouble ? <|endoftext|>
that does sound fun . my son just bought a dress . i was all gagging him and laughing so hard . <|endoftext|>
what did he do to it ? did you take it back ? ! or even call the police on him ? <|endoftext|>
yeah . i ' ll be glad when i can laugh about it later . it was the beginning of a long road between me and my mom . <|endoftext|>
yea i just enjoy reading sad stories . but the shows can give me a good idea of what happens on tv <|endoftext|>
i always have the same feeling . i guess you ' ll have to watch it more often . <|endoftext|>
i have never been ! i hope you have a great time ! ! ! i cant wait to go as well ! <|endoftext|>
i went to williamsburg . it was so much fun . so many people and great food . i feel really envious of myself . <|endoftext|>
yea but it seems like it hasn ' t happened to him yet . i ' m worried if i can help . <|endoftext|>
what a bad kid ! did you tell him you were jealous ? that would show him we are good friends . <|endoftext|>
how cute ! enjoy your day off at work ! : ) i think you ' ll be a great asset for the government ! <|endoftext|>
thats good . dogs are our friends after all . they are loyal until they run away . <|endoftext|>
well , you seem prepared for this situation , so i ' m happy . i hate infections . i hope you ' re able to find some medicine that you can continue to take home . <|endoftext|>
that is horrible . it is a terrible thing to have to replace a roof . it sounds like the storm have gotten bad enough that now you have to start all over . <|endoftext|>
wow that sucks , i hope the repairs are priceless . that will hurt so much . <|endoftext|>
oh , when did the wedding place open ? it sounds like it could be exciting , did you have a fun time ? <|endoftext|>
i hope they get a good retirement . i like to think of my grandma as my high school valedictorian . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s awesome . how long have you guys been living together ? are you looking forward to it ? <|endoftext|>
haha ! well that ' s cool , i don ' t think i would ever have my family in my life either . <|endoftext|>
that ' s nice . i ' m still pretty young , so i never really got into learning dance . <|endoftext|>
that is so awesome . i love stolen shows . i bet she is a good mom . lol <|endoftext|>
thank you . i just need a way to stay busy and keep my stress down . it was a rough day for sure <|endoftext|>
that was really nice of you ! where did you move to ? ? i moved in a similar situation with my father and i love to help but you were lucky to have him . <|endoftext|>
that is good that you were there to help him ! he sounds like an alright guy ! : ) <|endoftext|>
how do you think it will go ? are you ready ? also , i hope you get it - interview or no interview . you never know <|endoftext|>
no problem . it ' s hard to stay loyal to someone even if they give you great feedback . <|endoftext|>
oh no . . was it expired or something else ? lol i ' ve been there <|endoftext|>
lol . . did it smell like dirt ? that happens to me all the time . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! what store is it ? was it sold out ? did you find the owner ? <|endoftext|>
what did you think of a jewelry ? did you buy it yet ? i think it sounds cool . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome ! going to see her with your wife is probably even more special . i ' m sure she ' ll love to see you ! <|endoftext|>
sometimes you just have to have a day with your husband and let him spend the rest of the time with his fiancee . it isn ' t healthy for him to do that . but it is an alright gig for him . <|endoftext|>
good for them . that is very important to have . what did you do to help . . . <|endoftext|>
oh man , i just moved to amsterdam and i am already glad i did . it ' s a pretty big city and the people there are extremely nice . <|endoftext|>
that is good news . hopefully you will be okay ? you are lucky to have a great family <|endoftext|>
that is good . i had to recover from a injury . it is difficult to recover form a injury and recover form an injury . <|endoftext|>
oh i agree ! i feel the same way . it ' s frustrating when you try to say a good lie to solve the problem and someone else finds it true and then just walks away without any wilpower to admit it . it makes me feel like i can just be another human being that makes the world go less nice sometimes . <|endoftext|>
i ' m very happy for you . it ' s good you care about others . i hope you feel better soon . <|endoftext|>
oh man , that has to be so hard on you . is it a new roommate ? do you know him well ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad he ' s learned from his mistakes and learned to be more private . sounds like he ' ll learn for sure . <|endoftext|>
did they end up getting into any accidents ? people these days seem to think they are ok with cutting people off . <|endoftext|>
i agree 100% i don ' t care if your in a car or not but your in one . . . its fine if you are safe . <|endoftext|>
they will be in the better part of a week . just keep strong . : ) i am so sorry . <|endoftext|>
oh im so sorry , i have never been through something like that before ! i hope she recovers ! <|endoftext|>
do you have any interviews ready ? or just don ' t want to take the deal ? it ' s never good to feel like you never will , but if you feel you won ' t then maybe you shouldn ' t be feeling so bad ? <|endoftext|>
i guess you could try and meet with your friends and see what ' s up ! and , if you really like the job , get a bonus if you get the bonus ! <|endoftext|>
i bet , it is nice to have friends with so much younger things in life . just make sure you show them you are proud of her . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . i think it ' s a good idea to do what she is wanting to do and hope she decides to get it in the right areas . i know what i ' m going to do with my degree and will find it challenging to leave that degree behind and move on . <|endoftext|>
is this july you have prepared for or is there a different reason ? july is my favorite time of the year so i ' m really excited for it ! <|endoftext|>
yes , it is my first vacation . i needed that . what can you do in this life that you can ' t do that ? <|endoftext|>
i have never gotten in and it is only been a few weeks . why are you absolutely nuts ? <|endoftext|>
your family must have been very proud of you . good for you . we have all been there . <|endoftext|>
yeah i don ' t want to go anywhere the wrong way but i ' m still scared of getting caught . <|endoftext|>
i have never tried vegan food before , it ' s so easy and convenient . is it a lifestyle choice or a lifestyle that you choose for an incompruituve reason ? <|endoftext|>
i feel the same way about vegetarian . my parents both seem to be on a diet , but i am . they also decided to slowly transition when they turned 35 . i am 35 , and i am starting to feel like i have no time to do so when they ' ve been trying to get older . what ' s your favorite recipe ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i know how you feel . are you getting them themselves or taking them for the pain of the migraines ? <|endoftext|>
that is awful . i think it is good that you tried to do something to help her . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad to hear that ! is she better now ? it ' s always hard to recover from a drug addiction . <|endoftext|>
thats good . moms are the best sometimes ! ! ! helps clear your head ! ! <|endoftext|>
yeah every week or so . she moved away a couple years ago so it ' s been a bit while . but i still catch up on a lot of times . <|endoftext|>
wow , it must have been really cool . does it look like it ' ll go for long ? <|endoftext|>
i don ' t even know what that is ! tell me more ? ! ? ! haha <|endoftext|>
do you use a shoe or shoe cleaner ? i find that is more responsible with doggos <|endoftext|>
thanks , i ' m going to have to try on new shoes , at least i have something to prove my selfconfidence is strong enough ! <|endoftext|>
what an wonderful surprise , did you feel like working with her ? how did it feel being loved by her ? <|endoftext|>
sounds delicious . i love cheesecake . i ' m jealous . hope your future husband does too . <|endoftext|>
i love anything by a restaurant with good food . i feel so much better when i ' m home alone . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' ve been there before and it can be a rough journey . <|endoftext|>
it must be stressful for you . maybe you should find a hobby to keep you busy . <|endoftext|>
did you enjoy it ? were you able to go over ? did you have fun ? i bet that was a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
sounds delish ! i love seafood , i ' m very jealous . hope you had a great time . <|endoftext|>

nice ! that ' s awesome , where do you live ? ? ? my city has a really beautiful bike ride ! do you do it often ? <|endoftext|>
not really . i live in a smaller town and haven ' t been to many of them . <|endoftext|>
you can always talk to them and see if they ' re home for any reason . and get them to watch tv with you . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s far ! well i hope i can make this trip for her . she will be 18 and going to school in the state she is in . i ' m going to help her start her life in a different way . <|endoftext|>
where did you move ? when did you leave ? i assume you guys weren ' t in a foreign country ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m so happy for you ! enjoy your day on and pray for her ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
wow , what kind of car ? how do you feel about that ? how are you feeling about it ? <|endoftext|>
that is good . i am sure he will be happy with what he has . good luck to you ! <|endoftext|>
woow nice , do they ever drive you crazy after high school ? lol i bet you can relate haha <|endoftext|>
i do have one younger sibling . does that help ? lol . that would make my head spin lol <|endoftext|>
how did you two meet ? you must have been close . it must have brought a special smile to your face . <|endoftext|>
that is great to hear . how long have you been married ? and how close were you ? <|endoftext|>
oh yeah ! i moved from alabama for my highschool , too ! i miss home so much ! <|endoftext|>
i visit her every other month . last night i went on a long trip to visit her and she gave me the biggest hug ever . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you were successful . how did you react ? ? ? did you ever lose both your arms ? ? <|endoftext|>
i would never cheat either , no need to be commitment to a partner . good on you . <|endoftext|>
what play was it ? was it fun ? congrats you must be really proud of them ! <|endoftext|>
i suggest you go and watch the ace of spades . it will hopefully give you an idea of his life now and then . <|endoftext|>
did you end up getting around anyone ? or was everything fine just needed to get to where you were going ? <|endoftext|>
no problem . have a nice time ! ! ! keep it up ! ! lol ! ! <|endoftext|>
did you make it from scratch or online ? i ' ve never made a sauce before , so i don ' t know about buffalo wing sauce . <|endoftext|>
awesome , i am proud of you . you must have a very prepared dish . it is always good when you can do something nice ! <|endoftext|>
i am sure there is , just keep working hard and i am here waiting for it ! : ) <|endoftext|>
the power remains to you but as long as you keep pushing forward you will see success ! keep up the good work ! <|endoftext|>
good for you ! a baby is very exciting . are you having a boy ? did you two have a small family ? <|endoftext|>
i am sure you are so excited and want to have a child . good luck . my daughter was born without a father , so i can ' t judge you too much . <|endoftext|>
what kind of youtube was it ? some were really terrifying . i ' ve done that before . <|endoftext|>
i can . i get that feeling of excitement and worry just before going to sleep . you hit the nail on the head ! <|endoftext|>
oh , football season is next week for me . i have no idea how that will go ! i just watch it online anyway . <|endoftext|>
ah gotcha , nice catch ! i always forget those teams even have fans . it ' s like the best football team in the state of texas ! <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s pretty cool . where is the bmx ? i ' m pretty familiar with the name , but haven ' t used it in forever . <|endoftext|>
it definitely is . do you know if he landed on his back/ knees ? that ' s what it looks like <|endoftext|>
that ' s great , i hope everything is fine ! do you live far from your friend ? <|endoftext|>
i hope it will be a simple fix for you then ! we all need things that can be fixed but not many people know about so it ' s great you do . <|endoftext|>
that must have been a real bummer ! how did you do ? ! ! ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! well done . are you going to be a doctor ? i would try get an a or an a in education if possible . <|endoftext|>
oh wow i ' m so sorry ! i bet you are super devastated ! he must be heartbroken . <|endoftext|>
it really sucks , but sometimes people grow up , and they can ' t just stay single forever . i hope you find a friend you ' re happy with . <|endoftext|>
oh wow that is exciting ! how did you do it ? ? did you get lots of baby pictures or was it all a surprise <|endoftext|>
maybe you can see a future with your kid . i hope you see the bright side of the family . <|endoftext|>
oh i ' m glad you ' re ready . i bet it ' s hard on the east side of the city . <|endoftext|>
was kit helpful ? where did you come from ? was your home damaged ? what happened to your family ? <|endoftext|>
why did you steal the candy ? did you actually hurt someone ? did they get mad at you ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , i know how that feels . do you know how you made the decision , at least ? <|endoftext|>
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope they get some better soon . is he going to be okay ? <|endoftext|>
yeah it ' s hard to see people whine so much . it ' ll be good for him to be able to trust you and not take it personal . <|endoftext|>
oh , congratulations ! what made you do so ? did you write anything good ? and , did you go to college ? <|endoftext|>
yeah - but you ' re making it even easier to do your best . you have something to look forward to when the time comes . <|endoftext|>
what movie ? i bet it was super fun ! i ' ve never watched a movie before and thought it would be fun . <|endoftext|>
that sounds really fun ! sounds like you guys had a great time and i bet you were very surprised and happy ! <|endoftext|>
you were probably thinking about the interview afterwards . what happened next ? was it a good interview ? <|endoftext|>
well , maybe he just found you and is feeling more confident . but , i am happy to hear you got it . <|endoftext|>
yippies ! they think they are so safe to do anything but be very agressive . i bet it was a nice neighbor though . <|endoftext|>
i see , i hope she stops smoking soon . i hope you ' re able to tell her how to do her best . <|endoftext|>
i would have been embarrassed ! is it still broken ? i hope it isn ' t too bad <|endoftext|>
well , maybe you left and found your way back home . but if it was your boss , the mistake they made is their own . i would feel more trusting of them to be trustworthy about it . <|endoftext|>
wow ! congrats on that ! i know how hard it is to teach kids to use things that they shouldn ' t be using . i ' m sure he ' ll do great ! <|endoftext|>
hopefully he ' ll grow out of it . kids need to eat all the time . discipline will help him <|endoftext|>
did she go on a 2nd date with you ? ? ? haha . . how did it end ? <|endoftext|>
well , i ' m sure you were very happy . i ' ve never been to a zoo , i haven ' t been a zoo lover , and although i love to go to the zoo , and it would be fun to go occasionally , it ' s definitely not for me . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . have you spoken to you about this ? i hope everything is ok . <|endoftext|>
well , it ' s all a weight off of your shoulders so you have that to be there for when it comes to medical bills . i ' m sure he had a really great life though . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure you got there , what did you do afterwards ? what was your favorite part about retail ? <|endoftext|>
yes ! i think it was in the early 2000 ' s . my parents were very old . <|endoftext|>
why do you think it was fixed to that day ? is it your favorite day of the week ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , i get that for sure , they ' re pretty cheap nowadays . i ' d be tempted to change too , to see how much they pay . but with the way things are , they might as well be the cheap ones , since they ' d have to pay the bills anyway . <|endoftext|>
i know that feeling ! did she say something to you ? did you see her ? i know how that feels to me . <|endoftext|>
do you feel bad about it or good about moving on ? either way it seems he was a really good person and a champ for doing that . i hope it goes well for you . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! did you go home to make a story ? ! ? ! i think i would if i was you ! <|endoftext|>
oh man , you are making me wanna go listen to some now ! ha ha ha . good luck with that ! <|endoftext|>
how old is he now ? and how long does the first year take ? my daughter just started her senior year and feels like she ' s getting back in school <|endoftext|>
i know . . seems like yesterday he was just walking around , like a normal baby . he was like that little pup . <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! did anyone help you ? did you get hurt badly ? i hope everyone was there to help you . <|endoftext|>
thats good ! im glad you were ok . good friends are the best lol . im glad nothing bad happened lol <|endoftext|>
what a nice gesture ! what did you get them for it ? and how did it make them feel ? <|endoftext|>
oh well its their loss . you just don ' t know if you should risk it . don ' tk on a date though ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry . i have a sister who is in the military . she has been with me through my loss , too . i hope she isn ' t feeling too lonely . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry . i ' ve always found my parents to be more burden than mine . they ' re the ones that take me there most . but they do have to have that burden . <|endoftext|>
yeah i agree , i think it means a lot to me . my current job is not good at all and i ' m grateful for it . <|endoftext|>
i know , i was really happy to go back into my old school of being a kid again . <|endoftext|>
that is a good reason to be grateful ! life is so short and nobody is always there for you anyway . <|endoftext|>
these women are so beautiful ! i would be so much happier if they were my sons . what does detect sickness have to do with setting up shelters ? <|endoftext|>
oh no that sucks . what will you do now ? is it still working ? ? ? : ) <|endoftext|>
but you were able to finish . i hope you got a good prize . i can never win those things <|endoftext|>
oh wow , that sounds like a great surprise . what part of town did you end up in ? <|endoftext|>
wow , happy birthday ! what do you do to enjoy your own time ? are you excited for any upcoming plans ? <|endoftext|>
oh , wow ! i am sorry to hear that , did they move away ? you should visit them sometime ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . they seem very confident in their ability . i am sure you will have a great time with your son . <|endoftext|>
what show is it ? i ' d have been upset as well . the network wouldn ' t show it . <|endoftext|>
which one is your favorite ? i love impractical jokers . have you seen any new episodes ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s a nice way to both teach and show how to be better . good for you . <|endoftext|>
sounds like they are trustworthy then . i hope it all works out for the best ! <|endoftext|>
i wish i didn ' t have to fly ! flying is not fun . where are you headed for vacation ? <|endoftext|>
i thought about that when i was travelling somewhere . they do tend to be longer than normal times , do you usually leave a long flight ? <|endoftext|>
did you feel like you had to bail on her ? or was it something else ? was your dad upset about it ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . that kind of behavior is normal for people to do . glad you ' re getting some peace of mind . <|endoftext|>
it is a good day to be thankful . i ' m glad your day went well ! ! <|endoftext|>
lol , i love that book , can you tell me what exactly it means ? what makes it so rare ? <|endoftext|>
yeah i know , i was up really wishing for a bit of sun , but alas . . . well it was a relaxing weekend for sure . <|endoftext|>
that is so exciting . you will be happy to have that in your marriage , i am sure ! <|endoftext|>
wow , i can imagine that is tough work . does he have a family of his own to help him ? <|endoftext|>
did you confront him about it ? or did he just claim to be a friend with you ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible . sometimes people have a hard time dealing with others . it sounds like you guys seem happy they were able to manage it . <|endoftext|>
that ' s neat . what sort of talented ? what has she done lately ? it ' s great to have a niece that you ' re so lucky to have as well ! <|endoftext|>
wow . that ' s incredible . i hope she enjoys it . you must be proud ! : ) <|endoftext|>
that must have been so nostalgic for her . what did you do after ? how old is the kid now ? <|endoftext|>
that was kind of you , and an honest move on your part , but i bet his dad can see that as a huge deal to him , at least as far as you knew <|endoftext|>
oh , that must be so hard . what ' s wrong with his job ? why do you feel that way ? <|endoftext|>
that does suck . my sister is also working hours at a store that does not match up with her schedule . <|endoftext|>
does he get it in the following months ? that would make me so happy ! how much can you get ? <|endoftext|>
that is right ! lol but seriously , as long as you are happy with your current situation keep it up . you will get there one day ! <|endoftext|>
i actually saw one with some gore and was super disgusted , i have seen a lot of movies with that though <|endoftext|>
wow that is intense . it is really sad . i would have been traumatized . <|endoftext|>
ah that would be so disappointing , i am sure it is a relief to get it back though , did you ask him why he didn ' t get it ? <|endoftext|>
maybe you should give him some more ? but that ' s just me . . . it ' s all up to you ! <|endoftext|>
aw that ' s rough . perhaps you should get a wife and get yourself a hobby to distract you . <|endoftext|>
i hope it is a long and happy life for your kids . home life is always a pain . <|endoftext|>
what a wonderful experience for you . it ' s nice to have a little peace and quiet once they start school . <|endoftext|>
i can ' t believe i am older . i feel like we went back to normal in our lives . <|endoftext|>
oh shoot , i would have been screaming . did you tell your friend ? where were you at ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . i am glad it was gone ! i ' m glad you found it . <|endoftext|>
oh my god i am so sorry . i know how hard you must have been . treasure this moment while it lasts . <|endoftext|>
oh my god that is terrible . i am very sorry for your loss . are you going to be in therapy or working ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s always good . what kind of firm was it ? and how did it go ? <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh ! how did that happen ? is there anyone else ? ? ? i can ' t imagine getting so upset over that . <|endoftext|>
just say it was a joke and let them know it was and if it is true you should be let them see it . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really cool . did you have a good time there ? the water is so much fun ! <|endoftext|>
i love the beach . the people there are so friendly . it ' s fun . have you ever been to one ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! ! that is so messed up and frustrating ! what did you do about it ? <|endoftext|>
that really sucks . i would just try and be a better person and hope they don ' t come around . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a lot of fun . were you really inspired ? how was the show ? and how was it taking place ? <|endoftext|>
i have never heard of him , but i will check him out . what was the show about ? <|endoftext|>
thats a bummer . what happened next ? or was it an unexpected thing ? either way , i ' d say thats one of the most worst things to throw up in . . unless you ' re really bad and need to go to the doctor <|endoftext|>
well , you gave yourself a nice juicy sandwich ! i would have loved it if someone helped you , too ! <|endoftext|>
wow , where are they going ? are you nervous ? are they your parents ? ? i hope you are well prepared so you can do it confidently <|endoftext|>
you could always ask the manager to tell you how you are doing ! maybe that is a way to prepare them ! <|endoftext|>
i feel sorry for your feelings , it is very impotrant . have you talked to her about it ? <|endoftext|>
i understand . maybe you can put another girl over there and have a talk with her . if she is still in communication , that might help you feel a bit better . <|endoftext|>
that sounds so scary ! is she alright ? is she feeling any better now ? have you guys gone ? <|endoftext|>
you are lucky to have had so many people support you . you sound very lucky . maybe yall can have a baby together . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s amazing ! how long have you two been together ? what a big wedding ! <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh ! what a great story . i guess he didn ' t know he had one more knee to the rescue . <|endoftext|>
yes bosses can be good for standing up for ourselves . good for you ! maybe he can help you change your ways <|endoftext|>
thats really good , so you like him too ? what ' s his name ? i ' ll keep my fingers crossed he doesn ' t crash your building . <|endoftext|>
i do not know why , but fire flies are gross and i never want to see them again ! <|endoftext|>
do you ever get them out ? im sure if you put a little butter in the jar it will make them disappear <|endoftext|>
i know that feeling . i think it ' s related to sleep schedule . do you have to be up that early in the morning to feel energized ? <|endoftext|>
same here . i was miserable the entire time . i need to sleep at least 8 more hours ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! you must be excited ! good luck on the house buy ! is it close ? ! <|endoftext|>
wow . is it in the process of selling or just for the sake of saving some money ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds really fun ! are you planning to go out soon ? is it something you two are planning on doing ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i ' m really sorry to hear that . i hope she will find a happy healthy home soon . <|endoftext|>
ah , well i can understand why that might make you feel that way ! maybe they should pay you more attention to do things that you like too . <|endoftext|>
that would take a lot of time . i would be mad too . . . i can ' t think of many kids that would enjoy that . <|endoftext|>
what kind of drawing did she do ? that ' s really cute . what kind was it ? <|endoftext|>
stick figures are pretty awesome too , unless your a guy like me , you know ? i just don ' t like fancy toys . <|endoftext|>
thats very interesting ! what kind of math was it ? did they finish it ? lol <|endoftext|>
thats what we called playing video games in the college my junior year of high school . its a big deal there for the kids but not worth the drama at all , you did your part ! <|endoftext|>
wow that is super lucky ! i hope it goes well ! open up your eyes is always a great gamble . <|endoftext|>
yeah it ' s different for me , i don ' t like having to rush and feel like i have to pick a side when it comes to getting out of a job . <|endoftext|>
oh yeah ? any good ones ? / i ' ve been through that too . brings back a lot of good old memories . <|endoftext|>
thats very sweet . thats such a sweet memory . memories are great . i miss when my parents did that <|endoftext|>
why did he leave ? did he do something wrong ? ? ? did you ever make it back . <|endoftext|>
you ' re lucky . that ' s usually how it goes ! a guy never knows you ' ve been sick , and he just wants to impress other men . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s fantastic ! what is the job for ? do you have a prepared set of ready to go options ? <|endoftext|>
good , you must really anticipate this job . i bet that is super exciting . keep your head up . <|endoftext|>
how nice , did you have some ? and what was it made of ? lol ! a bit funny to read that while driving . . <|endoftext|>
eww . what a disappointment ! you are making me envy myself . i bet that would be a good prize for being so pous ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s a shame , hope you ' re doing better now ! ! ! : ( where did she leave you ? <|endoftext|>
that is so awesome ! i wish i had been engaged too ! did you two live at least a good life together ? <|endoftext|>
sorry about that . are you still there ? ? how was it ? ? ? celebrating your birthday is the biggest part ! <|endoftext|>
yeah exactly . people tend to think they have more weight in their hands than they do . there ' s a lot of difference . <|endoftext|>
thats great . it must be relieving to be so hopeful . keep up the good work <|endoftext|>
sounds like a pretty interesting job . you should get the position one day . you ' ll feel appreciated ! <|endoftext|>
what did you do ? ! ? ! ! ? i would have been terrified . did you get burned ? <|endoftext|>
omg that is so scary ! ! ! i hate bug digging out ! what did you do ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! was he okay ? how did he feel about that ? are you still alive ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool how long did it take ? ! i ' m proud of you for achievement like that ! <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds horrible ! how did that feel ? was anyone there ? did you have a nice time ? <|endoftext|>
well that ' s good . i ' m sure it was an easy test ! haha ! <|endoftext|>
was she older ? were they yours ? do you feel bad about it ? have you come up with one yet ? <|endoftext|>
i get it , you have to be happy about them . i hope they realize there isn ' t one above them now <|endoftext|>
that ' s good to hear ! how did you meet each other ? were you married for a long time ? <|endoftext|>
i would think that would be awkward . what did they say about meeting at the store ? is it a long distance relationship ? <|endoftext|>
oh i ' m sorry to hear that , did you confront her ? i ' ve been in that situation before and know it really sucks . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . hopefully it works out . did you guys end up able to talk through it ? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome . where will you be selling it ? is it a big size ? will you have a lot of space . <|endoftext|>
it ' s always exciting when home renovations take so long . are the renovations going to be cheap ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s exciting . how much did you pay for it ? what kind of car ? are you getting a free ride ? <|endoftext|>
awesome . what color is your car ? mine is black . lol its so childish . i wish i could see yours . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like something new from your pet . did it scare you ? ! ? did it jolt you awake ? <|endoftext|>
omg ! ! that is so scary and i ' m so glad it didn ' t do anything bad . i can ' t imagine falling out of bed . <|endoftext|>
oh i know what you mean . i love the fall and the sunshine but the sun is always shining so it makes the time that much better . <|endoftext|>
i used to love going fishing with some friends . we would all collect candies and be around our grandparents when they got home . <|endoftext|>
that sounds great ! is it a big step ? do you have to spell it out for you ? <|endoftext|>
well , you can ' t help it , but you can help yourself too . you can make some good new friends . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really nice ! how old is she ? that takes a lot of practice . . . <|endoftext|>
lol , she will be 13 soon ! ! ! hah . . best of luck ! <|endoftext|>
you could always fly her to new york to start a little easier . i ' ve done that before . <|endoftext|>
yea i know what you mean . i recently passed away due to lung cancer and i lost him over a year ago . just stay positive and always keep your head up , you ' ll get through it . <|endoftext|>
that is very unfortunate . do you have plans for the end of the world ? : ) ? <|endoftext|>
i am sure that you will be able to talk to him again . that is a great feeling . <|endoftext|>
that is really exciting ! where is she going ? ? ? is she excited ? ? are you going out for vacation ? <|endoftext|>
its always rough when a loved one dies . the best thing you can do is get a second opinion . <|endoftext|>
yes i agree with you there . i thought i was going to die ! what kind of scary movie was it ? <|endoftext|>
oh yeah those are creepy . do you know what kind of pop up you were thinking about ? <|endoftext|>
awesome . where to ? where are you going ? where will you be going ? vacation is always the first thing to do . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome ! i have never been on a cruise before ! ! ! have you gone on one before ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! what country is she coming back from ? when is she back ? and what country ? <|endoftext|>
how long did it take to take you ? did you take you dog by the way ? i know german , and also heard great things about italy ! <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds great . are you going to eat ? will you be ok ? ? ? . <|endoftext|>
i love food ! what kind are you getting ? what ' s your favorite ? i love cheesecake ! <|endoftext|>
i can understand ! when i was young we used to watch those with our cousins and they would scare us quite a bit ! <|endoftext|>
i have never heard of a scream . you better get out of there . i really hope you ' re okay . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , you should take them up with her ! that ' s really sweet of you ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s so sweet . i ' m glad it worked out that way for you ! i may need to find a replacement for myself soon . <|endoftext|>
oh man ! i hate that feeling too , it can really hurt , and it also leave you so unmotivated to do anything , too . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! how did you handle it ? maybe you should do some haunted house stuff or something . <|endoftext|>
why is that ? why do you say that ? is something wrong ? what was wrong ? do tell <|endoftext|>
did she buy you a new car ? that can sometimes be a challenge in those situations . i bet you will do great ! <|endoftext|>
uh oh . is the car okay ? how old is your son ? how is your car doing ? <|endoftext|>
that is good . my car gets a lot of flak but it has been worth it in the end . <|endoftext|>
it will be fine , be prepared for other challenges . you will do great . have you applied somewhere special ? <|endoftext|>
try to relax ! nothing to worry about ! it is always better to wait and see ! ! <|endoftext|>
aw , i bet . what happened ? did everything turn out alright ? did you find any trouble ? <|endoftext|>
thats great that your friend had a good friend ! im sure it will go better for you in the future <|endoftext|>
wow , she must be a bit confused . have you two been to the country you ' re with her for more than two months ? <|endoftext|>
i know , i still can ' t stop playing , it ' s just hard when you are the only one home . i just felt so alone without them <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i bet you are sad . . when does she come back ? ! i ' m so sorry <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad to hear it . i wish i did more stuff with my free time . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s so gross . did you have bad winter weather for the past couple of days ? <|endoftext|>
i get that , it does feel pretty miserable on an everyday basis . but i ' d just look into seattle or something if you don ' t already ! it ' s a pretty big part of the city and it ' ll be much better for people who don ' t live there yet . <|endoftext|>
why did they do that ? what did you do ? were they even trying ? ! ? ! <|endoftext|>
what kind of help ? i don ' t get this whole need for help with animals thing . . . <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never seen it - what was it about ? i ' m not into horror at all , but i like some horror . <|endoftext|>
sounds pretty fun , i might have to check it out ! ! ! lol ! thanks for the heads up ! <|endoftext|>
i know ! it ' s like no wonder she ' s the only one that works and can afford that . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good , it ' s always good to have people you can share your experience with <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful . did you go home and pick it up ? or did you stay and wait for it to come back ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful , so sorry . what i know for sure is that they took the car and put it up for adoption . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great , i haven ' t decided on a name yet , i ' m still working it out . <|endoftext|>
that is good . i ' m glad you have people to lean on during the day . at least you did that . <|endoftext|>
i would feel the same way . i never got over my fear of dogs . glad you found it ! <|endoftext|>
did they move permanently to california ? i ' m sorry for the way you were feeling , but california is beautiful ! <|endoftext|>
i am sure you will when you get there ! it would be great if i lived there ! <|endoftext|>
wow , that is extremely awkward . did you manage to go ? and how did it go for the wedding ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , i would probably be stressed myself . i can understand why they would feel that way though . <|endoftext|>
yeah , you need to get your act together to help the customer . hopefully , they ' re more understanding now that you ' re in the company of customer service . <|endoftext|>
i wish everyone was as lucky as you are ! maybe i will see you there ! ! lol <|endoftext|>
i ' ve always wanted to go on a vacation , where do you want to go ? i can imagine , being on one month just isn ' t right . <|endoftext|>
it was in south carolina , with some friends . i really don ' t like roller sters but i feel like they ' re a real downgrade once i get home . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that ! did you try to fix it ? i hope you ' re ok . <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh , i am terrified of that stuff . i had that happen to me and my neighbor once and it really freaked me out . <|endoftext|>
oh , no ! that ' s terrible . what did your friend do ? are you going to try and get it back ? <|endoftext|>
wow ! that ' s great ! so , he did not have to pay you anything , right ? <|endoftext|>
sometimes i tend to procrastinate also . maybe you need to prostate your procrasting a bit more . <|endoftext|>
you will be fine ! you should go out for dinner , take some nice glass of water and some laundry ! <|endoftext|>
it is nice that you have a partner like that . you are a lucky person ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
did she enjoy that ? surprised , amirite ? ! ? ! ! ? a surprise for sure . <|endoftext|>
that sounds great . i hope to do something like that one day . i love going out on the beach , i miss getting to spend time with my family . <|endoftext|>
why do you feel bad about it ? everyone gets left out there sometimes , you don ' t have to feel guilty about it . <|endoftext|>
well , i am sure she will understand . everybody makes mistakes and sometimes it is easy to forget about those few moments . <|endoftext|>
i can imagine ! i don ' t like horror films at all . what did you watch ? <|endoftext|>
yea he really scream , but it sounded bad , sorry . what ' s scream ? heard of scream ? <|endoftext|>
there ' s nothing to worry about , baby is good . you can also start slowly trying again as well ! <|endoftext|>
that is really awesome i ' m sure you will be good luck and have a great rest of your life : ) <|endoftext|>
really ? that ' s really nice of your mom . i hope she comes your way ! was it a good book ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it will be great for you and your family though . good luck and be confident in your skills . <|endoftext|>
yes , i totally agree . you ' re right , many don ' t . they can be very inconsiderate in my experience . <|endoftext|>
thanks for the condolences . maybe i ' ll just have to keep a good relationship with mine as long as possible . <|endoftext|>
i believe in little kids , even the oldest . how old is he ? do you know anyone with him ? <|endoftext|>
oh lord that is very stressful , just talk with him i am sure he will understand it is an exotic names for a reason <|endoftext|>
did she get you one ? i ' m always nervous about the surprise party part . . . <|endoftext|>
wow . that is a lot of memories . i hope you get a lot more from that friend . <|endoftext|>
how so ? what happened ? ! : ) ! i hope everything is ok : ) how did things go ? <|endoftext|>
you truly are a lucky human being . i would probably be too lol . i love my wife so much . <|endoftext|>
oh man i can imagine . i hate bugs too ! i have a phobia of butterflies . <|endoftext|>
haha they grow up so fast . i ' m thinking of the time when my kids played rock climbing for like 20 minutes on the couch . it was epic . <|endoftext|>
oh well next time , go right haha . it ' s only a friend lol . <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible , what happened ? did you go on time ? i hope it wasn ' t too hard on your boss . <|endoftext|>
i think that is normal for moms these days , but you must be close . why did you miss her ? <|endoftext|>
i hope she learns to speak spanish soon ! it is a wonderful skill to have ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
nice ! which movie you going to see ? hopefully it ' s not evil evil 1 . lol . <|endoftext|>
i have never seen it . i cannot wait either . there has to be a good one . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really good of you to do that . it ' s so nice to see people supporting each other . <|endoftext|>
the quirky clusterbags that your parents put on your car . it gives you a gift that makes you believe when you drive to it that it is in the bag . <|endoftext|>
wow that must have been quite an idea for the wedding ! did you have fun ? ? ! <|endoftext|>
oh awesome . i love etsy ! my favorite brand is google . . . i got my tattoo from there and its beautiful <|endoftext|>
you must have gotten really lucky ! i am sure it was cheaper than driving right . do you plan to take the kids ? <|endoftext|>
i would have loved to see a country too . it sounds like you are going places i ' m not interested in . <|endoftext|>
i think that is the plus side , it can get a bit quiet without it . i guess i will only be staying home with her when i get home from work . <|endoftext|>
oh i do not blame you . i never look out my window . always try to focus on what i am looking at . <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds exciting . have you looked in to buying a down payment ? that ' s always a good thing . <|endoftext|>
i wish you all the luck ! make sure to enjoy yourself while you ' re at it ! <|endoftext|>
congratulations on graduating ! when is the first year ? mine just started . . . still waiting on the grade x . <|endoftext|>
i ' d be too . if he ' s doing well , he should be proud ! what kind of bike is it ? <|endoftext|>
woow ! that ' s awesome ! how much did you lose ? weight loss can be hard on the body . <|endoftext|>
yes , if only we could go swim . too bad we can ' t . perhaps i will go again next summer . <|endoftext|>
i think there ' s a good chance that you will enjoy your peace when you hit 67 . <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that . did you have a bachelor party planned for the end of the day ? <|endoftext|>
oh that is an awesome memory . what did you think of it ? it is one of my favorite songs . <|endoftext|>
i can understand that ! i tend to feel nostalgic as well when thinking about the past . <|endoftext|>
i understand , i was an parent and know the feeling . you ' ll grow up to be great ! <|endoftext|>
stay away from giddy items because they can ruin the night ' s night . i use the bathroom cleaner but thats it . <|endoftext|>
what happened next ? ! ? ! ! ? was it a ghost ? ! that would scare me to death ! <|endoftext|>
we ' ve all been in that situation before . i had it happen to me when i used to sleep . <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean , it really frustrates me . what did you try to stream ? <|endoftext|>
hmmmm , sounds like your enjoying the app more than the showerd i think it is better when you can search however you want <|endoftext|>
she sounds like a talented child . thank goodness she was able to graduate so early . her parents must be very proud <|endoftext|>
that is good i am happy for her . do you plan to go to her birthday ? ? <|endoftext|>
why are you nervous ? is she going to say no ? if you are really good friends with her , you should do it . <|endoftext|>
oh yeah i see . that would be rough . if it all goes well , i think you can probably do it again . <|endoftext|>
no - why did you want to try bison meet ? i ' m not familiar with the book . <|endoftext|>
bison is the word i remember , and is the steaks . unfortunately i have no idea what the different words mean . <|endoftext|>
yeah , but he got some new tires ! lol . . . but that was a funny thing to say , huh ? <|endoftext|>
well maybe you can find a new roommate . no sense crying over stupid stuff . : ) i think if you are not happy with your current roommate , move out . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like such a lonely week ! do you have any activities planned ? i know i ' ve been missing mine . . <|endoftext|>
oh . maybe he will if he wants to . i ' m sure that he won ' t miss it though . <|endoftext|>
omg . was it still there ? ! i ' d have been so annoyed . did anyone come with you ? <|endoftext|>
well hang in there , it happens . at least you found something to do with them ! haha <|endoftext|>
why is he away ? do you not want to do anything to him ? ? ? . . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that but i hope he ' ll be visiting you in the near future . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . she will have a lot of great people watching her . <|endoftext|>
that is really bad . but she will be okay . im sure she will recover easily . sounds like you are still very young . <|endoftext|>
oh yea ? what sort of issues are they causing ? cat issues are usually bad in general . <|endoftext|>
oh shoot i bet that scared you to death ! lol what are you planning to do with it ? <|endoftext|>
wow , you must be sick . what makes you so afraid ? do you have a job now ? <|endoftext|>
i ' ll probably never do it again because they are worthless . you deserve it more than me . <|endoftext|>
it ' s always nice to have someone with you who can watch a good movie , sounds like you know what to do when you can ' t go <|endoftext|>
i ' ll add it to my to watched list ! i ' m sure it ' ll be a good watch ! thanks ! <|endoftext|>
yikes , i hope you didn ' t have to use your vacation time at least ! it ' s just not worth taking a chance and taking the risk . <|endoftext|>
yeah , there ' s a lot of people that don ' t know how to handle situations like that . i hope you feel better , and maybe feel a little better about the situation from there . <|endoftext|>
oh no , that must have been stressful ! did she have a lot of fun ? i bet that would be fun ! <|endoftext|>
i am sorry for what you went through . i hope you find a fix . and no more flashlights or electronics for you . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great to hear . do you enjoy your home ? where did you move ? ? <|endoftext|>
well good luck ! i ' m sure it ' s gonna be a blast ! ! ! what ' s the happiest thing that has ever happened to your family ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s sad , you want to get another one ? i hope you got lots of pets . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that ! my little fur baby has been stressed out about his old shots and its been pretty scary . <|endoftext|>
i see that a lot too ! i am glad that we have people like that in this world <|endoftext|>
thats awesome . i do that too . i give a small pot of money to charities that have no family or buildings . <|endoftext|>
what did he do ? sounds like something for you to be excited about ! ! ! how did he shock you ? <|endoftext|>
well , you never know what could happen , did you ? are you alright ? i am so scared of crazy people . <|endoftext|>
yea , that would make me broke up with mine . it ' s not fair ! what ' s the point of being with someone who is only loyal to one person <|endoftext|>
i would want to but i don ' t think i ' ll ever be able to do it . <|endoftext|>
that would be scary , especially when the moon is super bright . you are lucky it was in the area that you were planning to see the stars in though <|endoftext|>
it ' s like a storm outside here . i ' m hoping for a miracle and rain come now ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! i ' ve been in the same place with my wife for a very long time . i love my new baby , but i can ' t imagine the life of a new baby . <|endoftext|>
it doesn ' t even take just the baby . do you take the baby to the doctor , or do they get you a new baby the next day ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s so nice . your mom sounds amazing . what ' s your favorite exhibit ? : ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s for sure . my mom lives with my grandpa so when she ' s gone , i have always seen him in my room . <|endoftext|>
oh , why is that ? going to the grocery store ? or are you going to go on a trip ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s true , i try to remind myself that sometimes life is in progress and that there are people who still do things and have life changing things for us . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome , i go on a few vacations in december . do you live right next to there ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s a lot of money to spend , and you can always go and check it out yourself . i wouldn ' t let your fear stop you , though . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! sometimes it ' s hard to get into those classes where they can get in really high shape . <|endoftext|>
work hard and you will do great . keep it up ! ! ! you never know when someone may be born into an era of poverty and poverty that is beyond reproactive . keep up the good work ! <|endoftext|>
i bet they are . you must be proud . do you wish to have them on your side one day ? <|endoftext|>
haha ! oh wow ! they sound like very sweet kids . good for you for getting them over with . <|endoftext|>
extra hours ? i ' m not sure i even understand , what does that mean ? extra time for what ? <|endoftext|>
thats great ! ! make sure to get his clothes on time ! he might be thinking that it might be a good idea to get the boys dressed so early too ! ! : ) <|endoftext|>
oh man , that ' s awful . i ' m sorry to hear that . are you thinking about getting a part time job ? <|endoftext|>
hopefully soon ! that sounds promising . good luck ! : ) what is your field ? i ' m in the uk , and i ' ve got lots of good news ! stay on the road and keep trying ! <|endoftext|>
you must be so excited . what will it be ? that is always a hard position . . . <|endoftext|>
of course i have . i ' m a therapist , so i ' ve been trying to get into one of those work out of the house locations i work in . <|endoftext|>
why is that ? do you like her a lot ? is she close with you ? how does that make you feel ? <|endoftext|>
you should treat them the way you want to be treated . treat them like people . be confident and show them you are a man . <|endoftext|>
it sounds like that cousin was excited to come and visit you too ! was it your cousin or someone else ? <|endoftext|>
yes ! he is so lucky to be you in such a nice way ! ! ! and i ' m sure you are as well . <|endoftext|>
are you going to replace it ? maybe with food ? i would try that ! have you tried checking to see if there is any warranty with the pottery ? <|endoftext|>
i used to drink coffee a ton when i was younger as well . i think you ' ll be fine . <|endoftext|>
well , that should be worth it . i hope it goes well . are you moving for a job and not just a hobby ? <|endoftext|>
great ! i ' m happy to hear that . what subject is it ? college ? university umber ? <|endoftext|>
that is so sad ! has it affected her greatly ? is she still on the bus ? if so , that is one of my biggest pet peeves ! <|endoftext|>
i bet you were a great parent to your son . i ' m sorry your friend took the time to think that into his actions . <|endoftext|>
wow , that is a serious disease ! i ' m very sorry ! what is the treatable it ? <|endoftext|>
well i ' m sorry to hear that , it ' s sad when something so important dies suddenly . <|endoftext|>
oh that is annoying , i would be so scared ! are you ever home ? ? ? you might have heard it outside ! <|endoftext|>
did you give the hint after you saw them again ? did you tell them how mad you were about it ? <|endoftext|>
sounds like a plan ! i like to stay dedicated to my test day because it ' s the only day i ' m really prepared for . <|endoftext|>
i know . but i am sure i will be fine . im just a very good studying sedner . <|endoftext|>
oh , i bet that brings back memories ! what did you find ? that must ' ve brought back good memories . <|endoftext|>
that ' s very cool and nostalgic . i ' m glad you can relive those moments . that always makes me a bit sad . <|endoftext|>
aw ! that is so sweet and unexpected . how long have you been together ? ? and how old was he ? <|endoftext|>
dang that ' s a sight to see ! i bet he worked hard on that ! did you tell him anything about it ? <|endoftext|>
sounds sirens should be on for you ! ! do you live in a place where it is common to hear them ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great it missed you . hope you don ' t get much road damage . . - ) <|endoftext|>
aw , i bet ! is she a puppy or an intruder ? what breed is she ? : ) <|endoftext|>
is she a young dog or old ? i have a little husky and she ' s the same name as my neighbor ' s doggie , who is just an ounce older . <|endoftext|>
cool i have a pit myself , i love pitbulls they can be tough but i love their loyalty and loyal nature . what ' s her name ? <|endoftext|>
that is a real bummer ! did you call the cops ? that would be terrible ! ! <|endoftext|>
probably should have put a note saying that the person who stole it got really into trouble . that ' s really what i would do . i ' m sorry about your car , but can ' t you do anything about it ? <|endoftext|>
that is a large enough card that is hard to replace . i know this because i am a lightning damage fan . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i get a little scared too . i ' m glad you seem to be alright though . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! i bet you ' ll get in . what are you majoring in ? <|endoftext|>
it is . and then you can forget all about it . it will make you really reflect . <|endoftext|>
was it the lights out in there ? did you grow any trees ? maybe some led to that . <|endoftext|>

i ' m sorry , that sounds frustrating . what kind of place did you go ? were they apologizing ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s understandable . i would have been furious if i was in your shoes . i love restaurants that last long , it ' s best to stay loyal to them . <|endoftext|>
that must be quite quite . is it going well ? are you excited ? ! ? ! how is it taking you ? <|endoftext|>
i know right , it would have been nice to do something . i guess i need to find a better place to work . <|endoftext|>
it ' s pretty amazing how fast things move around us . it ' ll take awhile to get used to the new surroundings around us , but when you see him growing it ' d be even more amazed at . <|endoftext|>
i feel the same way about my husband he never lives too close to me so its safe to assume we don ' t see each other too often . <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that . how are you doing now ? any other option ? i hope you are feeling better . <|endoftext|>
aww . . i don ' t blame you . i ' ve dealt with sickness too . were you able to find a cure ? <|endoftext|>

that ' s actually really funny . yeah , you just don ' t notice until you wake up <|endoftext|>
oh no . . . i hope you weren ' t hurt ! that would inconvenient ! are you alright though ? <|endoftext|>
true , i once ate ice cream while driving and it was traumatizing for me . <|endoftext|>
tornadoes are scary , i wouldn ' t take anything for granted . are you sure it ' s not a stronger one ? <|endoftext|>
yes you do ! i hate it ! i keep remembering when it rains and it ' s the worst <|endoftext|>
that is awesome ! is this your first parent ? are you a parent now ? - ) <|endoftext|>
yeah i can ' t imagine how amazing that must have felt seeing a child do that . how did you find out the last time you saw her ? <|endoftext|>
it has to be frustrating when someone loves so much and is so insecure . have you talked to him about it ? <|endoftext|>
that is so sad that you have to deal with that . i hope that you can find peace . <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness , what happened ? was there something that happened to you that made you think this ? <|endoftext|>

i ' m sorry you have to go through that . is everything ok now ? i hope you ' re okay ! <|endoftext|>
did you end up doing anything scary with the movies alone ? i ' ve done that . but not in a good way . lol <|endoftext|>
i can understand that . . . did you ever lose your job ? i have and have been in that situation and it ' s different . . <|endoftext|>
that is so awesome . i am sure that you are two very lucky guys ! is there any downside to the travel ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . it ' s important that you both work for your own cause . hopefully it works out well . <|endoftext|>
i am too , what did they do ? that would be awesome . . . i hope that he is too <|endoftext|>
i understand . there are many families that take care of each other . it is hard , but it will happen . <|endoftext|>
very true ! i need to start doing that as well . good for you ! ! i wish i could . <|endoftext|>
it ' s really nice to feel at home like that . i feel like i am an adult , no longer the responsibility of working at mcdonalds . <|endoftext|>
that is great to hear ! i ' m so happy for you . do you cheat on her ? <|endoftext|>
i hope you have a happy marriage ! how did it make you feel ? : ) i hope it was a lot of fun . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s awesome . did you buy anything special with the winnings ? or was it more of a cash in the bank kind of thing ? <|endoftext|>
what game did you pick ? i was hoping you won . . . congrats ! ! <|endoftext|>
she is terrible . why she did not give you a penny ? are you alright ? did you need anything specific ? <|endoftext|>
i agree that seems unprofessional . have you tried talking to the supervisor ? maybe she has something to do with it ? <|endoftext|>
well that sounds disappointing . was it a good time then ? is it now over ? ! ? ! <|endoftext|>
i can understand that ! i have never been able to deal with the heat in south texas . it ' s awful . <|endoftext|>
congratulations . is this a promotion for you ? i think many people would like this . i have gotten pretty grumpy around the holidays so you should try and keep at it . <|endoftext|>
how long have you been working there ? i have a boss who is very positive . i hate that there is only one job at a time . <|endoftext|>
oh no . are you hurt ? is your name chad ? that sounds like a funny name . <|endoftext|>
did they pay you for the job ? was it just a free pass or was someone else pay you ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty tough . how long have you guys been together ? did you have a talk ? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry that happened to you . i have a friend who is in her late 40s and i feel you . <|endoftext|>
wow . . . that can be nerve racking . you ' re going to have to prepare well for this . have you tried packing ? <|endoftext|>
that is amazing , anchorage is difficult , what ' s the percentage of people who have actually been there who have been through a transition ? <|endoftext|>
i am married too . what happened ? ? ? i hope they ' re not nice women . <|endoftext|>
just leave it . do not waste his time if he is a jerk . he is better alone <|endoftext|>
i understand ! i like the original trilogy as well , but my brother is a bit of a enlight" and is saying that we should try to watch the old ones in their own right now . <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool . i wish i had friends like you . mine is too , but i don ' t think i know anyone but i sit in a room the whole time . <|endoftext|>
i bet . why don ' t you talk to your partner about it ? it will teach him not to do it in front of others . <|endoftext|>
i understand . i can hold my dog if it is under a brand new bottle of water . <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh ! that ' s an amazing gift ! you must be a super happy man , will you be getting married ? <|endoftext|>
hey it ' s not a knock on you ! i ' ve been married over a year and i still have a couple of mischievous creeps in my family ! i am truly blessed ! <|endoftext|>
it makes me so mad ! it makes my car break down ! have you seen what people put their trash in ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s good you have that ability to pick as much as you can . sounds like you need to be more careful next time . <|endoftext|>
oh i am the same , i have always felt afraid of them because there are so many and it makes me feel claustrophobic <|endoftext|>
hah , that is too funny , how was disne? were you nervous ? i always like going to disneand . <|endoftext|>
that stinks . was the interview positive ? i hope you get the offer ! ! ! : ) <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! it ' s always a great feeling when you get a job , and it ' ll feel better when you ' ve already done it <|endoftext|>
cool , where are you going ? tell me more ! ! ! ? ! ? vacation ! ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! where are you headed ? i ' m going to a business trip in 2 weeks . <|endoftext|>

oh wow i bet that was an awesome deal ! what did you trade in for ? were you able to buy it used ? <|endoftext|>
that is so nice of them ! what a nice gesture to make ! it is so sad that kids are paying for so much . <|endoftext|>
that ' s very kind of you ! a lot of people don ' t go to the thrift stores ! <|endoftext|>
its nice to know that some people have such good lives . i ' m glad to have you . <|endoftext|>
oh my god . i bet you were so mad . that must have been so frustrating . . . <|endoftext|>
did you end up getting it done ? or was this on a test at school ? i ' d be upset if i had to go through that ! <|endoftext|>
i do too . is it because you are not with them ? sometimes people do not seem to get it . <|endoftext|>
i understand that . you have a long ways to go before she becomes a friend . that sucks . <|endoftext|>
i hope you guys can take some time apart and maybe reconnect . or perhaps he will just move far away ! <|endoftext|>
yeah , i get that , and i hope you do , and you can do everything you want to because you are in love ! <|endoftext|>
you are absolutely right ! being motivated is all that is needed . i just wish there was more people like her out there . <|endoftext|>
i do too , i just think i should be better than everyone else and do whatever i can to be closer to them . <|endoftext|>
yeah , some people just do it for the money . . . not sure what the point was <|endoftext|>
yes , it ' s sad . what are we doing to help them ? are there ways to help get through the tough times ? <|endoftext|>
congratulations . how do you feel about it ? was it an important moment in your life ? how is that making you feel now ? <|endoftext|>
oh i bet . . . what kind of work did you do ? ? ? maybe it ' s worth it in the end <|endoftext|>
oh , what tv is it ? what ' s coming out this weekend ? i ' m excited for you ! <|endoftext|>
i am sure it will look great on video games . i like old games . good luck on the watching ! <|endoftext|>
that is so kind of you to help her ! how is she now ? anything in particular ? <|endoftext|>
i am so sorry to hear that . i feel for her ! it ' s hard to be alone sometimes . <|endoftext|>
that is exactly how i feel . all we can do is work our way up . we will come together again in the future . <|endoftext|>
wow , how long did it take you to prepare this chat ? it seems pretty wild that you would be the one to start planning a first date with someone in particular <|endoftext|>
i bet you had a lot of fun ! ! ! did you like working there ? how was the experience ? <|endoftext|>
oh , that doesn ' t sound fun at all . i hope you got it done on time ! <|endoftext|>
have you tried living with it . it may not be all you could have asked for . . <|endoftext|>
aw , i ' m sorry for your loss , she must have had a wonderful life . what breed was she ? <|endoftext|>
i am happy for you it means you love him ! ! ! do you have a special plan to take care of him ? <|endoftext|>

oh man i hate people who are abuse animals , its heartbreaking . what type of pets do you have ? <|endoftext|>
yea and i just got in a big dent in my front car as well . i was mortified . <|endoftext|>
i remember that , too . i always kept looking for ways to go a mile away but i never found anything to do because i always run into things i don ' t like too much <|endoftext|>
what did you eat ? i ' m glad that they helped . everyone deserves to have friends that are supportive . <|endoftext|>
oh no i am so sorry . i hate when that happens . . . did you cry when you had her ? <|endoftext|>
people are really reaching for old tradition . i am sure you are a great felon ! : ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good use of the tylenol . maybe he should get a nitle looper , then . <|endoftext|>
awww poor boy . i hope he is okay . molar problems are definitely the worst . <|endoftext|>
that is not fun but i am sure that you are able to . it may not be as hard as you think <|endoftext|>
i just want it to be comfortable for me without any baby feet . i don ' t want to move at all and i ' m not happy in the bed . <|endoftext|>
wow , italy is my favorite place in the world ! how long have you been there ? any big journey ? <|endoftext|>
they are awesome , they came to america to help us get in shape for the trip . they did a great job <|endoftext|>
i will definitley look into it some more . i hope to see a culture in my own city . <|endoftext|>
that is so nice of them . you must be really happy to have them . what did you eat ? <|endoftext|>
did you have anything to eat ? were you out of food for the day or what ? that sounds delicious . <|endoftext|>
i know ! the exact opposite happened to me ! it ' s so annoying ! i just avoid the situation as much as possible <|endoftext|>
that is horrible , i hope it didn ' t cause any damage . that really sucks though . <|endoftext|>
that sounds pretty creepy . have you checked what it may be ? i think it might be a robber or something . <|endoftext|>
me too . but i like to keep the light on when i ' m alone . it ' s so quiet without it . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . we adopted a dog from the animal shelter and he is such a good dog . <|endoftext|>
lol . they can be fun and a sometimes relaxing treat . i agree . we had to let our dog roam the streets as well as watch his favorite movies <|endoftext|>
oh wow . you must ' ve been losing power . how big was the power cut ? i ' m in florida , we have a hurricane . <|endoftext|>
wow , that is crazy ! it ' s great that you got the candles though ! i would have done the exact same thing ! <|endoftext|>
oh that stinks ! did you get the cat back ? did your mom get hurt ? hope she is ok . <|endoftext|>
next time just stay positive and just be honest . sometimes the haters won ' t listen . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that ' s the worst , gagging and looking like you had some sickness . . . <|endoftext|>
right ! ! i was so hungry and so unhealthy ! ! ! the only reason i have eaten is because i was supposed to be having lunch . . oops ! <|endoftext|>
i love listening to rain . what caused it to rain ? did you have some nice rain from earlier in the day ? <|endoftext|>
i love the sound of rain on a tin roof too ! it ' s always a good thing . <|endoftext|>
oh my ! i am so sorry to hear that . were you okay ? what happened ? please tell me everything is ok . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . hopefully you can spend it on something you really like to do for fun . <|endoftext|>
yeah i don ' t think i will ever go back to video poker . if i ever find myself in a bad spot i will call on somebody else . video poker is a great game though and allows you to do much more if you watch it play right <|endoftext|>
that is a really good idea ! i might do that too . i will have to invest some of my money in pockets ! <|endoftext|>
i have heard great things about new orleans , and i ' m thinking of moving there ! do you know where the lls there are held held tonight ? <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds awesome ! i think i would have wanted to hear about the band too ! the local community club sounds like a swell time ! <|endoftext|>

what happened ? did the bike turn out to be his ? what was he drugs money for ? <|endoftext|>
i love you . . . 3 ! ! 1 ! ! ! ahhh ! ! you can go anywhere ! ! go anywhere you want <|endoftext|>
mistakes can happen but that doesn ' t mean you need to pay him back ! what was an accident ? <|endoftext|>
if you allow yourself to have a negative reaction to something it becomes a good thing . don ' t give up hope . <|endoftext|>
omg , i can not even imagine how out of this world are they planning on doing this <|endoftext|>
oh , i ' m sorry . how did it go ? are you confident you will give ? <|endoftext|>
oh , sounds like you are prepared ! do you feel nervous about them ? that is what my college did and it did well . <|endoftext|>
no , i haven ' t , but hopefully not . i think that ' s where i head to find new friends ! <|endoftext|>
that is really disappointing . it sounds like you really trust your friend and that makes you feel even more grateful that they are your family . maybe you can make a special occasion out of it . <|endoftext|>
oh wow that is so nice . was it a nice surprise ? did you have a good time with it ? <|endoftext|>
i wish i had a sister like you . i would help you find a solution that works for you . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that ! did you hurt your foot ? i would be so hurt if i broke mine ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! that ' s great that you were able to help ! it was a good thing you were so supportive of your husband ! <|endoftext|>
that is such a nice feeling . are they excited ? or a bit scared ? shopping is great , especially for the kids . <|endoftext|>
oh i bet that is annoying . how often do you have to get there ? i get a bad feeling about the company . <|endoftext|>
you should be more careful with your shopping . i ' m the type to get really excited about shopping and then get distracted by the people who are next . <|endoftext|>
that sounds bad . what happened ? did you spend your day having a bad day ? what happened was good ? <|endoftext|>
oh no , was it a cookie that you were hungry for ? if so , that would be terrible ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! what kind of list were you in ? i hope they were not too mad at you for trying to protect your school life ! <|endoftext|>
oh gosh , i don ' t know where i would go so that was a great idea ! <|endoftext|>
it ' s great that you made your decision , it ' ll make things a lot easier and easier . <|endoftext|>
yeah , sometimes a rethink is good and sometimes bad , and it doesn ' t end up being the same . it happens . <|endoftext|>
yikes ! did you kill it ? i would have been so mad . was it a black widow ? <|endoftext|>
yes i feel you . i once saw a clown eat a flower . i thought that was gross <|endoftext|>
really ? that seems like a very enjoyed play> , did you not enjoy it ? if so , what was it about ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds pretty wild . i would have given it a shot at first . do you think they will take your money back ? <|endoftext|>
does he usually get a large bonus too ? ! ? ! how good is it ! ? hope he gets it ! <|endoftext|>
yea i hate when that happens . i feel your pain . it sucks when unexpected things go wrong . <|endoftext|>
that was really nice of you . how did he spend it ? ? ? ! ? ! ! <|endoftext|>
yeah that ' s crazy . so the guy you turned it in for wasn ' t really worth anything , right ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds terrible . i hope you can find a way to forget it . don ' t be so ashamed . you lived a happy and happy life . <|endoftext|>
oh my god , i would have passed out as well ! did anyone come ? what did they do ? <|endoftext|>
i love calc . i don ' t think i did well on it though . i had to study hard <|endoftext|>
wow that is pretty awesome then ! maybe you can do better next time . what kind of degree ? <|endoftext|>
is she cat the word she calls sleep , or was she a cat who likes to wake you up ? <|endoftext|>

thats crazy . where you finally end up going ? congrats and good luck ! ! <|endoftext|>
wow , congrats ! science is such a great occupation . you seem pretty smart . is it in your future ? <|endoftext|>
oh , i ' m sorry . what happened ? are you still waiting to hear back ? how did it end up ? <|endoftext|>
i went to one too but it was one i really liked . what school did you go to ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! why did he do that ? what were you guys to do ? did you guys have a plan b ? <|endoftext|>
that is very annoying . sorry you had to go through that . i would not let him choose the only one over you either . <|endoftext|>
it ' s great , what kind of video games are you playing ? cod , madden ? <|endoftext|>
yes , this is a good blow ! i will have to check out some of the new games on the channel . <|endoftext|>
yes , i agree . they would always be closed ! i always have to work during those cold months . <|endoftext|>
yes i remember that feeling too . it is so sweet to think about when you first open your bank account in february . <|endoftext|>
you sound very optimistic , are you excited to move away ? i wish you all the best ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m a political science major , engineering and technology i ' ve got my hands on experience <|endoftext|>
thats great to hear , i really appreciate my parents for having a lot of faith in me . <|endoftext|>
that is nice , who won it ? was it for your father ? were you hurt when you was little ? <|endoftext|>
well bowling has a good uprotation and its fun to play with people you don ' t normally play with . <|endoftext|>
i ' m not the best at it but i have always been a good bowling coach . i would love to try in the bowling alley . <|endoftext|>
that is scary ! are you home alone or with your husband ? you are safe ! what do you do to protect you ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s always really annoying . maybe you could try barking at them and see if they respond the same . <|endoftext|>
that is pretty awful , but at least you tried . do you often play and throw bowling ? <|endoftext|>
i know that feeling . it can always get better . i ' m so glad that your friend is okay . i would ' ve been in that situation at the very least . <|endoftext|>
i would say you should . your friend must be very trusting . if she ' s a great friend you should tell her . <|endoftext|>
oh , if it was only a money pit for you , i definitely understand . but , at least you realized it ' s just what you needed to spend , so if there were other issues she could have atleast told you , as it sounds like it was for your own good . still , i ' m still thinking about the benefit of honesty , even if it is just a temporarily . <|endoftext|>
that must be a real bummer , are you going to visit them soon ? i think a good weekend could really do some good things for you in your new space . <|endoftext|>
i see , its good you don ' t do anything too crazy . you can always do stuff on your own ! <|endoftext|>
there ' s always the one day where you really can ' t do anything else during the workload , you just have to keep an open mind and be patient ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! that ' s a long wait to start for me then ! can you do this whole thing four days a week ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! are you going to be a general ed class ? or is this your minor in college . <|endoftext|>
i understand . don ' t be too hard on yourself . just be confident ! and i am sure that you have accomplished something in life that you haven ' t before ! <|endoftext|>
nice . i love food . do you ? it makes me feel sick . i need a night routine . <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty cool . when i was little we always had pizza at the bowling alley . <|endoftext|>
how old is he ? i really am sorry to hear that he is going to be depressed . <|endoftext|>
i really hope he gets some medicine for that , i could use a tooth brush . i hope he stops eating after that . <|endoftext|>
is it a video game ? is it going to be good ? any good players in the news ? <|endoftext|>
how long have you been playing ? i ' ve been thinking of getting back into it . did you meet your husband through the expansion ? <|endoftext|>
that must be really hard to deal with when you come home from work . have you tried talking to them yet ? <|endoftext|>
mine too . they can get really irritating at times . just say excuse me . lol <|endoftext|>
yes , storms are great but if you ' re stuck in a place with so many trees it ' s hard to stay positive . <|endoftext|>
scary indeed . glad you guys are ok . it must have been terrifying to get in the house after that . <|endoftext|>
wow , i ' m a bit late to this party , but i bet you ' ll be studying as much as me ! <|endoftext|>
engineering is great , sounds like you will have a great semester ! as for procrastination , well i have a feeling you will do great . <|endoftext|>
that sounds so good ! what artist is it ? i used to listen to a ton of music . <|endoftext|>
yep . i always love it when my kids are little , and feel like they are getting another experience . it ' s so cute when they are little . <|endoftext|>
i would be too ! when does he first started bowling ? years ago ? haha i can ' t even do that ! <|endoftext|>
don ' t worry about other bowling throwers . they are all pretty good . just do what is comfortable for you . <|endoftext|>
what kind of job are you trying to start ? is it for something that is mainly needed for work ? <|endoftext|>
that would be challenging ! good luck , it will get better with time . : ) start with a few simple hobby like watching youtube videos or playing games online . <|endoftext|>
that sounds super frustrating . hopefully you can fix it . was the sign wrong ? is the form long ? <|endoftext|>
yeah i am sure he can help fix it . great work by the way ! ! ! : ) <|endoftext|>
did you call them ? it ' s not the end of the world . if you do not have any friends , it is hard to meet up . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a great trip . it ' s probably worth revisit if you don ' t get to see anyone nearby ! <|endoftext|>
maybe you should get him some money to pay off his loan ! that sounds good right ? hope it is a cheaper car . <|endoftext|>
it ' s cool , i think if your dad loves it then you should be happy for him <|endoftext|>
why are you nervous ? a bad wreck could happen on your new vehicle . is there some special reason ? <|endoftext|>
car ' s usually last a long time . it sounds like your situation is related to that . <|endoftext|>
omg ! you are so right . people are crazy . what did you do ? did you call the police ? <|endoftext|>
i would be mad as well . i hope that you have been well ! you are lucky ! <|endoftext|>
i hate mine too ! how do you have your car saved ? have you taken it to a auto parts store ? <|endoftext|>
2002 is when i had my first one , but i graduated in 2008 and it seems like the years have gone by quickly . i hope that you have fun at school with it . <|endoftext|>
oh me too , i hate presenting . what happens if i don ' t do it well ? <|endoftext|>
i get that ! i ' m too afraid to ask for help and just try to stay away from people when they come in the door . it ' s kind of gross to talk to so many people at once , when they need so much support right now . . and i ' d be terrified ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow , i would have been so disgusted . i don ' t think i could do that . <|endoftext|>
haha . my son does that actually . i can ' t help but feel like i ' m watching tv lol . <|endoftext|>
maybe they thought you might be on the horn or something ? they probably have forgotten something . hopefully , they were just impressed . <|endoftext|>
funny funny . well i hope you were able to laugh it off because you didn ' t even look terrible haha <|endoftext|>
did you end up buying them ? you can always try to budget for it next semester . . <|endoftext|>
that ' s amazing , what kind of books ? maybe you can get me some ? haha <|endoftext|>
you are very lucky ! what made you so happy ? did you do anything wrong ? and how was it ? <|endoftext|>
congratulation ! i bet your doing a good job ! ! ! i wish all my countries would do the same ! <|endoftext|>
nice . what kind of car did you get . is it flashier ? newer or newer . <|endoftext|>
it sounds like you are really set on this one . i would be very jealous . perhaps i should buy a new car also . <|endoftext|>
have you try smoking less ? and have you ever had a smoke at all . i am sure it is hard and no one is perfect and it can be difficult . <|endoftext|>
i have had one too . its always a relief to feel normal again ! are you feeling better ? <|endoftext|>
did you say anything to the person to say , i ' m going to smoke this weekend . i ' ll pack one " ? <|endoftext|>
it is , but you can ' t help it . just keep wearing sandals , and don ' t forget to use hand towels ! <|endoftext|>
i was in ft hauntley when that happened . i ' m happy that you were ok . <|endoftext|>
good to hear you made a new friend and reunited with your family . it ' s easy to lose one ' s motivation over a long period of time . <|endoftext|>
oh man i hear you ! i know exactly how you feel ! i don ' t flush at all ! lol <|endoftext|>
i can tell you that she ' s a strong woman and would never take my side at all . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome , you must have some confidence in yourself . sounds like you need a lot to help your team and them well . <|endoftext|>
yeah sometimes you don ' t know until it ' s gone . it ' ll take you a few days to figure out what to do <|endoftext|>
oh no , i hate the anxiety of rollercoaster . did you try it ? i hate rollersters so much <|endoftext|>
did the high speeds have a lot of closed seats ? i heard they are always a blast . <|endoftext|>
wow ! you must have been so proud ! how did it go ? did you have fun ? <|endoftext|>
what is it that you want the most ? what else is there ? if you want to be rich i understand . <|endoftext|>
lol oh god . . that ' s the worst i ' ve heard of a child choke under a carrot . i could just be laughing too long now ! <|endoftext|>
im glad to hear she ' s doing better after all that effort , you must be a great friend to help her forget that even a simple mistake can hurt . <|endoftext|>
that ' s not good , what are you going to do now ? did you already use the credit card ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure you will get something taken care of soon ! ! ! just keep an eye out for those hacked and let ' s hope for the best ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s too bad . have you tried going to sleep earlier and looking for something else to do ? <|endoftext|>
haha , sorry to hear that . . . maybe you should go and see the doctor about a change ? <|endoftext|>
oh yeah ? what was it ? was it something dangerous ? what did you do ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
did the kitchen have any other lights or a other light ? that is never good to be in the kitchen . <|endoftext|>
oh , no . i ' m sure it was . but how did you do ? how did it go ? <|endoftext|>
not if you do your best ! don ' t down yourself ! you did so well on it ! <|endoftext|>
oh that is horrible , how has she been ? i ' m very sorry to hear that . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i remember i had to put my mom down in my late teens . they are like little kids but they are your little kids . <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! that is a great news right there ! i am sure she would love it if you showed her . <|endoftext|>
hopefully . . . i am sure you will be fine ! ! : ) keep your head up and show them what you have accomplished recently : ) <|endoftext|>
that is a nice feature to have . i like to use them as tools . sometimes they can be quite expensive <|endoftext|>
it ' s worth a double check . just in case . good luck . it ' ll be a treat when you get home . <|endoftext|>
congrats ! what ' s the position ? do you like it ? i ' m sure you will like it ! <|endoftext|>
wow that sounds so exciting . it is always good to work as attorney , since you are the correct one in your abilities <|endoftext|>
i sure hope so . what are you planning on getting on it ? and how soon is that ? <|endoftext|>
the older models are nice but this one is nice . it is older and just a little bigger <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good decision for sure . i ' m glad you made it through . what did you major in ? <|endoftext|>
good luck , i ' m sure you ' ll do well . what is the name of the restaurant ? <|endoftext|>
thats cool , nothing better than relaxing after a long day of work . hope you ' re able to get back on your feet after a few hours . <|endoftext|>
i love pancakes and sausage , i would probably have loved to have a slice of that or even a cup of coffee ! <|endoftext|>
awesome ! i ' m glad that things worked out for you . i only have to save a couple thousand . i wish i could have more though . <|endoftext|>
i am sure you will be fine . what was your income before ? i had one not so much <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! i am sure that you are proud of every minute of it . how did it change your perspective ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i am glad you are in the better position . some people don ' t find themselves in that situation . i wish you many more success . <|endoftext|>
wow that sounds exciting , what are you going to do on the cruise ? i hope you have lots of fun ! <|endoftext|>
great ! i ' m glad they didn ' t charge you too ) . it sounds like the business is looking bright ! <|endoftext|>
i am proud of your sister too ! how far along do you have in life ? : ) <|endoftext|>
are you happy with it ? if you are , you should be happy for her . if you aren ' t , then you don ' t deserve it . it ' s her to her own car . <|endoftext|>
well at least you got to spend some time with each other because you are awesome friends . it takes time to build a true relationship with each others friends . <|endoftext|>
did you tried to ask them ? are they normally busy at work ? when my parents leave for their work , i usually call them . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s some dedication . i ' ll have to go you can come over if you want . <|endoftext|>
sounds nice , i am always looking forward to that . i usually watch tv with my roommate on the couch . <|endoftext|>
was it nice watching your pet go grey and white ? lol . dogs can be pretty mean though <|endoftext|>
did they make it through with their dog at least ? i would have been so pissed ! ! <|endoftext|>
it sounds like you have a solid support system . i ' m sure your friend has a good reason to trust you . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like it would relax you . sounds like you had a good night . no dogs left ? <|endoftext|>
wow they are awesome dogs , i have a pit myself . i have never had a wiener dog <|endoftext|>
time will tell . have you had a chance to see her since you ' ve known eachother ? <|endoftext|>
i have experienced that before . it is tough but it will get better . it will take time . <|endoftext|>
oh man i bet that was fun to find things from your childhood ! did he enjoy it ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a lot of fun . i ' m happy for you ! it ' s good you guys can have meaningful memories like that . <|endoftext|>
maybe she needs some alone time to make up for her trouble . take some time for yourself and talk to her , you seem very single . <|endoftext|>
it ' ll be nice to have some alone time . that ' s always nice . hopefully it gets better . <|endoftext|>
what happened ? did you end up becoming mad and fight ? what did you do ? did it end well ? <|endoftext|>
oh , that ' s pretty understandable . i bet you had a really hard time dealing with it . <|endoftext|>
i hope he is feeling better . did you go get him some rest ? ? ? he should have went earlier to prevent it <|endoftext|>
that is true love for the love of god . we have to love everyone . it will save us from everything . <|endoftext|>
oh no , what is making you anxious ? please tell me something else . did it make you feel uneasy ? <|endoftext|>
you need to sit down and talk to them ! that is all you need right now . no one else to talk to ! <|endoftext|>
yes i love her so much and have her with me every day ! ! ! what about you ? <|endoftext|>
puppies are the best , i ' m so glad you did something nice for him . did you have to take him to the vet ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s horrible ! what did you do ? how is she now ? is she okay ? <|endoftext|>
wow ! did you even get the vets insurance ? thats insane ! im glad she was alright though <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry , you sound pretty sad . i hope you are ok . do you have close by ? <|endoftext|>
that is horrible . i was always a little sad about what was happening too . i am so sorry . <|endoftext|>
oh no , was it an illness or what ? losing a pet is always sad but no matter what it is is the worse . i ' m sorry about your dog , what happened ? <|endoftext|>
i bet , just think about all the great memories he had with you ! how old was he when he died ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a sad feeling . . . but better than having to be alone every day . have you tried working with other people to make sure that you have an average day to night life ? <|endoftext|>
i get it , i like to think my home country and work are my family . my friends live there . i get to visit them once a month . <|endoftext|>
did you ask them why they did it ? sometimes people have an interest in something and then don ' t contribute a lot . <|endoftext|>
i know they were like that back in the day too . now they are priceless ! <|endoftext|>
are they really close ? that is sometimes the case . i wish i had some friends like that . <|endoftext|>
you will have to get one then ! it is a lot easier than driving around in a car ! <|endoftext|>
what kind of food did you order ? sometimes that can affect things like that . . . you got a good meal after all . <|endoftext|>
sorry about that . is the house not damaged ? or is the car damaged badly ? that is really scary . . <|endoftext|>
did you say anything ? i dont think that would be a good story to tell . were you okay ? <|endoftext|>
ouch , that ' s scary ! what were you doing at that point ? maybe they saw you and thought it was fair to let you drive while they were away ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great of her ! i bet she cared a lot when she was younger . are you guys still friends ? <|endoftext|>
so am i ! its always good to know there are people out there that care about you ! <|endoftext|>
oh damn . sounds like a bad sign . what was it ? was it a deer ? or something bad ? <|endoftext|>
my daughter just ran away ! i have a dog but she keeps wanting to sleep with her toy . . i am a little too scared to get a puppy <|endoftext|>
that is a surprise . what kind ? is it a huge one ? ? ? does it fit you ? <|endoftext|>
well that ' s great ! did you work hard for it ? or is it just crazy to think that a mustang is even better than a normal car ? lol <|endoftext|>
what is going on ? i ' m curious . what do you do that makes them ashamed ? <|endoftext|>
i see , you should try and talk to them to get over the feeling . some people aren ' t for all and it ' s hard to not be picky about things <|endoftext|>
oh no . what happened ? did you confront them ? ? are they a good friend ? ? <|endoftext|>
sounds like a pretty terrible prank . hopefully you can get them caught . if not i suggest you just find a new friend online . <|endoftext|>
oh yeah ? what was it about ? did the popcorn make you so anxious ? i used to be scared to go to the movies too . <|endoftext|>
oh no , were you okay ? were you able to get out as you went ? i ' m usually pretty gullabble around that sort of thing . <|endoftext|>
that is very trusting of you , you should really be more faithful to them , i ' m sure you will be fine <|endoftext|>
do they visit often ? are they very vacations ? i would if i went to cuba . <|endoftext|>
maybe you should leave her before she does , that may help you avoid that issue . : ) <|endoftext|>
oh okay . that makes more sense now . now you have know who she is . you should definitely talk to your girlfriends about your relationship . <|endoftext|>
why don ' t you get to see it ? have you tried to ask your friend for a ride or something ? <|endoftext|>
oh really ? ? was it scary ? ? why do you think that is ? ! ? did you do anything to prepare or miss the purge ? <|endoftext|>
where did you go ? i love the beach , especially when i ' m relaxing ! where did ya go ? <|endoftext|>
i bet . at least it wasn ' t completely dry . that would be lovely . i love hot weather . <|endoftext|>
that is really nice ! it must be exciting to see your family ! where are you going to go on your cruise ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! i ' ve never been there , hope you all have a good time . i ' d love to go on a cruise <|endoftext|>
did you find anything like it ? or is all that craving for you ? : ) it ' s hard to resist ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it was the worst . but at least you get to enjoy a nice day without a job . <|endoftext|>
that was pretty nice . is that what she said ? sorry to hear about him , i know it can be stressful . <|endoftext|>
i hope it is nothing but good for you guys . stay positive and let the pain pay off . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i am sorry to hear that . will he be honest with you ? he consumes much of his house . <|endoftext|>
wow he really owes you some money ! a contractor ? he must have been a cool guy . <|endoftext|>
i am sure you will do great ! just relax and be yourself ! i am confident in myself ! : ) <|endoftext|>
it ' s great how you prepared . i ' m sure you ' ll do great ! good luck ! <|endoftext|>
i am sorry . what did they argue about ? did they do something else ? or did they just argue without thinking about it , not actually arguing , just wanting to be contrary ? <|endoftext|>
maybe you can take that time to grieve and put aside your issues for now until you can get a resolution against the immature actions they are making toward you <|endoftext|>
you ' ll always live in lesson learned . live your life as you want to live . don ' t lose hope . <|endoftext|>
that is quite interesting . i am really glad that you were able to perform so well . its a great achievement . <|endoftext|>
i do have children , it is amazing ! we got a pool to jump in , i was so scared ! <|endoftext|>
no , but , i wish i did and i ' m already preparing for my associate ' s degree . it ' s just a tad odd . <|endoftext|>
oh man , that is so heartbreaking . i would be really sad if that happened to me . i am very sorry . i know how you feel . <|endoftext|>
oh that is so nice . i am glad he came through for you . i don ' t even know if i could be there for someone like that . <|endoftext|>
oh really . what happened on the 16th ? did you get a neat experience ? did it bring you joy ? <|endoftext|>
oh congratulations ! that is pretty awesome . it was probably a nice console , huh ? and you didn ' t have to ask for your friend ' s stuff back ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure she will learn she lost temper , that ' s how kids learn not to be caged up <|endoftext|>
i think if you say it again in light of the circumstances and don ' t put yourself in your place there is a chance she will forgive you . <|endoftext|>
that ' s funny , i bet your mom was proud as hell . haha . but yeah , it ' s hard to imagine someone who looks like you might be looking through the fridge and be acting up . <|endoftext|>
haha that is such a nice thing to do . he is lucky to have you ! maybe he can go to college . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! i ' m happy for you , and it sounds great that you got to go back ! <|endoftext|>
great . i am glad you all had a great time . i ' m also looking forward to going next weekend . <|endoftext|>
well , hey , sometimes it is good to disappear ! there have been many people who have done that successfully . <|endoftext|>
lol , i am glad it didn ' t end up hitting you in the forehead or something <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i ' m so sorry . that just sounds like a terrible thing to go through . <|endoftext|>
i hope it will be better . did you have surgery ? is it anything serious ? i hate seeing the big picture sometimes <|endoftext|>
i ' m not so sure it ' s just discipline . how old is he ? is he a bad child ? <|endoftext|>
what a good dad . you should have your world together and not anymore . it ' s time for the dark . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s sweet ! i do the same when i make cookies for my kids lol ! <|endoftext|>
why ? what happened ? was it bad ? did you take the kids to lunch ? lol <|endoftext|>
well , i ' m glad we have another onship like you in the house . that will help get through the head of any household problems ! <|endoftext|>
well maybe he will get back to not being so busy once he gets his work things together . <|endoftext|>
that is great news , i ' m sure she is really stressed right now , so congratulations ! <|endoftext|>
oh well , do what you have to do to keep up the good work . be there when she isn ' t on your side <|endoftext|>
it was a nice surprise . you got a good birthday . what did you do with the flowers ? <|endoftext|>
aww ! that ' s really sweet . it ' s always nice to get surprise gifts . <|endoftext|>
that must have be so sad . . . are you going to take them somewhere or sell them online ? <|endoftext|>
oh man , that sounds like fun ! what did you all do together ? i miss some of my family , too . <|endoftext|>
i would hate that ! i hate being inside in the hot summer . is it a lot cooler where you live ? <|endoftext|>
oh no , i hope that was a surprise for you , or at least a pleasant surprise for everyone . <|endoftext|>
wow , congratulations ! that ' s pretty cool . i moved to colorado about 8 years ago . <|endoftext|>
i am a teacher , so i have a lot of extra money to spend . i hope i will get this new job . <|endoftext|>
what kind of distance do you run ? and i love running , i love to do it in the morning . <|endoftext|>
we work at the local police station as we call it excersise " you can call me whatever you want lol . <|endoftext|>
awesome . i can ' t wait for the next day . no better feeling than waking up in the morning <|endoftext|>
that ' s nice . he sounds like he ' s a good husband . you all must be happy for each other ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! do you have any plans to do something special this week ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
awesome , congrats to him ! you will be fine . . i bet you ' ll make lots of friends out there ! <|endoftext|>
congrats ! i have a daughter too ! she ' s starting high school . we ' ll see how far she goes ! <|endoftext|>
she sounds amazing ! i ' m sure she is going to do well wherever she goes . my niece just turned 2 . i think i ' ll get her a little young to start school . <|endoftext|>
oh gosh i ' m so sorry ! i hope that it wasn ' t too spraying . <|endoftext|>
the police haven ' t come word , but they are looking into it . it must have been a very bad accident <|endoftext|>
i remember my first child . . they are so small and they love to cuddle and cuddle . now they are just babies <|endoftext|>
wow i guess that is not good then huh ? ? what do you think happens ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
do you have a diet in mind right now ? do you want to go into the kitchen to watch what ' s in there ? <|endoftext|>
it will get better . just keep working hard and your spirit will come through . you deserve it . <|endoftext|>
i wouldn ' t recommend it ! are you quitting because you don ' t like it ? i find it very unfulfilling , and like to stay in the work place for a couple of days . <|endoftext|>
oh no . will you speak with him about it ? i have no idea how to overcome that situation . <|endoftext|>
oh i bet that was so much fun . where are you going . the kids are too small ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds amazing ! where did you go ? ? ? ! ! ? ! ? so i ' m guessing , mexico ? ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! what type of dog ? i have two different dogs and am really looking forward to their future . <|endoftext|>
oh i have a jack russell that ' s a great breed ! it looks like she ' s about to become a little one <|endoftext|>
how are you going to move back into the old one ? i ' ve moved out before , i really miss it . <|endoftext|>
i miss my old house . it was a light color and it was my baby ' s favorite . i hope you get to feel that same feeling with your house as well ! <|endoftext|>
why do you feel that way ? have you been training for a long time ? it ' s so satisfying to be good . <|endoftext|>
do you get alot of presents at the holidays ? maybe you can get some cool things for them . <|endoftext|>
i have been there , friend . it is terrible . do you think it ' s the aliens ? <|endoftext|>
what are you worried about ? i ' m sure you will get better , i ' ve had those too . <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness . i am so sorry to hear that . it ' s hard to lose someone so close to them . <|endoftext|>
yes , true . i am sure you really loved the vacations . i have two kids and was there to visit one of them as well when my grandparents passed away . it can be tough even if you enjoy the house and the memories you got together . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good , healthy and nice are so important and we have to do better all the time ! <|endoftext|>
yea , but you know you can change that too ! go ahead ! don ' t you know already ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s horrible ! i hope you are able to get it open . will it help you in the future ? <|endoftext|>
oh man , i am so sorry that happened to you . i would be furious ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s sweet , does he love the game ? i had one who would play every morning when i was gone . <|endoftext|>
oh ! how disgusting ! i would have burned it , too . that rat probably deserved it . <|endoftext|>
congrats ! does he enjoy the water or go to the potty often ? i ' m guessing the former since you were proud . <|endoftext|>
you just showed my idea of a good parent , i was just talking to my daughter about how i was looking at her like she was mine , i had 2 young kids ! <|endoftext|>
yeah , it really was a let down . i really missed the best possible opportunity to hang out . <|endoftext|>
that ' s disappointing . hopefully you ' re able to refund them at least ? just have to remember that you can ' t return the tickets ! <|endoftext|>
that must have been embarassing ! did they have to take a uber ? haha . <|endoftext|>
wow that must make you feel really bad . you can try to wipe the smell off and then get some else to wash it off . <|endoftext|>
it sure could have , i would be so mad too ! you are absolutely right though , that is awful ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you ' re okay now but still glad the driver stopped and called an ambulance . did they even help you ? <|endoftext|>
i hate that last semester was probably the biggest challenge of your life . do you feel okay now ? <|endoftext|>
oh , man . well that ' s awful . hopefully you didn ' t lose too much that day ! <|endoftext|>
that sucks . it seems they are very understaffed at work right now . i wish they were more employees <|endoftext|>
did you file a police report with the client ? it must have hurt so much . . . <|endoftext|>
not since i was a baby . do you have ? i have ? maybe that ' s a plus <|endoftext|>
gross ! i would have peed my pants , that ' s awful . poor thing ! poor poor people <|endoftext|>
thats sounds like fun ! do you like heavy metal ? i grew up empegine death and rock <|endoftext|>
i was with my boyfriend who broke up with me after 2 months of being together , i stayed with him all the time <|endoftext|>
yes ! i agree ! it feels like a win , win situation ! congrats by the way ! ! <|endoftext|>
that is so romantic . you are very lucky ! : ) i would have felt the same way . <|endoftext|>
oh no , that ' s really bad . what is it from ? and are they alright ? <|endoftext|>
oh that is horrible news . i am so sorry for your loss . my mother had to have surgery and it was awful . <|endoftext|>
i love the original starwars ! the new character designs are so cool . i can ' t wait to see it . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a lot of fun . i loved the premier episode a lot as a kid . <|endoftext|>
oh wow thats sounds so fun ! did you have a good time ? i love visiting dive bars . <|endoftext|>
nice ! i ' d love to go see the pool ! sounds like fun ! i like to watch the ufc live on sundays ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool . what is your favorite place ? i love places to drink that last forever . <|endoftext|>
thats so sweet of him . what is the watch about ? is it sentimental value ? i am so sorry for your loss . . i know its hard to lose loved ones . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! i just recently started going to the gym again , and i love it , it makes you really focus on your weight gain and notice that the energy is putting on a different layer . <|endoftext|>
yes , that ' s definitely the tricky part . we ' ve been together for a long time , and i ' m comfortable here . i just wish we had a lot more to do , since it ' s not like we ' re married or something . <|endoftext|>
ok , well i would tell her why it was so late . girls aren ' t born to have moments of happiness , they are supposed to be with other girls for a while . it ' s her body ! <|endoftext|>
why do you feel scared ? do you think you ' re going to hit a bump in the road ? <|endoftext|>
did you enjoy it ? what do you do to make them go away ? just kidding ! that ' s great ! <|endoftext|>
how fun ! where did it go ? how much was it ? was it worth any money ? <|endoftext|>
oh yes i can understand that . did you damage any possessions ? if so who cares bout the parking lot lol <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh , i ' m so sorry . are you ok ? are you feeling any pain at all ? <|endoftext|>
that sucks . sorry that happened to you . hopefully you can move on . sometimes a friendship won ' t tell you the full story of the situation . <|endoftext|>
same here . i never expected to see the white space ship after my parents opened it ! we had one of those when i was much smaller . <|endoftext|>
yeah i don ' t think i would go either . i always do things my friends want to do . <|endoftext|>
that can be hard to deal with . do you talk to her about it ? she must have a lot of reading to do . <|endoftext|>
yeah , maybe you should take her out to dinner and give her something nice , like a treat for once ! <|endoftext|>
nice ! did you all play ? what kind of game were you guys playing ? p ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s so great ! it always makes me wonder why they didn ' t give it to you . . and the service . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! is it your whole family going ? or just the whole community ? i ' m excited to get a taste of this event . <|endoftext|>
omg congratulate me also ! you must be really excited ! are you nervous ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
really ? i love vacation ! where are you headed ? is it for work or something fun ? <|endoftext|>
i love california ! i hope you are able to visit it . wouldn ' t that be great ? <|endoftext|>
that is sad . i hope everything turned out okay . . did you cry ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
thats sucks . . cheer up buddy : ) whats bothering you ? anything fun happening ? <|endoftext|>
did you end up passing ? ? ? or did you just not study well ? ? that ' s what i always say , don ' t worry too much ! everything happens for a reason . <|endoftext|>
it is always nice to get a good score when you are stressed about something so important . congrats <|endoftext|>
that is really sad ! was everything fine ? do you still see her ? do yo have any other family member that she has had to leave for ? <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . is she close to family ? are you still friends ? i hope not . . . <|endoftext|>
i guess you mean the older generation is happy , right ? the ones that went away for decades ? <|endoftext|>
i bet you are excited . do you hope to move in soon ? good luck ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that is great ! when was the job you applied to ? did you get the job ? if you don ' t mind me asking ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! i bet that was a nice feeling you felt . i ' ve always wanted an interview . <|endoftext|>
that is surprising considering how low the skill level is in pool . i ' m pretty amazing but can ' t swim . <|endoftext|>
oh man ! sounds like you all won really . was he one of the good looking ones ? <|endoftext|>
what happened instead ? have you contacted the schools to see what can be done ? try to find out what can help you . <|endoftext|>
you are right that is a very noble cause . next time just make sure you put everything back together in a nice way <|endoftext|>
yes . things will work out in the end . but its still tough . are you going to go to the hospital ? <|endoftext|>
i think that ' s the perfect plan for a second baby . you ' re setting a great example . <|endoftext|>
what did she go to college for ? does she live in new zealand ? that ' s a good place to live . <|endoftext|>
good . that ' s a tough life to lead . do you think she can still manage ? <|endoftext|>
yea - being alone is hard for some and the weekends get really busy . i really like being able to have my own time . <|endoftext|>
i would be so shocked if that happened to me . i ' m happy that you are so comfortable in your own time . <|endoftext|>
that ' s gross , was it a treat ? ? ? i ' ve had some dog eat things worse . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . at least you made it through the day fine . it ' s better when you don ' t do that . <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! how old is he ? mine is just one now . i feel so special having a baby , especially since i am so excited for him . <|endoftext|>
those are nice and relaxing ! my kids are 8 and 10 years old and they still miss me while i ' m gone lol . <|endoftext|>
wow ! you were very fortunate to have your parents as payment . so they paid you for your hard work ? <|endoftext|>
yes , that is something you will never forget . it can sometimes be overwhelming when you have kids , but i think you will get there and don ' t remember much . <|endoftext|>
wow ! where were you ? i recently got on one by myself as well . where did you go ? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that , will you be able to make it up there ? did you at least have fun and enjoy the visit ? <|endoftext|>
did you ever do it yourself ? how ' d it go ? was it fun ? did you get to know anyone on the flight ? <|endoftext|>
i would not want to share the same burden with you , well i would hope i could manage . <|endoftext|>
really ? why not ? it ' s good to be cautious with every kind of person , as long as they are good people ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty vague . does your dad still live a good place ? i ' m in florida and it ' s not so great ! the weather is rough , everyone is so loud . - but we got this good family . <|endoftext|>
oh no , it ' ll be more like 2500 ! and if you don ' t then you will have to replace the whole front cover , and it will cost you more than 000 just to get it fixed . <|endoftext|>
sounds like somebody lost it . hopefully it wasn ' t anything serious . how did the engine break down anyway ? <|endoftext|>
how exciting ! are you planning on having a boy after ? or are you excited for both ? <|endoftext|>
thats awesome . ive been saving since i was a kid but i never keep that in mind . <|endoftext|>
wow , where was it at ? and where are you going ? what did you fly ? where will you go ? <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never flown , but i ' m jealous that you ' re able to enjoy yourself . it sounds like it was very painful . <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible . what did she do ? was it someone she knew ? did you ask her why she did it ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow , she is a good person . was it for a show or a pickup ? or an office gift ? <|endoftext|>
how exciting ! have you been baby shopping while you were pregnant ? and how old is your baby ? <|endoftext|>
i ' ll be playing dominos ! ! ! october 11 ! ! dominos . lol , i ' m in a hurry to get out and start shopping ! <|endoftext|>
thats fun . it is nice to be out in nature . were you nervous ? im always on the look out for new places to go . <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool . was there any kind of lights on ? like , did the lights work ? <|endoftext|>
oh , wow ! how cute . sounds like he was a part of you life . was he a naughty dog or a friendly dog ? <|endoftext|>
oh , wow . you sure you did not miss a opportunities . . . the farm was probably very busy with other neglected animals <|endoftext|>
oh man , that ' s a miracle . do you think it ' s your fault ? ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . you might want to get away from her ! i had that happen to me . when my husband was a little kid he would walk around the room and jump on anything and everything for no reason . we eventually found her and took her to a haunted house . <|endoftext|>
oh my , how did that happen ? i bet you were terrified . that must have been terrifying ! <|endoftext|>
you must be so disappointed in him . i would be furious and furious for you . my mom broke up with her alcoholic roommate a few years ago , she was not happy . <|endoftext|>
you must be so excited ! boy or girl ? it sounds like you guys are on our want too so it sounds good ! <|endoftext|>
how did you do it ? just keep going ? or did you just do it with the best of nerves ? <|endoftext|>
wow that is terrible . do you still keep in touch with those people ? what did they do ? <|endoftext|>
i bet people were a little embarrassed , but i bet it was a nice experience . did you talk to him about it ? <|endoftext|>
what a beautiful sound , must have been a good opportunity for her to get in ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
i love being an guitarist ! i ' d love to have the experience to show off in some way . you must have been really impressed ! <|endoftext|>
i ' ve always been scared to be in an elevator . i used to be a bit scared , but i ' m glad i ' d overcome that fear with some exercise . <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh , that must have been terrifying to witness ! you must have cried in a public place too . how are you now ? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome , that is a blessing to me as well . i hope you are enjoying the new home . <|endoftext|>
that sounds really nice . any plans for the party ? i ' m looking for a new place to live . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i understand now . . is your baby ok ? ? ? ! ? ! ! ? <|endoftext|>
yikes . that was pretty scary . i wonder how it all went down . hopefully insurance can help you . <|endoftext|>
oh really , what was it about ? how was it ? was it interesting ? did you do anything else ? <|endoftext|>
what message ? i don ' t know the bible . what is it ? i do like the old testament though . <|endoftext|>
oh me too . what did you do to beat yourself up ? ; ) i know people who actually do that too . they get so mad thinking they have more control over it . <|endoftext|>
you should try to relax and get some exercise . that will make you feel better . stress can be a lot to deal with . <|endoftext|>
that ' s sounds really good . how old are your children ? i ' ve only just seen them for the first time <|endoftext|>
i hope you have fun ! be safe ! : ) i ' m sure you ' ll have a blast . <|endoftext|>
yeah ? why ? were you stressed out , or trying to push it off ? i am sure you are doing really well ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure your parents had a lot to say . it ' s always good to keep a secret so you don ' t get too disappointed . <|endoftext|>
aw , did they tell you why ? how did you feel about it ? you must have felt unfair <|endoftext|>
what a bummer ! well in the end it ' s all about how you did ! : ) <|endoftext|>
i feel you there . i live in a bad part of town , and my house is always sketchy . <|endoftext|>
i am glad you didn ' t have to do it on your own . i can ' t stand the smell of dog poo when it ' s in the middle of the night . <|endoftext|>
did you ? did you have a good recipe ? did she find it ? i ' ve done it more than once , and i ' m pretty sure i ' d be more careful next time . <|endoftext|>
thats good news ! i am glad it was all good though . : ) you should buy a side hustle for it or watch an upcoming show ! <|endoftext|>
i hear you . i am hoping to move in the same general place as you , but i am also looking forward to being able to walk around and not have to worry about clean up . <|endoftext|>
well i hope your moving soon to a new city so you can enjoy it while you can ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . what are you saving for ? are you going to travel ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
good , money ' s all in the bank ! it ' s such a bomber when they bail on plans like that <|endoftext|>
i bet you had a terrible time ! did you feel okay ? ! did your friend give you an excuse to take it easy on yourself ? <|endoftext|>
i just wish that my son would stop making fun of me , he has more talent than me ! <|endoftext|>
it is nice to have someone like that in our family . it means you work hard and encourage us to do the best we can . <|endoftext|>
my son is about to turn 15 , my daughter is in second grade . that ' s a tough transition <|endoftext|>
did you tell them how annoying that is ? did you yell at them ? i would ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
haha i know . i would of done the same thing . people deserve to have their bosses disappointed <|endoftext|>
yea it can make me angry too , especially when people dont notice you are there . maybe talk to the owner about it ? <|endoftext|>
i am glad it is nice for you to get noticed . maybe you should go and meet some new friends <|endoftext|>
swimming can be relaxing to do . i also love to swim ! do you live near a lake or beach ? <|endoftext|>
me too ! i love the water , and the pool is really fun too ! my favorite time of the year is summer , since i live far from the beach . <|endoftext|>
soup makes for good men ? i ' d hope she was eating well ? it was nice of you to help her . <|endoftext|>
that is amazing , i am sure she is feeling much better now . it is nice to have a new aunt . <|endoftext|>
that is good . you are a good brother then ! : ) family is really important . we are all one in our lives . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a great feeling . i really love my family . they ' re always there for me . <|endoftext|>
what did they do ? that ' s exciting ! ! ! was it a surprise for you too ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , you do the right thing ! i bet they are looking out for you . sometimes it ' s hard to give back in this world , but i bet you ' re in a better place today for it . <|endoftext|>
what a surprise ! did you have to uproot it back or did someone take it down ? <|endoftext|>
ah you should have gone to sleep with that in the back of your mind . as you could hear the branch hitting your roof ! <|endoftext|>
that is so awesome . how old is your dog ? ! ! she must be an older dog . <|endoftext|>
the hard work will pay off and in the future you will have to thank her ! : ) <|endoftext|>
where did they go ? ? ? sorry to hear that . . . hope everything is okay now ! <|endoftext|>
how does that make you feel ? are you still close ? : ) do you have lot ' s of things in common ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s kinda sad . what job is it ? do you know him well ? flaunting is usually an imitating of his money thing . <|endoftext|>
yeah i bet it would be nice to have that type of money and lifestyle . maybe you can meet him next weekend and tell him about it ? <|endoftext|>
ew . i ' d be feeling similar to you right now . i could see how you would be disgusted too . <|endoftext|>
well , that ' s good . i guess next time you ' ll have to spend more money to win . <|endoftext|>
the theme park always scares me as well . was there a particular reason ? ! ? ! did you have fun ? <|endoftext|>
i hate the roller sters too ! i feel like i will die on them . i am so afraid of them . <|endoftext|>
that ' s unfortunate . what kind of strangers ? and what made them laugh ? was it just because of the embarrassment or were they being mean ? <|endoftext|>
that stinks . maybe your dad can understand ? ! it happens . just ask him . : ) <|endoftext|>
have you tried joining any groups ? there are many different kinds of gym you can join . you need to do something to keep yourself occupied . <|endoftext|>
i know that can be upsetting . my advice is to just be confident . if they are shy , they will take notice . you will feel better about yourself when you talk to them , and you ' ll have a faster pace of commute . <|endoftext|>
did she talk to other guys ? ? what ended up being the issue , i could understand if she was guys in a relationship . <|endoftext|>
trust is essential if you want to live a happy life . it is important to be prepared for any unexpected challenges in life <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never seen that one . what ' s it about ? what was it about exactly ? <|endoftext|>
it was really a challenge for me too ! ! ! keep up the good work ! ! i ' m sure it will all work out ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . losing a loved one is never easy . i hope you find peace . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you weren ' t injured . i am sure you feel better . maybe you could move on with your life and save one day that you might have had to sell it . <|endoftext|>
aww , i ' m sorry to hear that ! was she leaving you ? i hope you ' re doing ok now ! <|endoftext|>
i think you just have to be happy for the right person and not for someone else . there are so many other reasons . <|endoftext|>
it sounds like a fun day ! what did you all do on the beach ? was it nice ? <|endoftext|>
that was cool , that ' s a great way to start the day ! yeah , i live in a shoe- it ' s ok . not too bad . i just don ' t like thunderstorms . <|endoftext|>
my husband does that too . it makes me angry . have you ever had someone talk down to you in the past ? <|endoftext|>
have you tried yoga ? it might help you with your anxiety . if you are really intro, i advice is just to focus on the present moment and move forward . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great to hear . what else do they do for you ? are you a lot closer to them ? <|endoftext|>
good for you . i hope you ' re having a good time . : ) i ' m sure you ' ll reap the rewards <|endoftext|>
was it your birthday ? how old were you ? did you have fun ? and where were you living . . . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad to hear it ! there ' s always next time ! lol what do you do ? <|endoftext|>
i have never been very good with other people , even my own family . i hope that you don ' t get too bad of yourself . <|endoftext|>
tell me about it . its almost like we live in a box and everything is chaotic ! its weird <|endoftext|>
ah i know what you mean , did i tell you about my girlfriend ? lol jk . <|endoftext|>
i dont either but i can see why you would . if it was me i would just be honest about what i did and what i didnt . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! did you get a new one ? and what did your dog do when he ate it ? <|endoftext|>
i understand . i am sure it will all be well once you have paid it . : ) <|endoftext|>
probably . . i think it ' s their apartments fault but still . . so inconsiderate ! <|endoftext|>
i guess you really need to do something about this , then . your best option is to move right where they are . <|endoftext|>
what do you in trouble with ? are you the kind of person that goes above and beyond for somebody elses sake . <|endoftext|>
why do you say that ? have you had an argument with someone ? or do you just hate people ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s really exciting , i ' m sure it ' ll be difficult to continue your health insurance . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome . what career did you start ? and what was it ? you were in the field you wanted to be in then ? <|endoftext|>
yeah dentist visits are the worst . glad you enjoyed yours so much ! do you have any other appendications that make you on edge ? <|endoftext|>
yea i can only imagine . i hope it gets better with time , and you get through it . <|endoftext|>
wow , so impressive . what kind of job ? something that would be useful for him ? i ' m a bit iffy on google , but that ' s ok . <|endoftext|>
thank you ! i appreciate it ! i need to keep going ! it ' s going to take some time to prepare . i ' m ready to face the task of my life . <|endoftext|>
that is a funny idea ! we could end up marrying brinic ! i wouldn ' t mind that at all ! ! <|endoftext|>
oh you have a red sox fan . that makes sense , since you were watching a baseball game . they do have a good chance though ! <|endoftext|>
it sounds like your mom is a talented chef . it must ' ve been beautiful when they did it . <|endoftext|>
what kind of car will you get ? ! ? ! ! ? i ' m so excited for you . <|endoftext|>
i have a toyota that i love ! i have been in the car for over 20 years and it has not been hit . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i would have almost died too ! what happened next ? ! ? ! ! ! ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad he was able to get the dog and deal with it ! i would have done the same thing ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s really nice of her . it sounds like she appreciates it . so cool of you <|endoftext|>
that does sound like a tasty piece of cheese ! how interesting . . . i have never even tried a cheddie before . . are they nice ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s from oregon ! so delicious ! i can ' t wait to try it on pizza . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . its nice to not have to deal with drama . its also nice to have someone around to bond with <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible . that ' ll make you very sad . how are you coping with the loss ? <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s really cool . did he ever come back ? was it for work or something ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! sounds bad ! where at least it might be sunny if you go to the right place ! <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that . i hope it gets good soon . its just gonna rain here tomorrow . <|endoftext|>
oh no , that sounds good to me ! how do you feel about that ? i ' m guessing you ' re just not looking ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s wonderful . i wish the best for you . i am sure they will be glad you were able to unwind and help out their future . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a lot of fun . i have never done that before . were you able to spend time with your family ? <|endoftext|>
oh what happened next ? ? did you have a drink or something ? hope you are ok ? <|endoftext|>
me too ! i feel we are headed in the right direction though . there are too many crazy people in this world <|endoftext|>
i don ' t see why we can ' t , all we can do is try . it ' s not our fault . <|endoftext|>
i ' m really sorry to hear that . i ' ve lost both of my parents so many times . it ' s weird how quickly they pass . <|endoftext|>
that is so sad . i am really happy you are there and could use a friend right now . <|endoftext|>
why is that ? is there something wrong with your self ? or , i ' m just not used to being so sad and lonely the last few days ? <|endoftext|>
is your dad okay ? that must have been hard . how did they react ? did you try to reason with him ? <|endoftext|>
oh cool , what music is playing ? i love music . how long have you been going ? <|endoftext|>
yes - my brother actually grew up with them as a child ! what a great family you have ! <|endoftext|>
how did it go ? did you get any interesting tips from her ? i hope it turned out well ! <|endoftext|>
that is insane . someone should hire someone that does that for me ! i swear we need new apartments everywhere . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a really stressful time . what are they studying ? are you going to start them up ? <|endoftext|>
good , stay safe ! don ' t forget shoes and supplies ! we need more parents like you <|endoftext|>
oh how exciting . where was it at ? did you guys do anything fun ? was it a special occasion ? <|endoftext|>
sounds like it ! it ' s always nice to hit a beach ! what kind of place did you go ? <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s so much . and why did you decide to take them ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
wow ! that ' s a big one . you won it all ? that ' d be cool , too . i once won a 1000 jackpot in a raffle ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! it ' s good that you were happy ! sometimes you just get to win when it ' ll be yours . <|endoftext|>
yes it is great news . and he is going to be able to buy something fun for you . <|endoftext|>
i don ' t have any kids but i am very proud of you for standing up for your family . <|endoftext|>
are you happy for him ? what did you guys do ? i know it can be so much fun ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s so cool . do you guys still work together ? ! : ) what kind of car did you get ? <|endoftext|>
lol , i am sorry to hear that , maybe you can try asking them to pick a different place ? <|endoftext|>
they usually get what they want - a nice house , a good car , but they don ' t even realize it until they look in the eyes of someone else . <|endoftext|>
i ' m with you . sue for what ? you can get fired for anything ! good luck . <|endoftext|>
why do you say that ? is it because of the weather ? or because of work ? if either of those are curious . <|endoftext|>
i do the same . i was out on a limb here and said you definitely deserved it . <|endoftext|>
oh really ? why do you feel disappointed ? is there something else going on ? do they have some bad ties ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . maybe you should invest in an eyesite and spend it on those exciting times you have together . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , sorry to hear that . is there something you can do to help with the eating trouble ? <|endoftext|>
yes , that ' s true . if you have to change your diet , it won ' t be cake or soda . it will be something else that will make you feel miserable . and that might be the biggest step for you as well . it ' ll be good for you to think ahead though , and i ' m sure you will be alright . what is the secret to the diet ? <|endoftext|>
it can be very scary . i am glad to be on the side of not falling in so tight and getting hit by a tornado . <|endoftext|>
i hear you there , you have to keep at least some water and citronella candles handy at all times ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds like fun ! are you having it ? is it your favorite one ? ! i love those who are trying to go out and have wedding parties . <|endoftext|>
that is so nice of him . i am happy for you ! ! ! if you didn ' t get it yet . <|endoftext|>
do you know where ada took the photos of ? my girls are taking my girls . it was so sweet seeing him in the shot <|endoftext|>
why does it make you miss your moms decor ? is there something in particular that made you miss it ? <|endoftext|>
nice , sisterinlaw are awesome ! they are always there for you ! : ) <|endoftext|>
well that is very nice . how old is she ? younger kids can be very helpful when needed . <|endoftext|>
did you make it back home to the beach on time ? that would have been amazing . i love the beach ! <|endoftext|>
wow , that is a long drive for , but luckily , you can skip the driving and still enjoy yourself ! <|endoftext|>
aww ! that ' s great ! i hope it works out for him . does he have a good work ethic ? <|endoftext|>
you should be ! there are so many poor and innocent kids out there and that ' s just tragic . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s kind of a cute boyfriend . i hope your pets were ok ! what pets ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , there are a lot of people who would just lose their pets and it definitely takes a toll on them mentally . glad you had a safe weekend . <|endoftext|>
do you still trust her ? or was she just super mean ? if you say you trust her , i would just try to not believe her . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that , but it ' s good that you ' re looking for someone more committed . <|endoftext|>
what was the shadow of ? did you find out who it was ? ? ? ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that is scary ! i would be so scared to death ! ! . it sounds like you saw an intruder , which makes sense since your home is haunted ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds fun ! what movie was it ? were you all really having a good night ? ! <|endoftext|>
i think that ' s part of the reason that i like going outside a lot . less drama . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry . you know what is worse ? losing a family member . i ' ve been there . <|endoftext|>
riley ! that ' s so cute ! thank goodness for that ! i know mine would ' ve been hard on me otherwise . <|endoftext|>
you ' re a good friend for being responsible . you should feel ashamed for all the other bad things that you did . <|endoftext|>
it can do that to a child . there are a lot of circumstances where a child could be taken from her . <|endoftext|>
i have heard that too , have you found anything about it ? i also get a little sick when my dog is suffering so i know that you are trying to . <|endoftext|>
i hope you do well . what is your major take on the medication ? i hope it works out for you . <|endoftext|>
that sounds really frustrating . what do you think you can do about it ? are you going to find out who she is ? <|endoftext|>
maybe this is a good way to end the conversation ? offer to mow the lawn , or stay in bed all night or do something else to not wake her up too upset ? <|endoftext|>
oh no . i am so sorry . that is hard for everyone . i think a lot of parents would be upset too . <|endoftext|>
i can only imagine , i wish there was something i could do to help . i hope you have many years to grieve . <|endoftext|>
how much did you win ? that must have been so exciting . . . how much was the lottery ? <|endoftext|>
cool . i hope you receive good news . i ' m very jealous . i need new clothes . <|endoftext|>
that is great . you will be able to make more money in upcoming months . that is a great plan . <|endoftext|>
what happened ? what was that ? ? ? i ' m afraid to hear ! ! ! were you shoplifting ? <|endoftext|>
that is no good , are you alright ? any police officer there ? any postive on camera ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow , does she not realize that he is her friend ? or was he not paying attention <|endoftext|>
i guess it worked out for him , or maybe he felt bad about something . nobody knows the secret to life . <|endoftext|>
what happened ? everything is alright right ? what was it bad about ? everything happens for a reason . <|endoftext|>
omg , i never get those . i get it when people leave theirs on the porch or on the wall <|endoftext|>
i know how that can be . sometimes you just have to hang in there and let the others get the hang of it . if you have friends that already have kids , then perhaps you ' ll be able to find another house to hang out with them . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . so you won ' t have to worry about getting a camera for the guests <|endoftext|>
i love mexican food ! what did you get ? did you have some of your own ? how did it taste ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s understandable . at least she is getting to see you during her next few hours . <|endoftext|>
ohhh studying has its benefits but i believe you can do it ! ! ! just do your best and you ' ll do great ! <|endoftext|>
good luck . i have a microbiology class as well , pretty nervescience . it ' s a great class ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a lot of fun . who were the opposing team in the game ? that ' s the only question i have . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s interesting . i don ' t get to them often . it ' s always the football season . <|endoftext|>
that is so sad . i hate that ! how did you catch it ? did you end up finding it ? <|endoftext|>
yes , i live in texas , and i imagine it was scary ! just keep kicking away from it <|endoftext|>
oh , i ' m so sorry to hear that . my mom has been through a lot of hard things with my dad too , and it is always hard to be there for family . you must be lost in loss too . <|endoftext|>
i am so sorry to hear of your loss . please take the time to grieve . you will be able to think about him and think positive ! i am sure you are still a good person <|endoftext|>
maybe you should invite some friends over for a bit ? get out all you friends and then go watch a horror movie or something . <|endoftext|>
lol maybe . we got a cat who is quite obsessive with her eyes , and she spooks her hands at the stars when it ' s too super fast , so that ' s sometimes it <|endoftext|>
wow congrats ! that is great news . you must be so happy . how long will you stay there ? <|endoftext|>
awww , that ' s amazing . my husband got to live in the military for a little over 6 years , but it really helped us because our family moved so much for our first time and we really preferred it over the military . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! congratulations . she still has to study hard and study hard for the graduate school award . <|endoftext|>
oh really ? ! what kind ? like candy ? or just so many ? i know how you feel , my friend . resist the temptation ! <|endoftext|>
it really is , especially diet . so hard to start ! i keep thinking of how i wanted to lose weight years ago because all the options were terrible ! you ' re doing a great job either way ! keep it up ! <|endoftext|>
did you flip it or something ? i would have been so scared . what happened afterwards ? did you run into any big cities ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , or pepper spray . i really don ' t think the police should have to do anything for you , it is a privilege to have a weapon in your home . <|endoftext|>
that is too bad . did you spoil anything ? i am guessing you must have been anticipating something , hopefully it gets better this season ? <|endoftext|>
ah yeah i can see that . mine are more like that too . one of my friends just has a big evil heart and runs around killing everything <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a wonderful night . what is your favorite show ? i have been thinking about looking for a new favorite tv show . <|endoftext|>
mine have been too . are you planning on changing her diet ? how about taking an edge off on her natural food intake ? <|endoftext|>
oh , how are you holding up ? are you worried about being alone in a new place ? <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! how do you feel about the change ? that must be a pretty scary experience for him . <|endoftext|>
i am so happy for you ! did you have any weird feelings ? or just want a new home ? <|endoftext|>
i bet that makes it so much fun , it can be a lot of fun to get outside with the kids ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! are you alright ? how are you feeling ? are you worried ? are there any serious health problems ? <|endoftext|>
oh that is not good . must have been a really busy day . did they take care of you ? <|endoftext|>
tabby is very hungry , did you find her food yet ? is he scared ? do you think he wants your food ? <|endoftext|>
he is so cute . i love cats ! what breed is he ? p ) ) ) <|endoftext|>
oh no , was it a scam ? i have always had . . . horrible phone call . <|endoftext|>
well maybe you could send them a pizza so they can have more free food ? ; ) or a movie ? <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! what is the name ? my favorite kind of animal . . . poop ? <|endoftext|>
i know right . i was so shocked . i would have been too afraid to say no . <|endoftext|>
yeah , me too . i love halloween . i ' m taking my nephew . we go to halloween very lot . <|endoftext|>
was it really terrifying ? because i can ' t imagine anyone being a doctor . i think i would get tired of it quick . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful . i can ' t imagine how you feel . i hope things are doing better for you now . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a relief to hear ! were you home ? ? i hope everyone is ok . <|endoftext|>
did you end up finding your way ? i ' m guessing you could find out where you were going before you realized you couldn ' t be complete . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , glad that finally happened . was the man able to get you out ? ! ! ? <|endoftext|>
wow , how did that go ? was it fun ? were you nervous ? how did it go ? <|endoftext|>
did you all celebrate ? if so , is this her last year ? what is her specialty ? <|endoftext|>
okay , what was the movie about ? did you enjoy it ? i don ' t think i could ever endure that with a horror movie <|endoftext|>
i feel your husband has the same feelings as you do . i know exactly what you are talking about . <|endoftext|>
wow , mustve brought back a lot of memories . did you find some new ones ? what did you end up doing with them ? <|endoftext|>
i bet . keep up the great work ! keep it up ! you got this ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that . try to keep in touch with some other friends . you never know when something will happen . <|endoftext|>
it is ! i ' m ready to go now ! it ' s going to be awesome . <|endoftext|>
what did you do ? did you call the police ? did anything happen ? ! ? ! ! ? <|endoftext|>
oh no , well that sounds like a scary situation . was he nice ? i imagine he must have been though . <|endoftext|>
wow . i am sure you are proud ! what kind of car ? congrats on the new addition . how did it go ? <|endoftext|>

i wish i had the budget for a vacay like that . i ' m really looking forward to being with my family <|endoftext|>
nice . i ' ve never been . i feel like i should learn and take my grandma ' s side of things though . <|endoftext|>
what a strange friend . sorry you got hit on ! how did you react ? ? ? i hope you left <|endoftext|>
hopefully you will never meet another person like that ever again . i am so sorry that happened to you . <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . we went on vacation to japan . when did you go ? are you going again ? <|endoftext|>
i completely understand . it ' s always hard to do that when you lose a loved one . <|endoftext|>
wow ! i would be so happy for you if that was my money . and congratulations on the 200 ! <|endoftext|>
its a great idea , i will do it myself . what did you use it for ? a special occasion ? <|endoftext|>
he must be doing a great job ! i am sure he appreciated the effort ! i bet you were very proud . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome . what is the award for ? did you participate in any collegues activities ? <|endoftext|>
hopefully they don ' t ask you to pass or anything . do you want to do well ? <|endoftext|>
oooh i ' ve never heard of self shame . but that is very bad from her . why did she need to do it ? <|endoftext|>
that is good . everyone needs a ways to get away from bad bosses ! it ' s one of life ' s few advantages in life . <|endoftext|>
wow . that ' s terrible . why didn ' t she get him anything for christmas ? did he accept ? <|endoftext|>
that is such a great little guy to raise . i hope he cheers up in the future ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . that sounds really embarrassing . did anyone see or hear it happen ? <|endoftext|>
how did he fall ? don ' t worry too much about it . there ' s much better fish in the sea . <|endoftext|>
we have the same exact situation . its great . i hope i can make that kind of determination in my life . <|endoftext|>
that ' s very important , i ' m sure you two will have much happy breakin years ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow , that ' s awesome ! are you doing fine at all now ? i hope ? <|endoftext|>
was it a good one ? i think i would ' ve enjoyed it more if i were you . <|endoftext|>
are you going to a house party or something ? have you ever thought about going out to watch any old movies ? <|endoftext|>
it is exactly the same . i ' m very satisfied with my meal . i do not crave any more dessert like ice cream or chocolate anyway . <|endoftext|>
how old are they ? i know it will be tough , but as long as they are in school and being good children will come with you . <|endoftext|>
i can see that , it seems like an overwhelming experience , but once you have a few in the family it gets a bit easier to see why they ' re in the house . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! so many people don ' t realize how much time is spent studying now . <|endoftext|>
haha . sometimes we have to take time for ourselves . you will do great . enjoy yourself <|endoftext|>
that ' s wonderful ! does the husband know you guys are planning this secret trip ? p <|endoftext|>
i love tunica ! ms . i ' m in florida . i bet you guys had a great time there . <|endoftext|>
it ' s hard to be honest with ourselves sometimes . what did she say ? were you able to admit it ? <|endoftext|>
well , that was rash of course . i ' m glad that she didn ' t yell at you and tell you your friend was cheating on you , or something . <|endoftext|>
nice ! are you going alone or with anyone ? did you win in the reward for winning it ? <|endoftext|>
well it ' s nice here i guess but the beach is my favorite . the food is great and the weather is great <|endoftext|>
that is awesome ! how much did you win ? ? ? ! ! ? ! ? that is my dream vacation ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
wow . well maybe something more expensive will come along . : ) i am sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
i am sorry . . . i know how you feel . it is sad to lose good friends . . what did you guys decide to do ? <|endoftext|>
i hope it works for you . just remember that the other person in the car is trying to butter you up as well . <|endoftext|>
oh my god . that ' s horrible . it must make you mad . how much was your accident ? <|endoftext|>
i hope it was at least worth the price of the car ! i would be very angry if my little cousins stole my family from me ! <|endoftext|>
aw . . . were they upset about something or did you just want them to be back there ? <|endoftext|>
i bet you are nervous at first . i have felt the same when my cat was passed away . it ' s tough but i believe that you will get over it . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you ' re enjoying life . are you married ? children ? money ? everything else ? <|endoftext|>
yea i hate him right now he is trash ! ! ! 1 ! ! lol ! ! <|endoftext|>
oh what did you get ? what was it ? ? ? it sounds exciting and exciting ! ! <|endoftext|>
you should get it for herself ! ! ! you deserve it ! ! : ) it would only take a couple of days ! <|endoftext|>
what did she do ? ? was it a bad vase ? ! ? ! ! ? i hate when something broke on me ! <|endoftext|>
true , but it wasn ' t your fault at all either ! so how did it end up ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! what a terrible thing to do . are you going to try to help her ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow . its always good to see old people that you care about . im sure being gone helps alot . <|endoftext|>
no i ' ve never seen that show but i ' m glad it ' s getting a good amount of exposure . what showings do you watch ? <|endoftext|>
they sound super talented and talented ! i am sure they will be very good characters . i bet they will keep it up . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s terrible . i would have enjoyed eating there . maybe go to subway . or perhaps a new mexican food restaurant . <|endoftext|>
yeah it ' s nice to remember when your life had changing and your childhood was a bit easier . <|endoftext|>
aw , why did you forget ? was it an accident ? do you have a bad memory for it ? <|endoftext|>
i can understand , they are so little they will get bored easily . i took my neice to an experience with a toddler party . <|endoftext|>
that ' s wonderful , i bet he loves you a lot . it sounds like he is a good man . <|endoftext|>
yea i dont see how people could be so cruel to each other ! ! ! i hope the cops can catch the perp ! <|endoftext|>
yeah , we were very tech savy in our younger days . you are right . i am surprised he didn ' t try to charge me while i was at work . i wasn ' t home at the time . <|endoftext|>
i am the same way with family time , but i find that the more people i know the more i feel like i can get to know them better . <|endoftext|>
are you happy too ? have you had a good day ? do you get any presents ? : ) <|endoftext|>
that sounds like it ' s time to take the first steps with the first date , and hope for the best . i hope you have fun . <|endoftext|>
yes , it is such a nice time to think all the life moments you did not get from your childhood <|endoftext|>
yeah no kidding . my daughters do the same . i do the babysitting it is not fun . <|endoftext|>
are you ready for it ? are you basement tight ? i hope you are ready . if not , it may be time to get some water , or get some rain ? stay ready . <|endoftext|>
yes , but i bet that would be a safety hazard . is it raining alot where you are ? <|endoftext|>
thats cool , i do like to buy things sometimes . what ' s it for ? i can ' t order anything this weekend , but it will be the best day of my life ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! i heard that game is really good . i haven ' t played much since the launch <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! that ' s great news . what kind of job is it ? and what was the promotion for ? <|endoftext|>
i bet you feel really appreciated and appreciated . i need to start working at an human resources company myself . good job <|endoftext|>
did you have the right ones or did someone pick one out and make the others messy ? how many do you have ? <|endoftext|>
i feel your pain , its not like its hard to get rid of things like that on a paper plate , its so annoying ! <|endoftext|>
oh man . . . that ' s awful . you guys have to work through this . will you be able to move on or will you have to deal with this situation with his cheating ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a definite possibility . maybe you can search around a bit more for a place to match with your city . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! does she have the time to do it ? ! ? lol . <|endoftext|>
oh true , diapers are the best ! it seems everyone has one now . congrats ! <|endoftext|>
why do you say that ? is it your puppy ? why are you saying that ? are you a bit nervous ? <|endoftext|>
aw , that ' s so sweet . i have a dog myself , actually . i was thinking of getting another one eventually , but decided on having just one , since it ' d be easier . i hope you have a great time with them all ! <|endoftext|>
how do you think you ' ll do ? im proud of you . . . where do you work ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow , i hope that that ' s not the case ! are you going to school for the major you want ? <|endoftext|>
i bet you were a little envious ! what were the items they got ? : ) <|endoftext|>
yes , i think it ' s good to be positive though , so you can get back at them . <|endoftext|>
what is your childhood favorite movie ? i ' ve always enjoyed the classic with beauty and the beast <|endoftext|>
my favorite is the meg . it was a long time ago but it was finally released a couple of months ago . <|endoftext|>
5 what ? are you telling me that your mom just bought you a new house ? ? wow , i ' ve never heard that before . . you must be my best friend . <|endoftext|>
is he moving too soon ? i hope he makes a mistake and stays with you for a while ! <|endoftext|>
i am sure , family gets to hear all the good news ! good luck with your search . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . what ' s wrong ? have you been sick ? ? <|endoftext|>
it may be a little intimidating , but i ' m sure you won ' t . if you really like her , you should write her a letters to her or something . <|endoftext|>
i agree with you there , i hate all the geraint and trump is doing nothing to make our country better <|endoftext|>
me too , there is nothing you can do about it . it happens to everyone . you have to see each others side when you need to be able to be around them . <|endoftext|>
ah that sucks . . what did you all do ? ? did you have fun ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
that must be tough . do you have family that goes there ? i have family in new york that ' s in alaska . <|endoftext|>
ouch ! how embarrassing ! i hope he wasn ' t too badly hurt . did you tell him about it ? <|endoftext|>
that is great . i wish you the best of luck with your job . i hope you get everything you need ! <|endoftext|>
that is horrible , i ' m so sorry . you must have been devastated . how ' d you find out ? <|endoftext|>
i could imagine . losing a pet is never an easy thing . i hope everything is ok . <|endoftext|>
yes that ' s the worst . it ' s like you lose power in a flash flood . <|endoftext|>
it ' s good to be supportive of your local politicians . i hope your friend becomes popular so you can continue to be successful in your work . <|endoftext|>
that s awesome ! you must be excited , did you discover who it was ? ? ! <|endoftext|>
you should file a noise complaint . i hate when neighbors do that ! ! especially in the summer when it ' s hot out . <|endoftext|>
whoa that must have been terrifying ! i can imagine how hard that would have been to clean up ! <|endoftext|>
yeah i hope too too . there is a lot of spider web newerish places on the ground , so i hope you get some sleep . <|endoftext|>
oh , man ! that must be very difficult . are you going to study for it ? how do you think you ' re going to do on it ? <|endoftext|>
you have to get it out of your system , and use it to study more . just be as patient as possible , and it will pay off in no time . <|endoftext|>
oh no . what do you want to tell ? are you nervous ? i ' m sure you ' re probably nervous ! <|endoftext|>
i think that is normal . just use it as an opportunity to practice as much as you can before the speech . <|endoftext|>
oh i bet that helped you . how much did you sell ? did you realize you needed it ? <|endoftext|>
do you usually ? i always choke on weeksdays lol . i ' m in college and one of my roomies goes crazy on those days <|endoftext|>
that ' s a really positive think ! i think i also think that . i think everything will work out , it ' s so wonderful to have a marriage where all the effort goes smoothly and that everything is right . <|endoftext|>
i agree , if they are not trustworthy you should end the relationship first . if they aren ' t trustlike then they are lying to you . <|endoftext|>
wow ! that must have been devastating ! did your family in need ? do you know what happened in the afterof the disaster ? <|endoftext|>
that is pretty messed up . did you end up finding out who did it ? ? ? hopefully it wasn ' t a ghost . <|endoftext|>
that is not good , what happened after ? and what did they do ? i hope the flight wasn ' t longer than 12 hours . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . i like their music , i ' m the kind of music that would give me the opportunity to fly anywhere . <|endoftext|>
congrats ! that ' s amazing news . i ' m sure it will help you greatly in the future too . <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty awesome ! that ' ll teach the students to be more careful when they hang out with each other ! i bet they will do really well in the meeting ! <|endoftext|>
nice , did you catch anything ? i miss dad a lot , they never come home . . <|endoftext|>
i have two and one year old . it can be a handful at first , but i enjoy being able to take some time for us to talk about our loved ones and discuss the needs of our loved one as well . <|endoftext|>
why did you do that ? it is not cool . were you ok ? i would have been mad . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really odd . if that ' syou did not get fired . . . well , i hope you can find another job quickly , <|endoftext|>
crocodile clips are the best gun control ever . seriously . please becareful with your internet drinking . <|endoftext|>
i really do hope so . . . i had a similar thing happen where a battery died . you ' d better believe i had someone help me figure it out " <|endoftext|>
i hear you ! i love the games , but i have to work today so i ' ll be late ! <|endoftext|>
oh okay , i was confused , is he a player or a musician ? i know you said he was a homeowner <|endoftext|>
what did you do ? ? did you break anything ? ? ? hopefully your ok ? ? i know i did , <|endoftext|>
that sounds frustrating . was there a lot of work to done ? i ' d have to mop that mess up ! <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! what a great birthday , you must be proud . can you tell your brother about it ? <|endoftext|>
thats awesome . . . im sure you deserve a promotion . . or maybe a promotion at mcdonalds lol <|endoftext|>
you must have felt quite lucky for the guy . sounds like a nice guy . maybe i can get a good round trip down with me . <|endoftext|>
it ' s kinda annoying that he ' s such a slacker though , he ' ll probably learn that he was wrong about the night sleep schedule and just get up and leave like usual . <|endoftext|>
did he bark ? how big is the dog ? that would of had to be scary for you ! <|endoftext|>
i don ' t know why people still go on a leash . it is very dangerous ! maybe put someone with you that knows dogs better <|endoftext|>
hopefully not , what makes you so unsure ? hopefully it won ' t cost too much to fix . <|endoftext|>
man i am so sorry . thats awful . enjoy the house while you can . you will be safe . <|endoftext|>
that sucks , do you have a suspect ? i would be so mad ! . that happened to me too and i was in an awful neighborhood so i was very frustrated <|endoftext|>
i don ' t either . the world has changed so much . some people just have no integrity . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s really cool . are you gonna go more regularly or will you only be doing it once ? <|endoftext|>
what kind of scene was it ? sounds like you must have really put in a lot of work to do that . <|endoftext|>
what a cool guess ! must have been fun hearing their voice and the music . . and seeing what they sound like on the walls . <|endoftext|>
oh sorry i didn ' t mean to , that is awesome though , so amazing ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that is cool . bowling is my favorite sport . was it expensive ? i only have cheap bowling shoes . <|endoftext|>
i can understand that . i think if you go back to the old ways , you might discover some new ways to play ! <|endoftext|>
oh no . was there an obstacle test ? i ' m so sorry about your dog ' s poop ! <|endoftext|>
oh yea . well i hope they had a good time ! i like hanging with my friends ! <|endoftext|>
great . when are you done ? that sounds amazing ! ! congrats ! ! ! what phase are you starting <|endoftext|>
i wish you all the best ! i wish luck on your search . i know you will go far . <|endoftext|>
we all make mistakes , i am happy for you ! good luck ! ! ! hopefully it will all pay off <|endoftext|>
well if it helps you in some ways it doesn ' t necessarily mean that it isn ' t going to do well . . just know that it is <|endoftext|>
that ' s great that you ' re feeling that way . that can really make you recharge your brain . <|endoftext|>
yes i am sure you have prepared very well for this . i have to admit it is a bit daunting but i had that same feeling in my last college <|endoftext|>
thats really good luck . i would be jealous as well but i guess thats life lol <|endoftext|>
i hate when that happens . you get used to a place . it ' s not that far different than a home purchased for cheap once you get into the yourself . <|endoftext|>
that stinks . did anyone help you fix it ? lol bowling is great fun though , and very relaxing . <|endoftext|>
that ' s crazy ! when i was young we used to play football in the kitchen because the name stuck with me so it looked like we were on fire . <|endoftext|>
did you talk to him about it ? i ' m sure he ' ll understand . it ' s a cheap car to begin with . <|endoftext|>
i hope so too ! he just said he doesnt value them lol . guess i better find out for myself lol <|endoftext|>
nice ! what kind of car did you get ? it will hopefully be a newer version of the one you had before . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! i ' ve been waiting forever for my car to start . i know what i ' m getting for christmas <|endoftext|>
good ol ' nostalgia . what is your favorite playlist ? mine is plays" by metallica . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like fun ! i wish i could go to one of those shows ! too bad they aren ' t in town anymore . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . how is he now ? i hope he ' s alright . <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean . i hope everything goes well ! it ' s always nervewracking waiting to hear a response . <|endoftext|>
yay ! you must be so excited and anxious about your new place ! are you going to move there permanently ? <|endoftext|>
what a nice place to see the new place and hear everything about it ! that ' s what ' s most important and sadly sometimes more important is not the places they open to you , but the places you have open to them . <|endoftext|>
that was mean , did you hit it ? i hope it wasn ' t hurt anyone . if not , you can get a refund . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i ' ve been there ! it happens to everyone , so don ' t worry . were you able to laugh about it ? <|endoftext|>
thats awesome . are you going with family ? ! i know how hard it can be . <|endoftext|>
well i am sure it will be fun to see who you guys talk too . i bet you are very excited ! <|endoftext|>
i bet that was awesome ! did you go there for progress or fitness tips ? that sounds like a great achievment ! <|endoftext|>
i think its great you can only get one hand in a knittback . keep doing good ! <|endoftext|>
thats great , maybe we both will be ecstatic ! what ' s coming to you most about the next months ? <|endoftext|>
well that is good news . congratulations on finally moving the needle ! i bet your going to love this time . <|endoftext|>
that sounds really cool ! i bet that will hurt when he hits it ! how did he make it ? <|endoftext|>
you must be so proud , i hope he keeps getting better ! ! ! does he try to play professionally ? <|endoftext|>
oh no , is the noise still there ? it may be ok . i suggest turning the sounds down slightly next time . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad it worked for you and for them ! that ' s how you can tell if someone is actually messing with you ! <|endoftext|>
i guess it ' s just something of relative value , i hope things work out for you two . <|endoftext|>
ha ha . no kidding . . . classical music would be a good start . my grandma used to play some kind of music in her car in the holidays . . and we ' d ride our bikes around . <|endoftext|>
uh oh . what was it ? did you figure it out ? that does sound strange . what did it do ? <|endoftext|>
oh , man , that ' s so gross ! i hate snakes ! i hope it wasn ' t any big one , either ! <|endoftext|>
it must be exciting . will you see them soon ? ! ? ! : ) i bet it is awesome . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure they will be happy to know he ' s in the mix and not just a boon haha <|endoftext|>
yeah , those were the good old days . especially christmas because those were so much fun ! lol <|endoftext|>
i will not be living in this neighborhood again , it is so boring now , i like to go to the beach but i dont like spending time with them <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . i hope to have that happen one day ! i just don ' t think i know what to expect when it comes to job offer ! <|endoftext|>
it is , and i try not to think about it too often because then i tend to overthink too much . <|endoftext|>
woah thats pretty scary . what was it ? ghost ? what was he ? a clown ? <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness ! that scary stuff is never fun when you are in a wheelchair ! i ' m glad you and your neighbor are okay ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good thing . don ' t forget that when you start losing weight you ' re going to be hungry forever . <|endoftext|>
you can also try following a diet . it can help you feel more energetic and feel fresh when you eat a healthy meal . <|endoftext|>
wow , i would be jealous . what kind of car ? do you like it ? lol <|endoftext|>
lol , yeah it just really sucks seeing someone else drive a chevy . i am thinking of buying a new car myself <|endoftext|>
oh , i see . well , i ' m sure you ' ll get the best deal possible . i ' ve used craigslist a bunch of times , and it ' s not that bad . it ' ll probably be a quick sale . <|endoftext|>
that really stinks to miss him . i hope you are able to covisit him during the holidays so he can be more comfortable . <|endoftext|>
nice ! are you really looking forward to it ? i know a few people that are looking for their apartments and it ' s nerve wrecking . <|endoftext|>
i hope you are also able to move ! do you have any concrete plans for next year ? <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . are you okay ? is that a good thing or a bad thing ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s horrible , but it sounds like you have a good law enforcement officer now . hope things work out for you . <|endoftext|>
what about all that food ? are you going to be okay ? are y ' all going to have to save up for something ? <|endoftext|>
yes i agree it is hard not to take them for granted . it can also be as a means to an end . <|endoftext|>
wow , i have never even heard of a sawing machine . sounds interesting ! do you like having the saw set up for you ? <|endoftext|>
are they expecting a baby ? have you had any ? sounds like a wonderful time ! cherish them <|endoftext|>
how exciting ! did you visit him after ? i hope you got to see him a lot . <|endoftext|>
it sounds like it . i ' m glad you have something in the cards for now , and the phone was able to work out . i think phone calling is the worst lol <|endoftext|>
how long have you been family ? why do you think you are lucky ? ; ) im happy to hear that you spend time with your family <|endoftext|>
always grateful is the word . we have to cherish every moment . i am glad you are doing better now <|endoftext|>
she sounds like a love machine ! what kind of dog is she ? does she give a lot of kisses ? <|endoftext|>
i have a cat , but she is older . i still love her as well . i have 3 dogs that are grown up . you ? <|endoftext|>
i remember being a little nervous too but luckily most schools are super chill and don ' t really care about your grade or the grade you take . <|endoftext|>
yep and i like having time with them now that i ' m starting college . so many new memories . <|endoftext|>
i feel the same way . i think that everyone has their place . how do you feel about the situation ? <|endoftext|>
don ' t worry . i am sure everything will work out just fine . just need a bit of time before you get to it . <|endoftext|>
what do you have on hand ? i ' m sure you ' re ready ! ! ! we always need a lot of stuff ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure you can as long as you keep your head up . i doubt anyone else can though . <|endoftext|>
that is exciting ! do you have any other big plans for him ? or is he just excited for the new opportunity ? <|endoftext|>
those are great options . he better be careful out there ! ! ! don ' t wanna sugars get into town with those crazy drivers ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome , what type of car ? i don ' t know how much money i should be making because my job just got me into it . <|endoftext|>
they really are , i wish i was afford one lol . good luck ! ! ! i hope you are able to get one soon ! <|endoftext|>
so what happened next to your husband ' s family ? i hope you were able to avoid the crash . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it was . glad they ' re okay . i ' d say send them out to the local park , if you don ' t mind <|endoftext|>
that is sad , i know how that feels . when my daughter ' s birthday was just wednesday i cried like a baby because i was holding her and the cake was my favorite dress . <|endoftext|>
she will experience those memories as well as you will . kids grow up so fast . enjoy the time while you can . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good thing . not many people realize how much better they have it . i do . <|endoftext|>
that ' s okay . now you ' ve got some exercise . i think we all have an entered function somewhere in our brain . well , i ' m glad you got to work out ! <|endoftext|>
did you eventually buy everything ? i bet you will now that you have found your perfect place . <|endoftext|>
that sounds delicious ! i ' m not familiar with indian food . but i ' ve never had thai food before so i ' ll check it out ! <|endoftext|>
have they been used in the past ? have they changed the look ? i know they are popular things today . <|endoftext|>
what do you think some strange things to try ? that sounds like fun . it ' s always good to find new things to buy . <|endoftext|>
why did he scared you ? was it something bad ? ? ? i am a parent and can totally relate ! <|endoftext|>
was it something you could kill ? haha ! did you try to get it ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! sounds terrible ! how long have you guys been working on the boat ? and where did he get cut ? i ' m assuming it was from hard work ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , he did get stitches but that doesn ' t help that my son is quite young . it ' s going to cost me a fortune to get a new puppy . <|endoftext|>
i didn ' t know that . how sad that happened . he was a good guy . . . at least . <|endoftext|>
oh yes . . there is so much we can do but we just can ' t do anything <|endoftext|>
you are right . there is need to be a higher minimum of allowed shootings . i just wish people would get the help they need . <|endoftext|>
that must have been tough , it ' s good to be able to see your grandmother . do you see her often ? <|endoftext|>
that is such a nice surprise . i bet you were so happy and appreciated . and i am happy you got to see her again . <|endoftext|>
wow what a lucky day for your mate ! what an amazing event ! i love how lucky people are ! <|endoftext|>
sounds like such a great night - you ' re all quite lucky to have so much fun in one night ! <|endoftext|>
i didn ' t know until my 5th grade year . i spent three months in the school building <|endoftext|>
it really does . and then you can imagine all the work they have to do now to get those little bump in the road . i can ' t wait until they are both adults . <|endoftext|>
that was really nice of him . do you live near where the value might be located ? also , have you ever lived in an earthquake ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s so much better when it ' teams up . the other team is more concerned with getting the things done , and the other is more worried about doing a good job . <|endoftext|>
congrats ! it sounds like a big milestone . . you must be so proud ! ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! that is so cool ! when did he start being that good at languages ? : ) <|endoftext|>
what happened to them ? did you ask them why they were gone ? i am curious . ha ha <|endoftext|>
three weeks . . . you had me at 3weeks . lol . what are you going to do with all the free time ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow , that must have brought back some memories ! i bet you are so happy for it ! <|endoftext|>
they don ' t care ! ! people everywhere have cats now i miss my cat ! ! ) we ' ve had to do the same thing for 5 years . . but the bad apples always get to us , i guess . and the good apples always make us think they ' re invincible and can ' t help or care for them , when they actually aren ' t . unfortunately , i have two cats and one is allergic . i ' m also worried because he doesn ' t like them and we have one and he doesn t like cats . . . so it ' s really scary ! <|endoftext|>
wow thats some crazy stuff to go through . sounds like a sad life to me . how do you cope with that sadness ? <|endoftext|>
the badminton class sounds really cool ! i wish we could learn to do those things ! we can only get up in heaven ! <|endoftext|>
oh , i have hulu , but i ' ve never given it a try . what was your favorite show ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s true ! i don ' t have hulu so i really don ' r use it for that , but i do watch them online . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! did your husband know the cat was missing ? i am so sorry about your loss . <|endoftext|>
that ' s too bad . we have a dog that got hit in the face when it was first puppy sitting . <|endoftext|>
yes , it was so unexpected . but the experience made you feel better , right ? i feel you on the loss of all three of your family - ) <|endoftext|>
yes , it was very shocking and i ' m sad to know that is the end of it . <|endoftext|>
i bet you were really surprised by that party ! you must have been thrilled to get to just you and your friends . <|endoftext|>
that is nice . i love doing that . you have the best friend ! ! : ) just kidding . my grandma was always so kind , but recently she changed her whole diet to be a lifestyle , and she ' s changing it to be more of a lifestyle . <|endoftext|>
that is tough . how long are you waiting for ? do you have a lot of assignments ? <|endoftext|>
that is good , i hope you get it ! : ) i feel you , i recently ordered some new clothing for my self and i haven ' t received an update from the website either . <|endoftext|>
me too ! people always think they are more important than anyone else . . it ' s such a sad situation <|endoftext|>
i guess that makes us both heartless ? maybe one day we will get the chance to be the same , instead of being the same person . <|endoftext|>
you ' re so right , christmas is such a great time for families ! i love watching the community make memories with our family . <|endoftext|>
i agree . it ' s really nice to think about when we were kids . now we just wait around in traffic . <|endoftext|>
yeah , that can be really hard to control . i don ' t get it , either . no one should eat out and be expected to do so much . it ' s gross <|endoftext|>
thats insane . some places are pricey . i wouldnt pay that much if i had a job . <|endoftext|>
awesome ! where are you moving to ? it is always great to rehome with new people . <|endoftext|>
is it the weather there your prefer ? i have been love texas it has always been my fav . <|endoftext|>
oh man . a hurricane sounds terrible . did it get any severe ? i live in florida , and it hasn ' t been one yet . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good , it ' s important to care about all your important things ! especially those you care about ! <|endoftext|>
oh how exciting ! it ' s wonderful to connect with people . have you seen them ? do you know them as well ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s wonderful ! you all are lucky to have each other ! do you have kids of your own or have you kids of yours ? <|endoftext|>
i hope she is okay . do you think you ' ll see a funny face ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
that is very scary i am sorry to hear that . i hope she gets better fast . is the surgery scheduled soon ? <|endoftext|>
oh i ' m so sorry to hear that . i know how hard it can be to lose your loved ones . <|endoftext|>
i know exactly how you feel . it is very hard to lose someone you love . we never know how long you ' ll live with her . <|endoftext|>
good thing you packed an extra , extra waterproof , and fire support bag . otherwise you could have been a wreck . <|endoftext|>
thats great . you are very lucky . where did you go . . ? ! ? ! <|endoftext|>
packing is the best way to go in my opinion . to catch up on old times . have fun ! <|endoftext|>
maybe they have an emergency room near by . that way you ' re more likely to see a patient and not be rushed . <|endoftext|>
that ' s nice ! you must be really happy . marriage is so important for a lot of people . <|endoftext|>
you are very lucky . the perfect person for your problem . that must make you feel very good . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a really good time . how did you find the songs ? i love going to the radio and enjoying the bands playing . <|endoftext|>
oh that is such a great group ! is it just you that is excited about your new concert ? <|endoftext|>
did you study ? or did you just prepare and get a good grade ? how did you do ? <|endoftext|>
i am sure you did well ! don ' t give up . even if you don ' te do great , at least you tried . <|endoftext|>
excellent ! i bet he was beaming ! how much is he playing ? ! ? ! i am so impressed . <|endoftext|>
golf isn ' t the same as playing in the golf course ! lol ! i ' m glad he ' s doing well for himself ! <|endoftext|>
you must be so proud of him . i hope he wins ! : ) i know this will be his last match . <|endoftext|>
i ' ve heard a lot of people go through quite a process of doing one so i ' d love to hear how it goes . <|endoftext|>
i am in the us . i wish i could go ! it is on my bucket list ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i ' m just a cat who likes to watch and read and eat . <|endoftext|>
hahaha sounds like it , plus it always good to have a backup plan ! even better when it ' s unexpected like a trip you didn ' t plan too well <|endoftext|>
oh that stinks . . . were they happy with it or did you try to find something else ? <|endoftext|>
i can imagine . maybe you can move in there with someone you like and enjoy the space . <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . did you find out that she was sick ? is it a rare breed ? <|endoftext|>
ugh i feel so sorry for your pet . i think it ' s just best to spend time with them as much as you can . <|endoftext|>
oh that is so nice ! i really wish i had a friend like you ! p ) <|endoftext|>
yeah makes sense , it ' s good you are there . just take care of him . he will soon know you appreciated him . <|endoftext|>
i am sure it was a very satisfying thing to accomplish . education is a great thing to have . <|endoftext|>
i can imagine . i ' m glad you did it ! that must have felt great ! ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m jealous ! do you enjoy being with her at all ? does she have any fun things to do on her free time ? <|endoftext|>
that is impressive , i wonder if her parents will be disappointed in her for not doing that . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that ' s always a bit frustrating when it ' s a good opportunity to throw away the mood lol . <|endoftext|>
i understand , i prefer a nice clean house as well ! you are a good girlfriend ! : ) <|endoftext|>
oh no ! did your parents notice ? that is awful . . . no one could tell you whose fault it was , could they ? <|endoftext|>
did you cut your hair or borrow something from a friend ? i hope you can find a hair that will look as good on you as you can with your new hair . i never use marijuana but it makes me want to . <|endoftext|>
what happened ? ? did something trigger it ? did you eat something else or you were really sick ? <|endoftext|>
that stinks , hopefully it will be fixed soon ! don ' t let them ruin your food . <|endoftext|>
oh no , did anyone see or hear you ? i would have been so mad ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
it was so simple . nothing important was changed . what did you do ? did anyone else see ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s not too bad . do you have any plans to keep her ? have you looked into leaving her on a vacation ? <|endoftext|>
i feel you ! summer just went by so fast . now i have summer and the beach ready to go : ) <|endoftext|>
that could be a tough change for sure . i ' m glad you made an attempt to network though . <|endoftext|>
that would be silly ! you could have found another place to stay . it sounds like you really need a place to live now . <|endoftext|>
yeah , that sounds rough . maybe you can try and move closer to your old place ? i ' m glad you got to experience your city , though . <|endoftext|>
i went to the beach . it was very beautiful . i don ' t think i could ever afford that . <|endoftext|>
is that the weather you ' re looking to go through ? i ' ve always wanted to do that . <|endoftext|>
well that ' s good at least . my friend went camping last year , so i know how camping can be <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that . is she better now ? how is she feeling today ? did she not get enough sleep ? <|endoftext|>
glad to hear that . glad to here that . hope she feels better soon ! ! ! enjoy your babies ! ! <|endoftext|>
me too ! i love summer and the weather . i am excited for school too . i hope mine is as smooth as yours . <|endoftext|>
i guess you had some free time ? that is still great that you weren ' t at home all summer though . <|endoftext|>
i am sorry about that . i had to get a weight loss surgery for my mom as well . i hope she gets well . <|endoftext|>
it will be difficult for her but i would be very worried if she isn ' t listening to you . <|endoftext|>
i completely understand . it ' s a horrible experience to have to deal with . it was a terrible idea to make that choice for yourself . <|endoftext|>
that sucks . i hope you won ' t be as angry as i am . what do you do to motivate you ? <|endoftext|>
oh , that ' s great . any special plans ? it ' s been a great monday too ! <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s great ! where will you go ? ! ? ! ! ? where do you want to go ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that is horrible . im sorry to hear that . what a horrible thing to lose all your animals . <|endoftext|>
the first thing that i thought was your baby probably did something like run away ) but then i realized that ' s just the happiest thing you could do <|endoftext|>
how is he feeling ? is he okay ? im sorry for your loss . is he a nice dog ? <|endoftext|>
well i hope they are not too upset with you . they may want to be left out of the house more . <|endoftext|>
that must be stressful . how did she take it ? and how did it make you feel ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it ' s going to be a great time having company too ! i wish you good luck . <|endoftext|>
wow that must have been a lot of hard finding a new place to live . i can only imagine how stressful that must ' ve been . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it was . it ' s always nice to have good people in your life . <|endoftext|>
i can imagine you are a bit jealous of them . do you visit them often ? i ' m sure it will be fun to see them soon . <|endoftext|>
what are they doing there ? i ' m so happy for you . you have many years of love . <|endoftext|>
oh man , me too . i think the easiest way would be to just look away . they ' re super creepy . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i have a strong feeling your aren ' t too fat either . lol ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s so sweet of her ! were you not able to have it without her taking you out ? <|endoftext|>
really ? that is crazy . do you plan on living there forever ? ! ? ! lol <|endoftext|>
i hate that too . it ' s a reason to hate life sometimes ! can ' t say i don ' t hate it too . <|endoftext|>
kids are weird . i ' ll send mine off to college and he ' ll be playing outside with friends . he is just adorable ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you weren ' t hurt . was everyone okay ? were you able to see who was going to be in trouble ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s probably time for the police to film it . i ' m glad it all turned out for the best . <|endoftext|>
did you try to hold it ? i wouldn ' t have been able to keep my mind off it <|endoftext|>
that ' s ridiculous , that ' d be something they would charge you for . i hope you complained anyway ! <|endoftext|>
well did he survive ! he must be a good baker ! what did you eat ? ? ! <|endoftext|>
oh , you can ' t just go making new bread all the time . some people would like the food . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i love surprises like that ! i hope my husband can provide some next time we are together . <|endoftext|>
what was it ? is it an important gift ? a gift from him that he can ' t replace ? <|endoftext|>
i am so sorry ! sounds like he was an amazing dog . what breed is he ? he sounds like a sweet beagle . <|endoftext|>
he must have been a good listener . it ' s always nice to have new friends ! i bet you miss him a lot . <|endoftext|>
no i don ' t , but my parents had to keep one for a while and really wanted one , so they had to wait for one they loved so much . what kind do you have ? <|endoftext|>
i agree ! and that was my daughter ' s favorite moment ! we were both so proud of her ! <|endoftext|>
well its a valid skill to have ! it ' s not something everyone can learn but it ' ll help you get better . <|endoftext|>
yum , that sounds delicious ! i am jealous ! how long has it been since you have seen him ? <|endoftext|>
that is so great . how did it go ? ? ? ! ! ! ? ! ? good on you for raising a healthy kid . <|endoftext|>
that sounds great . algebra is easy . i love going to college and taking algebra classes . what is his final grade ? <|endoftext|>
that is great news , how long has it been ? ? ? how long have you been training ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! so you ' re taking care of yourself , that ' ats great ! good for you ! <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s a bit nerve wrecking ! i hope everything goes well and you ' re able to enjoy the first few hours with the moms ! <|endoftext|>
you are most welcomed . you can even take one day a week just to relax . i did that all week . <|endoftext|>
that sounds really fun though , and sad at the same time . how ' d it go ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s crazy ! i bet you were scared . do you think you ' ll make it to the next one ? <|endoftext|>
hey you sounded pretty confident ! did you do it well ? i mean you must have been strong . <|endoftext|>
holy metabal" , you are a trysted man . i like that name . <|endoftext|>
yea in the past couple of years . it really sucks . you ? ? ? i hope you are ok . <|endoftext|>
what happened ? please tell me you are okay ! ! ! that sounds terrible ! ! especially the car ! ! <|endoftext|>
awh , that ' s so sad . is she feeling any better now ? have you tried distracting her with hobbies or productive chores ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s very sad that that happened to your mother , i ' m sure your family is devastated as well . <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty nice . did you try to pay it back or are they going to compensate you ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure you will find a new job in no time ! don ' t let too much stress get to you though , just take it as an honemoon <|endoftext|>
yes , it was horrible . i talked to my friend about it , and she was very compassionate . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really terrible . i ' m sorry . are there plans to move forward with the medical examiner ? <|endoftext|>
yes but we rescued her not too long after she passed away . have you ? ? ? i love puppies <|endoftext|>
do you know what type of dog you have ? maybe that will help him recharge . if not , you can try some noise cancelling headphones ! <|endoftext|>
oh man , you must have felt nostalgic ! that is a great idea ! do you do that often ? <|endoftext|>
oh man ! that sucks . what are you going to get it to cheer you up ? that might be an important piece of jewelry . <|endoftext|>
oh , that ' s crazy ! have you ever found them in the last years ? what happened to the note ? <|endoftext|>
i can imagine ! maybe he will realize how messed up that situation is and forgive you ! and you can laugh about it now ! <|endoftext|>
you could always ask for an investment place . the utilities are insane ! maybe get a credit card <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it is frustrating to have to spend 300 just to fix a ceiling light . i would be 1 too . <|endoftext|>
oh , how did that help you ? were you able to go through it ? did you manage to find the right thing ? <|endoftext|>
aw , you ' re so lucky to have written such a nice story ! you must be really loved . <|endoftext|>
how did it come through ? was it a fine and safe zone ? or did you have to wait for that spot ? <|endoftext|>
awesome ! i am happy it worked out . were you all involved in some way ? did you have fun ? <|endoftext|>
did she ditch you after that ? that was harsh . . im sorry you had to see that . <|endoftext|>
oh no , what happened ? is everything okay ? did you end up going ? if so , how did it go ? <|endoftext|>
oh no . what happened to the backed up backs ? were they all at fault ? i can ' t imagine being stranded at all ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool . do you believe he ' s a rockstar ? i mean who does it in that context ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s crazy ! i don ' t think i could do that ! i can ' t even try to do that as a human being ! <|endoftext|>
what kind of situations ? i ' ve never done it before , but once upon a time i did . <|endoftext|>
oh my god . that ' s so gross ! i can only imagine how bad it was for the cat . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! is there a reason that ' s bother you ? is it because he doesn ' t use his socks anymore ? <|endoftext|>
then maybe you need to train him a little bit . i like to train my dogs before they realize it . <|endoftext|>
how did it go ? how did you love it ? did you ? are you still talking to me ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad to hear that . it must look a lot better now . i only think about cutting my legs sometimes . <|endoftext|>
oh no , what happened ? was everyone impressed ? how embarrassing . . . are you okay ? <|endoftext|>
i ' d be so embarrassed ! have they ever told anyone about the secret ? my anxiety would be with them . <|endoftext|>
wow . . the thrilling i see . did you go and buy it ? ; ) ? <|endoftext|>
absolutely amazing ! ! ! such a great idea , i would have used it as a lesson to move forward honeslty , not a bad idea <|endoftext|>
oh wow , that must be stressful ! did you study for it ? ? i ' m sure you did well . <|endoftext|>
awesome , how long have you been studying ? i ' m on week ' s studying and i have been very slow . <|endoftext|>
oh that does seem like it can be rough when you have a problems . are you able to take it constructs or does it tend to cause more trouble ? <|endoftext|>
you are welcome . i hope it helps . i have been there . its hard when you have to put all of your best efforts to find a good friends . <|endoftext|>
how ' s it going ? do you like her ? ! ? ! i ' m sure she ' ll do great ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s wonderful ! everyone deserves to get a little bit of extra time . your sister sounds like a smart girl ! <|endoftext|>
shopping is fun ! i love it when other people are finally getting what you are waiting for . <|endoftext|>
same ! my favorite time of the year is christmas , i love being in the house with no lights . <|endoftext|>
that ' s too bad . there are better ways to spend that money . . . you know , gambling . <|endoftext|>
haha , that ' s what i ' m saying ! i ' d have gotten sick ! <|endoftext|>
what caused it ? sounds like you were just scared you needed a light . . if you don ' t mind me asking . . . <|endoftext|>
that was brave . i usually would have done the same . still probably could have hurt more . <|endoftext|>
good luck ! it ' ll be my first one too , but i ' m nervous too ! <|endoftext|>
you got it ! good luck . i am sure you will do well . i hope you do very well . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s exciting ! i hope it goes well ! ! ! what is the proposal ? <|endoftext|>
i hope everything goes well ! what kind of questions ? if you are well prepared you can answers them in a day or even a week ! <|endoftext|>
is it a full awake or does it just start running around ? the first tenant of the tenant of my apartment didn ' t wake me up that night . i hate waking up in the morning because i know how bad it can be . <|endoftext|>
that is weird . did you find the right training routine ? it sounds like you maybe have a new puppy in the works . <|endoftext|>
well done ! i wish you the best of luck ! did you already get a good credit or did you have to make a lot of alot of cash ? <|endoftext|>
you ' re quite the nerd there . my husband is in college . i ' m not sure if you ' d fit in either , but whatever you do it ' s done . <|endoftext|>
i ' m surprised it didn ' t more players , that seems to be the norm these days . <|endoftext|>
oh , wow . how did you react ? it must have felt pretty embarrassing . i ' m not sure how they would take that ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m the same way , although i sometimes wish i had someone to talk to , instead of just chatting with . <|endoftext|>
hey at least you were able to go back and have a good time . was it a long trip ? <|endoftext|>
how did that happen ? did you end up with someone else ? maybe you can keep the other person . <|endoftext|>
that is tough ! do you think you can get her back ? maybe you can go through some sort of eviction to help her out . <|endoftext|>
i have never seen the ring . i was too afraid of the scallop cats to go through the trouble of reading a book <|endoftext|>
do you mean the dark or the loud light ? either way i love the light outside . do you get sleep well with the lights off ? <|endoftext|>
oh no , that seems like an embarrassing experience . did you get it fixed ? do you know if it will be as bad as you think ? <|endoftext|>
i ' d have been screaming and running . glad you ' re okay though . : ) ) <|endoftext|>
what do you mean you didn ' t say anything ? did you miss something important ? lol <|endoftext|>
i can tell you that it was the right thing to do ! i hope you get it all sorted out ! <|endoftext|>
that is crazy . what did you do ? did you confront him ? did he give it to you ? <|endoftext|>
wow . did you ask him where he got the money from ? ? that ' s awful . did he even give it ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds really neat . any particular ones in mind or just general questions ? i ' m sure you ' re pretty good at it so i ' ll try and get back to you . <|endoftext|>
lol , that ' s funny , i never think about that . that is a good idea ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good way to start the week ! did it keep bothering you when you took it ? <|endoftext|>

that sounds stressful . did you call out their meat ? i ' m always nervous trying to say my wings . <|endoftext|>
that is terrible . why don ' t they get paid to fix the wreck . the world wouldn ' t be such a place if people could do things like that . <|endoftext|>

i am so sorry . i hope you are able to cope with her . . . i ' m just glad you have someone you can talk talk to about her <|endoftext|>
man that would make me feel terrible for you . how did your friend react ? did he admit he messed up ? <|endoftext|>
that was nice of you . i am glad he was sober enough to take care of you ! <|endoftext|>
no , no one is doing it for you . we are all doing it because we know the 1 in a million chance it happens is enough to prove it is worth it . <|endoftext|>

wow , that ' s awesome ! i ' m also never able to try some craft beer . it ' s too flavour- too beer sidesthat ' d be interesting ! <|endoftext|>
that is such a silly thing to think about . do you think guys that are interested in that kind of thing view you or the other guy as unimportant ? <|endoftext|>
i would as well , but i wouldn ' t want to make myself look like a stupid kid ! <|endoftext|>
i can imagine . he was one my favorites . i feel your pain . . . it ' s been so long . <|endoftext|>
i do too , he must have worked his way up . you sound so close to us . <|endoftext|>
that was nice of them . were you nervous ? did you want a different drink ? i always get my own . <|endoftext|>
i bet it was even better than you expected . you were so kind and made that whole trip worth it . <|endoftext|>
that ' s so sweet ! did the twins like the peachy cheese ? you must have been a happy family . <|endoftext|>
that is really good , animals need all the help they can get . its sad when you do things like that . <|endoftext|>

she must be a talented athlete ! is she going to be going back for her graduate school ? <|endoftext|>
did you tell him you were leaving ? does he have any leads on when you are leaving ? <|endoftext|>
good for him . i know it takes a lot of hard work to break up with a significant other . <|endoftext|>
that sucks ! did they compensate you at least ? it happens to the best of us . did they even understand what you were getting from it ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it is , but at least you get something of yours . do you mind taking the time out for a few days just to relax ? <|endoftext|>
they don ' t care ! i hope you complained to the city ! that is just gross . <|endoftext|>
it is good that the cops were able to find who it was . it is not like you could be forced to pay a fine . <|endoftext|>
ooo ! good for him ! how did it turn out ? ? ? ! ! ! ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds really exciting ! but do you know him well enough to know that he ' d better attend an event where he could meet the basic needs of the army and become part of the society ? <|endoftext|>
thats awesome i love coffee ! are you getting a chance to start your day now ? <|endoftext|>
it is always a good thing to have some good stuff to make for yourself ! i am sure that your day is going to have a great day ! <|endoftext|>
yes , i can only imagine . i hope everything works out for you . just know that they probably want you to get the job . <|endoftext|>
what ' s the matter with them ? was the time fly ' s by quickly ? i ' m sorry you ' re not getting along . <|endoftext|>
wow . . that is amazing . . . where did he take it ? were they traveling for vacation or simply on vacation ? <|endoftext|>
are you going to go with them ? i could never afford that ! lol d that would be so cool though . <|endoftext|>
that sounds terrible . just in time for what happened ? do you know what happened to your hip ? <|endoftext|>
is it the wife of your boyfriend ? ? i think if so , you are the best couple ever <|endoftext|>
it ' s always nice when you can get back to doing some fun activities together . you have done great . <|endoftext|>
that ' s so sad , so did you get the job ? i ' m assuming you did ? <|endoftext|>
bugging them sounds like a great way to keep them guessing . at least now they know you are not a stranger to them . <|endoftext|>
oh , man . that is long time . how ' s it going ? are you looking forward to school ? <|endoftext|>
well i am sure you will get through it ! poor little pupper . is the dog stressed or upset ? <|endoftext|>
what is your new job ? was it one you wanted ? did you get the job ? or did you have to wait for the right one ? <|endoftext|>
wow that sounds like a tough job . i wish you the best of luck ! ! ! hope you get the boot <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that . have you thought of getting a new phone ? maybe you can download an app that works on his phone <|endoftext|>
maybe there is some good , trustworthy reason . it can also be considered low on the bucket list . <|endoftext|>
that is really hard , i bet it is very stressful having to leave the other . how long do you guys have to move ? <|endoftext|>
maybe you can facetime and have a talk ? that ' s what i do . they have the best headphones ! <|endoftext|>
oh no that ' s awful . hopefully he was able to find it before the fly hit you . <|endoftext|>
well , i hope he knows that you killed it . otherwise , you just made a scary scary living . <|endoftext|>
i do too . it ' s so gross and motherinuitive . i would never be able to sleep otherwise . <|endoftext|>
yeah i would like to go out more but i usually stay home . i hope i don ' t go too often because there is always a lot of tornadoes <|endoftext|>
i hate spiders too ! i am so afraid of them ! especially when you see them in your living room . <|endoftext|>
absolutely ! i mean the size of the animal can be small , the visual aspect , but it still makes me so angry . <|endoftext|>
that is so awesome ! i hope you have a blast ! where are you going ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
yes , do you do things like this often ? have you ever skied the same course twice before ? <|endoftext|>
ah i am so sorry about that . . were you able to get it back ? i know it can be difficult to get your glass back without a break <|endoftext|>
that ' s gross , were you able to find anything ? or was it too big ? i am so sorry ! bugs are too much . <|endoftext|>
how long will it take ? how old will it be ? how can i get a new hip , this is very interesting <|endoftext|>

that ' s too bad . were you able to take her out to eat or watch something or just relax ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow . well that ' s an awesome accomplishment then . so jealous ! lol ! <|endoftext|>
wow , congratulations ! if your apartments can be complained to , you may want to talk to a professional <|endoftext|>
they get so excited , get on tv , and get on their phone at the same time . i get really tired from it . <|endoftext|>
wow , that is really going to take some time to get back into the groove of things , where have you guys gone before ? <|endoftext|>
i bet , i love my dog but she gets really fussy before she spends the day on her bed ! <|endoftext|>
yes it is , i have been preparing for the last 3 years . i am hopeful that this will be a good fit <|endoftext|>

that sounds fun ! how long will it take to build the place ? ? have you seen a building yet ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that must have been embarassing . did your secretary help you up ? she probably should . <|endoftext|>
true ! it ' s ok , all is well . and i am sure you learned from your mistake ! <|endoftext|>
what happened ? why would they empty an airport ? that makes no sense . what happend ? <|endoftext|>
that is so scary , i hate la . its a mess . i ' d like to move there <|endoftext|>

oh no . what did you do ? i hope it was able to get clean . not like it would have if you just left it there . <|endoftext|>
what did you like about it ? did you get to try it ? i hope you liked it ! <|endoftext|>
oh no , i hope you can get it fixed ! maybe next time . . . ? : ) <|endoftext|>
oh i bet . is it usually a huge trancubatory ? like what happened the next day ? <|endoftext|>
i totally understand . i ' ve done something similar . the next time you should be ready . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! he must have a lot of memory acces . hopefully you can teach him to do that better ! <|endoftext|>

that ' s absolutely awful ! my mom had a heart attack too , and i cannot imagine the stress of a holiday with them . so sorry to hear that ! how are you doing now ? <|endoftext|>
you should . that ' s never a good idea . even better is if you convince her something good happened . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great news ! have you posted everywhere online ? is she microchipped ? i have two cat dogs that are microchills . <|endoftext|>
that ' s horrible . i hope you find her and keep her . sometimes , people won ' t tell you what happened , because they assume you ' re dead . i ' m sure she won ' t; t be so sad if she was hurt . <|endoftext|>
i bet that is painful , did you get a refund ? ? it will happen to the best of us <|endoftext|>
yes , mine is pretty bad , but my daughter took a lot of strength classes before her . she worked out a lot , which is good for your back . <|endoftext|>
it definitely was , i didn ' t get the intimidating look at first but it all looked so scary . <|endoftext|>
that is so kind of him ! i hope your family is happy for you ! remission is important <|endoftext|>
i know that feeling . have you used the screen with it in the past ? color fixed the problem . <|endoftext|>

yes the pay is great . what year will you be working in ? my wife was in government for a few years . <|endoftext|>
that must have been so nostalgic . i bet it brought back great memories . did you ever have fun with them ? <|endoftext|>
oh man . why is that ? ! ? i hate those kinds of dreams . did he end up coming home ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s really cool ! and funny ! good job ! ! ! hopefully she says yes ! <|endoftext|>
aww ! that ' s awesome ! is this your first dog ? what kind ? puppy or kitten ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! my dogs are my furbaby too . i don ' t know what i would do without them ! <|endoftext|>
that sucks , i bet you were ecstatic to find it so cheap ! hopefully you can find a new one for cheap , but that is a bummer if they are up for sale forever . <|endoftext|>
you can always wait . you can still save up until you have a certain amount of money . <|endoftext|>
well that sounds like a plan ! i love german chocolate bar and eat them every day for breakfast ! <|endoftext|>
oh no , no thanks for that ! i hope it helps you forget . thanks for being honest . <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible news ! is he feeling okay now ? if not i would definitely take him to the doctor about immediately getting rid of him ! <|endoftext|>
me too , it is so nice to be pets . we are so lucky to be able to . <|endoftext|>

that sounds exciting ! do you play any different species ? i prefer the darker ones . . ditchis the sweer . . <|endoftext|>
yes , but it ' s nice to catch up with a game i once loved . i get to catch a couple of sundays instead of the regular season ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible that it was the worst event . i hope that nothing has gotten worse since then . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you won that over with a positive attitude , that is good . i hope you ' ll continue to improve and be as beneficial as your mom was to you as you can be to her ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! that ' s impressive . i bet it was quite disgusting . what was it ? ! <|endoftext|>
uh oh . hopefully it ' s not something serious ! hopefully it won ' t get you into trouble . my cat does that too , so that ' s the reason i stay near the window . <|endoftext|>
me too , it really is sad to see people suffer in my opinion . i never did it with my own skin but i know how i feel <|endoftext|>
honestly what they should have done is assaulted or assaulted other men , and robbed them . what is up with these people ? <|endoftext|>
yeah that does sound scary ! what was it ? did you figure out what it was ? ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s hilarious ! raccoons are very cute and cute . i hope that was a surprise for you . <|endoftext|>
that is great for you . is your friend a good person ? is your friendship too strong ? <|endoftext|>
do you trust him ? does he write books ? if so that ' s good news . i wish more people would trust people like you . <|endoftext|>
that is pretty terrible ! i would have been terrified ! i don ' t know what i would do if someone were near me like that . <|endoftext|>
awww . he must be very lucky to have someone that care for him like that . <|endoftext|>
i agree . i imagine it would be very scary . have you ever flown one ? i ' ve always wanted one <|endoftext|>
you should call 911 . it may be something bad . how much was it for ? ! ? ! <|endoftext|>
what ' s a yikes . i hope she ' s getting better , from what you ' ve told yourself . <|endoftext|>
oh , that ' s kind of weird . what was her reaction to seeing you ? was she trying to prove something to you ? <|endoftext|>
i bet . i had a dog years ago that was by himself so it was so hard . <|endoftext|>
what happened later ? and what happened next ? was he acting strange during the day ? did you find out what happened afterwards ? <|endoftext|>
maybe he has better days to go , you could check back with him ? or has he still hasn ' t gotten the xray ? <|endoftext|>
i can imagine . i ' m glad they found him and you ' re okay . what are they going to do ? <|endoftext|>
so sorry about that . i hope you can find a suitable new place . i wouldn ' t be mad at you for anything , it ' s just you being on your own . <|endoftext|>
ouch , i ' m sorry to hear that . is everything fixed now ? if not , then you can file a complain with your insurance company to try to cover your hotel cost . <|endoftext|>
where are you camping ? in south texas ? if you ' re in the country with the snow and ice , prepare a backpacks for when it snows ! <|endoftext|>
i know how you feel . my dad lives in florida , and they told me that the roads used to be a lot better . <|endoftext|>

exactly , sometimes they are not even humans and just take it out on you , it is sad <|endoftext|>
oh no . i ' m sorry to hear that . were you able to manage it though ? <|endoftext|>
was the cruise planned where you were going ? what did you do to get away from the bated breath ? <|endoftext|>
i had a blast too when i was at my moms for a couple of days . i loved it . <|endoftext|>
wow ! i have a friend who was a doctor too , and i feel for her , i am sure you are a wonderful parent for taking her <|endoftext|>
ab is very tough . she will be successful . you should take her classes right away . <|endoftext|>
you must have felt really sick . hopefully you can get some rest now . i hate cold though . . so i really wish i could get a day off . <|endoftext|>

that is a scary movie . what is it about ? did you like it ? i have never seen it <|endoftext|>
were you surprised ? it happens to the best of us - were you grossed out ? i would be too <|endoftext|>
ah ! maybe you ' ll be able to find some pretty great deals then ! make sure to look at auto insurance in the future ! <|endoftext|>
yeah it really is ! especially in my state ! did you end up changing companies ? i ' m thinking about trying to sell mine . <|endoftext|>
that is too much . i feel sorry for you . what kind of cake did you eat ? <|endoftext|>
you ' ll be okay . once you start losing weight it all hit together so to speak . <|endoftext|>
oh no . i can ' t even imagine . how did you manage ? were you able to overcome it ? <|endoftext|>
i am sure everything will be alright . maybe there is something you can do to relax your mind <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that ' s really scary ! we have a door closed too so probably not the best place to go <|endoftext|>
i hope you find him . i know it ' s hard to lose a pet . we lost a cat a couple years ago and it was terribly annoying . i was going to suggest putting signs up online that you have to find him and that he was lost , so that you could search for him . <|endoftext|>
i would feel terrible , why didn ' t you meet another one , just her ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it was , especially since you have such a great friend . hopefully everything comes back ok . <|endoftext|>
that is good . i hope things work out for you . money really doesn ' t always turn out well everywhere <|endoftext|>
exactly ! good luck with everything ! ! ! i ' m sure it ' ll be great . : ) <|endoftext|>
congratulations . i bet you are excited ! does he go to college locally ? or do you guys have to be at school locally ? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome . i am sure he is going to do great ! good for you for that guy ! <|endoftext|>
what makes you so picky ? i love everything at home , but sometimes you have to go for something i really want <|endoftext|>
ah , gotcha . sorry about your lunch . do you think there was a damage to the burger ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i hope you were okay ! were you hurt ? you need to be more careful ! <|endoftext|>
yeah probably will be an unpleasant experience after that . i hope you are okay , though . i spilled my coffee on top of my wife when she was having a surprise . <|endoftext|>
what movie was it ? i feel the same way about watching scary movies . i used to be able to sleep when it came out in the night because of how scary they are . now i like to sleep where i am <|endoftext|>
hahaha , that must have been so embarrassing . did you go back later ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s got to be annoying . maybe you should call your landlord ? you need a dog too <|endoftext|>
oh man , i hate that ! i don ' t think i ' d want to deal with it as much as you do . <|endoftext|>
that sounds good ! do you have any friends or family that you can go with ? i feel i should get out more , but i ' m always running out of food . <|endoftext|>
i bet ! its so hard to have fun in the world , but i bet you feel great too ! <|endoftext|>
nice ! did you have to switch jobs ? or just get a new one ? that is great ! <|endoftext|>
retirement is the best time to relax and save . i ' m happy for you . you must feel so relieved ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow that must be fun ? that ' s what i thought about doing but didn ' t . how long have you been teaching ? <|endoftext|>
you are going to have such a wonderful time , teaching 3rd grade and i hope you have a great time . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i ' m so sorry ! losing a pet is a hard thing . it takes a lot of hard work ! <|endoftext|>
well that ' s good . i hope things get better ! ! ! i ' m so sorry you had to experience that . <|endoftext|>
yes indeed . the wait is just too good ! i ' m waiting for that chip and pin thing to arrive ! <|endoftext|>
you should be very careful next time and make sure you use debit card , it may not have been yours <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome , congrats ! will you stay there ? how does that make you feel ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s amazing ! she will make a lot of money . i wish her the best . : ) <|endoftext|>
wow , that is so great ! what was it about ? i ' m not familiar with him but i know he was a great writer . <|endoftext|>
oh yeah i forgot how bad she was talking you . lol . . good job on your credit card <|endoftext|>
my son is off too . but he will make good choices . are you proud of him ? <|endoftext|>
i understand being scared for his future . but staying with him will make him realize how valuable he is . <|endoftext|>
yup . the only way is if you start smoking pot instead . that is what my son did . it is not fun but at least he isn ' t driving a heavy traffic anymore . <|endoftext|>
i hope he does well in college ! that ' s a pretty great sport . i ' m sure you ' ll be very proud of him . <|endoftext|>
i can understand that . but when did you get the 64 ? were you addicted ? what is it now ? <|endoftext|>
i can imagine ! that game is great . i ' ve played it on and off before . <|endoftext|>
like what ? that seems like it would be hard to do . don ' t be so hard on yourself . <|endoftext|>
well done . sounds like you knew what you were doing , and did well . are you fully confident you will pass ? <|endoftext|>
wow that sounds very exciting . sounds like he ' s enjoying your effort . was it nice ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , that happens to me sometimes too . not enough that i can play at least . we need to get a cheaper nintendo switch so i can deal with that ! <|endoftext|>
i know ! it ' s like it ' ll be time to get a cup of the everyday things . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . you could try getting a few adderall and you ' ll feel a bit better . <|endoftext|>
sorry about that , i meant to say that my son is going to daycare . i will be going as far as having him take care of this special ed class ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty cool . is it small ? big ? tall ? i ' ve always wanted a dragon <|endoftext|>
that is great that you are feeling so much control over your schedule , sounds like you have a good work schedule ! <|endoftext|>
yeah , that sounds pretty scary , to live on peanuts for so long . i hope it works out well for you ! <|endoftext|>
you are lucky . why ' s that ? ? ? i want to know . . . : ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i ' ve been doing that . you get your independence , family , everything ! <|endoftext|>
did you have to go to the doctor ? i ' ve had a few that cause me to feel sick . <|endoftext|>
i guess we can ' t really say for sure what caused it . sounds like it could have been your wife or family . <|endoftext|>
ugh that ' s so frustrating ! i ' m guilty of this as well , we have a roommate and we keep eating ice cream the rest of the night . <|endoftext|>
same here ! i probably would have had a panic attack . . or just been vomited ! <|endoftext|>
that is pretty bad luck . i am sorry you had to see that . some people are just no good <|endoftext|>
aw , i ' m sorry to hear that . what ' s happening with your wife ? i ' ll pray for you . <|endoftext|>
oh well i hope you do good . parenting is a tough thing to tackle . good luck ! <|endoftext|>
oh my , that ' s a strange cat . did you say something ? it ' s always nice to see a similar looking cat <|endoftext|>
thats probably the case , maybe it was just a stray cat and it was eating a stray from home <|endoftext|>
sounds like you ' ve been studying a lot ! you ' ll do great ! what ' s your test in advance for ? <|endoftext|>
you will do fine . it can ' t be easy but you are reaching your goals . keep to yourself . <|endoftext|>
thats really awesome of her . ive been married a couple of years now and the last woman i treated like that did not get what i wanted . <|endoftext|>
yes , i know the process . it is hard to find true love . but , sometimes you will find someone new , and that is good . <|endoftext|>
absolutely . there ' s a lot of unethical and unethical activities by the police if they can ' t provide safety for the people driving . <|endoftext|>
lol ! what a funny story ! you should probably have done it in a car park in a neighborhood though . <|endoftext|>
yes that sounds very dangerous ! i hope the other driver sees what you did ! ! ! was it scary ? <|endoftext|>
he almost certainly tore something . i will have to call him over . i have never done that before in my life . he ' s the nicest guy . <|endoftext|>
i would have freaked out , have you sprayed the spray ? we get them all the time in our house , maybe you should get a pest control number ? <|endoftext|>
i hope you didn ' t get hurt in the sleep . i think you should look for a sleep apegoat next time ! <|endoftext|>
what sort of art do you do ? i am fascinated by art . i love art . . and science . <|endoftext|>
portrait portrait i see . that ' s cute . i would probably look like you too if i could draw . i like classic stuff like karas and death punch the best . <|endoftext|>
that is a nice way of looking at it i suppose . have you seen that friend ? if so , what did they do to prove it ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear about your loss . i hope she knows that you care about her and know that she will be there for you in the end . <|endoftext|>
oh that sucks , i hope they have a good find out . i bet that is the worse cancer ever , i heard they love to make it a bad thing . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s impressive . you ' re in good hands ! you should be proud ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds so scary ! do you have any idea what it is ? did you call the police ? <|endoftext|>
i would have been terrified too . i ' m glad you ' re ok ! i would be so scared . i would of ran away too . <|endoftext|>
oh no , i hope he will be ok ! what did he need surgery for ? and what was it that he needed surgery for , i don ' t even know . . . <|endoftext|>
i am glad you are concerned . hopefully they can find a cure for this and it stays that way for him <|endoftext|>
that is horrible , im so sorry to hear that ! . are you staying in contact with the person who is going through the news ? <|endoftext|>
it really is ! but you know , even if everything goes wrong , you might still be able to find someone you really like , and that ' s easier . <|endoftext|>
i hear you . there ' s nothing like going to the movies and playing video games with your friends . <|endoftext|>
yeah - its really fun and different with friends , it doesnt it ? i prefer older games but the classic is cool too <|endoftext|>
how did it go ? was it okay ? did you get the job ? ? ? ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
don ' t feel so ! it ' s normal to feel that way ! you never know what to expect in life <|endoftext|>
i really hope that the cure works ! type 2 is not an easy group of health problems . <|endoftext|>
he probably will if he knows you well enough . you gave good reason for your discover . you could be trying to tell a completely different story . <|endoftext|>
did you have many friends ? did you finally get a movie to watch ? lol . . what movie were you hoping to see ? <|endoftext|>
wow ! that sounds super cool . i bet that was scary as hell . lol . what was your pet ? <|endoftext|>
how cold was it ? did he feel it was cold ? do you know why he didn ' t ask you ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s good to be little so you can enjoy the time with your little ones . you can ' t always be babies ! lol <|endoftext|>
i totally agree . how did he get caught ? he definitely should have been in jail if i were you ! <|endoftext|>
they are riled up . everyone knows trump is going to do horrible things . they are just being unthoughtful . <|endoftext|>
do you mean darnit and i am going to kill you now . . do you know who i am talking about ? <|endoftext|>
well , i ' m sure nobody did and the rest of the world isn ' t as lucky ! <|endoftext|>
ohhh man . that is no good . how do you think she was planning on getting with another guy if they were up for some new bond ? <|endoftext|>
betrayal is not good and it only makes things worse . i ' m sorry . . . but i am sure you can find a new girlfriend . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome news ! i am sure he appreciated you taking him out ! family is important ! <|endoftext|>
oh , that ' s really nice of you to help him . i hope he gets to make it through . <|endoftext|>
great job ! was he able to ace the course ? or did he just struggle ? i mean i know you probably love that he got that b ! <|endoftext|>
don ' t give up . einstein was a einstein . . . not a gumball of a man ! <|endoftext|>
that is really impressive , i can never guess what a dog ' s speak for . . . <|endoftext|>
that really drives me nuts . you have to be able to say something if you want to be successful . <|endoftext|>
you must have developed a new talent for eating world class food . must be good at it . <|endoftext|>
stomachs aren ' t that strong you know ! unless you have some really strong stomach harts , no one will dare challenge you ! <|endoftext|>
you had a wonderful boyfriend . it ' s always nice when someone takes care of you when it ' ll be your last . <|endoftext|>
you must feel amazing and joyful ! i hope you feel better now as well . : ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s so nice . we are lucky to have loved ones . do you have a close connection to her ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s so beautiful ! i ' m glad you had that kind of memories with her ! <|endoftext|>
that is gross . i hope it wasn ' t something you took in as a kid . dogs are gross <|endoftext|>
well atleast you tried , did she cry ? ! ? ! ! ? jk that ' s mean of her <|endoftext|>
very cool ! how old is he ? is he usually better than older ? i think that ' s the important question . i ' m not the best at answers . <|endoftext|>
or invest the money in something real good . do you know the guy ? he ' s interesting ! <|endoftext|>
that sucks , do you think you deserve it ? it is always hard to find a decent job . . <|endoftext|>
maybe you should try and work with him more about it ? it ' s normal to feel unsure . <|endoftext|>
im sorry for your loss . what did you buy with the cat ? a quart or maybe a glass of gas ? <|endoftext|>
what kind of dog was he having ? i have a mixed race and i think my dog would be tough to teach . <|endoftext|>
that sounds so good . i ' m so sorry . how long have you been together ? you can still be together forever . <|endoftext|>
well i am happy for you . marry one of your guys ! ! ! don ' t get married ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds good , what kind did you make ? i bet it was delicious . . . what kind ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds delicious ! i ' m glad it ' s still there . were you there for the promotion ? <|endoftext|>
nice ! how long have you been shopping for shoes ? how long do you think you ' ll let them keep growing ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s sweet . i just got a pair of new releases about a month ago . still feel great <|endoftext|>
sounds like a really fun time . do you live in the usa ? do you like camping ? <|endoftext|>
sounds like you had a good time . . congrats ! ! ! : ) ! ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! can it be repaired ? hope it was just the storm . are you ok ? <|endoftext|>
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . i bet you felt so scared . . . <|endoftext|>
well , it is an interesting subject . where are you travelling to ? or why you are worried ? <|endoftext|>
i bet , when does they become a bit more expensive ? ? i know they ' ve been a big deal for me lately , they have so many people in them , it ' s crazy <|endoftext|>
oh , did you have your phone with you ? where can i find it ? ? ? ! <|endoftext|>
true ! that would be good if it were all in one place . but a police officer could certainly help you . <|endoftext|>
do you have a budget ? i know how you feel i was always stressed about money a long time ago . <|endoftext|>
wow , that is insane ! it will all be back up in a few years hopefully ! perhaps we can retrace our steps to save money . <|endoftext|>
it ' s sad to think that . has she been away too much ? could you call her and ask if she has any family or friends at home ? <|endoftext|>
i liked fortnite . how about you ? what was yours ? also , what kind of game ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . that must be really tough . are you feeling alright lately ? <|endoftext|>
thats great . glad you feel better . that ' s a disease i ' ve never been dealt with <|endoftext|>
oh no , that sounds scary ! i wish you won ' t ever have to go that way . <|endoftext|>
i think it ' s because a good deal has been made with trump to help lower his profile in the future . i don ' t see how he wouldn ' t want that ! <|endoftext|>
have you tried to get in touch with people who are interviewing for your job ? i ' m sure it will be fine . <|endoftext|>
i can totally understand that , well you just know that if things work out and you like the way you ' re doing , you won ' t have to ask for another job ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty pathetic ! that ' ll teach you to clean your own vomit ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
i get to be in a clean place during the day now too ! that ' s awesome that you are able to clean that much less mess around ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s amazing ! i am happy for her ! is it a first child ? that can be a huge learning experience . <|endoftext|>
you definitely have , i bet she ' s a doll ! i just mine are 2 now , so no real reason to change her mind ! <|endoftext|>
well it could be that way for you . but , be sure you do not behave inappropriately in front of them . <|endoftext|>
i don ' t know , i never get evicted . it could be worse . i don t know . <|endoftext|>
why were you nervous ? did it seem like you ' d be happy with your home , or did you let your family know you were hesitant , or were you worried ? <|endoftext|>
you must be really proud . it is a good feeling being in that position ! ! ! sounds like you all have a great adventure ahead . : ) <|endoftext|>
sometimes i wish i could go back in time too . what made you think about it ? i hope it gives you good memories . <|endoftext|>
i guess , but sometimes you just have to look at the bright side . . . and the bad side of life . life is better than nothing , but there are always the good old days when life just seems to skip a beat . <|endoftext|>
oh , tell me about it . i still miss my childhood . it was a lot simpler . <|endoftext|>
thats bad , i hope one of them gets back . at least you found them . i would be furious , i would make a shrine for them . <|endoftext|>
you must ' ve thanked him ! it ' s good to receive things like that . they make us think that we ' re so thankful , because we sometimes aren ' t . <|endoftext|>
well , he did a great job ! it sounds like he is very appreciative of you ! <|endoftext|>
why did she move away ? was she away for something different ? nintendo was my childhood , i still play it sometimes . <|endoftext|>
maybe you can facetime her to let her know that you have plans ? you are probably better off that way <|endoftext|>
reading also means you have the time to do something else that productive . i love relaxing on my porch too . <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool , i ' m not much of a reader . i love reading as well , but sometimes i wish i could read more . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! you should be furious ! that ' s awful . did it bring back any special feelings ? <|endoftext|>
when did you move there ? it seems to be very beautiful place now . any plans for the next tidbit ? <|endoftext|>
where would you live if you didn ' t live there . i don ' t even know anyone who lives there . <|endoftext|>
yes , i think it takes some people to be that way ! it ' s to give an opportunity to new people . i grew in a similar city as well , but much smaller . i love it there <|endoftext|>
awww that is so sweet of you ! what kind of dog does he have ? ! <|endoftext|>
aww i love puddle ! are you able to give him treats if he ' s successful ? <|endoftext|>
lol . why would they do that ? ? do you think they would turn you down ? <|endoftext|>
oh gosh , i am so sorry . did you give them a piece of your mind ? ! <|endoftext|>
i feel the same way . i hope the health of those around him is better ? it ' s hard not to take the hand . <|endoftext|>
that is nice to do that , people need help a lot ! i wish more people did that , because some of the world ' s homeless struggle would really hit head . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome ! how are you feeling about the jackpot ? ! ? ! ! ? : ) <|endoftext|>
good luck ! that is one of the most fun things to do ! ! ! get into one of those crappy yukon draw coins with coins and put in a small pot . <|endoftext|>
yep . good thinking . it would take a lot of training for sure . i hope it turns out well for you ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! did you guys have a good time ? did you have fun ? you never know . you can always make new friends ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool , i bet it made you a lot of connections . like from work or something ! <|endoftext|>
i hate cats ! how did you feel when your cat did that ? ! ? ! ! ? <|endoftext|>
well i am sure he will forgive you . just make sure you let him know you do it again ! <|endoftext|>
what was the prize ? was it a dollar ? a significant other ? a large cake ? or was it one of those lottery winning things where you win everything you need and they win some extra things for you and then another in their bag and you win more things for yourself ? <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s cool ! maybe one day you will win ! ! ! i ' m such a good player in talent shows , have you won before ? <|endoftext|>
it sounds like you guys are quite looking forward to it , where at ? have you made your bed yet ? <|endoftext|>
if you look at the prices at other places it is usually much more dependable and improves life . <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that . i am sure she is in a better place now though . <|endoftext|>
the times i have been in the hospital have been the worst . the people just care about them and not the health . <|endoftext|>
wow , i have always wanted to go on trips like that . are you paying for any flights ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s too bad . maybe you will get to see your parents someday . but i ' m sure you will do fine . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! what did you study ? ? ? i am proud of both of our parents for graduating . <|endoftext|>
i think most people are truly a bit disrespectful . some people do not get that opportunity and should be ashamed of that . <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never been camping but i hope it goes well . do you go frequently ? it sounds like you ' ll have a great time <|endoftext|>
wow . thats a good find . i hope he doesn ' t steal it ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
uh oh ! i hope he didnt get in trouble for that ! thats hilarious and sad at the same time . <|endoftext|>
that sounds so fun . does she always do it ? does she sometimes do it as a hobby or as a career ? <|endoftext|>
how cool ! how was the weather ? how many people were out there ? did you have fun ? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome ! i hope you do ! and if it is not , keep at it and it will pay off ! <|endoftext|>
do you play a lot ? do you love it , do you do it a lot , can you be in one place for a long time ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a very fun experience do you sky dive for a living too ? or do you already have one ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that is awesome . . where did you do it ? do you like it ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that sounds like a lot of work ! was it worth it ? was it your first cane ? <|endoftext|>
well , in that case you know you ' ve got a new adventure ahead of you ! i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! ! ! what happened to your house ? please share this experience with me . please <|endoftext|>
are you ever afraid to drive ? like an exterminator ? it can be so dangerous . <|endoftext|>
i have no doubt you will . i really hope so too ! what is the bid ? is it for a specific product ? <|endoftext|>
cool . is it a special one ? why you think you might need it ? are you looking to buy ? <|endoftext|>
what did you do about it ? did you call the police ? i have had that happen to me before . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great news , how did the neighborhood feel about it ? like they were watching you or something . <|endoftext|>
i agree , technology is amazing ! do you have a favorite technology you are talking about ? i love technology <|endoftext|>
yeah i know . i still love mine though . it can suck being at someones house . <|endoftext|>
that ' s quite a large cake ! what kind did you eat ? ! ? ! ! ? <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean ! you just keep doing the thing you love and it ' ll all pay off ! <|endoftext|>
that is good ! your family should be very grateful for your kindness . what kind of food do they need ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad , i hope they are ok , that would really hurt my soul . . . <|endoftext|>
i hate horror films with a passion . why was it scary ? ! ? ! ! ? congrats on the win ! <|endoftext|>
really ? that ' s pretty awesome , did you have fun ? : ) you have a good soul . <|endoftext|>
that sounds so fun ! did you just visit a new place ? i hope you have a great time and i hope that your visits go well . <|endoftext|>
yeah i love the good cheap deals i get there . that is surprising as far as the prices . <|endoftext|>
i know ! i hate doing that because i am lazy and get stuck doing a bunch of things i shouldn ' t . i want to throw up every time . <|endoftext|>
true , but with all the weather , i ' d rather be home with the food . ha ha <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never experienced that . i feel like a parent if i see that . does it happen very often ? <|endoftext|>
well good , people should be more considerate in the area . i ' m sure no one in this city will use all that food ! <|endoftext|>
me too , and those who cut people off . so annoying ! i just don ' t signal it and make the lane look bad ! <|endoftext|>
yes there ' s nothing you can do besides encourage them to stay out of it . i hate it when people just go along with it and nothing is done . <|endoftext|>
what did you do with it ? i had one when i was a kid , but not a big fan anymore . <|endoftext|>
its tough but , i ' m in love with it . love comes from people . i can ' t imagine if i lived in a country where there were more like it . <|endoftext|>
what kind of restaurant is it ? i ' ve never been but would like to try it . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i can understand your concern . you won ' t get everything you need for the same money , so i ' m sure you will find a replacement quickly . i hope your favorite dish comes out good ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds so tasty ! i ' m really glad you get to get what you like . have you tried any of your favorite food items ? <|endoftext|>
cool i am glad it turned out well ! i like indian food too ! i make it a living <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! how have you been getting on ? i just started doing mine this month as well . <|endoftext|>
how ' d you do ? i wish you the best of luck in that tournament ! it will be great ! <|endoftext|>
that is pretty annoying . have you told him to stop ? he will probably ruin his plans over it . <|endoftext|>
you might have better luck moving out or perhaps getting a dog who could tune out on their own ! <|endoftext|>
i have no idea . maybe he was having a bad day ? i don ' t know ! <|endoftext|>
try to speak to someone higher up . they should have more experience at your store . maybe someone above you could give you tips for dealing with the situation . <|endoftext|>
that is true , and what i do not want to happen is not have any control over what i am doing . . <|endoftext|>
wow , that sounds like a lot of fun . i ' m sure you ' re going to have a lot to talk about . <|endoftext|>
i hope so too ! ! maybe a little too soon . my children probably would have the funnest time watching her singing . <|endoftext|>
i would be so anxious ! ! ! i bet you will be filled with anxiety after that ! <|endoftext|>
i hope everything goes well for you . that sounds like a great achievnment . congratulations ! <|endoftext|>
yes , i do . i ' m not a big social person , and i ' d like to work for my own space . <|endoftext|>
yikes . did you clear the air ? we get them all the time in the midwest . i ' ve found them on the side of the road actually <|endoftext|>
ugh that must ' ve been horrible , especially when you were trying to play the game ! did you punish the guy for being a little disrepectful ? <|endoftext|>
that is quite early though , and i am sure you will be fine . are you ok ? <|endoftext|>
lol . . . i do the same thing , except i keep the radio on and i play a song from my car . <|endoftext|>
ooooh ! ! that is great . what kind of computer did you get ? ! ? ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a really good computer , what are you going to do with it ? are you working on any games ? <|endoftext|>
i do the same . we get our food delivered to our house a lot so we get a lot of stuff we aren ' t buying yet , but we make sure to buy their food . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . i just don ' t do it much anymore . i used to buy ten pounds of groceries a day back in the day . <|endoftext|>
i used to sit there and read those books all the time as a kid . definitely can ' t imagine how sad that was . <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean , i know it was a good idea to wrote it shorter to avoid the ending . but it gets so dry and depressing after a couple times . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s amazing ! i bet you are so proud ! how did you learn that ? <|endoftext|>
i bet you were so proud and also happy for him . he is a lucky guy ! lol <|endoftext|>
that ' s fun ! do you get to go often ? i am always looking forward to being out there and chillaxing ! <|endoftext|>
thats terrible . were you a kid ? did you hurt yourself ? were you hurt to ? <|endoftext|>
little brothers do this all the time . i bet it was something distructive . did he get in trouble for it ? <|endoftext|>
i would prank him so bad that he won ' t even be honest with you . . i would . <|endoftext|>
what did you see ? what was it ? did it follow you ? ? ? what did it say ? <|endoftext|>
omg , i would have screamed ! how did you get out of the house ? what did you do ? <|endoftext|>

wow what an incredible story ! i guess you ' ve been really lucky ! what did you buy ? <|endoftext|>

you ' re pretty smart for getting so started . california seems beautiful . what school did you choose ? <|endoftext|>

it must ' ve been very sight seeing . what did you look up ? were they stars ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m happy for you ! be sure to stay optimistic about everything ! : ) there ' s much to be achieved in life . <|endoftext|>
wow thats not cool . did yall confront them about it ? ? ? did they even tell you ? <|endoftext|>
they must have a good relationship with you . maybe you should visit them . : ) it ' s always fun to find a friend that is close to you and get to chatting . <|endoftext|>
are you excited to have them back ? are you having a special occasion ? or are you just excited to start shopping ? <|endoftext|>
damn that is bad . did you say anything to them ? maybe that was the only way they were gonna sell . <|endoftext|>
it ' s over for them . find one that does not . you will fit in just fine ! <|endoftext|>
wow . . that must feel really hard and timeated . . . i hope you get that done soon ! <|endoftext|>

im sorry , maybe the doctor could check your driving skills ? give it time . it can get really bad <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i hope they are not in trouble and didn ' t take anything like groceries . <|endoftext|>
have you called the dealership ? it may be worth getting a new car . you never know if it ' s someone just craw or they are really craw . <|endoftext|>
oh no . i hope it was not anything serious . did anyone else get hurt ? were you hurt ? <|endoftext|>
yea you feel like you are about to be sated and then you go into panic mode . <|endoftext|>

absolutely . i ' m so sorry you had to experience that . it ' ll be okay . <|endoftext|>
oh , what a beautiful memory . how old is the song ? i remember so much simpler times . <|endoftext|>
have you tried alternative music ? it ' s the same way , but with music without music it ' ll feel like it ' d be a show , an intro to a new line of music . <|endoftext|>
oh no what was he doing ? ! did you call the police ? ! ? ! ! ? what happened ? ! <|endoftext|>
yeah , you can start over there . armadillos don ' t go for much . <|endoftext|>
really ? was it an old one ? they get skunk of the year . . they are the best <|endoftext|>
hopefully it ' s fine . i hope you get it back soon ! ! ! you probably did a lot for the bird . <|endoftext|>

that ' s great . you ' re living the dream . i ' m sorry you have to deal with so much pain . <|endoftext|>
yum , yes . he won ' t know if you didn ' t feed him though . <|endoftext|>
oh no . what area is it in ? i live in florida so we don ' t get storms that bad . <|endoftext|>
yes , it worries me so much . we are going to have to do so much to prepare . <|endoftext|>

i hope so too ! i ' ve always wanted one of those . i love riding in my bike on the street . <|endoftext|>
what kind of accidents are they ? can you try to see if he is messing up ? : ) <|endoftext|>
i see . maybe you should just keep her a bit sicker until she begins to get more aggressive . i think that ' s more helpful in situations like these . <|endoftext|>
did you perform well at your role ? how did you feel ? that is up to you . <|endoftext|>
it ' s a tough situation , being at a big company and having to leave behind a bunch of coworkers and your position . but being alone is the least of your worries . <|endoftext|>
cool what are you planning to do there ? i love water parks ! are you going to be swimming ? <|endoftext|>
i wish i had a kid that wanted to visit there . maybe i will though . not with my own kids . lol <|endoftext|>
that ' s quite a confession . why didn ' t you call the cat by it ' s name ? <|endoftext|>

whew . that would be hard to do but you know . if he ' s gonna do it , it might as well be natural . <|endoftext|>
oh my . did you have any of your childhood pets as pets ? if that ' s the case i hope it was a good cat and not a bad one . <|endoftext|>
i would cry to my friends walking on the sidewalk behind me . they would be running around in their torn up shoes . <|endoftext|>
that ' s very nice ! i have a violinist too , she ' s pretty amazing . what kind of art does she make ? <|endoftext|>
you must be so proud of her ! mine always choke at drawing even when i try really hard . <|endoftext|>
how did that happen ? ? ? i hope you ' re okay ! are you alright ? do you feel okay now ? <|endoftext|>
i love my cold blankets , and my long blanket . what ' s your secret ? what is your job ? <|endoftext|>
oh god ! i hate bugs so much ! do you know what it was ? bugs can be bugs , and i love bugs , so you won ' t be the only one . <|endoftext|>
oh no , that ' s horrible . what did you do ? ! ? ! ! ? what did it do ? <|endoftext|>
ha that ' s crazy . she may have done something really gross though . i bet you are glad she isn ' t looking . <|endoftext|>
i think you should take a small bites from her now and let her know how happy you are with her . <|endoftext|>
are you nervous about it or just ready to face the public ? i ' m sure you ' ll do great . <|endoftext|>
good luck ! are you going to get a bonus from the speech ? sounds like you ' ve done a great job ! <|endoftext|>
that sucks , did you clean it up quick enough for your cat to be able to do what she wanted ? <|endoftext|>
now that is funny ! lol , poor thing . poor you . poor poor kitty . poor no one . <|endoftext|>
did it get on your shoe ? sometimes it ' s just that hard . . . to be honest <|endoftext|>
yeah those kids are so young . hopefully they grow out of it soon . not a lot you can do to help them . <|endoftext|>
oooh cool ! what kind did you order ? hopefully you like it , since you ' re hungry . <|endoftext|>
yum that sounds amazing , what did you get ? ! ? ! ! ? a juicy cheese burger ! <|endoftext|>
what happened ? was the airbnb reconnecting to you ? did you ever get it all figured out ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s always an awesome experience when you finally get around to doing something . a little easier is all ! <|endoftext|>
oh goodness . did you get hurt ? was it a big deal ? ? ? lol . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a real bummer when you forget to put on pants . i hope you get that fixed ! <|endoftext|>
that is no good . how did you respond to the situation ? did you hurt yourself ? did she know ? <|endoftext|>
maybe you could reschedule it for something later on . i find the internet is sometimes the hardest to connect with . <|endoftext|>
i bet ! was it your first night alone in a house ? or was it with friends ? <|endoftext|>
i bet ! what is it you like most about yourself ? are you an introvert ? <|endoftext|>
who did that ? i would be very scared ! was it a big problem or a big one ? <|endoftext|>
good for you ! i hope he didn ' t get out . but your best best bet is to call the police . <|endoftext|>
i feel sorry for you . i think i would feel pretty guilty too . lol . but i bet you looked fabulous . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad for you , and i hope you can get some good food back ! i know that can be upsetting . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! did you not make it through ? ? ? i mean it is smart to be honest . <|endoftext|>
ah yea that ' s a good idea . a lot easier when it is someone who know how to do it . <|endoftext|>
dogs are weird like that . it took awhile for mine to learn and realize how to properly behave . <|endoftext|>
i hope so . if not , there ' s always starbucks ! it ' s my favorite . <|endoftext|>
what book did you have to return ? it ' s good that you left it out . what book was it ? <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that . . im glad you were able to get it repaired . . it was probably expensive . <|endoftext|>
that ' s nice . what did you get ? ? ? i love getting something i want ! <|endoftext|>
you ' re the favorite . you should do it more often . . or take better care of it ! <|endoftext|>
that sucks , but it happens . maybe you should complain to them about it . they have the right to do it . <|endoftext|>
i suppose , it ' s better to be somewhere you know is right for you , right ? <|endoftext|>
yeah and when they ' re not , i feel like i wasted time reading a novel . . . or watching a movie lol <|endoftext|>
yes , i have a partner . it took me some time to realize it though and it ' s definitely better than the alternative . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure you won ' t be as disappointed as i am . they don ' t sound that great ! <|endoftext|>
thats so good for you . hopefully his mom can give him more motivation and healing . im sure he will <|endoftext|>
have you spoken to her ? i think she would if she can . she ' s a good person . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i ' m sorry . i hope things work out for you soon . if not , there ' s always adoption ! <|endoftext|>
just think . . . you will never be * that * terrible again . . right ? hopefully , you will look back on when you were one of those people who was a bit worse ! <|endoftext|>
oh really , why did you do that ? im curious . . did you actually do it ? <|endoftext|>
oh nice ! do you like roller sters ? i never went but i heard they are awesome ! <|endoftext|>
maybe it will be worth it for you to try it out sometime ! maybe even a little scary ? <|endoftext|>
im sorry , i lost my cat 5 years ago so it makes me sad to hear that . <|endoftext|>
i got an ultrasound . my heart was beating so fast i didn ' t even know it had brakes . <|endoftext|>
i think i also do that . but , lately , i ' ve started making more effort to be more empathetic to my animals . they deserve it more than i do . <|endoftext|>
yup me too . i hope i ' m like you someday . money is tight these days , and i just want to get ahead . <|endoftext|>
i do too ! i love to think about when i was in a situation where i could have just looked back and reminisced . i don ' t know if that ever happens to me though . <|endoftext|>
you must really be loved and appreciated . i hope your family was able to represent themselves well in their lives ! <|endoftext|>
i watch some youtube . it brings back good memories . what about you ? do you enjoy watching youtube ? <|endoftext|>
anything really . i even watch the olympics once a year . . its just fun seeing how the kids grow <|endoftext|>
was it a dessert ? it happens to me a couple times a week . i get so angry with my food ! <|endoftext|>
haha that ' s pretty funny . how did your mom react to that ? ? i ' m sorry your going through that stress , but i am sure you ' ve got some good tips on youtube . <|endoftext|>
aww . you need a husband who loves steak . no woman i am talking about . lol <|endoftext|>
what happened next ? was it scary ? ? ? how many people do you think went ? ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds like fun ! what are you all doing now ? what did you do then ? <|endoftext|>
it really does help to relax and feel better about yourself . i wish i could do that with my kids <|endoftext|>
god ' s given me a lot of luck lately . it seems like its happening to everyone these days . <|endoftext|>
i try to do that all the time . i live paycheck to paycheck . its all i got in life . <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s so far from finished . can you go and have it in time for yours ? <|endoftext|>
wow . i can ' t believe the tax burden . i wonder how they ' ll handle that ? <|endoftext|>
i bet ! are you okay ? was it your first day out of the bike ? i hope you didn ' t hurt yourself . <|endoftext|>
oh well , you must have had a nice night ! but in all fairness , i am sure you did good ! ! <|endoftext|>
only if they are madden . ; ) what kind ? super nintendo ? lol . all joking aside , ive had my eye on so many cool things to get into the gaming scene but the price really dropped lately . i ' ll have to pick them up again some time <|endoftext|>
i have not played that one . why do you think it is so cool ? i love f76 <|endoftext|>
yes . sometimes i feel that way about the company i work for . do you feel the same about your friend ? <|endoftext|>
i can understand . maybe she is not the right one for you . keep your head up ! <|endoftext|>
my exams recently did great too . i am happy for you . how do you feel about your future <|endoftext|>
that is for sure , that is all you can do to get through this year , best of luck ! <|endoftext|>
amazing ! i have been feeling a lot better and having a lot of fun . it ' s very quiet where i live so i can ' t really go much without being tired . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great news ! i ' m happy for you . why are you so anxious ? <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh what a terrible thing to experience ! did you confront them ? were they ever found ? <|endoftext|>
that is a real shame . i would have been furious as well . especially since i promised my kids that they would come home with their own house ! <|endoftext|>
yes i loved donkey kong , mario , gelunky , and metroid prime . so many more . <|endoftext|>
i have tried playing them . i still feel like there may be some missing from the game . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good , i ' m just happy for you , i hope things go better soon <|endoftext|>
i bet you are . best wishes . i hope it goes really well for you both . : ) <|endoftext|>
is that a bad thing ? i think she would be more than happy to share it with you . <|endoftext|>
haha that was really mean of you . at least you were honest about it . otherwise she may be mad at you . <|endoftext|>
that ' s no good . i ' m sorry , i hope you guys can work it out . <|endoftext|>
that is disappointing . i think we can all just move on . . . lol . i would have to run out and find money quickly so i can show you how cheap i am <|endoftext|>
was there anybody there who could see it ? ? i bet that was a pain . i had to clean up dog accidents before . <|endoftext|>
i bet that was really disgusting , too . at least you can laugh about it now that it has come out and use less than stellar seawork . <|endoftext|>
oh my god . that is so sad . my boyfriend had a cat die in the car last week . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it was , i hope you ' ll make it , did he take you somewhere ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow . do you think you might get hurt doing something like that . ? ? ? did you get hurt somewhere ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow . . that would be terrifying . i would have just stayed home ! it ' s good to overcome your fear though ! <|endoftext|>
oh yea ? did it go well ? were you nervous ? ? ? you must feel prepared for it ! ! <|endoftext|>
well i really glad it didn ' t turn out to be a disaster . : ) it ' s always hard to be confident when you don ' t have what it takes . <|endoftext|>
how did that feel ? did anyone notice ? ! ! i ' m so jealous ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
i have never cheated on my wife . she cheated on me twice in her life . what are you going to do ? <|endoftext|>
why was that ? was the bunny more affectionate ? was it scary ? or did you have fun ? <|endoftext|>
i would have done the same , not to even try though . i am glad that you did <|endoftext|>
that is always a good feeling . i bet they appreciate you . i hope you keep it up ! <|endoftext|>
it is sad that other parents don ' t take their kids . kids need to have discipline and structure . <|endoftext|>
sure , it takes hours to make a working game . i really love my job . . . <|endoftext|>
yes , especially video games , it was nice to see that it was getting a lot of attention <|endoftext|>
oh no , was it any good ? you seem like she really wanted you to be in the relationship . <|endoftext|>
oh he certainly wouldn ' t . good thing your not married ! lol . are you ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds like fun , how was it ? are you planning on going ? ? ? what do you think ? <|endoftext|>
it is good that you brought them up , it is always good to appreciate what you have . <|endoftext|>
how do you profit from an ice juice stake ? like from your stake of yourself ? \ <|endoftext|>

that was really nice of you . are you having them for a while ? i hope he ' s satisfied with the purchase ! <|endoftext|>
it will be okay . you will still have plenty of time to call the cops . it happens . <|endoftext|>
why don ' t they do it for your birthday ? that sounds exciting . did you ? any fun plans ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s funny because chugging is actually really common in quite a few cases . is that where you get your information from ? <|endoftext|>
oh my word ! that ' s terrible , i hope you didn ' t get sent to the restroom . <|endoftext|>
what ? ! no way ! what are you going to do ? ! it ' s like you are stealing from me ! <|endoftext|>
wow ! ! that is horrible ! i have not heard about that yet , so i am thankful <|endoftext|>
ha ha that sounds kind of funny though . ha ha . i suppose that ' s life for the most part . <|endoftext|>
i hope you can understand my sentiment . it ' s important to take it easy and do this as a chance to reflect on life . <|endoftext|>
yeah i understand . i guess all you can do is give her a good hug and pretend you weren ' t ther . <|endoftext|>
that ' s a long time , do you like it ? do you both like it there ? <|endoftext|>
i bet . the pay is definitely good . do you find it difficult at times ? like getting an award for your work ? <|endoftext|>
oh , that ' s pretty amazing . i thought it might have been a lot cheaper than going all over . did you overcome your fear with time and have fun ? <|endoftext|>
is it still in the airline ? or did the flight have to be complete and total abhorrent ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you were able to enjoy some free time ! but i ' d be pretty annoyed , too , since it was an important trip for you . well , i ' ve always enjoyed getting to take long trips . the driving is probably the best part . <|endoftext|>
that sounds amazing . what was there ? food ? i just got done eating chinese pizza . it is my favorite . i can ' t wait to try the new pizza . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like it was a great time ! nap time is the best . what were you having for dinner ? <|endoftext|>
how did it feel going back then ? did you all go on a vacation ? are you going to visit there again ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m the same way . i used to love those things . not so much anymore , since everything is digital . <|endoftext|>
that is so scary , is your friend okay ? is he ok ? i really dont care how it ends , i just want you to know that you are my best friend ! <|endoftext|>
i hope you are doing okay . i know how hard it can be to lose someone you care about . <|endoftext|>
what was your surprise day ? that must have been so fun to see her do it ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
there ' s always the funny ones . good luck and keep it up . hard to be good at something <|endoftext|>
it sounds like you enjoy it . how long have you been married ? how long were you married ? <|endoftext|>
that is wonderful . good on you guys ! be sure to take lots of photos and keep them on display in the wedding room to remember the special moments . <|endoftext|>
that is terrible , did you find it ? did you get it back ? hopefully your friend doesn ' t take it ! <|endoftext|>
it is good that you did that , people do bad things sometimes . did it make you feel better ? <|endoftext|>
i have never volunteered for that , but i will check into it . what did you use your time for ? <|endoftext|>
it sounds like fun , i am so glad you had a fun time , i had a bad time last year because of bad drivers <|endoftext|>
that is wonderful . i ' m happy for you . a good life is important . have you been married for a long time ? <|endoftext|>
really ? how have you gotten to that point ? anything in particular makes you grateful for being there ? <|endoftext|>
great , hopefully you have enough time to celebrate ! it can be really fun ! ! ! i wish i could go to one in a couple years , but i ' m a homeowner . <|endoftext|>
dang that ' s annoying , what happened ? ! did you get it fixed ? ! ? ! <|endoftext|>
dang that sucks . at least its not an abused engine . . . but again , that ' s still very frustrating . did you just buy a new car ? <|endoftext|>
you should buy a used car then . don ' t need a new one . use a savings account . <|endoftext|>
oh no , did it wake you up ? is your foot okay now ? how embarrassing that must have been ! <|endoftext|>
i hope you ' re able to find the right therapist for you . if you find a new one , you can ask for them to help you move on . <|endoftext|>
well , you ' ve got to be the wiser as long as they ' re in good company . <|endoftext|>
same here . the delivery guys have really busy schedules and it ' s hard to keep track of things . i just start counting my blessings and sending them to their delivery guys haha . <|endoftext|>
i understand , i have to take breaks sometimes because i do that much more often than others . <|endoftext|>
i am so sorry , how are you holding up ? i just lost a dog and it hurts , i am sure you are still loved by your pets though . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry for your loss , but i ' ve always secretly wanted a cat so that i could be around my own . <|endoftext|>
are you going with anyone ? i bet you are gonna have a great time ! d that sounds so fun ! <|endoftext|>
that might be a bit bigger than i thought . but , i love the idea of going in there and singing a song . you never know when you ' ll be singing in the ocean . <|endoftext|>
that ' s very nice of her , hopefully she continues to work at it so she can achieve something of yours . <|endoftext|>
you are good at work . there are more people that aren ' t . i just wish things would turn out well for the most part for the foreseeable future . <|endoftext|>
yea i feel that way once i buy what i need and leave with what i can ' t make . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . how long did it take to finish ? and how much did it pay ? <|endoftext|>
well , coding is a lot of work , and it pays very well . you will make a nice bartender in no time . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . better things can ' t always be done on my end . it can always be taken for granted though . <|endoftext|>
that is not good . what types of problems do you have ? health problems , or just physical ones ? <|endoftext|>
yea but it is a lot less faithif u go to a real doctor right away . <|endoftext|>
well , i think you should give up eating pizza and cake - it ' s bad for you . <|endoftext|>
that ' s not good i wonder why it happened ? ! maybe the weight came from the weather ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow , you must be very prepared ! i guarantee you ' ll do well if you ' re prepared . <|endoftext|>
just keep yourself occupied with other interests , like reading or playing video games , etc . , , . <|endoftext|>
aw , well happy early birthday ! i ' m sure it won ' t be as bad as your day . <|endoftext|>
oh , well it sounds like you went on a pretty long and easy path towards success so i can see how you could feel that way . <|endoftext|>
i know , life gets in the way , but the most important thing is the health . stay strong ! <|endoftext|>
it ' s a great feeling when you are loved like that . they must be really happy too . <|endoftext|>
that is not good . i am really sorry . were you close ? if so how was he ? <|endoftext|>
i understand that completely . i lost my cat when i was 18 years old myself . i am still sad . <|endoftext|>
that sucks , what is it that you are saving for ? ! ! ? ! ? i know it sucks to not be able to get a car and not be sure about it . what made you change your mind ? <|endoftext|>
yep . most are reliable . i had a honda civic the other day . i ' ve had it for over 20 years and it still runs fine . <|endoftext|>
you sound like a great person . it is great you have an amazing husband like him . have you seen him or does he mean work alot ? <|endoftext|>
you must be so proud of yourselves . it ' s such a proud moment for us all when we have these great moments with our loved ones . <|endoftext|>
dang , did it come out or get you really upset ? maybe they had something in it or something <|endoftext|>
that is great ! where was your prize ? i would be mortified too , if it happened to me . <|endoftext|>
i ' ve always wanted to go to washington . how big are you guys going ? and for how long ? <|endoftext|>
that would be so fun . i love when the shows hold up the shows you haven ' t seen in a long time . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! have you had it long ? i only have a little knife . i know its not meant to be but i have a mean pocket knife . <|endoftext|>
i bet you ' re a great boyfriend ! you deserve it . : ) i know it ' s hard to get upset about that <|endoftext|>
that is good . some people cant even control their kids for a few days a week . thats very sad <|endoftext|>
yeah it definitely helps to have control over your health . i ' ve heard good things about having a cortisone shots doctor to help keep your body moving at a healthy rate . <|endoftext|>
oh , how did it go ? did you nail it ? was it a good one ? or did you need more time to prepare ? <|endoftext|>
awesome , congratulations . always great when you aced a test like that ! i ' m happy for you . <|endoftext|>
why is that ? do you have better health ? did you have to use it or not at all ? <|endoftext|>

skydiving sounds like a lot of fun , i haven ' t done that yet . how ' d it work out for you ? <|endoftext|>
i hear you . i am very far away from my child hood hood friends . i hope he feels the same . <|endoftext|>

i noticed . but i knew the first one had died so i had to remind myself . but yes , i am sure no one noticed . <|endoftext|>
i bet you feel amazing ! ! that ' s cool that you are getting to dance with someone so long . <|endoftext|>
thats good . i bet you are nervous about it . so what do you do to make the dancer nervous ? <|endoftext|>
that sucks , i ' m sorry to hear that , are you not tired as much anymore ? <|endoftext|>
who did it end up being ? someone you know ? it ' ll be fine . i ' m sure your husband will be happy . <|endoftext|>
that ' s always a nervous feeling . i had that the other day for a job . i hope you get the job ! <|endoftext|>
ok that is good news , i would be so upset if i was you d i would have started preparing for the application already . <|endoftext|>
yes it feels good to keep progressing . that way you can stay on top of things for a while <|endoftext|>
that is a great attitude to have . it is even better to appreciate the things you have always got going on and not have them get in the way . <|endoftext|>
good luck , you must be doing something right ! best of luck , your on top of the world ! <|endoftext|>
don ' t worry . it is only you . it takes you practice to get there . hopefully you can do more this weekend . <|endoftext|>
no you won ' t , everyone has that problem at some point . if you ' re really bad then you shouldn ' t be coming at it . <|endoftext|>
oh man ! why would you do that ? lol i bet you ' re looking in great shape . <|endoftext|>
you got that right ! raw makes for the best shows . it always makes me want to watch . <|endoftext|>
juicy pump from doing benching what is that ? lol i ' ve never heard of that . <|endoftext|>
was she a surprise ? lol ! that is so great . have fun . . : ) <|endoftext|>
oh no that is terrible , did you find out what happened ? im assuming you had a good laugh about it . <|endoftext|>
well , that would only be a punishment if he continues to abuse you . at least now you can show him that he ' s being naughty ! <|endoftext|>
oh that has to be weird to see texts from guys like that . have you talked to him at all ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good i like your thinking . what i wouldn ' t do was take my mom ' s wrong for a second . <|endoftext|>
ah man thats the worst . that happened to me before , i was so mad . i had to go home and finish my food . <|endoftext|>
i would think it would be a little limits . chinese is a great food ! i am not the best with languages anyway . <|endoftext|>
how is that even legal ? i am so envious of you . . . what flavor was it ? <|endoftext|>
sometimes the sun needs a good amount of energy in the winter , so i guess we can ' t blame the sun . <|endoftext|>
that is pretty awesome . how much weight can you bench ? how much do you bench press a day ? <|endoftext|>
how long have you been eating the steaks ? i wish i could make a change like that ! <|endoftext|>
i have seen it . it is an action movie right ? and i have never seen a horror movie <|endoftext|>
i bet that would be fun . do you have a boyfriend ? lol ! ! ! ; ) <|endoftext|>
it ' s very hard to quit . i went and quit smoking almost 2 years ago and it ' d been hard to finally get through the process . i recommend trying online or online smokers app to ease your mind . <|endoftext|>
did you stay close to it ? was it close to where you live ? or what ? ! <|endoftext|>
oh really ? what did you do ? ? ? like , what exactly was the dare about ? <|endoftext|>
that is not very safe at all , and i bet you got lots of flashlights too . <|endoftext|>
i also enjoy getting things done . it ' s a good leisure activity . what do you do for fun ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty neat . what things do you crochish ? and how much do you make per crochsake ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s always good to get back in shape ! did you go to the gym for any special reason , or just have success at it ? <|endoftext|>
man , i wish i could lift that much , i cant do anything besides run . i wanna get to workout once im payed <|endoftext|>
hahaha that ' s cute , did you ask your roommates if they thought it was funny ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a really good strategy , and gets them out of trouble . you did the right thing . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry that you were sick . it ' s really nice of him to do that though . <|endoftext|>
yikes ! did you have to be on a job offer at the er ? i bet that would sting , and it would be the worst <|endoftext|>
it is a tough thing to go through . do you have friends to hang out with ? i hope you get to see them soon <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry . maybe he just isn ' t for you . don ' t worry though . there are fish in the sea . <|endoftext|>
yea that ' s true . i cry during tough times too . i try to take it from those times and appreciate all the good things in life . <|endoftext|>
yea i can totally imagine , do you know how to make it through ? maybe ask someone you know ? <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! did you catch any ? did you take in many casualties ? i hope they got back to you quickly . <|endoftext|>
well that sounds horrifying . sorry i can ' t resist a little funny with funny names . <|endoftext|>
that must be frustrating , how about admitting it to your boss ? i know how it feels . <|endoftext|>
oh yeah , well i guess that ' s a good way to put it . just keep your motivation up . you ' ll get there . <|endoftext|>
i admire the same thing . how old were you ? i have a little bit of jkeem . <|endoftext|>
i think it would need to be towards less suffering , though i do hope we can continue to move on from that <|endoftext|>
yay ! that makes me want to adopt all the little puppies . what a cute name ! <|endoftext|>
awesome ! what are the puppies of the cat ? what were their names ? i ' m excited for you . <|endoftext|>
i believe that was true . did you guys keep them inside ? i would have been very scared to . <|endoftext|>
what are you going to do now ? haha ? ? ? you know what they say , if you ' re not with me , you ' ve got the hat" <|endoftext|>
haha . did you try it with a salad ? and don ' t tell me how it turned out ! <|endoftext|>
oh no . . i ' m sorry to hear that . hopefully you didn ' t get sick <|endoftext|>
oh no , i assume it is a books worth of books now ? or were you reading it ? <|endoftext|>
you ' re a hard worker for going that way . i wish i had such a bright future ahead of me . <|endoftext|>
oh . i always pay anyway . nothing to worry about . as long as you have no soda on hand . <|endoftext|>
that is bad karma . but hopefully you can give an explanation for your action . it happens to all of us <|endoftext|>
i bet ! those were the days ! lol i bet you still have a good look , even if it is messy ! <|endoftext|>
you ' re right . they are just wish wish . i love watching wedding day ! i love when they leave a big scratch on their beautiful day ! <|endoftext|>
what made you stop visiting the dentist ? how did it treat you ? did you have a great time ? <|endoftext|>
well that is bad . i hope you go to visit soon . they can fix it . better health <|endoftext|>
that is true . the internet has been a very interesting and interesting part of life . i think it has become very fascinating to see . <|endoftext|>
do you like to read , i am the opposite . resources are always useful . you should cherish them : ) <|endoftext|>
i agree . i can ' t stand it when an animal sleeps in the restroom . i don ' t know why but it is so relaxing . <|endoftext|>
ah , maybe ask your mom ? that would help you with the nerves ! i ' m sure she can help you out . <|endoftext|>
oh no . did you have to put him to sleep ? sounds like he needs some rest ! <|endoftext|>
is it possible to get another dog ? it ' s a type of cat ? there are so many kinds of cats . <|endoftext|>
how did you deal with them ? did you like them ? were you happy to be adult ? <|endoftext|>
i do remember playing mario and splatoon on those days too . such a fun game . how about you ? <|endoftext|>
i do love bringing those back . did you find anything sentimental ? ? d what was it of <|endoftext|>
i ' ve been there before . it is really hard to deal with that . you ' re right though though , it ' s not fair . i still wish i could help , but i ' m too stressed . <|endoftext|>
what was your major ? i ' m majoring in social work now , but i never went anywhere so big in school . <|endoftext|>
what class are you in ? what are your grades ? i am curious how those grades are for when you got the a <|endoftext|>

wow , thats great . you must be very proud of yourself . i need to be more active also . <|endoftext|>
yes it will feel good to feel more success . what is the next step ? . . . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that must have been quite a loud and embarrassing mortified moment . did you sleep immediately ? <|endoftext|>
well try not to worry so much . i do know i sure didn ' t for my first time last year when i was almost sick , it sucks . <|endoftext|>
i bet you were proud when you hit it ! i ' m not familiar with what he does , was he famous or just a great worker <|endoftext|>
like a boss , go to work , and make a mess ! ! ! seriously , that ' s a good attitude . <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds like a great time ! did you do it all at the same time ? or did it take your mind off of it ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that is a long time . what kind of exercise do you do ? if i were you i ' d try doing 5 minutes a day and hoping for the best <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful . was it a real thing ? were you able to catch him ? did you tell him he was doing it ? <|endoftext|>
hopefully you don ' t have to deal with that . what happened ? and don ' tt get too jumped into a deep pit of emotion , just know that you ' re right and it ' s fine to feel angry , too . we all make mistakes . just do your best to be honest and respectful to everyone around you . <|endoftext|>
thats great ! you must be very proud of your friend ! what tennis game is it ? <|endoftext|>
i am glad to hear that you are able to provide great service to your loyal customers . that is something to be proud of ! <|endoftext|>
are you ok ? is heshe ok ? sorry you had to go through that . that must ' ve been really hard . <|endoftext|>
do you guys feel really love ? that must have been a lot of hard work . i am sorry for your loss . <|endoftext|>

that does sound pretty fun . what did you guys do to celebrate ? do you drink a lot ? <|endoftext|>
im so sorry to hear that . what caused you to be immobile ? did anything get wrong with you ? <|endoftext|>
you cant be afraid . theres always a next time . therare many opportunities out there <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . the only thing i don ' t go to the gym for is exercise . <|endoftext|>
i think i need to start training again , my arms are pretty arms right now ! lol <|endoftext|>
i see . i think that ' s the important part though is that you don ' t put all your weight into one people ' s lives . <|endoftext|>
i do not like married life is pretty short . it feels like forever . i hope you have a good relationship . <|endoftext|>
my dog was in a car accident the last time i saw her . i cant imagine what you must have been going through . <|endoftext|>
i know , i felt the same for awhile until i got a new dog myself . it can be tough <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry you had to go through that . it ' s one of the saddest moments in life . <|endoftext|>
that is horrible . but good on them for taking the step . sometimes they have issues with their parents . <|endoftext|>
that ' s so hard . was she ok ? are you planning on having her for a long time ? <|endoftext|>
you had a good life with her , it doesnt always turn out your best though , i hope you at least made memories with her <|endoftext|>

it sounds like he was feeling pretty good about it . that ' s good it worked out ! <|endoftext|>
did you have a good baby experience ? was it a healthy pregnancy ? a healthy baby ? it sounds very stressful . <|endoftext|>
wow , i am sure you are in heaven now ! what did you get surgery for ? and i am happy for you . <|endoftext|>
i ' m happy for you ! that ' s great . are you having some fun in school after ? <|endoftext|>
i know . i ' m sitting at home reading some books myself . maybe look up some online books to read also . <|endoftext|>
wow ! that ' s really exciting . where did you guys meet ? it ' s always fun to see family . <|endoftext|>
oh trust me , it happens to everyone ! you ' ll learn to laugh about it though : ) i don ' t think you did it on your breath . <|endoftext|>
how exciting ! did you not have to buy the new dress ? or was it unexpected ? either way , you ' re excited for it to start feeling better and more comfy ! <|endoftext|>
lol . you should also go to a makeup show ! or maybe go on a cute date . <|endoftext|>
good for you ! how long have you been training for ? it sounds like you ' re getting some good progress ! <|endoftext|>
that is amazing ! ! its always great when you can get into a good running environment . where did you find that ? <|endoftext|>
i wish you luck . i hope it works out ! ! ! i ' m sure you deserve it ! ! <|endoftext|>
it will be good to see what you learn about the company you work for , i hope ! <|endoftext|>
that is good . what kind of exam was it ? were you able to do well ? was it difficult ? <|endoftext|>
that is extremely lucky ! i bet you made a lot of hard work studying . that is awesome ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! were you mad ? do you know why he broke it ? did you call the police ? <|endoftext|>
yeah that would be a very relaxing way to spend a day . maybe you can take it camping ? <|endoftext|>
oh how exciting ! did you call back ? did you receive anything good ? : ) did you like their phone call ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s nice to hear from someone you remember so closely ! it ' ll be the same for me now too ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow , where are you planning to go ? im about to be back in school , it will be so good ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
i feel that is very relaxing . i do enjoy doing laundry as well . enjoy your day . <|endoftext|>
oh no that ' s terrible . i bet it is really nightmare related . did you try to play it off or do anything to keep them in your head ? <|endoftext|>
those are a nightmare i wouldn ' t want to live in . so many emotions . i always choke up <|endoftext|>
maybe he is saving for another time ? i can ' t wait to get a house ! i am so jealous of him ! <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean , i can ' t afford to buy a place i want to . <|endoftext|>
that ' s nice . did you enjoy that ? was it enjoyable ? did you do anything fun ? <|endoftext|>
was it scared of the ring ? i could never try watching that alone in a house alone . <|endoftext|>
what did they chat about ? do you talk to each other a lot ? i used to see a lot of those on facebook ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure they did . it ' s hard to lose loved ones , and i can ' t imagine how special they must be now . <|endoftext|>
that is a very long wait . i can ' t believe that i have to pay . where are you ? <|endoftext|>
thats horrible . was it for important stuff or something else ? im sorry you were late . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . any specific reason why it ' s been so rough ? everything has really been good so far . <|endoftext|>
i am sure you can . you will still have to do a lot to be successful . i know that sounds like hard advice but it is true . <|endoftext|>
i agree , i always just think it was a silly thing to do . everyone has done dumb things in their life . <|endoftext|>
exactly . people need to develop some respect for others . it seems that people are afraid of anyone not falling into their trap . <|endoftext|>
what is the harm in that ? ! would be so spammy to block people online ! <|endoftext|>
i would be anxious too . . . i don ' t think you ' re very good at social media then . . so do what i said to you . let ' s talk about them , then lets you keep in contact with them . i would do that too . <|endoftext|>
sounds like a blast ! how are your friend gonna react to the experience ? i ' ve never been . <|endoftext|>
thats cool , i dont think i could do it thats even hard . good luck , be careful <|endoftext|>
really ? why do you keep having those ? must be some weird dream - like entity from your future . . <|endoftext|>
oh dear . that sounds kind of scary . are you okay ? have you been on the edge of your seat a bit this time ? <|endoftext|>
good to hear you are making progress . i should start making progress myself . good for you ! <|endoftext|>
keep at it ! we can do it ! ! ! keep it up ! ! stay in touch with friends and family ! <|endoftext|>
that is amazing ! what did you have to do ? anotony or dihydrate ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . do you have anyone you can confide in ? i hope they are not a scared wreck . <|endoftext|>
nice . what will you be doing today ? any mods on here ? i will be banned from this subreddit lol <|endoftext|>
who did you perform such a feat against ? i can ' t watch it right now . . . <|endoftext|>
you should try exploring the city you live in . the town you live at is also known for a great social life . <|endoftext|>
i ' ll be your friend just fine ! i know it ' s not the same , but i hope you meet a bunch of cool friends . <|endoftext|>
do you take a lot of math ? or try to do some sort of memorizing ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a pretty large pool . i ' m sure you ' ll figure it out if you just decide to have kids eventually . <|endoftext|>
you deserve a special person in your life . you sound like one ! i believe in you ! <|endoftext|>
yes , i want an earring sooooo bad . how about you ? do you have one ? <|endoftext|>
yes , i live in the south . we get a lot of insect bug spooky things . i don ' t like them ! <|endoftext|>
yes , i am sure that is a scary place to live , but i will try to keep an eye out for them in my area <|endoftext|>
hey , you ' re doing great ! you should be proud of yourself . i don ' t have kids , but hopefully soon . <|endoftext|>
how old is the kid ? they will get there with time . you must be proud ! ! <|endoftext|>
oh thats convenient ! do you have lots of good friends ? ? ? it ' s hard to find nice friends ! <|endoftext|>
i know . i am so sure you are going to miss it ! i also just moved from florida , about 8 hours from where i originally moved , to florida , and that ' s one of the biggest places i have ever been . i hope everything goes well , and the weather takes care of itself ! <|endoftext|>
oh no , did you have insurance ? that ' s so terrible , i would be so devastated too . <|endoftext|>
good thing you didnt cause the accident , it could have been worse . at least you diddnt get hurt . <|endoftext|>
i know how that goes . . i have a stepdad and a mom as well . . it ' s tough . <|endoftext|>
absolutely . as long as it ' s not anything huge like a child birth or something serious like that it shouldn ' t be too difficult . <|endoftext|>
thats awesome that your pet is comfortable with its owner though ! i bet your excited to move on <|endoftext|>
that ' s cute ! ! hopefully she isn ' t too crazy with rats . . . they ' re so sweet . <|endoftext|>
oh really ! six flags are a very fun park . how long have you been there ? and where did you go ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that sounds amazing ! ! did you enjoy it ? ? ? and what made it amazing ? <|endoftext|>
tumor seems very suspicious . how big is she ? ? what ' s she getting surgery for ? <|endoftext|>
oh no . i ' m so sorry , that ' s awful . you better let her go . <|endoftext|>
oh man ! what happened ? ! i bet she made you feel horrible about it ! at least she didn ' t tell you <|endoftext|>
time heals all wounds , but it doesn ' t instantly make everything okay . it takes a while to get over a bad feeling , but then you will move on . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! are you ok ? i would be so embarrassed ! ! ! please tell me that no one saw you ! ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible ! i am glad you were not hurt ! that must have been embarrassing . <|endoftext|>
oh no , i ' m so sorry to hear that . you have to have some faith , otherwise you ' ll never know . <|endoftext|>
i hope you have a fulfilling life . i hope it doesnt change . do you have any children ? <|endoftext|>
great ! do you have a release date and will you be able to enjoy it later ? or does it have to be on a special date first ? <|endoftext|>
are you taking them for vacation ? just in case and all that jazz . i would be nervous too . <|endoftext|>
oh that is great . is telenaea your first go ? i have always wanted to go there ! what is it like there ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that is a pretty big place to grow up in . i can tell you that the show is very heartbreaking . <|endoftext|>
that ' s interesting to read . hopefully there won ' t be too much chaos . hopefully . <|endoftext|>
yes there are . maybe you will see one someday . : ) ) just keep looking and you will <|endoftext|>
it ' s always nice to be in a good area to find a good forest . my old gym wouldn ' t let me go because of it . <|endoftext|>
was anything bad happen ? did anything happen to you ? i hope you can make it back . . . or at least give you a good story to tell <|endoftext|>
that must have been embarrassing . did he get mad at you ? i ' d be mad as hell . <|endoftext|>
i can only imagine ! it is so gross to have your dog lick your face after that ! what did you do after ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . my grandmother passed away a few years ago . how old was she ? <|endoftext|>
wow that is so caring and caring ! i need to learn to be more frugal ! thanks for the kind words ! <|endoftext|>

sorry to hear that how is she taking her care of ? ! is it from a health issue ? <|endoftext|>
omg i hate that i had such a hard time getting used to kay/ is she going to do ok . . <|endoftext|>
yes . try to focus on positive aspects of life . focus on the positive . work your tail off to better suit the rest of your body . but don ' t let stress get to you , you ' re the one that got to it . <|endoftext|>
that is always a bummer . i bet you were exhausted . what happened ? ? ? did anything happen ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s unfortunate . i ' m glad you made it safe though ! at least you were okay ! <|endoftext|>
that is a great thing that you are doing ! is he not a good friend then ? ? <|endoftext|>
you shouldn ' t feel bad for him . he is going to miss the love he had for his mom . i think everyone should give him a chance . <|endoftext|>
yea well thats no good at all i dont know what to tell you . . . maybe she is your friend after all ? <|endoftext|>
if she really wasn ' t so broke then she wouldn ' t drive around like that . but yeah , that must be nice to have a big family . <|endoftext|>
oh really ? was it at least flirting with you ? did you know the man ? was he flirting with your spouse ? <|endoftext|>
do you feel like this is the right time to end the relationship ? just to make things right , or should i say i don ' t know what ' s trustworthy " <|endoftext|>
did anyone get a photo of you wet you pants ? i could never get any that i ' m looking at . <|endoftext|>
i bet that was embarassing . we all make mistakes and we learn from them . i hope you didn ' t get in trouble ! <|endoftext|>
i am sure the news will be a happy surprise . what would your butler think about doing this ? <|endoftext|>
oh that is terrible , is it something that he really likes ? like a prank that got him caught ? <|endoftext|>
oh , well , that ' s ok ! disneis a great place if you really love your kids . <|endoftext|>
yeah , my husband is in a better mood right now . i don ' t think i ' ll be going again for a couple more months , though . i ' ve had a lot of bad decisions in my life , and it seems like things are going to be going well for me and my family . i just want to see how it goes and if it ' s as good as i ' d hoped . <|endoftext|>
how long have you been there ? and how much money did you win ? maybe i can look at you the old addicts . <|endoftext|>
i haven ' t been out of the country that long , where did you go ? i just moved away a few years ago . <|endoftext|>
ohh , sounds fun ! are you having the party ? are you celebrating your friend ' s birthday ? <|endoftext|>
that is great ! i am happy for you . are you going to visit her ? or is it far away ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! how long have you guys been together ? i ' m too old to go , i ' d be dead lol . <|endoftext|>
just think positive thoughts . its important to be happy about things these days . i hope you can be happy with just the two of you <|endoftext|>
oh man . i don ' t live in a city , but was caught completely off guard by a hurricane , but i hope things turned out for you okay . <|endoftext|>
that ' s good to hear ! glad you were home safely . : ) are you in the midwest ? <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s pretty crazy , were you able to recover from the damage ? did you have to evacuate ? <|endoftext|>
you seem loyal . a true loyal person . you ' ve been following your heart lately . i admire you <|endoftext|>
you think 10 years would do it ? i think it ' s a lot to go through if you don ' t want to eat the stuff . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , that is amazing ! is she still a young person ? ? ? did she get hurt ? <|endoftext|>
that is not cool at all , i hate when my kids are late . . they annoy me so much <|endoftext|>
well you better . certification is a tough thing to take . what is it ? i hope you do well ! <|endoftext|>
oh good , i ' m sure they appreciate it . at least they will have something to look forward to when they get back <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds good and somewhat funny ! but hey how could you really say that ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful . how are they doing ? are they feeling any better ? ? ? i hope they are . <|endoftext|>
congrats ! are you expecting a raise ? a raise at work ? or raise to pay off debt ? <|endoftext|>
yea that ' s good to hear . . . i ' ve lost someone as well and it ' s kind of depressing . . you should be very grateful to him <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry ! that must be very hard for you . how long have you been together ? <|endoftext|>
i totally understand that feeling . my son is 8 and has been feeling pretty lonely too . maybe you should go to meet some friends or family members ? <|endoftext|>
have you tried a cafe or bar ? it is much better for people to be with then an app <|endoftext|>
just give yourself a chance ! go for a walk or take an uber . it will make you feel more at ease . <|endoftext|>
i am sure you did fine . what are you going to do now ? is that really hard ? <|endoftext|>
oh that sucks , i ' m sorry to hear that . try to retake the class tomorrow . <|endoftext|>
oh that sucks ! have you talked to her about her playing it over and over ? that could make it stop <|endoftext|>
yeah , she ' s just gonna have to let her go then . . or don ' t <|endoftext|>
yes . those are really reliable and cheap . i still have some from 5 years ago . they were bought for really cheap . <|endoftext|>
i know right ! they practically work ! it ' s so nice . it ' ll still work fine if i just write a little happy with it lol <|endoftext|>
i hope so , that is a stressful situation ! what made you think it would sell ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good way to put it , hopefully people get the message ! ! ! if not , i ' m sure you ' ll be well received ! <|endoftext|>
oh , no . hopefully it ' ll be something she can do next year . i can ' t imagine not being able to visit her . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry that you didn ' t make it . i bet you will see her soon ! <|endoftext|>
are you serious ? that is not nice . are you really sure it was your sister ? i bet she felt a little guilty . <|endoftext|>
that ' s gross ! i can ' t imagine that to be very healthy ! it ' s hard to not love a pet who isn ' t healthy . <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty inconvenient . did they catch the culprit ? did they take anything valuable ? <|endoftext|>
i hate that ! apartments that have more than a few walls covered should be made to allow people to have access to things like that . <|endoftext|>
yeah ? what ' s the oldest kids in school for ? is it kindergarten ? i can imagine . <|endoftext|>
yeah , it really does . they just have to make it through this first semester and it will be a very very stressful and lonely year for them . <|endoftext|>
i bet you felt really sick afterwards eating that . did you tell your parents ? or are you trying to avoid drama ? <|endoftext|>
oh , well that sucks , what kind of food did you like ? was it just your favorite ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a very sad thing to hear . i ' m so sorry . i lost my father in november as well . it ' s so hard . i felt the same way when i was younger . <|endoftext|>
yeah , you can just stay calm and not focus on the speech ! i hope the speech goes well <|endoftext|>
thats pretty cool of her , what did she get ? was it a special occasion ? ! <|endoftext|>
that was nice of you . she may forget now , but it always sucks when you forget something . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure you will . laid off is terrible . why did you get fired ? did they really lay you off ? <|endoftext|>
hopefully one that is high paying and good paying is in your hands . but if not i hope you find one that pays more and stick with it . <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible , did they find it and sell it somewhere ? or did they take it back ? <|endoftext|>
what kind of car is it ? what model ? i would be careful with the new one , i know some people that have broken into homes . <|endoftext|>
did they have a good reason for doing so ? where they coming from ? were you expecting them to wish you happy birthday ? <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean . well at least it ' s over now ! take some time to think it over and try to figure out what ' s going on . <|endoftext|>
i agree with you on that , life can be much more complicated , or quite boring . but i know my grandparents used to say , i live in the past . and that made me feel a bit homesick when they told me that . <|endoftext|>
i agree . flowers are beautiful . they ' re like a gift from god . i love flowers . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! what happened ? did you pull your clothes over and laugh it off ? or was it something different ? i ' m always a little nervous when others are staring . <|endoftext|>
oh my , that must have been embarrassing ! did anyone say anything or anything ? i would have been laughing ! ! <|endoftext|>
oh man ! you have to tell your cat something . are you going to punish him ? i think cats can be pretty rude . <|endoftext|>
that is good , i have a dog that i named him after and it ' s a very light husky . <|endoftext|>
so sorry to hear about your grandpa . please , treasure anything that you remember him by . i ' m sure he loved those items ! <|endoftext|>
are you gonna wear them ? keep them in sight . . . always - - ) do they stink ? <|endoftext|>
ah , well you have to repay the kindness . did he take care of it ? what kind of car is it ? <|endoftext|>
he ' s such a good friend . rare these days , sadly . it shows good chap that you care . <|endoftext|>
what happened ? that sounds terrible . what happened , if you don ' t mind me asking ? <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness . that must have been a nightmare for sure . then you had to remember how it felt when you was asleep . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . you sound like a really great animal parent . i ' d be worried that i would get bit by a watermelon . ) but , i know that ' d not happen often . they ' re smart animals . <|endoftext|>
those sound so nice . what do you feed them ? i feed everything but the bears . i love the little ones . <|endoftext|>
what type of puppy was it ? is it a pitbull or something else ? do you plan on taking him to the vet ? <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness , i love cute dogs ! especially the younger ones . i have a little black lab and a little yellow lab . <|endoftext|>
holy cow thats an awful thing to learn , i hope they find a way to end the affair <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry it ' s hard for you . i am sure she will get what she deserves with life . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s addictive so your addicted too ? ! ? that is not cool . i have a friend who has a soda problem too . i suggest taking a simple self help book to try and stop it and that way you ' re both doing a great job and saving your husband in the long run ! <|endoftext|>
oh lord , that takes longer than two days ! i try to get 3 cups every night , but i get so tired so fast . <|endoftext|>
i am sure your daughter understood , but it ' s hard to know how she would respond to that . <|endoftext|>
haha that ' s funny though , you thought she was understanding , but when she got back to the store , you told her she was underselling . i would not be the type of mother to do that . <|endoftext|>
those sound so nostalgic ! did you play any of the games on the cd ? i always get nostalgia myself when thinking about the simpler days . <|endoftext|>
those games can make you tired , i ' m usually the loser of my family even when i win ! <|endoftext|>
oh thats terrible , i can only imagine how upset you must of been . what was the job you wanted and what were you considering it for ? <|endoftext|>
we all have been there , i ' ve been in that situation before . they have to have someone to fill that position in , if they don ' t like you . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s great , just try to stay positive and the world will end soon . it ' s not meant to be <|endoftext|>
thats exactly how i feel . im single but love life lol . i wish it was that simple . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . a boat is quite the investment and it ' s great to take it on lake duty ! <|endoftext|>
yeah the conditions can be really extreme . . and you sound very smart so i guess the money is a good sign you ' re moving forward before the bad experience is too great to pass up . good luck ! <|endoftext|>
yes ! i bet that would make her happy ! you should take her to the local show . <|endoftext|>
sounds like fun ! where are you going ? i might be going soon for a vacation . . <|endoftext|>
that is awful , if you want to be friends you have to trust someone . however it would be pretty tough to do as a lender . do you trust the lender to pay you back ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good , sometimes i have a hard time trusting people when it comes to money . <|endoftext|>
that is so awesome . did you find him ? did you ever find him again ? i ' m happy you found him ! <|endoftext|>
i don ' t know what to say to that . she is lucky to have you . it ' s so sad . <|endoftext|>
i used to love to skateboard as well . i wish i could do it again . <|endoftext|>
i would say that it is worth it if you had a job that made you happy and not scary ! <|endoftext|>
that is terrible ! did they take the time to explain why ? it ' s always disappointing to have something taken advantage of without it being yours . <|endoftext|>
right , and now she is too old for all that haha . guess she was an angel when she was young . <|endoftext|>
what did you do ? do you think your friend is a good guy ? if so , the interviewer should be more than happy to keep the job and keep the person he works for . <|endoftext|>
sounds like you have some bright future ahead of you ! good luck ! ! ! i hope your luck comes to fruition . <|endoftext|>
oh my god . . that ' s so scary ! i bet your heart was racing ! <|endoftext|>
that is terrible , and gross . i am sorry you have to deal with that ! hopefully you didn ' t have to go through much again ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . i know how hard that can be . i ' ve had ms for the past 20 years , and i can tell you that it ' s a battle that ' s hard . i hope that you can battle it as well as i can ! <|endoftext|>
that is great , it must feel good to be alive . i hope you find some great cure <|endoftext|>
that is cool . i always wanted one of those . is it expensive ? ? ? haha <|endoftext|>
did he catch a break ? i used to love to sit on my old pup and play with it when i was little . <|endoftext|>
that ' s so reckless . it ' s like people don ' t care about the negative outcome <|endoftext|>
lol . what do you think this person was going to do ? i hope the police are involved . otherwise , i would be wondering why they were not in my car in the first place . <|endoftext|>
thank you for your service that was very kind of you to help her . sounds like she was very lucky . <|endoftext|>
i can relate , i lost my mom to cancer a long time ago . i am so sorry for your loss . <|endoftext|>
thats good you are a good parent : ) what grade ? what grade is your son ? <|endoftext|>
wow ! is he doing well at his new job ? how does he afford such a great girlfriend ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . congratulations . i ' m glad it ' s paying off . are you going to take care of your parents ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good that you are so committed to your faith . a lot of people struggle with that and it ' s hard . <|endoftext|>
oh how nice . how old are they now ? and how did they look ? i hope they are nothing special . <|endoftext|>
time does feel a lot longer . it ' s nice to have time to reflect . it shows how young they are . <|endoftext|>
it ' s so sad ! i never knew she did passed away . aretha means old in english and my dad says she still has his autographs ! <|endoftext|>
i am sure they will be around forever . it takes hard work to make a one 10 ticket ticket every year . <|endoftext|>
sounds like a nice dinner ! where did you guys get your beans and rice ? ? ? ! <|endoftext|>
three hours ? that ' s insane ! you should have been eating like a king ! i ' d be eating like batman ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that must of been scary . are you going to sue ? is everything okay ? <|endoftext|>
what happens when the father doesn ' t give up on him ? are the children happy ? is he unhappy with the custody ? <|endoftext|>
awesome ! what type of exam are you giving ? i need to get back to work . . . <|endoftext|>
what ' s that ? i ' m very curious , honestly . if it ' s not something urgent , then maybe a little anxious . either way , i hope you ' re able to get it resolved soon ! <|endoftext|>
awesome ! it ' s always nice to have something to prepare them for , doesn ' t it ? <|endoftext|>
good for you . i am sure you will do well in the future . you are the most important person in the world . <|endoftext|>
that is so terrible . do you have to pay any fine ? how do you handle it ? <|endoftext|>
that is so sweet . that is all you can do now , as long as you can continue your love with it . <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh ! i ' m so sorry to hear that . how did that make you feel ? <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never done it , but i ' m sure you ' d be able to get them put back <|endoftext|>
oh no . i hope he was better ! ! did they get to go to bed soon ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad she is going better ! i hope she gets better too . good friend for your help . <|endoftext|>
sounds like so much fun ! are you going to bring it home ? : ) i love animals ! <|endoftext|>
i love cats too ! i have two . they ' re cute but if they don ' t get bit by dogs or cats , they ' ll just become part of the family . how many do you have ? <|endoftext|>
hey man i ' m a violinist who is frequently mentioned in a violin and guitar groups . shame you didn ' t win . <|endoftext|>
for how good you do ? you must be very good then . when will you learn ? ? <|endoftext|>
oh yeah well thats life haha so at least its a new experience for you ? im sure everyone understood but still <|endoftext|>
pride is important . you must have a good group of friends that you can hang out with to keep in contact . <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . did you give up on him ? are you working at least two different jobs ? <|endoftext|>
maybe you should tell him not to keep working that hard . he may not like it . what will you do ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . it ' s hard to know what to do but it ' d be good to get your mind off it . <|endoftext|>
wow that is mean . did he get fired ? maybe i should quit myself and find a new job . <|endoftext|>
that really stinks . were you able to get it back to completely healthy ? that can happen to anyone . <|endoftext|>
thats ok you are still doing good . i hope it wasnt too much of an achievement <|endoftext|>
that is nice of you . did he babysit you ? how was the babysitting ? <|endoftext|>
thats great , its good to have people that care about you that will be there to take care of you . <|endoftext|>
i had an interview today and my interview date is next week . i ' m going to take the offer ! <|endoftext|>
eww , i hate when they do that . you should throw the trash out ! lol <|endoftext|>
yeah pollution . they were so cool though ! i will try to search more into it ! thank you ! <|endoftext|>
good luck ! i bet that you ' ll get some good news . but you ' re still a kid , so you shouldn ' t be worried about it . you ' d just have to learn the different techniques and techniques for the new team <|endoftext|>
yeah i know what you mean . just try and keep yourself the way you are and don ' t let your confidence control you ! <|endoftext|>
oh no , how was the dog ? did you end up getting stitches ? that ' s terrible ! <|endoftext|>
wow , that is a big dog ! did you find the operation necessary ? i know how expensive it can be to have animals die . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s cool . what did you get ? the new mario game ? and which one is you favorite ? <|endoftext|>
wow , he would only lose 20 pounds a month ! that is impressive . what kind of switch did you get ? <|endoftext|>
thats nice of you . is he coming with you ? ? ? do you want to go camping ? <|endoftext|>
you should definitely stay strong and let it happen naturally . just in case it doesn ' t work out , it ' s your call . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! what did you do then ? i hope you escaped ! it must ' ve been a nightmare . <|endoftext|>
that ' s horrible . the way they train kids is not good for them . they need to be put in a better position . <|endoftext|>
you could always keep it if you really have to . i know it can be annoying to have stuff that you already have and can ' t use anymore . <|endoftext|>
i understand that . . . hopefully the items will be reatable ! and you can make a new trip together like usual ! <|endoftext|>
wow , that is pretty amazing . that ' s a huge accomplishment ! how did they do it ? <|endoftext|>
sometimes jealousy or envy runs in our family . that is how i feel sometimes too . i can ' t help it at all ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that ' s terrible ! did you get in trouble ? did you find someone ? <|endoftext|>
i bet you were frustrated . kids can be pretty rash . do they run wild sometimes ? how old are you ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . did you talk to himher ? you may have missed himhim . <|endoftext|>
just be yourself and i ' ll call you ! don ' t let anyone else dictate your life ! <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! that ' s awesome , i ' ve never had the chance to hear about your husband and his family . <|endoftext|>
family time is certainly always nice , but my time is short : ) i have to work today ! <|endoftext|>
i would feel bad too , but then again i ' m probably wouldn ' t have been able to stop thinking it <|endoftext|>
maybe they wanted to save you ! i would be very jealous . i hope you are next ! <|endoftext|>
beautiful , how long were you suppose to take it ? is it for a test ? i am very happy for you , and want you to be on the supreme court . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i love visiting new places and revisiting old places . i ' m sure dc will be a great visited place for you ! <|endoftext|>
where to ? i am moving too soon , i am sorry ! what town are you moving to ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , hopefully that will be the best state in humans , because at least then you have something to do ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s pretty mean . did you ever get a beat down at school ? did you do anything embarrassing ? <|endoftext|>
that was so gross ! did you ever confront him ? or did he not accept ? i hope you guys were just hanging out because you were mortified ! ! <|endoftext|>
nice . what field ? does it make a big difference if you ' re a banker ? something about it makes you seem like you ' d be better off in a field like that . <|endoftext|>
sounds interesting ! have you gone through it before ? i bet it ' s interesting . statistics is a great way to introduce people to the world . <|endoftext|>
i hope it doesn ' t sting too much . if i won , i ' d be pretty jealous since i didn ' t win . <|endoftext|>
it would be great . i haven ' t been there in years . you can always take the family . <|endoftext|>
wow really ? that ' s intense ! did he die ? was he even alive ? was that his first attack ? <|endoftext|>
i dont like horror movies that much . . i think i will stay horror movie forever . . like scary movies from the late 50s . <|endoftext|>
oh cool . is it the first date ? are you going to go with anyone ? or just get a trip down ? <|endoftext|>
moving is always a hassle . i am sure you will be fine . also packing can be hard <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i would be so mad ! i ' ve been in that situation . did you call the police ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful ! do you know who was doing it ? or did they do it to random people on the road ? <|endoftext|>
how was that ? did you cry ? why was she a puppy ? was she not a good dog ? <|endoftext|>
yeah i bet she was . what did you get with it ? ? i never get gifts for gifts , and never win anything either . <|endoftext|>
i appreciate that , if you have a spare change of clothes it was very nice of you to help him <|endoftext|>
maybe he can though , if you tell him you don ' t do it often . but be careful with the money . <|endoftext|>
i don ' t blame you . i live on a busy street and see people doing it all the time . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i agree . you should really help him out with something , though ! it ' s hard to do something like that when people expect it . <|endoftext|>
where are you moving ? i wish i was there to move . are you excited ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
well hopefully you get it ! it ' s a good feeling waiting for something like that . like when you really really need it . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that ' s so sad . what was the job ? did they ask about it ? <|endoftext|>
i hope you get it . what is your occupation now ? do you have a prospects for the future ? <|endoftext|>
disgusting ! did you call the cops ? ? ? ! ? ! lol . that ' s not nice ! <|endoftext|>
yeah , maybe karma will tell them the person didnt really need it . i ' ve seen worse too , and it ' s pretty frightening . <|endoftext|>
new york ? im moved there about a year ago . . . really looking forward to it . <|endoftext|>
hopefully they send you to korea or something like that , sounds exciting to me ! : ) where are you going ? <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s horrible ! what happened ? did you have it cleaned ? are you going to replace it ? <|endoftext|>
sometimes life can turn us over too . but you live and you learn , i guess . you ' ll feel better next time . <|endoftext|>
did it make her happy ? what kind of toy is it ? do you still have the toy ? <|endoftext|>
she was a cream color pupcat with blue eyes . she was only 8 years old . <|endoftext|>
congrats ! when will you find out what the offer be ? was it a good offer ? <|endoftext|>
oh i see ! great job , i bet you are a great student ! what did you study ? <|endoftext|>
what is your final exam on ? and do you think you did well ? if you did very well , then you should be fine . <|endoftext|>
i really hope you do ! just stay on top of that . what are you studying ? i hope you have a good nights rest . <|endoftext|>
what did you do ? did your friend trust you ? do you want your friend to pay for it or do you not trust him ? <|endoftext|>
oh , wow ! i see now . that is a really risky move on your part . if he is still irresponsible then maybe you should call the police . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . what are you waiting for next ? a raise ? better pay ? or at least more fun fun ? <|endoftext|>
thats interesting . its good that you have your skills . . . do you sell milk by chance ? <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s awesome ! i bet that was very beneficial ! how did it turn out ? <|endoftext|>
good luck ! are you nervous ? that ' s a good thing to be waiting for , i know . <|endoftext|>
wow , that sounds like a lot of hard work ! good luck with it ! : ) give me a little credit ! you worked really hard . <|endoftext|>
i think you should still try to get to know each other a bit better and if you like each other it can be fun . maybe look for a new hobby . <|endoftext|>
it probably will , and it is good to know you are going to do well on your first try ! <|endoftext|>
what brand ? did you go check out what it was ? if it ' s reputable , i ' d totally be curious . <|endoftext|>
exactly , and it doesn ' t cost much to be in a hurry right ? so why not ? <|endoftext|>
yeah i know how that feels . we get rain here too , but i haven ' t felt like relaxing at home that late in the day . <|endoftext|>
i hope so , stay dry of these dry mice . just go for a walk or something and stay in touch with them ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i am so sorry for your loss . you must be devastated . what happened ? <|endoftext|>
yea i know it can be really hard but im sure your other pets will come back into your life . <|endoftext|>
where do you live ? i live in texas and we had a very extensive hurricane season . i ' m in missouri though . <|endoftext|>
i live in mississippi , about 1400 miles away from the gulf . i hope it doesn ' t cause any damage to your home . <|endoftext|>
sounds really bad . do you think you will be getting better ? or will that take a while to clean up ? <|endoftext|>
how many kids do you have ? mine is the older one i think . she cooks all the time but then does the dishes when i want them . <|endoftext|>
that is true , but it is still wrong as gluten has so many bad things in it . <|endoftext|>
i am afraid of that too . i hope the pain stop soon . i have a friend with ms who has that too and it is terrible . <|endoftext|>
colors can be strange . do you know what color them all are , or was it just random ? <|endoftext|>
that is very unfortunate . i am sure there is someone there who can help you though . do you work there at least ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s fantastic . i have a 17 year old son myself . he is adorable . kid ' s funny and cool . <|endoftext|>
i would say keep it and if you feel inclined just keep on making more . i believe there are out there for everyone . <|endoftext|>
that is pretty nice . pancakes are my favorite food . are you making yours or taking a side dish ? <|endoftext|>
thats so nice , she should be a great friend ! i need to learn how to make my own breakfast <|endoftext|>
that is great . i hope you find someone before they cheat on you . your happiness will depend on you <|endoftext|>
how can you complain when she gets up early to make you so a great meal ? you sound a bit irritated . maybe you should ask her how she feels about it ? <|endoftext|>
does he ? if he does i hope he does too . that would be too big of a secret . <|endoftext|>

that ' s awful ! what a bummer to have to go through that ! did the doctor say what happened ? <|endoftext|>
you don ' t feel bad . we all have to do what we have to . i am sure you have been stressed because of the new wednesday , and the changing of the season . <|endoftext|>
thats wonderful ! i never received that feeling before . i was really amazed . i pray to the pray to our hearts if you still wish for it . <|endoftext|>
i know how you feel . you wake up and eat junk food because you are under a ton of stress , and then a week goes by and you don ' t have time to change the foods so you have to eat them all . <|endoftext|>
i understand that , i ' ve been feeling crabby after eating chips from my protein bar this morning ! <|endoftext|>
nice , how old is he ? did you make him feel special ? celebrating his birthday is always great , though . <|endoftext|>

oh wow i ' m so sorry to hear that ! that ' s so sad , i feel sorry for you . <|endoftext|>
were you able to make it out okay ? i ' m actually pretty lucky to have a close friend who is so kind , even though i have no idea how they managed . <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that is she feeling better ? any signs ? does she have another sickness ? <|endoftext|>
oh thats a relief . poor pupper . poor little puker . hopefully , she has some more food to take care of it . <|endoftext|>

maybe you can practice in front of a mirror and then when you are sure you will be accepted there then you will recognize who you are . i hope you get accepted ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a lot of fun . did you catch much ? was it relaxing ? i love lake house , especially when the weather is nice . <|endoftext|>
i can imagine ! that sounds awesome ! i ' m happy you had a great time there ! <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s awful . i ' ve never gone through that , but i ' m scared to even open the door for someone who is too drunk to drive . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , they could ' ve vomited on your carpet as well ! have you put a waterproof cover on your screen ? <|endoftext|>
did you all have a good time ? it was fun . did you have a nice time ? <|endoftext|>

that stinks . hopefully his insurance will cover what you can ' t pay . it sucks not know what it ' ll be like for him when it ' s all up and running . <|endoftext|>
oh , man . do you already have physical therapy ? if you do , are you already a professional ? <|endoftext|>
yeah it is always scary meeting new doctors . i have been in that position before . they can be intimidating ! <|endoftext|>
aww , congrats , how old are your kids ? mine is just 3 and 4 months , almost 2 and a half <|endoftext|>
yeah , i can understand that . my dogs are always in the car . it gets to me way too much . <|endoftext|>
where were you all on ? i hope you had some extra time to reconnect ? i would be mad at my family for doing that . <|endoftext|>
i know that feeling i wish i had stayed at home instead of focusing on the road i feel like . <|endoftext|>
oh man ! that ' s terrible . it happens to the best of us . we can ' t wait ! <|endoftext|>
i always hate when that happens , it has happened to me before too ! did you report them to the manager ? <|endoftext|>
oh , i am so sorry . i know it is not a fun event , but how is it still hurting you ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad to hear that . i always wish people would just get along . it is sad when families lose their kids . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! what have they been doing ? are they on a business journey ? or just traveling for the passion ? <|endoftext|>
i love going ! it is always so fun ! even on the simple days like summer holidays . <|endoftext|>
what kind of things did they do ? i remember college well . what happened ? are they living close to each other now ? <|endoftext|>
thats sad . you must have been lonely in your freshman year . hope you can make friends and stay connected <|endoftext|>
ah okay that makes sense . well , i hope he gets over it soon . it happened to me , and i ' m not upset about it . just kind of a bummer . <|endoftext|>
are you mad ? that is bad . did you guys divorce ? why would she do that ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , that stinks . how old is she ? is she still that old ? hopefully she will get back to you soon <|endoftext|>
that ' s so terrible ! i hate that always happens in movies , where it ' s such a slap in the face and then when you see it in person it ' kind of makes it worse . <|endoftext|>
you did that right ! it takes a lot of drive to cut someone off ! i hope you ' re able to get that man out of there <|endoftext|>
i ' d totally be itlement . what did you do after ? get back at her ? <|endoftext|>
oh no , what happened ? i hope that it will be fine . i don ' t have any pets but i can lend a hand <|endoftext|>
how long have you guys been friends ? i moved to colorado for my husband and a few friends and it was the best decision we made . <|endoftext|>
wow that ' s great ! what a wonderful time for them to learn and to be independent ! <|endoftext|>
that was a great idea . i always have my kid in the car with me and i always save time picking out the clothes <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that . what kind of results ? did they come back positive ? are you happy ? <|endoftext|>
i can understand that . there are many of those who would wait for the last minute to know if they did good . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that . is there any way you can help them realize that they need to work with their father to not have such selfish sibling ? <|endoftext|>
you have a good husband and i hope he pulls through ! if not i say a strong love to him and offer him the support . . <|endoftext|>
is that a tennis game ? that ' s interesting . did she play field ? i don ' t think i ' ve ever played . <|endoftext|>
but what do you miss the most ? old games . old tv commercials . old school games ? <|endoftext|>
oh nice , i ' m actually going fishing tomorrow as well . i catch about 6030 catfish a day . <|endoftext|>

that sounds soooooo good right now ! what are you going to eat ? ! lol <|endoftext|>
how many people are there ? i only go to one a week and i don ' t see that much <|endoftext|>
well , why don ' t you come home soon ? just a thought . but then again , who doesn ' t ? do they live far away ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it ' s tough , but you ' ve got this ! i ' ve had to learn this way of thinking before moving in with my parents . it ' ll be ok . <|endoftext|>
i hope you get it ! ! ! are you excited ? ? ? have fun ! ! i am sure you are happy about it ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure that is the issue ! have you talked to anyone about it ? maybe the weather has changed or something . <|endoftext|>
oh my god that ' s horrible ! ! i ' d be mad as well , how did they take the drugs ? <|endoftext|>
or just move to a less quiet place lol . its better to be safe than sorry ! <|endoftext|>
awesome , camping is so much fun . i also love to listen to music while i ' m at it . <|endoftext|>
you may want to go simple . have a simple roof , no power , and be thankful for your momentary responsibilty . <|endoftext|>
that sounds scary . what was it ? sounds like a gunshot . did it happen ? or was it something bad ? <|endoftext|>
well that is horrible ! ! i know that sounds terrible . . how did you find out ? <|endoftext|>
is it raining alot where you are ? i ' m in austin , texas and it ' s been hot here lately <|endoftext|>
yes ! maybe you should find a safety class ! i would try that ! if your in a bad neighborhood maybe go to a pool or a lake or some other park or sporting activity that could be used to teach you better . <|endoftext|>
i have felt that way too when trying new types of cake . did you taste something you didn ' t like ? <|endoftext|>
did you eat it all or were you just really hungry ? how bad was it ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
i can totally relate . being nervous can be very negative though . you should be confident . i hope they don ' t let you down . <|endoftext|>
and you know when you buy the tickets , the tickets go back to what you already bought . . . and you don ' t have to buy anything . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad you have a good friend like your granddaughter . is she far or far away from you ? <|endoftext|>
oh i know what you mean . i ' m a big cookie parent , myself . i try to buy as much as i can . but man , i miss having a mom that made cookies . <|endoftext|>
that ' s amazing , i bet you are so happy ! it ' s so nice to look back and remember the good times ! <|endoftext|>
oh that is cute , did you catch a little kitty ? lol ! ! ! : ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s great , i bet she ' s a great player . i used to play starfox 2 with my friends all the time . <|endoftext|>
i ' ve never heard of either of those . what game do they play ? do they have kids of their own or are they kids of an older generation ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! i would ' ve been devastated . did you find something else to eat ? do you like french onion dipping ? <|endoftext|>
i bet you deserve to be in the right shoes if you ' re wearing them all the time ! <|endoftext|>
i hope you keep that job ! hard work pays off ! that is great news were you not offered a raise ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s so awesome ! i would be proud of that too if i were you . good luck ! <|endoftext|>
thats awesome . i hope you get it . have you been working very hard ? i bet you are really passionate about it . <|endoftext|>
why are you feeling so guilty ? that ' s the law of life . you shouldn ' t give up on your dreams <|endoftext|>
very interesting ! what is the secret ? are you a one income household ? ! ? ! : ) <|endoftext|>
wow , that is horrible . people shouldnt be doing that to animals . its so cruel . <|endoftext|>
i hope so too , too ! animals are what people take for granted sometimes , and i wouldn ' t want them to be treated that way <|endoftext|>
that ' s always a great game . i love that the english team was the favorites . were you happy ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s very cool . i ' ve never been in the national basketball team . why were they restoring ? <|endoftext|>
that would be really scary ! school can be scary for a moment ! ! especially when the kids are close . <|endoftext|>
it is possible . i really hope that you can enjoy a bit of home alone time before you move in . being alone can be really weird and lonely sometimes . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome i wish i could see mine grow ! i still have my toddlers toddler toddly days lol <|endoftext|>
oh no ! how did that make you feel ? i ' m sure it wasn ' t easy doing it beneath the desk ! <|endoftext|>
i could have told it was a ghost . they know what they do ! . . until you say " lol <|endoftext|>
well that ' s awful . that ' ll only make them more committed . maybe they ' ll fight fire with fire . <|endoftext|>
it was a very hard thing to grasp . the farm had great care for many animals . even some that had been injured or died in it ' s owners . <|endoftext|>
yeah . that ' s very true . what ' s your favorite thing to do during the week ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , for sure , and im sure they wont be in a recentyl ever again <|endoftext|>
thats nice . do you think he will get the attention he wants ? maybe he will be a good player . <|endoftext|>
is the team cleveland , the athletics there ? or were you a huge browns fan when he was born ? <|endoftext|>
yeah that ' s great , do you have any now ? any big plans ? ! ? ! <|endoftext|>
i think that ' s where you get your anon" lines from ! that said , i agree with you on the mom watching it without you . my mother always tries to pick me up and leave when i don ' t . that ' d be infuriating . i should be more alert when i watch it . <|endoftext|>
16 , 17 and 13 . they ' re both middle aged now , but when they were little they definitely looked like kids . <|endoftext|>
that is disappointing . are you going to miss them ? will they be back ? is that the case for your friend ? <|endoftext|>
lol ! maybe one day you could save up a couple million and invest it in stocks . <|endoftext|>
was it friendly ? that could be an dangerous dog if it was loose ! did you say anything ? <|endoftext|>
wow , that ' s terrifying . i hope you didn ' t get attacked . i hate aggressive animals ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . you must have been heartbroken for a long time . <|endoftext|>
oh man that sounds awful . my mother did that and she died too . she was such a strong woman . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , so she got it working at least . i remember those days with my son . my little sister always had trouble with the directions . i thought she was going to hit the blank wall . <|endoftext|>
yeah life moves fast . you should be proud of her ! its good she is making her way through school . <|endoftext|>
what were you short of ? what band fees ? and how did you find out you were short ? <|endoftext|>
you must be very prepared for that ! good on you . where did you go to school ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry to hear that . i hope it wasn ' t too expensive to buy a home ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i know exactly what you mean . my mother was actually killed in a car hit me for speed walking when i was kidsaged . <|endoftext|>
thats too bad . maybe she could come back soon . . . it ' s all in the mind . <|endoftext|>
good work , how long have you worked as a math class ? i always try to stay as pure as possible and always choke up when i work harder . haha <|endoftext|>
oh my god . why was you mom so mad ? ! was your mom upset ? jk i hope you ' re ok <|endoftext|>
she should buy you one of those 20 gift cards so you can share the experience with your parents <|endoftext|>
what movie was that ? i don ' t understand how to watch movies . . . why were you so sad ? <|endoftext|>
wow ! that must have been awesome ! we didn ' t have any kids in assic park at first . i bet you were full of pride ! <|endoftext|>
that is not cool . did he at least get a money back ? that would have been really nice . <|endoftext|>
he is the reason we exist ! ! ! : ) you should be proud of him and show him your love ! <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . i can ' t imagine having to deal with that . maybe try working from home with someone else ? <|endoftext|>
well as long as you aren ' t using anything alerts she isn ' t a kid . <|endoftext|>
have you been able to make a move on them yet ? just try to be as confident as you can <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure you will ! as long as you know you ' re doing the right thing . <|endoftext|>
ewwww . that must have been gross . did you get rid of it ? at least you tried to wipe it off with a towel ! <|endoftext|>
right i always get the ones that are apple id . the new ones arent too bad tho <|endoftext|>
that sounds so scary ! what did you do ? ! was it wild ? did you chase it ? <|endoftext|>
what did you do about it ? ? did you shoot it ? or have you never met it before ? <|endoftext|>
aww , what breed is he ? does he have a name ? what kind of dog is he . <|endoftext|>
awww , i have a little dog named charlie . i hope he is well taken care of ! <|endoftext|>
i would if i were you ! pies always make me feel awful . what kind of pie was it ? <|endoftext|>
i would feel guilty as well ! ! ! if she found it he would get mad and take it home . maybe you could show him how much you have left and ask him how many were gone ! <|endoftext|>
you are so lucky to have gotten that experience ! what did you do ? i would have probably stepped on it ! <|endoftext|>
if they won ' t let you know there was a ghost in the graveyard , it will hopefully wake them up soon . <|endoftext|>
how did that go ? ! ? ! ! ! you must be so scared ! ! ) <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome ! what did you get ? i bet that was amazing ! what was it for ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great to hear . better quality than nothing . do you think they will give you any money in return ? <|endoftext|>
aw that is terrible , i ' m sorry . what movie were you going to watch ? i remember movies like that are always fun . <|endoftext|>
yeah , but you did it , you are going to miss them . . no matter who they decide to go with . you can always facetime them . <|endoftext|>
that is great , what did you take ? and what was it that made you so happy ? <|endoftext|>
cool . they are always so beautiful ! what will you name it ? it is yours now . <|endoftext|>
did it work ? did you do it again ? lol it ' s bound to happen at some point . <|endoftext|>
i couldn ' t let my dog lick my face after that either . she had a really mean face at first and it was just so gross . <|endoftext|>
i hate when that happens . . . when my cat does that blushyblux" move . and i don ' t mean her ) , i just mean that she does that unresponsibly . . and you feel like you ' re trying to break her <|endoftext|>
i can understand that . i have a big red one and it drives me crazy . it keeps me up all night ! <|endoftext|>
oh , my congrats then . waiting for interviews can be so nervewracking . i hope you get it . <|endoftext|>
have you studied ? do you have the basic understanding . i will pray for you . : ) <|endoftext|>
oh my ! i hate plane rides ! is everything ok ? was the flight a good one ? <|endoftext|>
where you hurt yourself ? i hope you weren ' t too badly hurt ! ! ! if i was you , i would just try not to let it happen again . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , how come ? is it because he ' s a pretty good butler ? have you won anything before ? <|endoftext|>
oh , it should be fine ! i was able to load up the game in about the same time , which is good for getting those good values for the game . <|endoftext|>
oh thats horrible . are they going to take anything ? shoot em up ? ? ? i hope they are real <|endoftext|>
thats terrible . i hope you can find a way to deal with it . you know the law now . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry . i know it ' s hard but at least you had your cat for a few years . <|endoftext|>

that is great , and i am really glad for your great parent , you ! it is not often parents care about their kids ' feelings like that of parents do . so , very proud of you ! <|endoftext|>
thats good . you are going to do great . ill keep my fingers crossed that you did awesome . <|endoftext|>
do you dislike that song ? does she usually play it ? what ' s the song ? is it any good ? <|endoftext|>
maybe talk to her about how her use to being so loud has gotten too high . if she still likes it , then she just needs to get over herself . <|endoftext|>
it was a bit of a relief to get her out of the house . i just don ' t like tornadoes . <|endoftext|>
i am going to grab chocolate or candies and go shopping . we love chocolate . i am so excited . <|endoftext|>
oh really ? how bad was it ? do you think they would still be there ? did you tell them to go home ? <|endoftext|>
i think everyone feels that way . i hope you didn ' t cause much harm . i don ' t know why , but it ' s funny . <|endoftext|>
did he take an interested eye on the car ? is he somewhere where you might have come up with the idea ? <|endoftext|>
what a jerk ! i guess he didn ' t have a car to drive ? ? ! ! ? what did he want to do ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . i think you ' ll be able to decide if you want to go education or just work on your brain a bit . i ' m sure you ' re very motivated . <|endoftext|>
well , my son was studying graphic design and it is becoming pretty boring so maybe go to school for a while and then maybe you can be the nurse . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s so nice of you ! what do you want to buy ? do you like it ? <|endoftext|>
that is good to hear . do you have a steady job in your family ? i mean , you said you didn ' t make anything . <|endoftext|>
that is so disappointing . maybe you could ' ve gone on a different date . you seem to have a good selfcontrol problem . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! i am happy for you . school can be a stress killer ! ! ! i love when my kids are gone ! <|endoftext|>
maybe you can do the same ? or both ? i ' m glad it seems that you ' re taking your mind off it , and that he ' s being honest with you . <|endoftext|>
your friend should be just fine if you check in . it is his turn . you can trust him with your business ! <|endoftext|>
that is so true . i recently just bought a new car . it can be really hard to not be financially stable . <|endoftext|>
yeah thats fair , i mean if they do a good job they should get a tip . <|endoftext|>
yes , what a terrible thing to happen . what are they doing to make it worse ? is he getting lots of presents ? <|endoftext|>
if it makes you feel any better , i would be furious as well . it just isn ' t worth it . <|endoftext|>
that must be tough . maybe you can ask your local exlaws ? they should be able to answer your question . <|endoftext|>
i bet . that ' s what errands are for . enjoy your day off ! ! <|endoftext|>
wow . . i cannot even imagine how you feel . . . that ' s brutal . i am sorry to hear about your mother . <|endoftext|>
what does she say to you ? that is a blessing in just the way that you thought . <|endoftext|>
i know it does . i am hoping for a good start to my career . . . i have no money <|endoftext|>
well i ' m glad you finally reached your goals . that must be difficult . how old are they ? <|endoftext|>
wow . each of your kids are growing up so fast . i ' m sure they ' ll be fine . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , they are really training you to be a nurse ? i ' m sure they are glad they have you as a nurse <|endoftext|>
did she turn out okay ? yes that is the scariest part about a newborn , i know . is she still very young <|endoftext|>
oh wow ! that ' s really impressive ! have you been playing for a long time ? how long has it been ? <|endoftext|>
good for you , the trust you can play on pc is worth the effort i bet ! i need to hit that point too <|endoftext|>
oh man i love hello kitty ! d good luck cleaning that up . . d did you get to go and get any more ? <|endoftext|>
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . she may be a little clingy then . <|endoftext|>
oh that sounds painful . did you go to the doctor ? did you get home ok ? did anyone help you ? <|endoftext|>
you didnt drink any at all ? was it a special occasion ? haha i can only imagine how embarrassed you must of been . <|endoftext|>
that happens to everyone . it sucks . what happened next ? did you do something embarrassing ? or were you just happy ? <|endoftext|>
oh no , is there any memory attached to that ? hopefully no one else saw or heard it . <|endoftext|>
congratulations to both of you ! i bet you are very proud , it is a very exciting time . <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that , my mom was in a car accident several years ago , she passed away 6 months later . <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh , i am so sorry ! what did the doctors say to the surprise ? ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m so sorry that you had to go through that . ms is a tough one ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s a bummer . how old is she now ? that must have been hard on you . <|endoftext|>
she should have told you sooner but you don ' t have to wait to hear the news . <|endoftext|>
well that was very nice of you . i hope she has a nice day . what does she do now ? <|endoftext|>
she is ! i am so glad that she is learning from our old car , the looks and personality that she has now is so attractive . <|endoftext|>
good luck ! you sound prepared . what kind of test was it ? i ' m sure you ' ve done well in other situations <|endoftext|>
good luck , hope you don ' t do well in it . are you a super studying ? <|endoftext|>
sounds like you were a good kid . always happy to reminisce . : ) what is the song ? <|endoftext|>
yeah it ' s weird how we can place so much on those times , when we really weren ' t that old . <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that , i hope he had a happy ending . . i hope . . . <|endoftext|>
oh no . i feel sorry for you . i am sure the doctors were trying to comfort you . <|endoftext|>
that is so horrible . she must be in a terrible pain . what did you end up doing to help her ? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry that happened . you are a great friend and i wish the same for her . <|endoftext|>
what did you have ? i ' m always hungry but that sounds great . what did yall have ? <|endoftext|>
skirt steak is a very solid and dependable piece of food . how hungry would you have been ? <|endoftext|>
how was that ? what happened ? ? why were you nervous ? please tell me ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
yea i can understand that too . dont know why some people dont just dont give a crap . <|endoftext|>
dang ! i feel like someone i knew once might want to quit drinking . . but i just wanted to tell you that i have tried to quit myself , and it is definitely worth it . i ' m sorry to hear that the lack of caffeine really plays to the brain and the timing of the pill . but i hope you find a healthy way to stop , and i hope that you can too ! <|endoftext|>
keep it up ! anything can happen ! ! ! lol- cheating is not a bad thing . <|endoftext|>
i hope you get it ! you must be so nervous . do you feel ok , though ? <|endoftext|>
what happened to the last week ? tell me about the news ! ! ! . : ) is there something exciting that will happen this week ? <|endoftext|>
oh no that ' s a little aggravating . is your daughter busy today ? i hope things get fixed fast for you . <|endoftext|>
wow . so what is the explanation for ? he wants to be a kid again ? lol <|endoftext|>
wow that sounds delicious ! i would have loved to have a pie . . . did you end up falling asleep too ? <|endoftext|>
good luck . stress can be upsetting . is it going away ? try to stay positive and let go . you deserve it . <|endoftext|>
did you feel weird or happy about that ? or are you happy they are looking for you ? <|endoftext|>
i see . i ' d be upset too . but maybe we ' re all human and have human moments . <|endoftext|>
really ? why ? that seems strange . i thought drugs didn ' t do this . if he ' s doing drugs then why wouldn ' t he be on drugs ? <|endoftext|>
that is smart . sometimes dogs can be quite unpredictable . did you find out who did it ? <|endoftext|>

i ' m sure you learned a lesson from that . i hope you got that money back . <|endoftext|>
oh , i hope they weren ' t hurt ! i ' d be more scared to try and get hurt from getting tripped over a drug dealing party . <|endoftext|>
well , you must have learned from it ! a stupid thing to do and even if it was not the end of the world you should have known better . <|endoftext|>
wow that is very sentimental . did it hold up well ? have you looked for it ? i know people have lost things in their closet . <|endoftext|>
i bet it did , hopefully you can revisit those with your next life . don ' t give up . <|endoftext|>
congratulation . i am sure it is a nice yard to have . are you doing it for a party or something ? <|endoftext|>

that sounds fun ! do you have a bbq schedule yet ? and you must have been excited about it because everyone should be eating bbq ! <|endoftext|>
thats too bad , i love sports but hate sports a lot ! what kind of job do you do ? <|endoftext|>
i haven ' t been to the water park in ages . perhaps i will go back and see if i can save up some cash for a new park . <|endoftext|>

i dont blame you , it looks like so much fun ! did she enjoy it ? did you let her ride alone ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s amazing . what was her first favorite sport ? maybe i should try her out . <|endoftext|>
i can ' t imagine the stress that must have been put on your daughter in that moment . i wish you all the best . <|endoftext|>
did they even try to reason with you ? they sound quite extreme to me . that ' s not right ! <|endoftext|>
you ' re so lucky to have a sister like that ! what a blessing ! i hope you feel better soon <|endoftext|>
i am glad i could help cheer you up ! how long has it been since you last saw her ? <|endoftext|>

aww how cute ! did you get to go pet shopping ? ! ? ! ! ? my dogs love to come over and we always have new house chores to do . <|endoftext|>
she seems a little guilty . maybe you can get her on the blindworld or something so it isn ' t as bad . <|endoftext|>
that ' s no fun , did she get better ? was it a cold ? a miscarriage ? <|endoftext|>
thats a really good neighbor , you are a good friend . i would ' ve been a little sick too . <|endoftext|>
thats nice , are you really happy ? why the wait ? do you like her ? what does she want to do after she gets married ? <|endoftext|>

do you have any ? did they love the kitten ? i love kittens . . how long has the kitten been rescue for ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m so happy for you ! it ' s so hard to adopt , some of the shelters are overburgish and the shelters that are known for it have low profit , so it ' ll take a while . <|endoftext|>
hail ? like a tornado ? that would be terrifying ! did it get that bad ? storm rap can be terrifying . <|endoftext|>
that is funny . i am the same way ! she got a car too , but i got used to it . now it ' s a hang over for the kids <|endoftext|>
what is a programming wizard ? what kind of program ? i ' ve never used a programming wiz before . <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad he ' s got you in his thoughts . keep us near there . lol <|endoftext|>
that is good to hear ! did you get the promotion ? did you tell them you are looking ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i ' m sure you ' ll get great feedback from them . is the job a job you love ? <|endoftext|>
that is a fantastic thing to be proud of . when will you share the winnings ? that ' s a great idea . <|endoftext|>

well , i am happy you are getting to see your friends and family again . if only there was some way to make them visit you ? <|endoftext|>
how was the first day for him ? did he have fun ? what did you end up doing with him on it ? <|endoftext|>
i bet ! i would be too ! it is such a scary time for first ! i hope he makes it through ! <|endoftext|>
what is the test for ? do you think you did well ? ? ? are you prepared ? <|endoftext|>
wow ! that would be pretty hard for someone who just has to pick one up all day ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome , was it an important job ? i think most people are nervous , but i ' m sure you got the job . <|endoftext|>
the best way to get a good answer is to make it stand up . good luck ! ! <|endoftext|>
what movie was it ? sometimes nostalgia hits us hard . it is nice when a memory hits us like that . <|endoftext|>
it will always be like that to me . it was so fun seeing all the old memories fondly remembered . <|endoftext|>
that is terrible ! sorry to hear about your loss . . . did it ever come up again ? <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that ! maybe you can get them a call to say you had a bad day . <|endoftext|>
oh no that sounds awful . why were you left alone ? is she doing something wrong ? was she being a sweetheart ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! how terrible . but , shelters are great for dogs because they find so many really cute guys that can help ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s annoying . i hate working on computers . are you able to fix it ? ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s fair . i ' m the same way . i have such a busy nature sometimes and that can take forever to figure out . but you ' re right , there are some products that help you . <|endoftext|>
that ' s really sweet of them . do you think they will keep trying new things ? i don ' t know , i felt like a kid again when i moved back in with my mom . <|endoftext|>
yes ! i miss that time so much . . my own grandmother passed away 2 weeks ago and i miss her . <|endoftext|>
wow that really sucks , how old is he ? and i ' m guessing he wasn ' t born until he was about to - - is he still alive and ok now ? <|endoftext|>
thank you for the heads up . i will keep in touch with my friends from now on . <|endoftext|>
i have a feeling you won ' t return them . they are always down . don ' t hold any more <|endoftext|>
it ' s always a good idea to do this in the event you really need it . it gives you an extra level of perspective . <|endoftext|>
oh man . that must be a smelly floor . did you clean it up ? that is the worst . . especially when you don ' t have a lot of clean clothes . <|endoftext|>
oh i see . i do shelters can be a bit inky sometimes . they may have mixed up dogs . <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! you should be able to write a lot of software . good for you ! that is very impressive . <|endoftext|>

wow , congrats ! that ' s a huge achievement ! how does it feel ? i ' m super proud of you . . <|endoftext|>
thats good to know , i hate parallel parking , too many people just parking to get in and out <|endoftext|>
that will be great . are you going with friends ? i ' m not sure how much time will be left at the beach <|endoftext|>
well that sounds great ! have fun ! : ) . also , make sure to bring extra sunscreen in case you fall somewhere . <|endoftext|>
sounds like a good night , i wish i had a umbrella like that ! what kind of place do you live ? <|endoftext|>
oh no ! were you okay ? did you have to pay ? that ' s a very stressful situation . i once had to fly a few times and i hate being on a plane ! <|endoftext|>
why didn ' t you wear anything ? why not tell him you forgot something and he may have gone a long way to make it up to you . maybe he is trying to get you out of debt so he can pay his rent . <|endoftext|>
she sounds very thoughtful . maybe you could throw a party or something . how about a chocolate cake ? <|endoftext|>
were you able to go home ? was anyone hurt ? sometimes bad drivers stick around when people need help . <|endoftext|>
what were the issues ? did you talk to your boss about them ? you probably felt like you could retell the story . <|endoftext|>
i love texas taco ' s . what did you have in taco place ? yummy ! <|endoftext|>

well then keep that attitude , i wish you many success days ahead of you ! ! ! : ) <|endoftext|>
oh nice , what kind of dolls were they ? i never owned a doll . i had only a few good ones from my childhood . <|endoftext|>
that must have been so nostalgic ! i think i had some that were in a plastic bag outside . it made me so mad . i don ' t know why , they ' re so precious <|endoftext|>
maybe you could get a new one for a similar cost ? that way you still have the same physical physical body . <|endoftext|>
how ' d it break ? did you get mad ? hopefully you don ' t have to let it ruin your weekend . <|endoftext|>
wow . do you make enough to make time for anything ? that sounds like fun ! was it for a special trip ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s good . you should celebrate by going and doing something awesome with your life ! ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome , that makes sense when you know you are getting more productive with an average human . <|endoftext|>
i am sure it will go well ! ! ! what field is it for ? ? ? do you have a job ? <|endoftext|>
awesome i wish you the best of luck . good luck ! . i hope everything goes well . <|endoftext|>

that ' s very nice of him . did you get a prize for it ? that is always a good prize . <|endoftext|>
wow , was it a good job ? how did it go ? i don ' t really want a video job . <|endoftext|>
i can understand that . . . im sure it will be ok ! just have to work on being positive <|endoftext|>
my pleasure ! i ' m sure she ' ll appreciate your kindness more than you will . i ' ve felt more at peace during the last two years knowing how much i appreciate my family . <|endoftext|>
i can ' t imagine a worse pain . have you ever thought about taking some types of medicine to help destress and relax ? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry you are having a hard time . i hope your well deserved visits come back at a good cost ! <|endoftext|>

oh no ! you should train her . i wouldn ' t mind my dog to count as well . <|endoftext|>
hahahahah . . playing school , raising kids , all good things i guess . . . just makes you want to hide and wait for them to grow . <|endoftext|>
what is her name ? i love that uniform ! mine is really old too . . . like 20 years old <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a fun game . did you play it ? it sounds like you enjoyed it . <|endoftext|>
when does it start ? it will be exciting . i ' ve never had a tv before . <|endoftext|>
i hope everything works out okay . hang in there . we ' re all in this together . <|endoftext|>
i ' ve had that happen before . i am glad it wasn ' t something serious and just drink a bunch to feel a bit more normal . <|endoftext|>
no , it is not something you should worry about . the only thing to do is to take your mind off things and try to focus on just your focus . <|endoftext|>
jebodiah ' s concoction can cure any anything , huh ? that sounds like a very good connection to him to me . <|endoftext|>
what is an uncle jeb ? someone that seems cool but doesn ' t do you dirty ? <|endoftext|>
oh no that really sucks . did you get the cat fixed ? did they do a good job ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome to hear , i ' m glad to hear that . glad she ' s doing good ! <|endoftext|>

do you have an emergency kit ? or do you just get prepared ? lol . it happens to the best of us <|endoftext|>
well maybe you should go to the grocery store with the coupons and pick out your own food . <|endoftext|>
that ' s gross . did she get hurt ? was she hurt ? did she have fun ? <|endoftext|>
thank god she is ok . what did you do to get her to go back in ? addiction is so tough and scary . <|endoftext|>
oh , were you able to make them ? did you reschedule ? ? ? that could always be an option . <|endoftext|>
did you reschedule ? maybe something simple to do . sometimes people are just terrible people sometimes ! <|endoftext|>
do they ? i didn ' t know that . that does seem very strange . maybe the president wants a little something extra to add to his bucket list ? <|endoftext|>
people like that need to be removed from the rest of the world . how ' d you take it ? <|endoftext|>
i bet . i went through one like that back in my day as well , great times . <|endoftext|>
yeah , i know . it ' s nice when our little memories come to us . it makes us feel warm and fuzzy . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry , that must be a lot of pressure . did you enjoy yourself at least ? <|endoftext|>
were you flying from another country ? how long did it take to arrive ? was it an important destination ? <|endoftext|>
i bet that was nice looking back . what was your major ? did you make any friends at college ? <|endoftext|>
i bet that was really fun . you must have been very proud . have you gone somewhere else yet ? <|endoftext|>

that ' s awesome . how did you do ? i would like to work there someday . if i don ' t end up getting it . i ' ll just stay here . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that is awful , i am sorry ! how did they lay you off ? ? <|endoftext|>
what lie did you tell ? i want to know ! ! ! if you have to tell a lie to your mom she will attack you . <|endoftext|>
so how did that make you feel ? it can be so hard to deal with sometimes . . <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! was it something you could really afford ? i know that can be really stressful . <|endoftext|>
well , congrats then . not many people are like that and it ' s great . <|endoftext|>
oh my god , did you see anyone ? i ' m sorry . that sounds bad . i hope you feel better ! <|endoftext|>
that is awful . did the police report it to anyone ? i hope they came after you for a crime you didn ' t punissh them for . <|endoftext|>
what was it for ? did you enjoy it ? ? ? : ) have you gotten any gifts yet ? <|endoftext|>
i hope you wear them some day ! that sounds wonderful . congrats . . if i was you i ' d be super excited also <|endoftext|>
so you think it was going well for you ? i am sure the interviewer wasn ' t underestimating you at all ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s great to hear ! we all need help and help to learn from our mistakes sometimes . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! was it cold out ? i hope no one was hurt . you must have been terrified ! <|endoftext|>
that is scary . i hope it didn ' t cost too much to fix . i hate hearing those noises in the house . <|endoftext|>
i hope you win , that is a cool raffle ! what kind of car ? is it car of his own ? <|endoftext|>
thats awful , how long does it take to research the cancer ? i hope it is worth it for them to get cancer . <|endoftext|>
that was very nice of them . what kind of move was it ? and what was it for ? <|endoftext|>
oh man , i am so sorry to hear that ! i hope you are alright now ! that is amazing ! <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . how many tickets did you buy ? ! ? ! ! ! ? lol <|endoftext|>
i don ' t blame you at all . you have to think about saving more . i know that it can be stressful and difficult . <|endoftext|>
did you try the other games ? i ' ve only played the first one . and i ' m looking forward to the second one ! <|endoftext|>
why do you think that is ? i mean there ' s always the chance of you getting a rich family . <|endoftext|>
i am too . is there anyone else that can help stop them ? why don ' t they just stop trying to stop us ? <|endoftext|>
i am too . his presidency has made so many people so unhappy . i am just not watching it . <|endoftext|>
thats too bad . . im sorry about that . . were you thinking of bringing him back to you ? <|endoftext|>
i am so sorry to hear that ! you will find somebody who will keep you going for another 4 years ! <|endoftext|>
how did you get in ? you must be feeling pretty good about it ! did you end up getting the job offer ? <|endoftext|>
that happens sometimes . how ' d you respond ? i can ' t really diagnose so i ' m not sure . <|endoftext|>
that is terrible , did you have another computer that did that ? if so did you save the money ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it is . you ' re not the only one on this one . maybe you should have asked for a refund . <|endoftext|>
how ' d the finals end ? ! ? ! ! ? so many things could have gone into that game . <|endoftext|>
i agree , what choke ? i never said that they did it in a good way . what were you referring to ? <|endoftext|>
have you looked into that ? is it a sight check or a feeling ? where are you going to be going to the doctor <|endoftext|>
my house does that sometimes when it rains . you better get that checked out ! it might not be the same . . . <|endoftext|>
really ? when were you guys there ? do you usually go ? was it a good time ? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome ! what a good dog . did he get a pet ? ha ha . you are my favorite type of person . <|endoftext|>
what kind of job is it ? and when will you get the interview ? im sure you will do great <|endoftext|>
great ! it seems like a great place to be and to make a good impression in people ' s lives . have fun <|endoftext|>
i am so glad to hear that ! i bet you are feeling really good about it . did you study hard ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a good reason . why did you feel good ? it ' s always good to feel good during a party . <|endoftext|>
wow , mothers are great . it ' s nice you have a mother like her . i hope she knows how grateful you are to her . <|endoftext|>
that is so nice to have a mom . i do not have a mother myself but i wish i had one ! <|endoftext|>
its always a new experience that you get used to . its hard to move away but you will do fine ! <|endoftext|>
i can understand that . i ' ve only been out of town for a few weeks because it ' s so quiet . <|endoftext|>
oh no . it can be pricey but it can also be worth it if your children are in an area that is easily available to them . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful . it happens sometimes and i ' m sure it would be very hard for the family to replace the house . <|endoftext|>
aww , that ' s cute . have a good day ! : ) are you tired at all ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds like so much fun ! i hope you have many more great times together . sounds like you ' ve got great family ! <|endoftext|>

you must have been very strong up that you guys were able to put together such a strong bond . <|endoftext|>
thats good to hear . . you will have another chance to get your car before your gone : ) <|endoftext|>
it ' s nice that he was willing to help you . he sound like he has it in him . <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . but happy memories can be nice i guess . i ' ve lost many loved ones . <|endoftext|>
yeah i can understand that . i would be the same way with my sister . i hope you feel better . <|endoftext|>
that ' s so terrible . what happened ? did someone get out late ? did you take a photo of the poop ? <|endoftext|>
hey man , do all the work you want ! its the work of the people you named after <|endoftext|>

oh really ? what kind ? i love cats but sometimes its hard to find the right one that has the right personality . <|endoftext|>
omg , thats amazing . . . did you know what breed ? hopefully she is a good one <|endoftext|>
i am sorry that happened but dogs are family . i am sure they will make a new friend . <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure she had an amazing time and congratulations on the challenge ! you ' re in for a treat ! <|endoftext|>
it ' s always good to take your dog out to dog food and to see the faces of their owners . <|endoftext|>

oh my god , i ' ve lost that many times . what happened ? do you know him better ? <|endoftext|>
everyone needs ice cream at least once in a while . did he take it ? that could be a cold one for me . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! how did it go ? are you still in school ? and how are you going to take the plunge ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sure it ' ll be great ! where are you going to start ? how old is the dog ? <|endoftext|>
that is very nice of them , did you like it ? were you happy with it ? nostalgic feelings are awesome <|endoftext|>
i really enjoyed playing soccer as a kid . it was a great time ! we had a ball ball in our hands and i could see the ball touch the ground . <|endoftext|>
nice ! how did they fix it ? did they just take care of it for you ? ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! was it a long trip ? did you enjoy it ? what was the plan ? <|endoftext|>
oh no , is there a plan to get him to quit smoking ? i hear they are so helpful in finding healthy ways to quit . <|endoftext|>
it ' s hard when you have no one to support you . it ' ll be hard when he goes to college . <|endoftext|>
nice . i hope the flight goes well . what are you driving ? ? ? i hope you have a great time ! <|endoftext|>
are they your favorite team ? they have been great this year . they did good last year . <|endoftext|>
wow , they must be really bad actors . do they not have an hr department to handle the situation or do you think your company would have a hr department that could help ? <|endoftext|>
yes i agree . . that is why i dont like going to work either . . i get too jealous <|endoftext|>
i did too . are you still there ? how did she go ? sounds lonely . sorry . <|endoftext|>
that ' s right . college is much nicer now than before . i really miss it . what are you studying now ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry to hear that ! i ' ve always bid before ! i don ' t have a friend who would be happy to receive another bid , but i hope you have a good nights ! <|endoftext|>
hopefully she ' ll be in school this weekend , i ' m sure you will see her again . <|endoftext|>
i know how that feels . i ' ve done that . it happens to everyone . did you find them ? <|endoftext|>
i think you should stay it that way . never trust a stranger with keys . i don ' t have a car but i would feel horrible trusting somebody with my key ! <|endoftext|>
yea that ' s pretty weird . do they not look up to other roommates who look down on the looks of other people . <|endoftext|>
it ' s great that he got to leave so quickly ! that shows that he ' s really got something good going for him . <|endoftext|>
well , as long as you ' re friendly with the coworkers , you should be ok . maybe she ' ll understand ? <|endoftext|>
that is good that your supervisor is like that . did they know about it ? that is great that you have a supervisor who is loyal to you . <|endoftext|>
you would give it to someone you trust ? why not ? what if they loved you ? don ' t say it is your last money , man . <|endoftext|>
nostalgic i hope you were able to remember the concert and who it was . stefan is an awesome guy . <|endoftext|>
dang good job ! that is a great accomplishment ! was it a race with a team or with another person ? <|endoftext|>
thats amazing , you deserve that promotion ! ! keep it up ! ! ! : ) good job ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s really sweet of them ! was it a good surprise ? was it in a bad way ? <|endoftext|>
lesson for what ? ? ? well that sounds a little too funny haha . . but good on you for doing that to your son for once . he ' ll grow up to be very good . <|endoftext|>
was it a good one ? what were some good ones ? nostalgia is a very real thing ! <|endoftext|>
it does feel a lot better when your older and you know your childhood was a lot easier than mine . <|endoftext|>
wow , that sounds like a interesting experience , but bareback was never comfortable ? your mother was there for you ? <|endoftext|>
well now you know it ' s time to have your friend as friend as you can trust your horse . it takes much time for the horse to make of your mother and the support she can provide to you . <|endoftext|>
yea , i wouldn ' t do that again . just don ' t get involved in something dangerous like that and it ' s all good . <|endoftext|>
i hope your friend is not too disappointed . sounds like they might be shy or anxious . if not , apologize . <|endoftext|>
aww ! does he stay on the road often ? how long has it been ? is he away from you guys long ? <|endoftext|>
then i hope you both can both take good care of yourselves . try talking to him about your life and your situation . you ' ll both have a better chance at being able to hang out again soon <|endoftext|>
try to think of something else to do but work for the company you ' re currently working for , it will make a difference . <|endoftext|>
try to get over it ! life is too short for everyone ! do whatever you have to ! <|endoftext|>
i know the feeling . did you just move from florida to indiana ? i moved from alabama last year and was miserable . i hope you ' ll stay here long . <|endoftext|>
that is nice where are you guys going to go ? ! ? ! ! ? are you going to see my family or some kind of event ? <|endoftext|>
did the dog make it ? i hate when dogs get hit on the highway . so tragic . <|endoftext|>
you know that isn ' t good , but then why not get the dog from the tree ? <|endoftext|>
oh yea ? what did it say on your foot ? ! ? ! ! ? ? ! : ) <|endoftext|>
thanks for the story . i am truly proud of your recovery ! i am sure you were very proud of yourself . <|endoftext|>

that sounds like a wonderful surprise ! it is sweet you have such a lovely dad ! how ' d it make you feel ? <|endoftext|>
oh thats cool then , any special plans ? anything nice going on ? : ) what are you doing ? <|endoftext|>
congratulations ! you must be thrilled . what are you going to do now ? does it make you feel good ? <|endoftext|>
yeah , i get you . i enjoy it during the night as well . during the day , not so much . <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear about your loss . it must have been tough . but now , i am content with my loss . <|endoftext|>
oh , wow ! that is a very fond memory to have . was it related to your childhood ? <|endoftext|>
dogs are so sweet and it shows you care about them a lot . you ' re doing a great job <|endoftext|>
oh no , was the dog okay ? i ' m so sorry to hear that . i hope your dog is okay . <|endoftext|>
awww i bet you are so sad . have you thought about going and swimming or something to take your mind off of this ? <|endoftext|>
did you go and buy them ? did you ever find out who he was ? is he still here ? <|endoftext|>
oh i hate when customers are asking for cable and then they get a mistake made by someone else . especially if they ' re being billed ! <|endoftext|>
oh no , i am so sorry to hear that . i have lost two different family members to cancer too . it is very hard and it is usually one of the hardest events of our life . <|endoftext|>
i would imagine ! did she have a side gig recently ? i bet your family is proud to have you managing their business ! <|endoftext|>
sounds like a great plan to me ! i love relaxing while i watch shows . what shows are your favorite ? <|endoftext|>
i love that show . i have never seen it before . have you ? what is it about ? <|endoftext|>
i think you will make the right choice . grad school can sometimes mean a lot in a big city . <|endoftext|>
it is a hard market out there . there is not much you can do but try your best and maybe they will call you when they have something better ? <|endoftext|>
oh no , i hope you are ok ! they sound like jerks ! do you think they could be more understanding and understanding ? <|endoftext|>
im sorry to hear that . dont worry , it happens to everyone . soon you will look older . <|endoftext|>
that was really nice of you . i hope he ' ll get better , he sounds sweet . <|endoftext|>
eww . was it gross ? i hope you didn ' t throw it up . was anyone else too ? <|endoftext|>
i bet that was embarassing ! did it end up being anyone ' s fault ? ? ? <|endoftext|>
that might not be a good idea . i think it ' s better to tell the kid to stop now <|endoftext|>
good luck . are you confident that you will do well ? if not , then it might be best to rehearse in the meantime . <|endoftext|>
i hope that it works out for you . hopefully big money is in the cards . and you get a raise . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , that was kinda rude . what happened ? did you tell him ? ? ? or the ex ? <|endoftext|>
that is sad to hear , i hope that he will always find her and you can enjoy some alone time together . <|endoftext|>
i understand . did you ever do it again ? what did you guys do ? did you move forward ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad it didn ' t ending with you losing him . that can really test the waters sometimes . <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome , good luck . i am sure you did awesome on them ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s a wonderful attitude to have . will this affect your career ? job ? family ? health ? i ' m sure it won ' t . <|endoftext|>
aww , did you find him ? if so , i have a feeling you would have a good time explaining to someone what happened to him . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that is awful ! ! i bet it was scary . . but glad you can sleep at night knowing it wasn ' t hurt ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . do you like the work there ? do you visit often ? if you visit more often , you will love it there . <|endoftext|>
yeah , it is a bit scary not having visitors ! i have a hard time leaving my kids to spend time together so i understand ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s a nice way to be a good wife ! you sound like a good mom ! <|endoftext|>
hey . . you are all still good . i could tell your daughter would come back stronger than you . <|endoftext|>
its really nice to have someone you can count on like that ! i hope you can find it all out one day ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m really glad you have that in hand ! i also have a lot of faith in our ability to work our natural abilities and make life right for our loved ones . <|endoftext|>
oh wow , you must have been so anxious and nervous . but it must have turned out well in the end . what did you do once you found out ? <|endoftext|>
is he going to be a moneyer ? ! ? ! i wish him the best , that takes some hard work . <|endoftext|>
oh no . . . how old is she now ? ? i ' m so sorry . : ( <|endoftext|>
i am so sorry to hear that . is she doing better ? i am still dealing with cancer . <|endoftext|>
college is great for kids and for families , but parents get that attachment to their children too much . <|endoftext|>
good for him ! it is a great career to be in . you must be so proud . <|endoftext|>
awesome ! the beach is always a good time with family . what did you do ? ! ? <|endoftext|>
yes , it really is . i ' m so glad he is finally here and going off to college . <|endoftext|>
nice ! where have you guys been ? are you going to do anything fun with your time ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a great idea . i hope he does like that . what did you make ? <|endoftext|>
thats cool . i hope you guys have a blast . good luck to you guys . you ' re lucky to have an awesome husband ! <|endoftext|>
23 years sounds very long ! 23 years is a long time . is it because of work or something else ? <|endoftext|>
oh yea . it ' s always good to look back and remember the good times you had together . <|endoftext|>
time does fly by , but the moment that it happens , it ' s like that moment that your kids remember the most ! <|endoftext|>
that is great ! there are a lot of people that are worried about something that isn ' t important . <|endoftext|>
what job did you applying for ? is it a career changing opportunity ? congratulations i ' m super happy for you . <|endoftext|>
oh that is not cool ! what did you do ? maybe you should tell the neighbors about the incident ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s so crazy to have a child do that ! i hope your son can work his way up to be the next ben and jerry ' s main character . <|endoftext|>
that must be stressful . is she stressed about school ? did she have a good day ? <|endoftext|>
sounds like she really liked you . good for you . give her an air of appreciation . maybe she ' ll let you borrow her car next time . <|endoftext|>
oh no , i ' m so sorry to hear that ! i bet it looked like a good time , though . sometimes it ' s difficult to plan in advance when we have no one to go with us . <|endoftext|>
well at least you were able to remember everything . did you forget anything else ? ! ? : ) <|endoftext|>
oh dear . how did your friend react ? did your heart turn red ? ! ? ! ! ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad that he is in a better place now , and i hope he continues to improve . but you ' re not worried about your daughter , there will be plenty of great children who will grow up with happy and happy lives . <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh , i would be so scared too ! i am glad someone was there and i ' m glad you made it through . <|endoftext|>
maybe your pet won ' t come back so they can teach you . that ' s great they don ' t have any pets anymore ! <|endoftext|>
wow , how ' d it turn out ? ! ! ? ! ? please tell me ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s good to hear . i bet you got a lot of new friends . : ) <|endoftext|>
you shouldn ' t have said that . it wasn ' t that bad . what was the argument about ? <|endoftext|>
that is good , it gives you time to really look back and see if it is truly what they did . it also helps to prepare them for the future . <|endoftext|>
what was it . was it a shadow ? did it look like someone was trying to get in ? <|endoftext|>
that is pretty scary . we should contact the authorities . . . just kidding , i hope you are ok <|endoftext|>
well , you ' re doing good . it ' s nice that you feel comfortable giving to those in need . <|endoftext|>
i get it , but why didn ' t you give them something ? maybe even money ? don ' t feel bad , it happens to all of us , you just have to live . <|endoftext|>
i feel the same , it makes you appreciate life more . when my daughter was born , i felt a lot of freedom to just be here and my life was great . <|endoftext|>
that is great ! i ' m happy for you . how old are your children ? mine are 2 and a half . <|endoftext|>
were you able to convince them ? did you get through it ? i ' m sorry you had to work there . <|endoftext|>
i agree , race is a big part of it , and i have to say that is a very asian theme . <|endoftext|>
did you end up getting a new car after not driving for several years ? i ' m glad you didn ' t . <|endoftext|>
a civic is a nice car . i love hondas . those things are really nice . and a ton of money . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome . it is so important to be proud of your self . how did it go ? <|endoftext|>
that is good , i am glad you have found something that helps them . it will give them something to be proud of also <|endoftext|>
for what it worth i love those songs , i bet you did great . did you get good vibes ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s a lot of questions ! i ' m glad you passed ! i hope you pass ! <|endoftext|>
thats nice i love reading old mementos , it makes me smile and relive a moment from yesterday <|endoftext|>
its not silly at all . its probably something that you really wanted to say in the moment . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great to hear , i wish my parents kept my things too ! that ' d be my least favorite thing to do <|endoftext|>
hahah they ' ve got to get away from that crazy stuff sooner rather than later . <|endoftext|>
did you go home with the manager ? or was it something else ? that must have been very uncomfortable . <|endoftext|>
oh damn . did someone come with you ? i would have been so upset , but i guess we live in different world <|endoftext|>
why ? is it your friend ' s secret ? i would be as well . do you want them to find out ? <|endoftext|>
oh yea . that would be really scary . i would never want to go out with someone so close to me . <|endoftext|>
oh really ? i ' d love to see that . what play is it ? do you have a favorite character ? <|endoftext|>
i get that , i would have freaked if i did that too . congratulations though ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
how old is she ? that is great for her ! how old ? did you teach her ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . she will be fine . i bet she felt a lot more calm when you all took turns going off <|endoftext|>
well thats great . . . i wish all the best for her . . and make sure she keeps practicing <|endoftext|>
that is a good thing . just make sure you give her a lot of credit . it ' s in a store with tons of children . <|endoftext|>
i know the feeling . are you tired of clean house ? do you have any plans to move or are you ready ? <|endoftext|>
you are very thoughtful and you sound like such a thoughtful person ! i will keep you in my house in case it happens . <|endoftext|>
that is awesome . how are you coping now ? its good to have a brother like that <|endoftext|>
your parents sound like good people . i ' m glad you guys were able to get the share . i always had my parents split my share with me , but my brother was always a bit on the laziest , usually deadend side . <|endoftext|>
well that sounds awesome , i hope i have a long , long term relationship like that ! i ' m sorry to hear you got married , but if it ' s any consolation my wife and i haven ' t had one since i was a baby ! <|endoftext|>
are you seeing your spouse after all this time ? that would be so exciting . i hope you guys have a successful future ! <|endoftext|>
yay ! how long has he been an older" ? congrats on the new semester . <|endoftext|>
thats amazing . what kind of art does she like ? i wanna be an artist . lol <|endoftext|>
where are you going ? where are we headed ? ? ? . i hope you don ' t get lost <|endoftext|>
sounds like a good project . how do you feel about being on your own ? are you ready ? <|endoftext|>
i am sorry to hear that . did they have a good memory for it ? was it family or a friend ? <|endoftext|>
that is really rough . do you have plans for a party ? i might be willing to attend one if you want . <|endoftext|>
wow , she must ' ve been very strong ! how ' d she do in the us ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s so tragic and tragic in a way . that poor flea . . . and all the other injured ones ! : ( <|endoftext|>
you should definitly go for it , i love mine . you will enjoy it , there are a lot of other games that come out in the future <|endoftext|>
what is that ? a video game ? haha , that sounds like a cool game . i only play fortnite . <|endoftext|>
that ' s great ! i know it must be hard to lose loved ones . we have no idea what that would be like today <|endoftext|>
thank you . i agree , we take them for granted as well . i will always cherish her as a parent <|endoftext|>
i am glad i am not the only one feeling that way ! are you happy about your neighbors leaving or are you anxious ? <|endoftext|>
wow , i could not imagine living in such a place . i would definitely not go there . <|endoftext|>
how far away was he ? i bet you were happy . it ' s always nice to get away from someone you love . <|endoftext|>
what a cool achievement . what did you guys end up doing instead ? i bet that was exciting to watch . <|endoftext|>
that ' s sad . did you find the kitten ? was it somewhere safe ? was the kitten happy ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s great . i ' m glad he is going to keep progressing . i love animals ! <|endoftext|>
awwww . . . poor baby . was it a stray or a stray ? what did you do ? <|endoftext|>
lol , i think you stole it . he ' d probably run away . but you could give it back to the family <|endoftext|>
did you graduate recently ? when do you do graduate ? ? do you graduate at your new school ? <|endoftext|>
how did it go ? you were able to get the grades , correct ? and did you end up passing it ? <|endoftext|>
haha . . . i would say you should tell her she ' s going to be a little bit late and apologize then . but maybe that ' s just me . <|endoftext|>
that ' s terrible , did he come back to visit ? did he forget the night before ? <|endoftext|>
oh no . was your greatmoment not a bad time or a good one ? i hope you were just honest with everyone . <|endoftext|>
i love those kind of parties ! i bet it ' s so much fun ! and a great time ! <|endoftext|>
oh , now that ' s a weird experience ! do you know why you didn ' t have your dreams anymore ? it ' s probably because you ' re more of a math nerd . <|endoftext|>
yeah that would frighten me too , i ' m always scared of staying upside down when i ' ve been in a horror movie . <|endoftext|>
how did you feel ? that you thought you were stealing ? ? ? not in a good way or just because you felt guilty ? <|endoftext|>
the only time i would be charged is if they prove that you lied to them , and even then , there is no way i would ever let them do that to me . they should be required to show more than just a simple ticket . <|endoftext|>
are you any good , or did you just get too tired ? how did it feel ? i am trying to relax and healing after a long time without feeling too bad about losing my mind . <|endoftext|>
i see , well , for what it ' s worth i use it on my phone sometimes and it helps with eyesite ! <|endoftext|>
holidays are really nice , especially in your own home . what are you looking forward too most about it ? <|endoftext|>
i love harry potter , but i would be so excited too ! go yourself ? jk ha . <|endoftext|>
what kind of letter is it ? i hope it ' s one that ' s worth something . <|endoftext|>
i believe you did well my friend . do you think you will get in ? you sound very eager . <|endoftext|>
what are your favorite recipes ? do you have a list ? lol . a cookie chef is one of my favorite . <|endoftext|>
i just love doing that , i try to do a lot of that myself ! i love chinese food , and vegetarian helps too . i just don ' t think i ' m enough of a saver though ! i don ' know how i ' ll ever make it in life . <|endoftext|>
wow ! that must have been so exciting . did anyone die ? or was it just a random flip ? <|endoftext|>
i wish i had a video of that ! you must be so proud of yourself . i ' m sure you will be able to tell people who think that you aren ' t a great player by your video ! <|endoftext|>
i ' m very sorry to hear that . i can only imagine the pain that must have been felt . <|endoftext|>
yeah it can be rough for awhile but the experience over the period makes it worth it ! ! <|endoftext|>
i am so happy for you ! that is a very loyal and trustworthy act ! i hope you have a great life ! <|endoftext|>
oh man ! i hope so - is it your first marriage ? also , make sure you do everything right ! <|endoftext|>
oh no , was it at a light ? or silled you ? that will set you off . <|endoftext|>
oh i am glad to hear that . i ' m glad you made it back on time ! <|endoftext|>
that is not fair . . have you spoken to him yet about this ? have you thought about contacting him ? <|endoftext|>
what was the care for ? sounds like he has a bright future ahead . good for him . <|endoftext|>
it sounds like it was a great thing to fix your tire . glad it didn ' t get kickered by someone . <|endoftext|>
what a wonderful thing . at least you had that to look forward to . i bet you look forward more at those times . <|endoftext|>
that ' s so good . do you have a special memory for her ? or does she just love you still ? <|endoftext|>
maybe a gift for something nice ! what is she wanting ? ! ? : ) have fun ! <|endoftext|>
how long ago was this ? how long before you realized that you needed it for the supplies you had ? <|endoftext|>
i love pokemon ! what did you play when you were little ? little league or something ? <|endoftext|>
i ' m very sorry to hear that . that must be very tough . i ' ve been there . <|endoftext|>
wow , it sounds like a real life support system ! you are doing such a great job . <|endoftext|>
it ' s always nice to think of what we ' ve all come to accept as our childhood days <|endoftext|>
then stay strong , if he does not give you the same respect that he does now then it ' s time to move on . <|endoftext|>
that was very nice of you . did she find them ? was it difficult finding them ? you must have found them eventually . <|endoftext|>
that is frustrating ! hopefully they can get it under control this time . good thing they had cameras and a cameras camera ! <|endoftext|>
five is a pretty strong six , don ' t you think ? six is a rough four numbers , especially when you can ' t even put one together . <|endoftext|>
yay ! congratulations ! what kind of paper was it ? and what grade ? that ' s great ! what were the grades for ? <|endoftext|>
oh my goodness ! that must have been so embarrassing . do you know how much trouble it was ? <|endoftext|>
i bet they are a really happy person . i am sure they appreciated it ! : ) i ' m a little bit nervous about moving out of my parents ' house . i don ' t think i can move to a new state . <|endoftext|>
why ? wouldn ' t be a good idea ? what made it so bad ? i ' m curious . <|endoftext|>
oh no ! that ' s awful ! so did you get hurt ? ? ? do you think it was serious ? <|endoftext|>
what did he do ? i find it very hard to understand why he ' d do that . <|endoftext|>
you should tell him ! he may consider moving on to something better . it ' s hard to say , but i ' d try and convince him to consider moving . <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that . i assume that you have bad managers ? or do you mean that all of your work is like that ? <|endoftext|>
they probably have nothing to show for it . if they are that insecure , they shouldn ' t have invited you to come hang out with them . <|endoftext|>
yeah the upkeep is the worst , is there anyone you can talk to about it ? or does it have to be done all the time ? <|endoftext|>
i wish you all the luck ! if you have to do that , you got to try harder ! <|endoftext|>
that is unpleasant , are you okay ? i tend to wake up to go to the doctor for help . <|endoftext|>
ah that would be very interesting then ! i can see how that would really frighten someone . . . especially someone you trust <|endoftext|>
awesome . i need to start saving money better . gym is a bad place for that . not enough work . <|endoftext|>
i know how you feel . i ' m at 160 now . my weight has gone up and down every year for the past 10 years . <|endoftext|>
oh that ' s cool . i ' ve never done that but it sounds like fun . were you nervous ? <|endoftext|>
that ' s awesome . i ' m glad you enjoyed it ! what was it about ? were you in particular excited to see that ? <|endoftext|>
good luck ! i ' m sure you ' ll make some really good money ! that ' s what people usually say about financial stability . what are your main goals , if you don ' t mind me asking ? <|endoftext|>
thats good ! what did you write ? i ' m always looking for new work . what genre ? <|endoftext|>
what are your chances then ? what are the chances of you not getting your dream job ? : ) <|endoftext|>
you can also learn to write and write a few sentences . it is a trade off ! ! <|endoftext|>
i don ' t usually have the best anxiety , so i don t do much meditating . <|endoftext|>
my wife is usually energetic too when she has an alarm . maybe you should try that ! maybe it ' ll help you feel better . <|endoftext|>
i know that is a common sentiment , but being lonely isn ' t a good thing in my opinion . if you can ' t have fun by yourself , then why not develop a relationship ? <|endoftext|>
it will grow over time though . that ' s how much bigger the universe is than we think . be careful ! <|endoftext|>
that is what i am talking about . its hard to let things get to us like that when we are in a place in life that we have to move and move forward . but this is what you have to realize . its a weight is lifted off your shoulders when you let things go too far . <|endoftext|>
i believe everything is out there for you . things always seem to happen for a reason . hang in there . <|endoftext|>
that ' s fantastic ! my son just started school and i ' m so proud of him ! i hope to look the same in a few years . <|endoftext|>
that is great . i need to make the same progress . maybe even earlier . i have a fear of heights . <|endoftext|>
that sounds like a lot of fun ! i do hope your night goes smoothly . are you planning on camping on a farm ? <|endoftext|>
we need flood lights , that is all we need . and solar eclipse glasses . just make sure that you don ' t go to the water park ! <|endoftext|>
oh no ! are you okay ? how are you holding up ? you are being through it i am sure . <|endoftext|>
wow , was everyone okay ? i hope nothing that could have been done by a random person or forest gump was involved . <|endoftext|>
ouch , did it cause any serious damage ? did you get it fixed ? my old car got hit an entire week ago and it was pretty bad also . <|endoftext|>
that is pretty awesome ! good to hear that you got your money back ! you are a good man . <|endoftext|>
thats nice of you , did it manage to get away ? i hope it did lol <|endoftext|>
i ' m glad . do you drink a lot of water ? is that a thing ? any advice ? <|endoftext|>
thats very deprenceless , i am happy you feel so much more connection to him then mine . <|endoftext|>
i know , you just have to be positive and positive ! embrace the joys while it lasts . <|endoftext|>
that ' s wonderful . i ' m sure your health is just the sweetest . anything special going on ? <|endoftext|>
i think being in a positive environment would help a lot with that though , i ' m sure it will be helpful <|endoftext|>
when i was in elementary school i was envious of the kids who were popular . did you get to go to high school ? <|endoftext|>
it ' s hard when you don ' t get in the mood ! you should have gone to the bar and had a drink ! <|endoftext|>
i could imagine . ice bath help to clear the mind . what about the shower ? does the ice bath make you more selfreliant ? <|endoftext|>
oh my . i thought the dirtbike had done its job and was going to wreck . my bad . <|endoftext|>
you got this . good luck hitting the gym . i wish i could get in shape too . how long do you keep going ? <|endoftext|>
i love raw garlic , it sounds so good right about now ! so that will be the next little snack you take . <|endoftext|>
i agree , they make the whole process very stressful . did you buy anything ? just to make sure ? <|endoftext|>
i think so too , it seems like it . i thought i knew exactly what you were talking about . <|endoftext|>
i love when my mom does things for me . makes me feel like a mother to the kids ! <|endoftext|>
oh my gosh . that really stinks . did you buy another one ? ! ? ! ! <|endoftext|>
do you know them or like them better ? if you like them you should check out the stones . <|endoftext|>
i love them . deftones is my favorite . you should listen to them . they are a great singer . <|endoftext|>
that ' s cool . i can ' t wait to get my license ! i ' m really wanting to try driving now , as i ' ve already got my dmv booked . <|endoftext|>
yeah . i hate car accidents , but i had some i was in one where i could be out of luck . they really are something ! <|endoftext|>
that ' s awful . did you do anything to catch them ? do you have any charges yet ? <|endoftext|>
did you lose your debit card ? that was an error on your part . if you lost that , that is a mistake on them , but if you did lose that , then it was an accident on your side . hope you had insurance on that . <|endoftext|>
what wasn ' t a fun time ? do you still do it ? or was it just the bad ones ? <|endoftext|>
yea you should find a new job ! you need to take it slow and steady ! i hope you find a good one <|endoftext|>
i ' m sorry ! that is irritating ! does he live far away from you ? maybe it will help his mind turn a little easier ? <|endoftext|>
that is sad . i know that is a tough stage . i hope she pulls through this week ! <|endoftext|>
i am glad you see that i just don ' t see it as fake when people say that they are doing the right thing <|endoftext|>
yeah it would be good if you could see the future . i don ' t know if we can ever replace scientists though . <|endoftext|>
don ' t be , you ' ll do fine ! a lot of people are afraid of presentations ! <|endoftext|>
that sounds awesome . i am sure you will do great ! good luck ! ! ! : ) <|endoftext|>
oh no , what happened ? was someone able to find it ? what a pain ! did they catch them ? <|endoftext|>
i agree , i see it more as an opportunity than a hindsight . it could work out either way though . <|endoftext|>
how did you do ? did you study hard for it ? what course ? did the professor make you go to one ? <|endoftext|>
that sounds very scary . i hope it goes well ! i ' m sure the grades are great . <|endoftext|>
how long has it been since you last spoke your shade ? that must have felt painful . how did you respond ? <|endoftext|>
