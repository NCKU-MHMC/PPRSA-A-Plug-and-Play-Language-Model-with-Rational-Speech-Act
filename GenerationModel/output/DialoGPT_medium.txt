Why did they hit the barrels? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did the drunk actually hit you, or just try to cover their tracks? <|endoftext|>
No way! I want to hear from someone else <|endoftext|>
He was stopped because he was texting and flirting wile I was driving :( I was terrified and shaking <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that buddy.. It's okay we have people that care about us all the time <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun to do with friends and family! <|endoftext|>
Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! That concert was amazing! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's really sad. What was the article about? <|endoftext|>
That's sad. I had a friend who was born with that.  What kind of doctor were they? <|endoftext|>
Aw poor baby! Is it alright now? <|endoftext|>
That's cool. Do you play any instruments <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that.  Is there any way you could help him find a new one? <|endoftext|>
What for? <|endoftext|>
Oh man I am glad they caught them. It sounds like it was a stray bullet. <|endoftext|>
I feel you there! It can be tough to protect a young child from harm. What makes you want to do that? <|endoftext|>
That's cool how long has it been <|endoftext|>
Oh cool, that's nice. <|endoftext|>
Oh I hate when that happens <|endoftext|>
Yea that happens a lot <|endoftext|>
No way that's way too expensive. I just did that yesterday to get a new monitor, but I ended up getting a Nintendo Switch. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
You are so sweet. <|endoftext|>
Yea, I am happy that you were able to able to put yourself in a better situation.  Sometimes a situation doesn't lend too much meaning to what's happening, but maybe your friend's situation would be better if she had more financial stability.  It's really difficult to tell how people can be financially stable if they don't have a traditional job. <|endoftext|>
Is it your baby's first day? <|endoftext|>
What did you agree with? <|endoftext|>
What country? <|endoftext|>
When did you decide on that? <|endoftext|>
Yes that is infuriating! What happened afterwards? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm so glad I don't have to deal with them either. I'm glad they are safe! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did it get you? <|endoftext|>
That's good, it's always nice to have those kinds of memories <|endoftext|>
I was sad when my mom died.. sad that much.. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome!  I bet your very happy now and wish you the best <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's what love is, when a person's face lights up on the screen when the phone rings, and it rings again. <|endoftext|>
Not really- No manager or director * asks * about* or asks/talks about* problems- so he *exactly* gave his blessing when I was having financial difficulties * <|endoftext|>
That is what I keep saying.  Its like a force field brings me in and knocks me out.... <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. Was it a serious one? <|endoftext|>
Thats amazing I can understand that! I dont have family in my own right <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  Have you had trouble in the past with your intuition? <|endoftext|>
It's like a knowing that if you aren't prepared it's a guessing game. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, you should go again soon! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  You studied very hard for that! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's rough.  It sounds like you have a sweet home-cooked meal and are doing alright.  You should try to go out and meet new people - it's actually encouraged <|endoftext|>
Sometimes they do. I used to be like that too <|endoftext|>
I wish that were true! It is always so interesting to experience that. <|endoftext|>
That sounds stressful lol. I like the idea of having a baby though <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a delicious place! <|endoftext|>
That is the worst feeling. <|endoftext|>
that is wonderful that you had such a fulfilling experience <|endoftext|>
How did it go / end up / what happened / <|endoftext|>
It does! I bet she has a wonderful partner now. <|endoftext|>
I've got no mom / I'm not gonna get no mom <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Yes. My 7th graders are all dead now :( <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I am so sorry!  How do you feel about the situation? <|endoftext|>
Awesome! What does the job do that you're doing *so*?! <|endoftext|>
I do it all the time but it's so expensive to do so. <|endoftext|>
I just read a lot and am learning to write and perform singing. It's a lot of fun but I can't keep doing it all the time! <|endoftext|>
That is crazy <|endoftext|>
Has she ever lived far away? <|endoftext|>
wow! you are very tough man <|endoftext|>
Wow, congrats! <|endoftext|>
Wow that must have been exciting. Did you do any stops along the way? <|endoftext|>
What did they say or do? <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate, do you have any example or just always assume it's bad <|endoftext|>
It's not always about anger. Sometimes you have to work away a little patience and learn what things are not right before you lash out at them <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What a terrible thing to hear!  Hope the cat was okay! <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's really tough when someone takes a life form a kid - Especially when the kid is only 4.  Not everyone is like that <|endoftext|>
Yeah!!! I bet you loved it <|endoftext|>
Oh I love going to Disneyland!  Tucson is awesome too. <|endoftext|>
That is always good to hear. Did you have a good childhood or was it rough? <|endoftext|>
Is the car a Honda Civic? <|endoftext|>
Yeah its fun.  I have 4 kids so you need organized space! <|endoftext|>
Yes they are so helpful <|endoftext|>
Me too, what are they doing online <|endoftext|>
We use online chats, but unfortunately we're not always on the same page. <|endoftext|>
Did you call her and console her <|endoftext|>
What happened <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Well you can still keep in touch if you want but you can't use the baby with family or what? <|endoftext|>
Sounds great, what did you do while you were away? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I get that.  I bet if you give yourself enough credit, you can do whatever you want with whatever you have <|endoftext|>
I have a degree in meteorology and work in meteorology. So i'm well versed in the subject <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that could be rough. Was it your moms fault? <|endoftext|>
That's the thing with being angry though... anybody can be angry.  It's not good to be angry <|endoftext|>
That's awful!  I mean that in the good old fashioned way! <|endoftext|>
I love my dog. she will always have love and recognition. <|endoftext|>
I can understand that <|endoftext|>
That is good for you <|endoftext|>
That must be amazing <|endoftext|>
yeah they are all grown. <|endoftext|>
i am happy for you! <|endoftext|>
I understand <|endoftext|>
Sometimes its just a need for self-employed work, or a need to do something you can do while you're at home. I've found that it's the need for work/life balance that keeps me in line :) <|endoftext|>
Yes. It is always a worry-winder if you don't have a side hustle! <|endoftext|>
Did you guys ever get together? <|endoftext|>
That is exciting <|endoftext|>
I bet that is going to be a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome!  What kind of vacations do you have planned for the area / area in general? <|endoftext|>
What happened, did you get busy? <|endoftext|>
What a pain in the rear <|endoftext|>
What was scary about it? <|endoftext|>
Haha that is awesome that you trusted him with your life jacket! That's awesome that you had someone to protect you! <|endoftext|>
You said it, I believe you! <|endoftext|>
Wow, she's acting arrsh, I'd sit down and talk to the cops about what happened. <|endoftext|>
Why did you do that? <|endoftext|>
hahaha that's awesome you ended up having too much. I like the honesty. <|endoftext|>
You were supposed to go to a rock concert. What happened? <|endoftext|>
I know. I love Beyonce. <|endoftext|>
Whoa! That is awesome. Did you end up meeting any cool people? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. That would be so scary!! <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome! Did he know what he got you? <|endoftext|>
You are the best <|endoftext|>
I would just do your best to forget about it and do what you want <|endoftext|>
Nice try... what is your adress <|endoftext|>
No <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, Did he take your insurance money? haha <|endoftext|>
Wow! It's always a surprise kiss if you've never had one. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that... <|endoftext|>
i hate those situations where the food is thrown away <|endoftext|>
They must have been on vacation!! <|endoftext|>
Oh, well when you've been around guys that much, you kind of learn to just play it cool or not even care at all <|endoftext|>
It's okay.  It's a rough situation.  Take care for your family.  They are here for you. <|endoftext|>
I cant imagine. I always try to imagine myself doing it <|endoftext|>
Who was watching you? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! The summer is the perfect time to go on vacation! <|endoftext|>
Oh, Panama City is a very exotic place! <|endoftext|>
That is great, she has a bright future ahead of her <|endoftext|>
I do. It is wonderful to have my own money and not work for others. <|endoftext|>
I always carry at least one cart with me <|endoftext|>
I just bought a bag with a 20-20 gym membership <|endoftext|>
Weird. That's a girl. <|endoftext|>
That is good <|endoftext|>
Me too. That's what I do most today. Good money, good health and good sleep <|endoftext|>
Oh I am familiar with it.  It's not something that I'm familiar with but that's what I'm familiar with. How do you do it if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
It's a recipe for success right there! <|endoftext|>
You have a very good point there. <|endoftext|>
that is awesome that you have such a great friend <|endoftext|>
Ah, you must be a great aunt! It was a long time ago, but I remember having those experiences as well <|endoftext|>
Really, what was the occasion or something? <|endoftext|>
That's interesting, those cards can be expensive! <|endoftext|>
I'm not sure but it's driving me nuts. My auto locks are always off and it's discouraging. <|endoftext|>
Not yet, you speak to the TO? <|endoftext|>
I am trying, what do you suggest? <|endoftext|>
Well that would be nice if she would give a little time tag when it would be time for it to be <|endoftext|>
Wow what a forward woman. Who did she give the child to? <|endoftext|>
Oh yes and it was scary because the thought of being eaten by a bear made me nervous <|endoftext|>
I have never seen that show <|endoftext|>
Are you religious <|endoftext|>
You did great, those things happen but it's important to stay positive <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that is incredible, did you at least use it for something good <|endoftext|>
i hate traffic!  It's like an excuse to get on your way to work. <|endoftext|>
You ever ride a bike or a car? It is really annoying and dangerous <|endoftext|>
Oh no what happened? <|endoftext|>
That's when you realize you either love them or you don't <|endoftext|>
Well, that's good that she was able to do that. I mean in terms of grades. <|endoftext|>
That's a really good friend <|endoftext|>
Wow that's interesting. I think you'll need to throw it out right away or it won't work right. <|endoftext|>
That sounds really scary! <|endoftext|>
oh how did it go?? did it come back? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! Do you work for a living or what <|endoftext|>
20% is not so bad! I can't wait to get on my feet and fix my bank account. I'm glad you got what you needed! <|endoftext|>
That is a great attitude. You sound very confident. <|endoftext|>
What do you do for work? <|endoftext|>
I have a feeling you're going to get married very soon. <|endoftext|>
Wow I wish I was that rich. <|endoftext|>
That is bad too, it costs too much to have to do that all the time. <|endoftext|>
That's exciting. What would be the benefit of having a adviser that you could use in your university? <|endoftext|>
Well there you go, that's the place to start. It's what's important <|endoftext|>
I've spoken to a few people who have dealt with issues like that, it's not a fun thing <|endoftext|>
Yes but its not the same thing - -_- <|endoftext|>
Good friends are people too. That's a good friend for sure. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. That is quite a while. Are you excited about it? <|endoftext|>
You don't live in a trailer park?!? <|endoftext|>
Those were the days. When you needed something to play with or take to the pool or beach. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! It's good to have those toys with you that much! <|endoftext|>
That is cool. Do you still keep in touch with those folks? <|endoftext|>
Oh man I understand you.  My mom had social media in the early 2000s <|endoftext|>
I was a child in the 80's. I don't have to say that I know anything about the 90s. What about you? <|endoftext|>
I really do too. And even if they're not that bad, they're so often the same kind that they become excuses or don't consider your concerns. <|endoftext|>
Absolutely. I have met a lot of people who aren't the most responsible and it just sucks having to watch your kids be the worst <|endoftext|>
I've never seen it. But I've heard the reviews are good. <|endoftext|>
I can not imagine paying more than a quarter. That is crazy! <|endoftext|>
How come? Are they trying to take advantage of you? <|endoftext|>
I understand that. It's always better to do it all on your own <|endoftext|>
Oh man, look at the bright side. The kids will thank you when their parents do cleaning up after them. I know it's never as bad as what I'm thinking but it will be different for them when they grow up and find someone else to do it with. <|endoftext|>
LOL, that was very mean. ANTS!!! I don't know why this convo is happening, lol. It's like they don't realize that's a dude. <|endoftext|>
What?!? why what happend <|endoftext|>
Ouch, is she alright? <|endoftext|>
That is a wonderful name. <|endoftext|>
What did you heal from? <|endoftext|>
What was the issue with your car? Did it not run well or did you need a ride? <|endoftext|>
That is so nice! <|endoftext|>
It's amazing how nice people can be sometimes. I'm from South Texas and even they can be mean. <|endoftext|>
I had a party the other night for me - I turned 40. It was great - everyone was surprised <|endoftext|>
That is so awesome! What a great story to tell, and one you will always have to be told. :) <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I bet you were scared. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you got your priorities straight, lol <|endoftext|>
I have never studied hard in school but when I did I felt a bit putrid. Did you study hard for it too? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, what a great score! Are you going to save for a car? <|endoftext|>
I do have a cat, but it's pretty old. <|endoftext|>
That's annoying, try getting him to stop! <|endoftext|>
That is great. Congratulations <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah?  So do you have kids in college? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that. How did that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
That sucks <|endoftext|>
Yes, that is really something. <|endoftext|>
Wow, I wish I could learn how to make beans! <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Is there anyone else that could help her? <|endoftext|>
Siblings can be super awesome sometimes! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Well that's a blessing in disguise. :) <|endoftext|>
Yes, that happens to me often actually. I listen to an old song that was on an old station that I used to listen to frequently <|endoftext|>
yea i know what you mean <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's so sad, what happened to the cat? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's terrible!!! I'm so sorry to hear that but wow your heart to hear that. That must have been so scary <|endoftext|>
That is sad to hear. I have had a dog die once too. You are not alone. <|endoftext|>
Lol. We had it rough last year. Almost gave up <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate! <|endoftext|>
I can understand that <|endoftext|>
That's so funny, did the other person die from shock as well? <|endoftext|>
Did you mean laughter on? <|endoftext|>
That is sad.  Maybe find a hobby or a new passion <|endoftext|>
Oh I thought you meant your son because you said you wanted to join the military. Maybe try and get a job or work at home? <|endoftext|>
It is, but think of how many years you can wait until you get to go. <|endoftext|>
that sounds so sweet! i love dogs and would be SO excited to see one <|endoftext|>
maybe it's time to explore <|endoftext|>
Is there any reason why? <|endoftext|>
She's going to be your best friend right? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a plan <|endoftext|>
I have had a very happy and fortunate life. What about you? <|endoftext|>
It can be expensive depending on where you are from.  And tequila is not cool here, it is too expensive. <|endoftext|>
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel. What ended the argument? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that sounds really scary! <|endoftext|>
That's good news. <|endoftext|>
Yes.  It is the best feeling <|endoftext|>
Yes it is, I do try it at least once a week, lol. <|endoftext|>
That is good. I wish i had a mom like that <|endoftext|>
that's awesome of you, you are caring and giving <|endoftext|>
I guess we just didn't do well <|endoftext|>
I did. But I didn't understand the material. I failed both exams. <|endoftext|>
Your mom is a saint! <|endoftext|>
I do <|endoftext|>
That is sad, I am sorry about that <|endoftext|>
Where has she been? <|endoftext|>
I work as a caregiver for patients in the ED. It is a lot of fun but tough work. <|endoftext|>
Thank you. Yes, I am working overtime at work so I can afford food and clothing. <|endoftext|>
You got this <|endoftext|>
I thought that might be a field I enjoyed.  Is it that neat? <|endoftext|>
Those movies give me chills though, gotta watch em <|endoftext|>
That's too bad it's not like you can go back and forth and go back and forth and forth and do that all over again.   What do you do- <|endoftext|>
I like action movies and dramas. You? <|endoftext|>
I love the Evil Dead. <|endoftext|>
I hear that. He is not doing so great either. <|endoftext|>
Really? I'm a Social liberal and I totally agree with him. The Donald needs to go away <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  I love that too! <|endoftext|>
That's great, it's always good to have a partner like that. <|endoftext|>
That's good to have around. Are you often treated well? <|endoftext|>
Yes.  I miss some.  When I was a kid. <|endoftext|>
You have a wonderful voice. <|endoftext|>
There is nothing to be jealous about.  It's an eternal battle of good vs evil <|endoftext|>
You should do it. You need to do it to yourself not with a partner <|endoftext|>
5 years <|endoftext|>
Do you trust that the person who dealt with your issue did their job properly <|endoftext|>
Does she give you checks or does she give you cards? <|endoftext|>
What do you mean exactly? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that.  Are you okay? <|endoftext|>
Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
What kind of car? <|endoftext|>
What does? <|endoftext|>
That's really nice of you.  That's what we called first-time meet and greets where I was from.  She is very beautiful/good looking? <|endoftext|>
Yes I do! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful.   How big is your family? <|endoftext|>
We are, that's why it's a big problem to get out early and then have to wait tables! <|endoftext|>
Why do you feel guilty about it? <|endoftext|>
What's wrong <|endoftext|>
It is never to late to try again!! <|endoftext|>
That is dedication! dedication <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What did you get your degree in? <|endoftext|>
That does sound fun.  Are you from there originally? <|endoftext|>
What's wrong? <|endoftext|>
Ha Ha I am not looking forward to that either, lol. <|endoftext|>
It gets a little lonely in the summer sometimes. <|endoftext|>
that's a bummer.. <|endoftext|>
Good luck!!! That will be a very nice surprise!! <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! When does the Final round start? <|endoftext|>
Tell him not to snack on sugary things. He will start taking them less and less! <|endoftext|>
What does she do that you like to do with them? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad... do you miss her? <|endoftext|>
Are you talking about someone special or just seeing them <|endoftext|>
Oh man that's rough! I hate that. <|endoftext|>
Awwww that's too bad! What was it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry!  I bet you were really excited, though! <|endoftext|>
Yes I have. Have you? <|endoftext|>
sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Oops! That's what I meant to say, sorry! <|endoftext|>
Good luck.  What job did you apply for? <|endoftext|>
They have a couple of those already, they need new people to step up <|endoftext|>
Well you should do something special, you deserve to be loved and appreciated even if you say you don't talk. I do love my baby though. He's a wonderful angel <|endoftext|>
Ha ha, yeah I know where this is going. Still kicking myself for 20 years. <|endoftext|>
...what does that mean exactly <|endoftext|>
Haha, kids these days are so careless! <|endoftext|>
He has had a rough go of things in life. <|endoftext|>
What's up with your brother? <|endoftext|>
Not personally, but I know she works for Disney. <|endoftext|>
No not really I am quite shy <|endoftext|>
I was in a bar mitzvah when this happened. It was the worst  I've ever had to endure <|endoftext|>
That sucks <|endoftext|>
I like the Dr Pepper watermelon smoothie. <|endoftext|>
You must be very proud. What did he graduate in? <|endoftext|>
Me too! What do you think? <|endoftext|>
oh no what happened <|endoftext|>
I am sorry about that, what happened to the pizza shop? <|endoftext|>
Ugh... that's the worst! I mean, how can they get away with it! <|endoftext|>
Why? <|endoftext|>
Those delicious cookies <|endoftext|>
Dang, that stinks. Did they give you anything in return? <|endoftext|>
That is a horrible thing to do <|endoftext|>
Wow I love Gucci! Do you know where you were when you had to wear the clothes? <|endoftext|>
what is the recipe <|endoftext|>
Yeah those are the important ingredients, and what you need when you're making a pizza! <|endoftext|>
wow that's intense!!! <|endoftext|>
Where did you find out? <|endoftext|>
Are you going to punish him? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, were you able to do anything about it? <|endoftext|>
That's okay to have doubts but I am glad you did pass it! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, I'm not sure how that works but that is a really good way to go about it <|endoftext|>
That is cool!  What kind of blind is it? <|endoftext|>
That's a shame. What does he do? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is a lot of driving. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened to your hitch hike? <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome!   Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
oh wow that sounds super annoying <|endoftext|>
That sounds so scary! <|endoftext|>
I saw him in concert once. <|endoftext|>
Awwwww,  I'm sorry to hear that.   What are they going to do? <|endoftext|>
oh no, what did he do? <|endoftext|>
That is great. You must be so proud. <|endoftext|>
Good for him. Am a Juve fan but I'm more of a Man City fan <|endoftext|>
Wow where do you get your money from? <|endoftext|>
About what <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a nightmare <|endoftext|>
What was it that caught you off guard? <|endoftext|>
What does he do? <|endoftext|>
You can do whatever you want, you just can't be expected to take care of us when we are all dying around you. <|endoftext|>
That's happened to me before. It is embarrassing <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's pretty cool that people are still friendly with each other in the future. It's hard to find that nowadays. <|endoftext|>
You and me both. What is your favorite part <|endoftext|>
lol. I think that is where I am at now. Maybe it was too soon or I was just lucky <|endoftext|>
Oh that's terrible. I hate when that happens <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That's a bummer. I love sushi and I can't wait to go to LA <|endoftext|>
less than you <|endoftext|>
I do not give but I am thankful every time <|endoftext|>
Hiding is pretty risky but as you said paranoid you mean? <|endoftext|>
Who is Jesus? <|endoftext|>
Oh dear. Did you hurt his feelings? <|endoftext|>
So I take it you've got the hang of that physics education? <|endoftext|>
How does that make you feel <|endoftext|>
Did you ever <|endoftext|>
It's crazy to hear about people doing things they don't like. <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of days saved <|endoftext|>
That's not bad,  Are yo gonna go anywhere special? <|endoftext|>
What did she say <|endoftext|>
Sometimes people take those t-shirts that you don't want to return because of issues. That's what I do, keep my receipt <|endoftext|>
Were you trying to control yourself?  It's interesting that she publicly spoke out about it though and not behind your back. <|endoftext|>
Wow that is a huge let down. Who is she? <|endoftext|>
I was always afraid that I wouldn't be able to because of my shyness. Thankfully I wasn't shy at that time. <|endoftext|>
Do you have a particular memory that triggered it? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool...how was your first year <|endoftext|>
It is an option!  Employers often have these things where you can opt in for a certain amount of time. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Was it a long time ago? <|endoftext|>
I have heard good things about this movie. What is the name of the movie? <|endoftext|>
adapt or die try hard - that's the motto of my ex-wife <|endoftext|>
What did you do with it? <|endoftext|>
Oh my!  That is awful.  Does she want to end the relationship? <|endoftext|>
Maybe it was out of anger? <|endoftext|>
Did he do it on purpose? <|endoftext|>
What did he do that got you so stressed? <|endoftext|>
wow that is great, what is your future endeavor / occupation / etc <|endoftext|>
What kind of challenge was it? <|endoftext|>
I'm so glad you understand me! No problem! :) <|endoftext|>
Yeah I am glad you are enjoying your life. I have a place in Hawaii <|endoftext|>
What was your dedication to? <|endoftext|>
Did she fall on hard times? <|endoftext|>
I was too <|endoftext|>
The wonders of listening to the radio or video <|endoftext|>
True. Some people have sacrificed a lot for music to get better <|endoftext|>
Nice!!! What game is it? <|endoftext|>
That game is going to be so good, you should get it. <|endoftext|>
Well done, what was your role in the firm? <|endoftext|>
I am hoping that is the case <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a good career. <|endoftext|>
I am sure you will get it soon. <|endoftext|>
Why do you feel that way?  Are you always facing your mirror? <|endoftext|>
Yes they are! Its like hitting a blank wall with bullets. <|endoftext|>
That's ok. At least you're making progress. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. University changed my life. <|endoftext|>
wow, that is great, you did your best and still got the job <|endoftext|>
WHAT? I would have been terrified <|endoftext|>
What was it? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear.  Is the job for a good cause? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? How come? <|endoftext|>
I hope everything turned out okay! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. Sounds like you should have a talk with someone then. <|endoftext|>
That's great.  What do you do in the mean time? <|endoftext|>
Did it take a lot of time? <|endoftext|>
No.  Do you? <|endoftext|>
Oh I bet that was a real bummer. Are you alright now? <|endoftext|>
No I usually get tasered for a fist fight. <|endoftext|>
That is horrible. <|endoftext|>
Never <|endoftext|>
I did too. I remember riding around the block playing catch with my friend. <|endoftext|>
Nope. I tried that once and was sick afterwards. <|endoftext|>
That is not cool. <|endoftext|>
Never, those are too scary for me. <|endoftext|>
I bet you were terrified! <|endoftext|>
I did when I was a kid, but I always knew my brother was ok with it. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, those are cool looking cars.  They always seem to go fast <|endoftext|>
Oh wow,  that was really mean. I am glad it worked out for you two! <|endoftext|>
What happened, you don't want to tell me? <|endoftext|>
Cool. Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Wow, you should go and visit them? <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I hope she gets it! It really stinks to lose your work-life balance. <|endoftext|>
Good. Hopefully she enjoys it. <|endoftext|>
That's bad <|endoftext|>
That is pretty amazing. Did you get a puppy or is she saving it for a special occasion? <|endoftext|>
I have a german shepherd too!! But he is so fat!! Can you imagine how that made me feel!! How bout you <|endoftext|>
You were trying to ignore the drunk girl trying to make moves on you? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I bet your proud all the time too <|endoftext|>
Wow!  That's rough, was she trying to be polite? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Me too - it's almost the weekend! <|endoftext|>
I hear ya.. I used to be the same way but I have learned to embrace it and live it to the fullest potential <|endoftext|>
that is a bummer. was it tought weather wise? <|endoftext|>
That's always a little scary. Especially in the winter time <|endoftext|>
I hate snow. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's rough. How did it go <|endoftext|>
Everything happens for a reason. <|endoftext|>
Was it a mist or something heavy? <|endoftext|>
That is a wonderful news!!! Do you have any plans for the future? <|endoftext|>
That's exciting!  What did you all do? <|endoftext|>
Nice! Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
Why did you steal the shirt? <|endoftext|>
What made you like it? <|endoftext|>
Well, it is a good thing that you went on such a special trip <|endoftext|>
There's an app for that. <|endoftext|>
That is sad. Were you able to find someone else to take her? <|endoftext|>
That's how it is where I live too.  It sucks <|endoftext|>
That's awesome of her, my mom doesn't have a ton of money either...she just stays home with us <|endoftext|>
How much was it? <|endoftext|>
Wow what a ride! Those things are very dangerous! <|endoftext|>
Did you? <|endoftext|>
that must have been crazy <|endoftext|>
Aw I know how that feels. Is your friend ok? <|endoftext|>
That must be a sight for you. <|endoftext|>
Ah okay, that makes more sense. I mean in terms of actual progress. Maybe try going to the gym or getting a good lawyer client to represent your case? Haha. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!!!  It's takes a while to feel that freedom though! <|endoftext|>
How did it go / <|endoftext|>
Oh, dear. Did you ask her if she wanted to go home and apologize? <|endoftext|>
No.. what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that sounds dangerous <|endoftext|>
Cycling is fun, and can be very dangerous too! But I do love my dirt bike. You should give it a try! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, how did that happen? <|endoftext|>
Who was he? <|endoftext|>
Yikes, that's rough. Did he/she do it on purpose? <|endoftext|>
You can complain but you need to know what to do about it, <|endoftext|>
I understand that.  Did she forgive you? <|endoftext|>
It's okay, it happens to everyone, we're human beings <|endoftext|>
You sound like us! Except we had to work outside. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I agree.  I love it there is nothing like it anywhere else in the world! <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite part of the area? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I get it - does it not take much for people to change their path when confronted with reality / human nature/metaphysics / whatever - like you know how it is when one of those people were able to say what they wanted to say and then actually do it? <|endoftext|>
Oh trust me i know i just have a lot of pride in who i am!! <|endoftext|>
Tornados are terrifying.  I was terrified too <|endoftext|>
I'm with you. I grew up on the east side of the US and never had to go down to the basement. What's the deal with no basements where you grew up? <|endoftext|>
That must have been a nice feeling. <|endoftext|>
Those are never good reasons. Were you abused as a child? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. You sound motivated and intentional. It's refreshing to hear someone voice their personal feelings about something. <|endoftext|>
Sounds exciting!  Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
Yes I hear that! How long did you go there? <|endoftext|>
What is it? <|endoftext|>
That is good. It is always great to have someone give you something for your birthday <|endoftext|>
What is the gift <|endoftext|>
Oh sweet- how long has he been working? <|endoftext|>
Oh no.  What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I have issues with that too, I can't stay still for long <|endoftext|>
Yeah that's what I'm talking about! That's no fun!! I wish I had some kind of prescription that I could use to help me see more. I always get so distracted by everything else that it's hard to focus on anything interesting <|endoftext|>
That's true! I was there nearly an hour ago and it was still crowded. <|endoftext|>
That is a horrible feeling, especially when it's late at night! <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's too bad. I'm sure he'll get over it. It's ok. <|endoftext|>
I hear you.. my daughter is going through the same thing now.  She goes to bed so early! <|endoftext|>
Me too. I get nostalgic every time I think of my childhood. <|endoftext|>
Yes. I do get a lot of company during the summer. <|endoftext|>
They will be in the right places then. It all starts with the grades! <|endoftext|>
Thats good. How old is she? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful to hear! What will you do with your extra money? <|endoftext|>
yeah i have been there. its sucks when you cant pay your bills <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that is a long time to be studying. Did you get a good lawyer? <|endoftext|>
Awesome! It's always nice to feel like we made it. <|endoftext|>
Did you end up paying? <|endoftext|>
What are you going to get? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I wouldn't be surprised if that happened to him. <|endoftext|>
What do you love about him? <|endoftext|>
Oh my! I bet you practiced a lot before you got your license! You are very lucky to have that kind of memory. <|endoftext|>
Wow that sounds bad.  I hope you are okay? <|endoftext|>
That's cool, are you doing it for work? <|endoftext|>
Nice, i didn't know about that. <|endoftext|>
Work how? <|endoftext|>
I live in the city. It is horrible as well <|endoftext|>
I was late for work today. It was awful <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun, how did it turn out? <|endoftext|>
We met online actually! It's really complicated though haha. I'd say they were either cousins or something haha <|endoftext|>
I care about you too <|endoftext|>
You're quite welcome. I'm always here if you need someone to talk to. <|endoftext|>
Glad it didn't go to waste.  Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
That's a tough situation. I'm glad you had that opportunity. <|endoftext|>
What a wonderful surprise/ <|endoftext|>
Not always true. I am currently in college and there is no degree needed to get a job. <|endoftext|>
I don't blame you, we are not supposed to touch them outside until its potty trained. <|endoftext|>
Maybe she hasn't been eating enough chicken noodle soup. <|endoftext|>
why is that <|endoftext|>
You must be a loyal friend <|endoftext|>
That sucks. I used to hate that too. <|endoftext|>
I know right! I almost stepped on a scale reading that text when I was little! <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear. What's going right in your life? <|endoftext|>
Nice, it's a lot of work for a hobby. But is really fun. <|endoftext|>
That's the worst part. I never knew anyone else at my new job. <|endoftext|>
i dont even know how to respond to that haha,  everyone must have been so happy or excited <|endoftext|>
That's good! Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
I agree, I always try to forget about those times when I was younger. <|endoftext|>
did you do it? <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  I live in Nashville, but I visit often.  What did you like about it? <|endoftext|>
I love going to Mexican places. I was there yesterday and I was feeling so loved <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you! <|endoftext|>
what is even more amazing is that is only the beginning <|endoftext|>
I used to do that too. That's why I use blowtorch lol <|endoftext|>
That is usually the reason.  I hope he turned it around.  Sushi is amazing. <|endoftext|>
oh god, that must have hurt, i know it was horrible <|endoftext|>
Why do you always have to do that? What do they need to pick up? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! They have some of the best burritos I've ever had! <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  Just curious do you like Mexican food? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing, do you know what languages he was speaking? <|endoftext|>
Wow!  That's amazing.  What was the experience like?  What was it like studying? <|endoftext|>
That's really great to hear. What does he do that impress you? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! He's the type of manager that never gets too much flack, right? <|endoftext|>
Nice, those kind of games are very important for your kids. <|endoftext|>
You must be very proud. That's great that you have that opportunity to teach him. <|endoftext|>
Aw that stinks, I bet you were alone the rest of the day. <|endoftext|>
It is ok. You should have enjoyed it. It happens everytime. <|endoftext|>
That's really great, what kind of dogs do you have? <|endoftext|>
There is, lots of dog parks! <|endoftext|>
He sounds very generous.  Is this your first time? <|endoftext|>
What was the gesture? <|endoftext|>
Ugh, that's annoying. <|endoftext|>
I have a pit myself.  They re so derpy! <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  What happened?  You must have some explaining to do. <|endoftext|>
What's going on? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lovely moment! <|endoftext|>
That is a long time.   It is nice that you got to meet your wife though. <|endoftext|>
Who is she? <|endoftext|>
Any time. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a relief. It happened to me once and I had a great job interview. <|endoftext|>
What do you do/ <|endoftext|>
How did you scold her? <|endoftext|>
What does she do that's focused <|endoftext|>
Are you a professional cook? <|endoftext|>
How do you like it so far? <|endoftext|>
Me too... it's crazy to hear good things come to those who wait <|endoftext|>
but why does it have to be relieve? <|endoftext|>
What do you mean by that? <|endoftext|>
What happened <|endoftext|>
How did you discipline him?  Did you tell him? <|endoftext|>
It is for the kids. He should not do stupid things when he is young. <|endoftext|>
At least you're saving money <|endoftext|>
Yeah, i do okay in normal mode, but when i have to do something crazy it gets a little overwhelming. <|endoftext|>
Awesome, is it in the field that you work in? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear that! <|endoftext|>
Those were the days! <|endoftext|>
What a waste of good clothes. <|endoftext|>
Yeah. I remember having to do back to school shopping when I was little. <|endoftext|>
That's true.  I have a nice pair of under armour and love them <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet of you! What breed is it? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I thought it was Alphys - LOL. What's his name? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I hate it when that happens.  That's why I have only one child <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, I want that baby to be alive too <|endoftext|>
Wow! That is awesome. What does she do? <|endoftext|>
Make sure she knows how grateful you are <|endoftext|>
I hate to hear that. That's rough sometimes but its life. What kind of dog is it? <|endoftext|>
That sucks.  I hate ear mites.  Itchy and scaring the heck out of me. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Why did you eat it?? That's not nice of them! <|endoftext|>
Why wouldn't you tell her? <|endoftext|>
Yes it sucks when people get all worked up over nothing. I always hate when that happens. <|endoftext|>
That is the worst part, the yelling. <|endoftext|>
That's really cool.  I've never been on a cruise. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. You should take a trip once you have a chance. It's worth it. <|endoftext|>
Beautiful, I am glad you enjoyed it. <|endoftext|>
Oh my.  Are you alright? <|endoftext|>
When did you become a dog? <|endoftext|>
I meant big dogs lol <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's too bad. Do they work either way? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! What did you discover? <|endoftext|>
Oh I bet your excited <|endoftext|>
What happened to you <|endoftext|>
What is silly about it? <|endoftext|>
What was the award for? <|endoftext|>
Ok, But do you get a prize? <|endoftext|>
Thank you. I sure hope so. I like my work environment. <|endoftext|>
That's the positive side of it.  Having a plan B always helps. <|endoftext|>
Yes you are right! Im always nervous going to job interviews <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah I have. It's so nerve-wracking, but so fun- <|endoftext|>
It's not always so bad.  I've had some very bad parents/ <|endoftext|>
Oh no, is she ok? I don't know too much about kids or public transportation <|endoftext|>
What does? <|endoftext|>
How many kids do you have? That would be pretty frustrating for a deaf person <|endoftext|>
I understand. Did she move out or what happened <|endoftext|>
Sounds like fun! I wish I could go out to eat with girls <|endoftext|>
Cool, what do you have planned? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun! <|endoftext|>
Is she okay? <|endoftext|>
Ah that stinks. I hope she is alright now. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a nice morning. <|endoftext|>
hope it goes well! <|endoftext|>
That's exciting! Are you still interviewing for that job? <|endoftext|>
You must have been very satisfied with the results <|endoftext|>
Good to hear, how long have you been married? <|endoftext|>
Cool, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Your welocaste <|endoftext|>
Did you mean nothing? <|endoftext|>
That's alright. What's up? <|endoftext|>
nothing? you don't like nothing? <|endoftext|>
Very cool. What do you grow <|endoftext|>
My pleasure <|endoftext|>
What mistake did they commit? <|endoftext|>
that's always disappointing <|endoftext|>
They will I bet. That stuff stinks in the sun but we have to do what we have to do. <|endoftext|>
what happened <|endoftext|>
yea thats fair <|endoftext|>
What did you do with him? <|endoftext|>
Ah, so it was an outside influence / outsider / what? <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's sad. Maybe you can talk to her tomorrow night? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What kept you occupied? <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite part about the area? <|endoftext|>
About what <|endoftext|>
That's pretty nice. What is the gym? <|endoftext|>
What do you do? <|endoftext|>
That's incredible! Did you have a party? <|endoftext|>
what happened <|endoftext|>
Oh I bet! How long was it? <|endoftext|>
Did you guys go anywhere? <|endoftext|>
Aww I'm sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
You are most welcome. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow. I love when a baby is born! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's cool man, how have you been with him? <|endoftext|>
That is the best thing about love, u can do whatever you want with her <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you! <|endoftext|>
How much was it? <|endoftext|>
Is that a tundra? <|endoftext|>
It is always wonderful when your day goes smoothly. <|endoftext|>
Whats the trouble? <|endoftext|>
Oh no I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
lol. Why do you do that? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's really interesting! Did you go camping or something? <|endoftext|>
Haha, it's alright buddy <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome, I love singing too! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry what did she do to upset you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I have been there too. It is not a good feeling <|endoftext|>
I believe you are correct <|endoftext|>
That's awesome I'm happy for you. <|endoftext|>
I should look into it. <|endoftext|>
Yea i would get social media involved if i were you. <|endoftext|>
Why's that? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that is alright. I'm an elder... I can't judge you.. it's something that comes up every few generations at least once in my life. <|endoftext|>
Well, you have to do what you have to do. Do what you have to do to get what you want. <|endoftext|>
uhoh. i cant help but eat them either. or are you being purposely obtuse? <|endoftext|>
Diet is important <|endoftext|>
I bet you are super proud of him! <|endoftext|>
Yes he is hard worker <|endoftext|>
That's rough.  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're not stuck in the elevator. <|endoftext|>
Maybe it's time to invest in some new clothes <|endoftext|>
why? what's the issue with your visit <|endoftext|>
I bet that's a blast from the past. What do you think you're going to get on your visit? <|endoftext|>
Ok, But what about the baby? <|endoftext|>
That's cool, where did you meet her. <|endoftext|>
You should go to a bar and meet some friends and then maybe get involved in local groups. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
I tried to use it as a motivator when I was recently fired. Sadly it didn't work. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty funny.  I hope it wasn't a Rohypnol or something like that. <|endoftext|>
Does she live far away from you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that sounds awful. Did you feel lonely or do you enjoy the trip? <|endoftext|>
Why is that <|endoftext|>
You should not thank the person who made the good decision. You must thank the person who followed through it. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is a really long learning process. <|endoftext|>
I am responsible for what exactly? <|endoftext|>
what is that? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that.  Try to stay positive. <|endoftext|>
It's all we can do <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Nope!  Well it all started when I changed jobs!!! It was awful at first but I've come around.  I hope your in a better place now! <|endoftext|>
Yes today is a new day, tomorrow is the anniversary <|endoftext|>
That's great you have so much control over your life. It's like that with your kids too... you can decide where you want to go with life. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, it is a rough period for sure. <|endoftext|>
How do you fit in with the crowd then <|endoftext|>
That's a long time.  What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
I was, but I did not, and I'm glad she is. I'm still a bit upset, but I'm gonna go back and forth and work it out :) <|endoftext|>
Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
How was the water, was it deep? <|endoftext|>
I hate when people do that! Did you go through their menu or ask them to re-do their work/Table- organised? <|endoftext|>
I'm a guy. And I use the internet a lot, I can't imagine how you would respond to that. <|endoftext|>
oh what happened <|endoftext|>
I am so hungry right now <|endoftext|>
Terrible. How about you? <|endoftext|>
Mario <|endoftext|>
It was fantastic! What about you? <|endoftext|>
I'm happy to hear that <|endoftext|>
Ahhh.. I understand. That is why I wear shorts <|endoftext|>
Oh no, were you able to clean it up/ <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. Is it in a field you do interesting in? <|endoftext|>
I hope so! <|endoftext|>
It is. Are you in school? <|endoftext|>
I'm not either but it's always good to do what you have to do <|endoftext|>
I can understand your feelings.  Did you call her back later? <|endoftext|>
You should go out and meet friends and see what interests you.  Then you can work it out as a team!! <|endoftext|>
Really? Why? <|endoftext|>
oh that's too bad, I always like to hear people yelling <|endoftext|>
Oh no. How did that go? <|endoftext|>
Yeah we all felt stupid at one point or the other. <|endoftext|>
Was it a nice apartment? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes I do like to go back to my childhood.  Being a kid was so easy <|endoftext|>
I would have been like you.. what did you do? <|endoftext|>
Ouch, that's rough. Have you tried talking to them? <|endoftext|>
What is the job for? <|endoftext|>
What do you do for work? <|endoftext|>
What kind of dog do you have <|endoftext|>
I just don't understand why people are so nasty.  I guess some people just have no respect for other people's personal space. <|endoftext|>
Yeah me too. I'm glad the kids are safe though. <|endoftext|>
The mailman? What's that? <|endoftext|>
That's good. What is the test over? <|endoftext|>
thats awesome.. how long did that take? <|endoftext|>
That's good, what was your favorite memory? <|endoftext|>
I am too young to know about those things but sounds like a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
Car or apartment? <|endoftext|>
What do you do? <|endoftext|>
That is so true <|endoftext|>
I think that's true for a lot of people. It is much better to be listened to than hurt though <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens!  Did they give any explanation?  Maybe it's a trap!! <|endoftext|>
well hopefully the next one will go better! <|endoftext|>
I am but it is hard when you know your boss is out to get you. <|endoftext|>
I was, I would have been happier at work I guess. <|endoftext|>
Pets are amazing.  It's the best feeling. <|endoftext|>
What would make you feel that way? <|endoftext|>
It is not stealing if it is performed under someone else's control.  If you do it yourself it is not stealing. <|endoftext|>
Sure is <|endoftext|>
That's such a bummer. Where did it go? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow I really hope she is OK! <|endoftext|>
She will be here before you know it!  Where are you from originally? <|endoftext|>
Oh okay! That makes sense,  what kind of baby? <|endoftext|>
Yeah it is hard to trust people these days <|endoftext|>
My dentist, he was kind of boring. <|endoftext|>
Very, I have 3 beautiful girls <|endoftext|>
Wow, she did! She must be a tough person to handle <|endoftext|>
That can be rough, there are just too many people in the world. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling <|endoftext|>
That sounds terrible,  What happened? <|endoftext|>
Well that's always good, it'll leave a mark. <|endoftext|>
Who was famous? <|endoftext|>
She is talented, but she sounds like she is alluring a lover. Can you imagine being in a relationship like that? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! <|endoftext|>
Indeed it did, I was a kid too so this was not an issue- <|endoftext|>
oh no. you have to get your security deposit and get the stuff <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  You can buy a new tv online <|endoftext|>
I bet that did some damage <|endoftext|>
Who is hoodlums? <|endoftext|>
Oh that stinks <|endoftext|>
Are you confident you will get the job? <|endoftext|>
Oh my!  I hope they weren't heavy clothes you were wearing. <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that.   What happened next? <|endoftext|>
That's awful <|endoftext|>
Oh no what's happening to you <|endoftext|>
That sounds wonderful!  Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Nice. We need to start saving money. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Well it's good that they were oblivious to the clogging up the toilet sign. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that's terrible! How did you treat it? <|endoftext|>
Oh nice! What was the prize? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a good sport <|endoftext|>
I talk to my boss all the time. <|endoftext|>
I know right? It just is frustrating. What is happening, so frustrating. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's always a bit scary. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
When was the last time you got a new phone? <|endoftext|>
I understand that, I have a fear ofPublic transportation as well! <|endoftext|>
Why is that <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! How long did you go? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow thats awesome where did you go? <|endoftext|>
Yikes!  That is frightening <|endoftext|>
oh snap! That's what happens when I'm not paying attention. lol <|endoftext|>
oh no that is sad news <|endoftext|>
What ideas do you have coming up?  Do you have a team working on it with you? <|endoftext|>
Do you have a spare key? <|endoftext|>
Dang - you better find a way to keep your cool and take care of your nephew. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.   What do you do to pay the bills? <|endoftext|>
I am so glad we are! What tasks are those? <|endoftext|>
I always like to volunteer at the local food bank as much as possible. <|endoftext|>
Did they say why? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Are you in an area where it is difficult to find work? <|endoftext|>
We can always talk about it. It will get better. <|endoftext|>
Always trust people who are helpful <|endoftext|>
When I first found my child I felt that was the best day of my life. <|endoftext|>
Aw that's sweet! How long have you been friends? <|endoftext|>
She sounds like a good person.  I am happy for you <|endoftext|>
That's cool! I don't think I'd be able to do those things <|endoftext|>
I have never been able to skate <|endoftext|>
Are you ok man? What do you mean exactly? <|endoftext|>
I have never been to mom's place before.  It's expensive and it is always full <|endoftext|>
Aw :(  You're sweet and lucky to have a healthy baby! I can not imagine what you are going through. <|endoftext|>
Maybe he needs you to come hang out with him in his free time. I'm sure he'd appreciate it. <|endoftext|>
lol.  I bet they were scared and confused.  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, they learn not to fight in the house. <|endoftext|>
How did it go?  Did it take long? <|endoftext|>
I am hoping for a child as well. That's pretty tough <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's terrible! I am sorry that happened to you :( <|endoftext|>
Good to hear that!!  I am glad to hear that you are getting better.  What kind of medicine <|endoftext|>
Yeah I got to go to a sushi buffet once. <|endoftext|>
I love watching humming birds.  They are really cute though.  I need to go see a humming bird someday <|endoftext|>
Cool. What kind of job did you apply for? <|endoftext|>
What university do you work at? I work at a university in Boston <|endoftext|>
No but it always stinks when you have to go to court.  I get so stressed when that happens. <|endoftext|>
what happened <|endoftext|>
they do when they want attention. <|endoftext|>
They like that too. It's also so easy to remember what they did when they play it. <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I hope she gets better. <|endoftext|>
Well thats good. You can always drive again <|endoftext|>
That's really good, you should do the same for your friends <|endoftext|>
Oh wow I hate that. I have never gone <|endoftext|>
What was the issue that made you think that? <|endoftext|>
Yes, volleyball and basketball <|endoftext|>
Nice! Is she practicing for competitions? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that doesn't sound fun <|endoftext|>
Oh I hate when that happens, happens a lot for me. I tend to forget my keys too <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. What store was it? <|endoftext|>
She always uses the receipt as cover up <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah what kind? <|endoftext|>
Absolutely, it's like seeing a family reunion or something. <|endoftext|>
I agree, those were the good old days. <|endoftext|>
That's always rough <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful! I know there is nothing better than winning a fair and being recognized for your work. <|endoftext|>
LOL that is interesting.  Was the stuff you were trying to grow? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Maybe it's time to go to the store so he can learn some independence <|endoftext|>
That's rough.  It's like hearing your kids cry and you just know they are going somewhere or having a sad time. <|endoftext|>
I love vacation places! <|endoftext|>
Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
21 is still pretty young! <|endoftext|>
Yes, that was the one time I actually saw him in person. I was ecstatic! <|endoftext|>
Why, did something happen to you or where you going? <|endoftext|>
Your husband should go work at his own place then. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! That is exciting. <|endoftext|>
Wow what an Engineer! You should work on his engineering if you want to be successful! <|endoftext|>
That is good.  Is he taking medicine or something? <|endoftext|>
I do not. I am too old for that. I wish I could have kids, but I am too poor to do that. <|endoftext|>
Cool <|endoftext|>
hahaha, that's a lot of Babies!! I think I need to go through old photos.. they seem like they came out of the future! <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! How old is she? <|endoftext|>
Yea that's how it goes for me too, I go to the store, get the groceries, leave, repeat <|endoftext|>
Did the baby rat get hurt too? <|endoftext|>
Oh no :(  I had an experience like that when my youngest was born.  The nurses made me feel better after that experience <|endoftext|>
I am glad she got better <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. Is she alright now? <|endoftext|>
That is such a caring thing to do, what kind of cat was it? <|endoftext|>
Ah, well that makes more sense. They're usually either knocked out or stressed. Did you try any treatment options? <|endoftext|>
Oh man thats scary.  I hate that. Did you find a way back? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like it would be scary! Did you find them? <|endoftext|>
Did you want her to do anything? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Thats still pretty young for a teenager <|endoftext|>
I can understand that! <|endoftext|>
I've never had any bills go for granted <|endoftext|>
Really? How come? <|endoftext|>
Who is gonna take him <|endoftext|>
Really?  It's an amazing diet! <|endoftext|>
That's really cool.  What kind of books <|endoftext|>
What did you find out? <|endoftext|>
haha what is he looking for? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. What did you all do? <|endoftext|>
Did you?  What made you want a pink car/ <|endoftext|>
Nice!  How did it go? <|endoftext|>
I hope you mean you've gotten the A's long-term / not just on paper. I know the feeling. You got this buddy! <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
Absolutely, and we get so much written about on fitness but it's so few resources available. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
I love whole milk.  What do you do with that 2% milk? <|endoftext|>
What do you do during summers? <|endoftext|>
Good, you made the right choice. What is the matter? <|endoftext|>
Wow that sounds very scary. Are you okay? <|endoftext|>
Driving can be tiring. So I understand it <|endoftext|>
Oh my! I am sorry to hear that, it must have been hard on you <|endoftext|>
Yea it is.. sometimes hard situations call for harsh language.  I hope he is finding happiness now!! <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is SO annoying! Why did they have to have to wait so long?! <|endoftext|>
I've always wanted to do that, but with lice.  I think its the tentacles.  It is horrifying, but so easy to get rid of... <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! What a good surprise. Where are you celebrating? <|endoftext|>
oh yea.. how old was she <|endoftext|>
Oh that's rough. Did you ever get over it? <|endoftext|>
What cave? <|endoftext|>
Wow what was your cave experience like <|endoftext|>
Oh, baby...  Are you having lots? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a real life flashpoint!  Did you have a lot of preparedness? <|endoftext|>
Yes, it is always a good sign that your pregnant! <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you, thank God you didn't pass! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
Wow! That's amazing!  I love seeing people get rescued.  What kind of dog was she? <|endoftext|>
What did she do? <|endoftext|>
Who is she? <|endoftext|>
That is important! <|endoftext|>
Unfortunately, as a parent, I can't help but feel like I have a responsibility to take care of my kids.  My kids grow up so fast! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun. Did you find any interesting doggo's? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I can only imagine! It is hard to lose a friend! <|endoftext|>
Im sorry to hear that buddy <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun!  Where are you going on your adventures? <|endoftext|>
Good for you.  It's nice to know that you have a good life.  Do you have a good doctor? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  We tried everything <|endoftext|>
How was it? <|endoftext|>
Well, I think you can find something else to wear. I am not a fan of ties either, but a nice wedding dress is a nice wedding dress to have. <|endoftext|>
I used to play this game a lot with my family when we were kids <|endoftext|>
I agree, the music is fantastic. It means so much to me. <|endoftext|>
Who was it? <|endoftext|>
How frightening!  That's crazy I don't think I've ever seen something like that <|endoftext|>
That is great, do you have kids of your own <|endoftext|>
I bet she is a great player <|endoftext|>
nothing.. i just want my vacation to end soon so i can go to the beach and not have to work <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I think so too, what went wrong? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that is so sad!! I hope everything is ok <|endoftext|>
That is nice to hear. I would like a cat myself. <|endoftext|>
That's impressive, where did she? <|endoftext|>
Wow. What a great woman. Where do you live? <|endoftext|>
I have heard that it's the fault of the tsuramis! <|endoftext|>
What happened to pass your home? <|endoftext|>
Oh thats cool, how long have they been together? <|endoftext|>
Some people really need to learn to work around the 40-50 mark <|endoftext|>
Me too! What kind are you getting? <|endoftext|>
Those are nice SUV's. I have a Y series. It is nice. <|endoftext|>
Aww.. do you have a boy or girl friend? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I am trying to be optimistic but I am a little scared too.  I am trying to be a lot less scared. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, is there a way you could buy it locally? <|endoftext|>
What is so difficult about it? I have no issues ordering international and paying UPS or Dominoes. <|endoftext|>
WHAT A TRAP <|endoftext|>
What happened <|endoftext|>
Was the car in need of a change? <|endoftext|>
Where do you have to save up? <|endoftext|>
What a pleasant surprise. What was the lie? <|endoftext|>
Does she not have a family? <|endoftext|>
She said she didn't like it but I guess she meant like that one time when I went to pick up a girl from the club and we had some fun. It is always fun to do that with people you like. <|endoftext|>
Did you? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is quite a while! Where did she go? <|endoftext|>
Okay, so what's the matter? <|endoftext|>
Oh that is no good. Is it serious? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad <|endoftext|>
What are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
Oh lol.  What happened in the club? <|endoftext|>
Oh ok <|endoftext|>
You sound like a nice person to be around. <|endoftext|>
That is a smart choice. <|endoftext|>
What do you do? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should tell someone <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!! that's horrible. <|endoftext|>
I know some of those words. <|endoftext|>
Don't worry about it. You're a good person. <|endoftext|>
What happened to break her heart? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I am sorry to hear about that. Was it from cancer? <|endoftext|>
Good.  What's wrong? <|endoftext|>
It takes work. Does she have an instagram or something like that? <|endoftext|>
That's great! It's nice to feel a sense of care for someone. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
It's hard to escape the bad feelings sometimes, but it helps to remember the good times. <|endoftext|>
Me too, I always know exactly what to expect and when to go. <|endoftext|>
More like women are more desire oriented <|endoftext|>
Where are you going with that feeling/ intuition coming from <|endoftext|>
Was she hot? <|endoftext|>
Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
You are telling me? I am still recovering from my first time experiencing it. <|endoftext|>
Yikes. Was he using cell phone or something? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>
I think so.  What are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
I hope it goes well! Don't be nervous! <|endoftext|>
That's a very cool game! <|endoftext|>
What hurt you the most? <|endoftext|>
How come? <|endoftext|>
Oh my! That must have been embarrassing. Were you walking around the office? <|endoftext|>
Yeah that's the worst feeling. <|endoftext|>
I hope he is well prepared! What are you all gonna eat? <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of that game. But I am looking forward to it. How does it work? <|endoftext|>
LOL....I thought it was pretty good <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens. I hope you can make it! <|endoftext|>
Terrible, howabout you? <|endoftext|>
What's going on today? <|endoftext|>
it was really bad!!!! <|endoftext|>
Did you do it on purpose? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, hopefully that never happens again! <|endoftext|>
Is it a good relationship or bad relationship? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good that you love her a lot. <|endoftext|>
Oh, are they getting to you? <|endoftext|>
No problem. There's a lot of studying involved. <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome! I love watching the sloth and would love to go <|endoftext|>
Where are the sloths from? <|endoftext|>
That would make me irate, but I'm assuming they had no idea what was wrong? <|endoftext|>
Yes, do what is needed. <|endoftext|>
ok <|endoftext|>
That's always a good feeling. Congrats! What kind of house did you get? <|endoftext|>
Yes it is. I also can't wait to get back to work. <|endoftext|>
Help is always good <|endoftext|>
Really? Why do you do that? <|endoftext|>
Are you ready to ride a motorcycle? <|endoftext|>
I bet you do. <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  What is it made of. <|endoftext|>
That is good, are you enjoying your car? <|endoftext|>
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>
You're very lucky to have a girlfriend like that. <|endoftext|>
what is the upgraded version? I only have the basic one. <|endoftext|>
Me too.  Congratulations on your successful career. <|endoftext|>
I will keep you safe :) <|endoftext|>
What is the class? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  Hopefully you can get over the grade, or use it to get you into an even better school? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, what was wrong? <|endoftext|>
Who is it? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that she passed away. <|endoftext|>
Oh my!  That is so messed up.. I hope it got better.. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Was it Japanese? <|endoftext|>
hahaha why not? <|endoftext|>
wow.. thats a great feeling <|endoftext|>
Yes, we had a very close relationship. <|endoftext|>
Were they  from when you were a kid? <|endoftext|>
What else does that tabernacle do? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I've been through that.  Was the weather bad? <|endoftext|>
I was OK but I was so shocked to be alive. <|endoftext|>
Oh, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh, sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That's a really neat project.  Is it in a city or rural areas? <|endoftext|>
No I haven't but I'm considering it for my kids <|endoftext|>
That's no fun. Why was it a funeral? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What happened? <|endoftext|>
I dont mean the doctor. I mean my family. <|endoftext|>
Exactly. That's why I never cheat on my spouse or kids.  However, when it comes to eating ice cream, I don't mind going over to my girlfriend's side and eating there every once and awhile <|endoftext|>
Who doesn't like to wait for their turn? Why does it bother you so much? <|endoftext|>
I am sure you are ready.  You will do fine. Just have patience. <|endoftext|>
That's a good way to go in knowing you got this one. What is your degree in? <|endoftext|>
That's cool I'm not too far from there <|endoftext|>
No I haven't <|endoftext|>
That's aweseome.  How long did that take? <|endoftext|>
Thats good that he does that <|endoftext|>
probably not <|endoftext|>
Nice. Did you get a lot of jewelry for your wedding? <|endoftext|>
Why? were you hungry or what? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Did you lose your phone? <|endoftext|>
That's fun- guessing... <|endoftext|>
What is making you cautious? <|endoftext|>
Maybe they do.  What do you think it is? <|endoftext|>
No, do what is best for you and your family. <|endoftext|>
That's great that your boss cares about you. <|endoftext|>
How long have you been working there? <|endoftext|>
I hate crying <|endoftext|>
I am glad you are selfaware.  It really helps or hinders if you can't be selfaware yourself. <|endoftext|>
That is great for you. Are you happy there? <|endoftext|>
That is a great bonus! If you work for yourself it doesn't really matter what your bonus is. <|endoftext|>
That is very nice of her. What did you get from her? <|endoftext|>
Yea thats true. My parents are getting up there in age, so I have no financial issues with them. Its more about family <|endoftext|>
thats awesome that your shelter was saved. i bet everyone was shaking with their heads <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you're okay. I'm terrified of them too. <|endoftext|>
Who doesn't like to water their plants?? <|endoftext|>
Like what? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome what are you doing to prepare? <|endoftext|>
What is the secret? <|endoftext|>
I mean how can someone be a mother and have a little baby when they are only 18 or 20 years old. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you got to do what you got to do <|endoftext|>
The truth hurts sometimes. You should never say no when someone is lying to you <|endoftext|>
I love thai food. That sounds awful! I bet your stomach was burning that bad. <|endoftext|>
Haha I actually have a friend with that name. It rings a bell from work! <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a horrible trip.  Glad there is trash in there to clean up.  I'm guessing it wasn't a Walmart or something? <|endoftext|>
ugh  I'm sorry..  At least now you know how it feels to have it bad. <|endoftext|>
Dang! What brand is it? I have a plasma TV <|endoftext|>
Turn it off and go outside!! <|endoftext|>
I know right? Its like she has zero confidence in you!! <|endoftext|>
Well, I won't argue with you there. I love pizza. And I also love going to specific places to eat. It is just a fact of life, you know? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like fun! What did you all do on it? <|endoftext|>
It is always good to catch up <|endoftext|>
Did you attend a college? <|endoftext|>
LOL!! you know what is even funnier? <|endoftext|>
I know this is very hard time for you but you can do it! <|endoftext|>
I am <|endoftext|>
Well then why don't you give them your money? <|endoftext|>
Oh, why do you suffer? <|endoftext|>
That's so scary! Was it a tornado? <|endoftext|>
Ouch.  I hate that feeling.  It's like you have to power through it, but when it's over it's over. <|endoftext|>
Oh no I am sorry to hear that.  How long have you had it? <|endoftext|>
What drugs did you use? <|endoftext|>
sorry, what happened? are you alright? <|endoftext|>
Where are you desolate from? <|endoftext|>
that stinks, i hate that, i can't stand the smell. <|endoftext|>
That is the worst feeling! Did you go home and take it easy on it? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Did she forgive you? <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. That is life though right <|endoftext|>
That's fair, you want to be organized. It's the only thing that stops a friday lol <|endoftext|>
Yelling at people is always wrong, especially if they are doing something annoying. <|endoftext|>
It's not <|endoftext|>
Why are you mad? <|endoftext|>
The suspense is killing you?! I hope it works out for you! <|endoftext|>
What happened <|endoftext|>
I'm not doing surgery.  It's related to a health issue that was aggravated due to improper hydrodasting <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, what's worse is that he's a married man and my baby's mother was only 6 months old - we live in a small town where hardly anyone knows either. I want the creep to clean it up but I'm terrified he'll cause a scene like that. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's pretty cool. Where do you live? <|endoftext|>
I'm jealous. I like the yard work myself. <|endoftext|>
How come? Do you not have natural talent for it? <|endoftext|>
it is hard for sure, and the harder you work the easier it gets. <|endoftext|>
Why do you think that is? <|endoftext|>
I have never seen it but my family tells me all about it <|endoftext|>
What is it that you find so difficult about watching movies at a family gathering? <|endoftext|>
Exactly, nowadays kids use facebook, youtube, whatsapp and whatsapp.  So much stuff is everywhere <|endoftext|>
Getting a job is great. Being able to pay your bills is not. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's too bad. You need to find something else quickly <|endoftext|>
What do you do there? <|endoftext|>
Cool cool, how long did you work? <|endoftext|>
I know right.  It makes you appreciate life more <|endoftext|>
did you do anything <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a good way to get to the other side of the street. <|endoftext|>
Did it crash?! <|endoftext|>
That's the worst.  No thank you and then they're holding their breath on what? <|endoftext|>
Yeah those are bad <|endoftext|>
That's great, you must have put in hard work to get there. <|endoftext|>
That is too bad. Well perhaps you could have a meeting with your boss to vent some frustrations. <|endoftext|>
4 years <|endoftext|>
Yes that is a great way to start. Yes it is difficult but you got to do it.. I miss my family. I was in the same situation before I met my girlfriend and best friends <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Save up, and you won't regret it.  You'll only regret later when you have to buy a new hard drive <|endoftext|>
Congradulations. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I've never been to a restaurant so that's pretty cool <|endoftext|>
It's good to have that recognition though. How do you get it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no.  He'll know when you get him a new snack <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Was it that important or did you forget a lot? <|endoftext|>
MY mom had a stroke the other day and I brought her a bag of chips from home when she was doing her shopping <|endoftext|>
That's true lol <|endoftext|>
Oh man. Did he pick them up quick? <|endoftext|>
I like the grocery store idea! <|endoftext|>
Oh lol.  Did someone say choker? <|endoftext|>
That is good, do you live in a house or apartment? <|endoftext|>
Ah, that is okay, sometimes people are more personal. How did it go? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What was it about? <|endoftext|>
How did that go? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  How did you do it? <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling!  The first couple of days are rough but by the end it's great! <|endoftext|>
Woah, that's amazing! What do you get? <|endoftext|>
That is a great job. I am sure you earned the paycheck too <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's pretty amazing. I wish I was that calm and easy-going. <|endoftext|>
Ha ha, you want a man that makes you passionate? No thanks. I want someone that will love me forever. <|endoftext|>
llike what they used to pay for <|endoftext|>
That's funny. And sadly true. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  Do you like it so far? <|endoftext|>
What did you need? <|endoftext|>
Did you try anything to distract you? <|endoftext|>
Were they just being polite? <|endoftext|>
Why? <|endoftext|>
Must've been a bombshell hit, that is a real bummer! <|endoftext|>
That is nice, what was your conference on? <|endoftext|>
What position was it <|endoftext|>
Have you been saving lately? I had to when my wife and IDivorce <|endoftext|>
Oh.  Are you excited? <|endoftext|>
Is it an engineering exam? <|endoftext|>
What is the reason? <|endoftext|>
You did good my friend, you will do better next time <|endoftext|>
What are you doing for work? <|endoftext|>
What kind of restaurant was it? <|endoftext|>
What is an achivement of the whole town? <|endoftext|>
You were not strong enough didn't you <|endoftext|>
What happened at the gym? <|endoftext|>
Change always stinks, especially when it comes to health <|endoftext|>
Yes especially that <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of discipline. How do you do that? <|endoftext|>
I eat carbs but I do not want to <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. When did that happen? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, I've lived in that place. Are you having trouble finding a new place? <|endoftext|>
Yes, that must have been a very special moment. <|endoftext|>
I think he might have done something wrong. <|endoftext|>
that's great! what did she want you to do? <|endoftext|>
You must have been thrilled! What book was it? <|endoftext|>
What do you need to do to earn money? <|endoftext|>
I am working from home. Its quite a hassle with social media nowadays. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow,  that's exciting!!! <|endoftext|>
what does the bugger do <|endoftext|>
I agree, its important to have a plan B if the alternative fails. <|endoftext|>
Just hold onto your money. Don't listen to others advice, it's not helpful. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, how are you going to explain that to her? <|endoftext|>
Did she like you guys? <|endoftext|>
I dont know how to be understanding <|endoftext|>
Where did you force it? <|endoftext|>
Nice. Is she into that kind of thing? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
What is your distance race? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  You like to be organized / tough / mean / what? <|endoftext|>
What kind of games was it? <|endoftext|>
Yes! So many good games on there, I play them so often I remember them from my childhood. <|endoftext|>
Really? Why's that? <|endoftext|>
Yeah that is a really good reason not too go in. <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing!  You sure you want a new car? <|endoftext|>
That would be a Toyota ok <|endoftext|>
Really? What was the name of the movie <|endoftext|>
That's cool how did it make you feel when you watched it <|endoftext|>
Maybe its time to take a vacation <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That is no good. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah!!! Did you tell them how gross it was? <|endoftext|>
What kind did you get? <|endoftext|>
That is always nice to have a new bike. You will have to take it out to get maintenance done. <|endoftext|>
what did you buy? <|endoftext|>
Good for you. What are your long-term goals / <|endoftext|>
It is. I try to do it every day <|endoftext|>
It will work out for you buddy <|endoftext|>
That is terrible :( <|endoftext|>
You must have felt quite some type of way. Was it traumatic? <|endoftext|>
Oh no.  What happened? <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
That must have been a nice surprise.  Was it a picture of you or your grandparents? <|endoftext|>
Ah I love to be able to see my friends and family. They grow up so fast these days. <|endoftext|>
That's always fun...what was the surprise? <|endoftext|>
That is a nice way to spend a day. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What happened?! <|endoftext|>
You got it buddy <|endoftext|>
Why did you do that? <|endoftext|>
That's so brave! What changed your mind? <|endoftext|>
That is great, math is pretty tough for me <|endoftext|>
Yeah right, it's like when I get a high paying job, I should go find a job that pays as well <|endoftext|>
What happened next, was it a knife or was it something more serious? <|endoftext|>
that is wild, sometimes being wild is good. <|endoftext|>
OH thats awesome.. I never got into sports <|endoftext|>
Did you have a lot of favorite things? <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
Do you have a date coming up? <|endoftext|>
Yes, he is a great actor. <|endoftext|>
Oh okay! I don't know much about it. What show is it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah? What beach was it? <|endoftext|>
The ocean is beautiful and I am always watching my reflection in the water. <|endoftext|>
Dang, you should have told me not to do it! Did you get any help? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I know how you feel. It's hard to do when you're not doing anything physical <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. How does that go? <|endoftext|>
Where has the family gone? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.. it's always rough losing a friend.. <|endoftext|>
oh no what happened? <|endoftext|>
Why? What happened? <|endoftext|>
That sucks, hopefully you got well! <|endoftext|>
Did you like it? <|endoftext|>
The ocean is beautiful and the breeze is nice and comfortable. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome. I have never been to him. <|endoftext|>
Wow. You should check his books. He is one of the most popular teachers in the world! <|endoftext|>
Nice, did you take them out or anything? <|endoftext|>
I love when that happens.    What was the experience like? <|endoftext|>
Uh oh.  Was it OK? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hope you are OK. <|endoftext|>
What's wrong? <|endoftext|>
That is the best way to be safe for your family. <|endoftext|>
Why? Were yo worried yo meet one of them <|endoftext|>
That's great! What did you do with the time? <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. Did you catch him? <|endoftext|>
Was it cold? <|endoftext|>
You and me both! I have a singing disability. <|endoftext|>
Do you have a better career? <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of you.  I wish I had kids.  How old are your kids? <|endoftext|>
Must've been a party <|endoftext|>
That is always fun to do <|endoftext|>
I bet! Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Thanks. You too. <|endoftext|>
? <|endoftext|>
Who is your Mother <|endoftext|>
I bet.  That is nice <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  How do they feel about that? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's not good. How long have you been thinking about it? <|endoftext|>
Oh man that is so scary!! <|endoftext|>
That's ok. Were you embarrassed? <|endoftext|>
What are you budgeting for? <|endoftext|>
Better is certainly always better :) What do you do <|endoftext|>
Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
What did you go with <|endoftext|>
Whataburger is life saver for me <|endoftext|>
Oh no, how come? <|endoftext|>
Did you kiss on the forehead or chin? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry about that. <|endoftext|>
lol what happened <|endoftext|>
That's adorable! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! <|endoftext|>
Why was that? <|endoftext|>
I am happy for you <|endoftext|>
You should.Youll love it <|endoftext|>
Oh that sucks, I know that feeling.  Sometimes money grows on trees. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry, I know how hard that can be for you <|endoftext|>
... police never show up in my neighborhood <|endoftext|>
Aw man that's sad. What happened to your dog? <|endoftext|>
Oh nice. What kind of a do you use to run? <|endoftext|>
That's always fun to do <|endoftext|>
Those what? <|endoftext|>
why is that <|endoftext|>
Were you driving or walking? <|endoftext|>
Uh oh. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Ha ha.  That's a good use of the money. <|endoftext|>
I know that was Blackjack. <|endoftext|>
that is disgusting!!! <|endoftext|>
Oh damn. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping the best for you. <|endoftext|>
How long has she been <|endoftext|>
That's terrible.  I bet you miss him a lot? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
That's what social media is for, the real news is drowned out by all the fake stuff. <|endoftext|>
I know right?  Its so boring to just read what everyone is saying <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? Is she trying to get her hands on some? <|endoftext|>
Hahaha!  That is the best kind of version. <|endoftext|>
Do you mean the company you worked for or what you purchased/ sold? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! I bet your family feels pretty disheartened right now. <|endoftext|>
why is that <|endoftext|>
I will try them, thank you. What brand do you have? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? When does it start? <|endoftext|>
I sure hope so. i really like your team <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear about your loss. <|endoftext|>
That is sad. Is it treatable? <|endoftext|>
Maybe your friends are messing with you, you should ask them. <|endoftext|>
What a nice girl. You are a lucky person. <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I hope you are able to meet them all <|endoftext|>
That is impressive, you must work very hard for that. <|endoftext|>
What was your favorite part about it? <|endoftext|>
That's cool, was it your favorite show when you were a kid? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, is she okay? <|endoftext|>
Ouch, is it a rough floor to be on? <|endoftext|>
I understand. When those days came around i had many friends dancing as well <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite hip hop band? <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome! Do you go to a gym often? <|endoftext|>
That's true for some people but I find it hard to believe a person would cheat on the tenets of vegetarianism <|endoftext|>
Must be a bright sun shining. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Are you with family? <|endoftext|>
What about them do you have trouble remembering <|endoftext|>
Why were you nervous? That's the fun part <|endoftext|>
Did it work out for you? <|endoftext|>
why is that? <|endoftext|>
well she has to get up there to go play <|endoftext|>
Why are you mad? <|endoftext|>
Oh I bet.. It is so embarrassing <|endoftext|>
Same here.. It is the best feeling <|endoftext|>
That's pretty neat. You must have a very nice garden then. <|endoftext|>
Who is that? <|endoftext|>
Really, where is it covered up? <|endoftext|>
That's fun, hopefully they let her go on the roller coasters? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome <|endoftext|>
Yea - that is not safe at all. <|endoftext|>
Where exactly do you have faith? <|endoftext|>
Yes. My 3 year old son <|endoftext|>
You got that right <|endoftext|>
You should take your mind off things and focus on the negative emotions <|endoftext|>
How did it all go <|endoftext|>
Was it an important holiday? <|endoftext|>
it's okay to have fun sometimes! and also many people have trouble understanding the concept of silly <|endoftext|>
It takes some hard work to do that.  Are you in a household or working multiple jobs? <|endoftext|>
I wish I was that committed to a given work project. It's always hard to "mark" your progress. <|endoftext|>
What is your battle waht <|endoftext|>
That makes sense, although as you got older you realized you had more insecurities too, lol. <|endoftext|>
Oh what did you guys do while you were there? <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome, how many kids do you have? <|endoftext|>
That is disheartening to hear. What happened to him? <|endoftext|>
That's frustrating. Ask him for a loan assignment. I'm sure he'll work something out. <|endoftext|>
how did it go? <|endoftext|>
That's fantastic! I'm on my way to lose 30 pounds myself! <|endoftext|>
I bet that was a real pleasant feeling.  What a wonderful story to tell your loved ones. <|endoftext|>
Yes. It's so nice to hear that your hard work paid off. You deserve it. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Yeah that happens, I had that happen when I was younger as well <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! I hope it is a good friend and not some stranger on the street <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful <|endoftext|>
Ohhh, fancy. What's your exam on? <|endoftext|>
What was the result? <|endoftext|>
Is it a long visit? <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's horrible, it works if you have a good doctor <|endoftext|>
That does sound scary! <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened!! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Why is he doing that <|endoftext|>
What is the problem with the fire department <|endoftext|>
You should be able to do it. I'm sure you can do this. <|endoftext|>
.. than what <|endoftext|>
Where did you guys go? <|endoftext|>
What do you like most about life? <|endoftext|>
Yikes, that's a lot of money to spend on something you don't need and can't use. Did they say why they did? <|endoftext|>
You must be quite scared.  That must be frustrating. <|endoftext|>
Who is your friend? <|endoftext|>
That sounds fun! How long did you stay there for? <|endoftext|>
Can you have a significant other around? <|endoftext|>
Where do you go? <|endoftext|>
What?! Did it come from above or were you walking?! <|endoftext|>
You could have damaged the car <|endoftext|>
Florida is beautiful. Are you vacationing or visiting family? <|endoftext|>
OH.  I just moved to TX from FL and this is what we get : <|endoftext|>
That's not fair! Have you yelled at him? <|endoftext|>
I have one and it is so convenient.  What's your favorite kind of fridge you have? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. You are making a determination to get through this difficult time. <|endoftext|>
That is very sad to hear.  What do they refuse to do to help? <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling <|endoftext|>
Where are you and what made you come to that conclusion <|endoftext|>
Awesome! Is it your first time moving to another state? I moved once and it was definitely a change/event. <|endoftext|>
It gets really cold here!! <|endoftext|>
Nice. Where do you live? <|endoftext|>
That's cool.   What is interesting about the future? <|endoftext|>
I am hopeful so too. But sadly there is no automation <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  I hope things get better for her in the future.  What is she saying the issue is? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That's great news to hear! <|endoftext|>
You don't say..  That's a classic theme park experience! What was the Chicago Day? <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  I've never seen one <|endoftext|>
Yeah I hate those. Did you see it on a saturday <|endoftext|>
Whoa. Did you have to look away while watching it? <|endoftext|>
Wow,  That is amazing,  I am so happy for you. <|endoftext|>
What do you do <|endoftext|>
Really? where from <|endoftext|>
That's a cool ride <|endoftext|>
I graduate next May, I can't wait to get out and try and do something great. <|endoftext|>
Cool, what do you do currently <|endoftext|>
Don't feel so bad.  There are plenty of fish in the sea! <|endoftext|>
I think you just have to word it in a way that it's understood <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  What do you want to do while they are away? <|endoftext|>
It is really nice. Who is your favorite band? <|endoftext|>
good memories? <|endoftext|>
We all wish we had time to do more.  I wish i had money to do it <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's terrible! What was it? <|endoftext|>
They do. TV is actually pretty good these days. You don't have to pay for a subscription to access certain shows, right? <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel.  I only have one partner but we stay close so we don't get too emotional about it <|endoftext|>
I am glad you guys go back, what is your fav part of the visit? <|endoftext|>
That is sad to hear, you must have been devastated <|endoftext|>
I have a significant other, too. They are so fun to be around too. <|endoftext|>
True. I wonder how he will do on foreign policy. <|endoftext|>
Such as what? <|endoftext|>
I totally understand where you're coming from.  Is it better now? <|endoftext|>
Ah, I see. I mean you can do it but I'm sure it would be hard if it wasn't healing well. <|endoftext|>
I love Alabama, it's beautiful there. What kind of emotions did you feel from it? <|endoftext|>
Ah. I see. Did you do a lot of driving? <|endoftext|>
Did your work get stolen? <|endoftext|>
Exactly. I feel like if you have more control over it you would have no problem <|endoftext|>
what does that mean? do you have a pet or are you just keeping them as a pet? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, It is tough when it is a busy work day, but totally doable if you work hard! <|endoftext|>
Did you have your phone or tablet with you? <|endoftext|>
What's the big one? I hope it does and you have a party! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun!  We always have these things called friends and family that we keep remembering and telling stories about <|endoftext|>
Really? That's interesting <|endoftext|>
Man that's some serious driving ability, glad your ok! <|endoftext|>
Oh no you should get them fixed then. <|endoftext|>
wow thats like a whole lotta heights <|endoftext|>
Good for you. That was a tough situation to be in. <|endoftext|>
Well, you could always go and work there <|endoftext|>
Hey sometimes you have to take one for the team and do what you have to do <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, good for you! moving can be so interesting and frightening! <|endoftext|>
I am originally from Hong Kong <|endoftext|>
i wish i could do that <|endoftext|>
You and me both <|endoftext|>
Did you get away? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow I can't believe someone would do that to you. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. What was it that they promised? <|endoftext|>
I feel the same way, it's very irrational though <|endoftext|>
I was more nervous about being called names. Did you do ok? <|endoftext|>
Well that is a smart choice on your part, especially with such serious ramifications. <|endoftext|>
He does that sometimes, people can be such a pain sometimes. I try to buy from those too. <|endoftext|>
Really? I bet it gets expensive <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a good time to me. It's always sunny where I live. <|endoftext|>
That's awful, was it an adult wasp? They're more stingy than a wasp. <|endoftext|>
That is the worst. <|endoftext|>
That's awful!! Did you apologize to them or did you put it in the back of your cart? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, I hate having to explain things to customers lol <|endoftext|>
Those were the good old days my friend! <|endoftext|>
It's sad that you can't do that.  Do you have kids? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome.  What do you do? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great job. What do you do specifically? <|endoftext|>
oh I know how that feels. <|endoftext|>
Don't worry, buddy. If anything it's going to get worse. <|endoftext|>
People always seem to want to be mean to me.  It just makes me angry. <|endoftext|>
What was the prize for that ticket? <|endoftext|>
Well that's a blessing. <|endoftext|>
circuit work is very difficult. <|endoftext|>
Ok thank you <|endoftext|>
What do you mean?  It is under construction right now? <|endoftext|>
Ah!  I don't know anything about that.  Please tell me there's a special prize for that!? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, sounds like it was a scary experience. <|endoftext|>
oh wow that is interesting i wish i could find something interesting like that.. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. Why did she move far away? <|endoftext|>
I went to the Caribbean to teach English. Did you ever move there? <|endoftext|>
Well you tried, what went wrong? <|endoftext|>
Oh I get it.  I mean the characters, not the actor! <|endoftext|>
honk! honk! honk! honk! honk! honk! <|endoftext|>
Yes.  Everyone should take care when traveling. <|endoftext|>
that is great, good luck <|endoftext|>
No I haven't <|endoftext|>
Did you get storm'd or what was it? <|endoftext|>
We have been hit pretty bad here, been watching the news. It's awful <|endoftext|>
I know right? Such a shame that he will soon be gone. <|endoftext|>
I know. I have tried going off meds but it doesn't work. I don't want to go back to the dark ages. <|endoftext|>
Did he know who you were? <|endoftext|>
I bet your boss loves you <|endoftext|>
Which one? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I love the pinball machine. <|endoftext|>
That's really impressive! <|endoftext|>
Emergency fund? What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
That's nice of her.  What was the occasion? <|endoftext|>
Yeah i was refering to the kids, i love santa! <|endoftext|>
Wow I would be too! <|endoftext|>
Wow I am sorry you had to go through that. What did you do about it? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. They have gotten so realistic  in the technology these days. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel, my friend. <|endoftext|>
That's exciting!! <|endoftext|>
I go to one in Williamsburg. What about you? <|endoftext|>
They sure don't!! Especially not kids that eat alot. <|endoftext|>
Uh oh! Did the candy bar spill on him, or did someone else eat it? <|endoftext|>
Why not? <|endoftext|>
That's amazing! I have two dogs and I could never do that to them. <|endoftext|>
That sucks but is good that they are getting help right away. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That's horrible!! I hope you will get it fixed! <|endoftext|>
How did that go, was it fun <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite part about the movie <|endoftext|>
Nice! It's always nice to see your family when you're settling in. <|endoftext|>
That is interesting!  I have never been to Japan. <|endoftext|>
Wow, how amazing. I bet she enjoyed it a lot. Did you get to keep the clothes afterwards or was that donated to her? <|endoftext|>
That is a shame <|endoftext|>
Yes but I would have to trust my instincts about not doing it. <|endoftext|>
How sweet!  How old is he? <|endoftext|>
Well that's always nice when someone wants to help. IS he doing alright? <|endoftext|>
When do you get the interview <|endoftext|>
Of course you should.. its an investment <|endoftext|>
Yuck! <|endoftext|>
I bet that smelled great though, huh? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! I love finding new places opening up.  What is your favorite thing about it? <|endoftext|>
Oh cool, is that near you? <|endoftext|>
What kind of job is it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah that would be difficult, when did you move? <|endoftext|>
I agree. I love that expat community! <|endoftext|>
I will certainly try, thank you. It is a very beautiful city and has a lot going for it. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am fortunate enough to have a great family too <|endoftext|>
That is great to hear. <|endoftext|>
Indeed. I don't understand how anybody could turn away from a decision made because of what they were told was the best option <|endoftext|>
I'm rooting for you. What's happening in the future? <|endoftext|>
Was this a long time period <|endoftext|>
Does that make you sad or scared? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes we get those cars that just want to cut you off. <|endoftext|>
I try to never risk hurting anyone. Only see and do that to achieve what I want <|endoftext|>
Oh no what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, it's always so busy these days. I bet you miss her terribly. <|endoftext|>
I wish you luck and don't give up!  You need a different passion than what you currently have <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry about that. Have you tried joining any hobby groups? <|endoftext|>
That is good that she is going to be going places. Is it college? <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck with that, I know how hard it is to find a dentist these days <|endoftext|>
i agree. When I first moved into a new apartment, we had issues with the trash. Every trash bag we threw was thrown out <|endoftext|>
No I am working two jobs during the summer. IT and then the rest of the time it is a zoo and it gets very hot. <|endoftext|>
I've only ever skydived.  It was pretty awesome. <|endoftext|>
That's always nice to have those moments when you are at a place where you can say you have been praying. <|endoftext|>
I do love doing things whenever I have the chance.  Do you do the same thing? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  I have been trying to go vegan for a while now, and it's taking it off- Takes a lot of discipline to do that. <|endoftext|>
I love all the paleo food recipes on pinterest <|endoftext|>
What are you having trouble with <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great lady. <|endoftext|>
Moms are awesome <|endoftext|>
Sometimes. It's hard sometimes because I live so far away. She always skypes me or my mom chats. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah those are cool, i like dodge <|endoftext|>
oh i thought it was gold <|endoftext|>
That is a real bummer. <|endoftext|>
LOL I know this is a bad thing but I am sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
What did she make? <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds amazing. You must have thanked her for that. <|endoftext|>
I love sushi. I am so glad I am not the only one who enjoys sushi! <|endoftext|>
I understand that.   I am not sure what to do when no one wants to hang out <|endoftext|>
Yeah it is <|endoftext|>
Wow that's great that your grandpa was able to do that for you <|endoftext|>
Really? Never had it. I'll have to try it sometime <|endoftext|>
Woo hoo!!! That's awesome! I bet you can't wait to go celebrate. <|endoftext|>
Glad to hear it. What do you do? <|endoftext|>
Sounds pretty neat!  What does she say? <|endoftext|>
Not yet. I still look back on my childhood days fondly <|endoftext|>
That's smart, gotta save up for the later. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool <|endoftext|>
That is a nice gesture by your parents.  What did you eat? <|endoftext|>
Sushi is my absolute favorite! <|endoftext|>
How does that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. What kind of bike did you ride? <|endoftext|>
I did not. That is one of the few places I cannot visit because I have to work - unfortunately. <|endoftext|>
Maybe they are watching tv in another room. <|endoftext|>
Thank you for your service. <|endoftext|>
That's good. I need to learn that too <|endoftext|>
Going through a tough time has always amazes me.  When did you get caught up? <|endoftext|>
Oh man, he's lucky!  It's really tough when people get older and your in the same boat as them.  You will get there, I'm sure! <|endoftext|>
He wants a new car.. <|endoftext|>
That's good, it's the perfect age to party. <|endoftext|>
no but i hope i will get one soon <|endoftext|>
Who was it? <|endoftext|>
What happened <|endoftext|>
oh yea i can see that <|endoftext|>
No unfortunately not <|endoftext|>
How did that go? <|endoftext|>
Thats what you have to do...if you're not committed you may as well give up.  Good luck in the future. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome. Who was it by any chance? <|endoftext|>
How did you support him? <|endoftext|>
I do too, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon! <|endoftext|>
No worries.  It's always good to improve. <|endoftext|>
I love wings, you found a really good recipe. <|endoftext|>
I had never even tried a whisk until recently <|endoftext|>
That would be awesome. Would you like to work there? <|endoftext|>
Are you working in finance :) <|endoftext|>
Oh nice!  You are giving birth early?! <|endoftext|>
We should always stay away from those dark areas. They are never good for anyone. <|endoftext|>
Were you alone? <|endoftext|>
Yes I can very much relate to what you are saying. <|endoftext|>
Whoop Whoop! It's gonna be a lot of fun watching games. Who's your favorite team? <|endoftext|>
I know but that's not the question <|endoftext|>
That is intense.  That is great you can see that. <|endoftext|>
Yeah exactly, I don't know how these people do it. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's awful. I'm glad your friend was able to help <|endoftext|>
Oh no that sucks! <|endoftext|>
That's great! Did you get an A? <|endoftext|>
Well done! What subject was it on? <|endoftext|>
Oh my god,  that's terrible.  I'm really sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry that's no fun.  I hope things get better for them. <|endoftext|>
Wow how exciting! I have a boy on the way. Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
What was the expected outcome? <|endoftext|>
That's the same thing I did. When the weather was bad we put up signs to warn people. <|endoftext|>
What happened?! <|endoftext|>
Hey it's okay. You deserved that drink. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah what happened? <|endoftext|>
That's a good friend right there! Good for you taking care of them <|endoftext|>
Whiny? He seems to be doing okay. He needs a nap right now I think. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, what school did you attend? <|endoftext|>
What kind of work did you do? <|endoftext|>
That sucks.  Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|>
what movie was it? <|endoftext|>
Were you nervous about the interview or just excited about the job? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awesome! I'm happy for you! <|endoftext|>
That is terrible! I really dislike people who do that <|endoftext|>
Its the other girls fault, she doesnt care as much as you <|endoftext|>
That is lucky. Did they made you whole pizza or just your chair? <|endoftext|>
Oh man, you should have never left. <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! spoon and a fork are very useful tools! <|endoftext|>
Thats the best part <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah.  Those are long times. <|endoftext|>
I bet you went home tired. <|endoftext|>
Aw I am sorry to hear that. Did you get a burial at sea or what <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I remember those days too, they make you work hard for a small wage but in the end it's worth it. <|endoftext|>
I did get a check in. IT cleared <|endoftext|>
That's great, bus technology is improving all the time!! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I am glad you have those. What company was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no did she leave you a note or anything? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no what happened?! <|endoftext|>
Were your parents nice to you? <|endoftext|>
I hear you.  It's like the kid is growing up on you.  When he goes back to school, that is when I remember the good old days! <|endoftext|>
Call me mommy, ok? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I am glad you are okay - it really stinks when people are being nice to you though. <|endoftext|>
Was it for a specific gift or just needed for the self-employed? <|endoftext|>
oh yea? what was the food? <|endoftext|>
Wow that's so sad. Are you alright now? <|endoftext|>
Sibling dies, we get that, But it makes me feel sad to hear people getting hurt when they get older <|endoftext|>
Yep, and I am thankful for that in a lot of situations. <|endoftext|>
Yes, He is always there for us. <|endoftext|>
Where do you work/what do you do <|endoftext|>
Oh, do you work with an outside contractor / materials manager? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry that happened to you <|endoftext|>
Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
Did you have fun <|endoftext|>
Wow what a great milestone!!  You will always be able to remember this day because of the amazing memories that have come to you from your youth <|endoftext|>
That sucks, where at? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's exciting, that's a special trip that's for sure! <|endoftext|>
What show is that? <|endoftext|>
I have never seen that show <|endoftext|>
I agree, but then again we're not supposed to talk about it! <|endoftext|>
you deserve a lot of credit for that <|endoftext|>
That sucks, maybe you can hotel for a while? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I've never flown longer than 30 miles on any form of travel. <|endoftext|>
Why not? <|endoftext|>
Did you not meet her? <|endoftext|>
That's always nice.  Do you have a favorite dish? <|endoftext|>
My yard always seem to grow longer as well. You just never know what's going on and who's behind them. <|endoftext|>
I feel you buddy..I'm sorry you had to go through that <|endoftext|>
Travel is a must for any relationship.  Why do you need a marriage for that? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I am sorry, I thought you meant other people work. They must be working hard <|endoftext|>
Aw,  That is too bad!  I've been married for that same time though.  It's a bit too intense for me <|endoftext|>
Wow what a mean person. How did your friend react? <|endoftext|>
How old is she? <|endoftext|>
Thats great. <|endoftext|>
Thats what happened to me yesterday.... <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's quite aggressive of you. What did he say? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  Is there anyone else near by that can help you? <|endoftext|>
What store you going to <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, what are your plans for next year <|endoftext|>
That's a good point actually <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, the noises and the shaky camera work is just brutal! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How did that happen?! <|endoftext|>
That's too bad, hopefully you get it this time! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Have you tried calling him? <|endoftext|>
oh wow thats a shame <|endoftext|>
I can only imagine, the house will be empty in no time <|endoftext|>
Yeah, kindergarten was fun for me too. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm an adult now. So everything is the same. <|endoftext|>
That would scare me too!  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. He is always with us no matter what we need <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's horrible, how long did you have him for? <|endoftext|>
What was reputed about yourself? <|endoftext|>
That is rough.  When did you find out? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good. Just talk to them and whatever it is that you need to tell them. <|endoftext|>
Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that was fun <|endoftext|>
That is awful and I am sorry to hear that! Did you find out who the badmouthed was? <|endoftext|>
What did he do? <|endoftext|>
I have never seen it. Was it that good? <|endoftext|>
What show is it? <|endoftext|>
Why was that <|endoftext|>
Man that sucks, did you find someone to help you? <|endoftext|>
oh? you planning to go? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it a work issue? <|endoftext|>
Oh no.  Was he younger or older? <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear. What did you do to her to make it go by so quickly? <|endoftext|>
That is cool man. Why were you surprised? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's wonderful! Were they married or taking care of kids? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you can get him to act like a boss then? <|endoftext|>
That is a good thing. That means they are loyal <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a very magical time! <|endoftext|>
That is so cool...how long were they? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah!  That's why I only go to bed at specific times! <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
What is your occupation currently? I will keep you in mind. <|endoftext|>
Wow, you must have been a little put off after you saw it. <|endoftext|>
Did you get any work done? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. How is she holding up? <|endoftext|>
that happens to me too.. work is the worst sometimes! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that,  do you have any help with chores? <|endoftext|>
What was it? <|endoftext|>
Was this a friend that you were hanging out with? <|endoftext|>
That's really good management. <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  Was it math homework or work? <|endoftext|>
What is the job?  I hope you get it. <|endoftext|>
What job do you have now? <|endoftext|>
did you get a good look at them <|endoftext|>
Aww, I bet that was sweet <|endoftext|>
Why would you be disgusted? <|endoftext|>
well that's not good, maybe you should talk to him and if he wants you to do something he'll be there for you <|endoftext|>
That's great. Are you nervous? <|endoftext|>
That is a great idea. It's good to be prepared. I bet you did amazing. <|endoftext|>
What was an ice cream cake <|endoftext|>
Oh well at least it's cake, right? <|endoftext|>
Where did she go <|endoftext|>
Were you on a date or what <|endoftext|>
It's always annoying when that happens. <|endoftext|>
True. I work in a building that is being turned into an office park..and I always see people coming and going everyday. It makes me worry <|endoftext|>
awesome, I hope it works out for you <|endoftext|>
Oh, I was hoping it wasn't something too serious. What is wrong with the lab manager? <|endoftext|>
I bet.  I wouldn't be there long either! <|endoftext|>
lol thats actually hilarious <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is terrible :( What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Yeah it is pretty awful when you are scared you will die. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible, have you gone to a doctor? <|endoftext|>
How long did it take? <|endoftext|>
Oh god.. that happened to me in high school too. I was terrified and scared that I was going to get publicly humiliated or something. Did something happen to you after that? <|endoftext|>
What was angering about it? <|endoftext|>
That is good. You are both wifes <|endoftext|>
Who's we? <|endoftext|>
Oh my! What were the results of your studies? <|endoftext|>
Whoa! What did she do? <|endoftext|>
That's good news. You will have a great house to buy <|endoftext|>
Nice, any special occasion? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What kind of car is it? <|endoftext|>
Mustangs are awesome, man. I wish I had a car of that description <|endoftext|>
That sounds like something that would scare me. I am glad you are alright <|endoftext|>
Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
That's ok. I miss them too. I was really young <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a good time, what was the name of the band? <|endoftext|>
Good luck, I hope you do. <|endoftext|>
That's a lot of studying. What do you plan on studying? <|endoftext|>
That's a good start. It's hard to discipline kids when they're so eager to learn and do new things! <|endoftext|>
I'm sure it was challenging. How old was she? <|endoftext|>
It stinks. How far does she have to traveled? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I miss him too.  What happened to him? <|endoftext|>
She must be a keeper then.  How is the weather? <|endoftext|>
What's been tough <|endoftext|>
Horror films give me nightmares, I can't imagine doing that in real life. <|endoftext|>
Who do you know that has those popups? <|endoftext|>
That's great. Will you like it? <|endoftext|>
Really? I've always wanted to go there <|endoftext|>
That's great! Where is she coming from? <|endoftext|>
I speak German. <|endoftext|>
That is always a good thing <|endoftext|>
You mean you won't eat it? <|endoftext|>
i can imagine <|endoftext|>
Scream is the adult version of FIFA <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's nice. What did you do with them? <|endoftext|>
that is awesome that you got to meet her again. does she live near you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, did it scar you? <|endoftext|>
Me too.  It is always the same. How are you? <|endoftext|>
That is a good thing <|endoftext|>
Who is? <|endoftext|>
Was it parked? <|endoftext|>
Oh I get it. What happened? <|endoftext|>
What does the job be? I wish you good luck! <|endoftext|>
I know, I worry a lot about that too. <|endoftext|>
Did everything go okay? <|endoftext|>
What did they do? <|endoftext|>
Why is she in the country for 2 months? <|endoftext|>
Yeah that's true <|endoftext|>
That's too bad, have you tried talking to her? <|endoftext|>
What is it? <|endoftext|>
I can understand that.  What are you looking to do? <|endoftext|>
oh yeah what do you mean <|endoftext|>
Uh oh. I hope you had something else lined up? <|endoftext|>
What help you need? <|endoftext|>
Was it by yourself or with friends? <|endoftext|>
I love the movie and am a big fan. I love how the makeup and prosthetic people can create such beautiful and unique visual constructs <|endoftext|>
yes it is beautiful. <|endoftext|>
It's always good to stay safe when traveling. <|endoftext|>
What food was it <|endoftext|>
That sounds so good right now <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great! They really learn quickly, it's great to have a dog that can listen and understand human needs. <|endoftext|>
What did you do for him <|endoftext|>
Oh no. How long does it take to clean up a dog if you keep it shut up? <|endoftext|>
It's good to explore and see what's around you - you'll like it there much better if you love it there. <|endoftext|>
What area are you in? <|endoftext|>
Wow, I hate that. Did you end up changing your w the service? <|endoftext|>
I can relate. I always want to be ready when the bad comes to light <|endoftext|>
It definitely is.  I hate going to those stores that you have to write a check to. <|endoftext|>
Its almost all the time. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awesome! I wish I was traveling for work like that! <|endoftext|>
Overseas. Where I am from, we have exotic animals like bears. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What was the issue? <|endoftext|>
Wow, I bet that was scary. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That is very annoying to hear. Have you tried calling your bank to speak with them? <|endoftext|>
What did you do instead <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What was the occasion? <|endoftext|>
That happens to me sometimes.  Sometimes I forget things that I don't even need.  Glad to be reminded sometimes haha <|endoftext|>
That is good, how often does she? <|endoftext|>
Well I hope you guys have a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
That is awesome!  So glad you had a good time. <|endoftext|>
Well we all go to the same places, right? And what was it that made you feel bad about it? <|endoftext|>
Oh I hear you.. I go to work all the time so I understand when wife is being kind of wuss <|endoftext|>
What was it? <|endoftext|>
? <|endoftext|>
I feel you, i know how you feel <|endoftext|>
Oh, you're so welsome!!! How are you doing today?! <|endoftext|>
What book is it? <|endoftext|>
oh nice <|endoftext|>
I was thinking about that too! It's always so hard to put up with someone not being treated right. <|endoftext|>
Mine is still a puppy.  I wish I could go back in time to teach her some life lessons. <|endoftext|>
What happened? That's so frustrating. <|endoftext|>
What does he do well enough in school? <|endoftext|>
Is it the biggest party you've ever had? <|endoftext|>
It sucks being alone a lot. Are you doing okay? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful <|endoftext|>
That is great.  Do you have a partner? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I don't like them either.  I hate those things <|endoftext|>
Oh man that is priceless. That is what my boyfriend does when his wife is around. <|endoftext|>
I understand that <|endoftext|>
Was there a work meeting you could leave early too? <|endoftext|>
Wow.. I am sorry to hear that... maybe she will return soon for you :) <|endoftext|>
Oh how long did you have to work? <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  What movie are you going to see? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that you're going to miss it. <|endoftext|>
haha oh no that's a good story! <|endoftext|>
They're used to carry things that you don't normally have access to. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that you have something that keeps your focus. <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  Does she do custom orders? <|endoftext|>
I live in FL but have family in CD <|endoftext|>
What country was it? <|endoftext|>
Maybe I should give it another shot <|endoftext|>
Yep, it's always good to be watching someone driving or doing something they're not doing themselves! <|endoftext|>
That is a smart move. Money grows on trees. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear <|endoftext|>
Did everything go okay? <|endoftext|>
What did <|endoftext|>
I have never tried that.  I'm a bit concerned about the health effects of swimming. <|endoftext|>
Yes it is!  Do you do any sports / do you do Yoga / curling? <|endoftext|>
Me too <|endoftext|>
That is too bad. You should try to cherish your wifes feelings. <|endoftext|>
How was that song? <|endoftext|>
I miss those times too <|endoftext|>
I bet he gets a lot of hate too though <|endoftext|>
What is the easiest way to do that? <|endoftext|>
Hahaha!  I've been there!  I've been curious myself, too. <|endoftext|>
What happened in the basement? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean.   What is the issue? <|endoftext|>
Yeah that is pretty annoying.  I only watch stuff on computer or with the smart TV on <|endoftext|>
Very nice! I was never able to have children. <|endoftext|>
That's cool, I bet it is a great show then <|endoftext|>
Why is that <|endoftext|>
I would go first class first if I were you, girl or man. <|endoftext|>
That's a shame. They should have to buy it from a different store. <|endoftext|>
Yeah it's lean but also highly quoted from a book that talks about the hunting and settlement of the frontier people lived there. <|endoftext|>
Lol <|endoftext|>
Oh, is it that bad? Or just a lot of people have trouble smelling it? <|endoftext|>
Does the cranky toddler get to you? I'm hoping for a vacation soon! <|endoftext|>
Oh you don't have a mission / assignment assigned to you? <|endoftext|>
I hate that feeling... what did happen?! <|endoftext|>
I love empty a shelters, so relaxing. <|endoftext|>
Aw that's too bad. Maybe you can talk to him soon. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that really stinks.  You must be proud. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear that. Is it the first time she had to be rushed? <|endoftext|>
That's awful.  Did she die? <|endoftext|>
How does that usually cause trouble for you? <|endoftext|>
Did it work out? <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Thats so sweet of him. So what was the movie? <|endoftext|>
Oh cool. I've never heard of it. What is it about? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Is it a work travel or a family emergency? <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh my!  Did you miss her with that mis reading, hu? I hope you at least get a little bit of sleep during this time! <|endoftext|>
What happened that made it so bad? <|endoftext|>
Ouch, that's rough. Did it take a pay raise? <|endoftext|>
That's sounds like a lot of fun. What are you most excited for? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is quite an adventure! <|endoftext|>
Same.  There are so many  places that should be turned into shelters or turned into park places but they don't.  I'm a simple man-  I just want a toilet. <|endoftext|>
I do the same. I also donate on those days. <|endoftext|>
What happened?! <|endoftext|>
Jumped out because you're expecting trouble or because he scared you half to death? <|endoftext|>
Because they are never satisfied with what they have <|endoftext|>
Yes, I was at a party and this girl was giving me necklace- No <|endoftext|>
It's cloudy and rainy over there now? I think it's time to go outside and do something you love <|endoftext|>
What happens tonight <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear!  When does the new baby turn 16? <|endoftext|>
How often does she spend with the baby? <|endoftext|>
Aww that's sweet, how old are your kids <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that, my family is a lot further away <|endoftext|>
Oh wow you need to go quick before people see you go in too much debt. <|endoftext|>
I just moved to the middle of nowhere. Can you imagine the difference between being on the outside and being on the inside!! <|endoftext|>
That is always a blast! We should plan a trip together! <|endoftext|>
Nice! Is it a holiday? <|endoftext|>
Good job!! You should celebrate with them!! <|endoftext|>
Where do you work? <|endoftext|>
Who does, and do you take them everywhere?! <|endoftext|>
That is interesting. What does that mean? <|endoftext|>
Are you ok with that? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good!  Hopefully it stays that way! <|endoftext|>
How did that happen <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What kind of position are you wanting? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, what will you be doing? <|endoftext|>
No I have not but I hope to soon. It is a great career with great benefits. <|endoftext|>
Where do they go? <|endoftext|>
Do you have a girlfriend or do you just want a friend? <|endoftext|>
Were you staying at a holiday resort? <|endoftext|>
Who is he? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That is SO NASTY <|endoftext|>
LOL!! I love when you can just rely on those convenient stores! <|endoftext|>
Oh what kind? Did you like your new job? <|endoftext|>
moving is hard work <|endoftext|>
Wow that is quite the predicament you are in, glad it wasn't intentional though. Did you cry for a while? <|endoftext|>
That's horrible, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's horrible.  I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should try something new <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I bet that was fun to hear <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, she's a lucky lady. <|endoftext|>
That's the spirit! <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, I always hear about that - so does that mean you're taking a break? <|endoftext|>
Oh cool, was it like a sketch or did you find something cool? <|endoftext|>
Ah yes, you are speaking fondly of the past. I can relate to the situation at hand though because they are all still with us <|endoftext|>
Oh no! You are the lucky one. <|endoftext|>
lol thats what happens when you get tatooed in the face <|endoftext|>
Are you in the area?  Was your house ok? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, I almost had to be on the phone just to be sure we were OK. Are you OK? <|endoftext|>
You must have a happy relationship with her! <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet! Was this before or after you got her? <|endoftext|>
Whoa, that's a big dog! <|endoftext|>
Wow. What a pain. People can be so careless. It's unfortunate. <|endoftext|>
I would try to wash it with cold water <|endoftext|>
I hate thunderstorms! <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
What did you study? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine it is <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's good to be able to do that when you have nothing to lose. <|endoftext|>
I have a garden too, its nice to see people when you least expect them to be <|endoftext|>
That was nice of them, windstorms suck!! <|endoftext|>
They didn't help you clean up the tree. They helped you cut it down- which is what they asked for. <|endoftext|>
wow! thats amazing <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great!  That is a tough field. <|endoftext|>
That's great! How long is she staying for? <|endoftext|>
I haven't decided on a place yet.  We might go to Nashville and then just chill for a while! <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's embarrassing. Did someone help you? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry that happened to you. <|endoftext|>
That's not true at all! The CSMO WSAP has such a hard time accounting for the number of employees involved. <|endoftext|>
That's not cool <|endoftext|>
Yes, the employer is supposed to provide a 24/7 coverage for all employees - even those with disabilities - it is a shame when they don't provide it to all employees. <|endoftext|>
Harvey was a disaster for so many people. I wish we could have evacuated before it was too severe. <|endoftext|>
Wow! What area did you move to? <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds wonderful!  I bet that meant a lot to him! <|endoftext|>
What was it about? <|endoftext|>
Wow! I bet you are excited! <|endoftext|>
Oh man I am so sorry to hear that!  I'm sure your diet is important! <|endoftext|>
What's going on with him? <|endoftext|>
Where is she coming from? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
My best friend had a rough time with anxiety and it was horrible <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful. <|endoftext|>
Why did you mention it? <|endoftext|>
I hope you did too. I know you did great. <|endoftext|>
Yes, we all need to study every day! <|endoftext|>
I'm happy to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That is impressive! What subject was the test in? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome that you get to celebrate with him every now and then. What are your specific plans for this time of the year? <|endoftext|>
What do you mean it's not an guarantee? <|endoftext|>
Why would he not come? <|endoftext|>
He's talking about himself? <|endoftext|>
I am too, what are you doing to make your plans? <|endoftext|>
Exactly. It's a feeling that hits right on the forehead. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. That is rough. <|endoftext|>
Can you talk to them? <|endoftext|>
That does bother me too often. Especially when the airplane is doing a turn and I'm behind the wheel. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. What did you do with the other foods? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that... I wish I was there for you if you need someone. <|endoftext|>
Have you tried calling  the casino? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you got your computer <|endoftext|>
What are the issues? <|endoftext|>
I bet you did, you won a lot. What kind of poker do you play? <|endoftext|>
What is your occupation currently? <|endoftext|>
Same here! They are the creepiest things in the world. We have a big spider den on our terrace <|endoftext|>
Have you tried praying? <|endoftext|>
I used to play this game all the time when I was little. I miss it. <|endoftext|>
What game is it? <|endoftext|>
That's always a pain!  What did you end up doing? <|endoftext|>
I love when restaurants review you. Makes it hard to order sometimes. <|endoftext|>
That's great, when will you be seeing them? <|endoftext|>
What do you do for work? <|endoftext|>
You are super lucky to have a nephew that fast! <|endoftext|>
What is his name? <|endoftext|>
Oh my god, why was that? <|endoftext|>
That sucks, hopefully you guys got plenty of tickets? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great. What was your favorite thing about high school? <|endoftext|>
How many cups of coffee did you drink that day? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hate when that happens! I know how that feels. <|endoftext|>
why is that? <|endoftext|>
Are you scared? <|endoftext|>
For what? <|endoftext|>
wow, that's a nice surprise!! <|endoftext|>
How long has she been with you? <|endoftext|>
I am so happy for you <|endoftext|>
That is great that he is there for you. <|endoftext|>
Oh goodness that is awful, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad it was your personal property. <|endoftext|>
Get a koss bag! It should be very helpful. <|endoftext|>
That sounds pretty terrifying! <|endoftext|>
Why were you annoyed? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh really? I've never been <|endoftext|>
How come? Is it not something that you should be doing regularly? <|endoftext|>
That is so amazing to hear. <|endoftext|>
His work.  How did you find that out? <|endoftext|>
Cool! Have you talked to him about it? <|endoftext|>
Then why are you upset? <|endoftext|>
good for you <|endoftext|>
It does. IS IT THAT AMAZING? <|endoftext|>
that's wonderful! I'm sorry you're being downvoted <|endoftext|>
How long did you stay together? <|endoftext|>
Oh awesome!  I never win either. That never helps but it's nice to win when you can. <|endoftext|>
what did you win? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's pretty sweet <|endoftext|>
What? <|endoftext|>
That really sucks.. Did you get a lot of sun during the trip? <|endoftext|>
What is rain? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! I bet you worked hard for it! <|endoftext|>
You are very welcome <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you hurt yourself bad? <|endoftext|>
That's what work does - have a good attitude - easy to hide when you're not doing anything <|endoftext|>
That's great. What do you do? <|endoftext|>
Yeah?  Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's exciting! Why are you moving overseas? <|endoftext|>
I live in Alaska.  I was just up to take a vacation, but that's taken off unfortunately <|endoftext|>
Me too. I think those are creeps or scammers. <|endoftext|>
Mine too.  We are trying to have a serious talk about things. <|endoftext|>
I am a huge fan of the prequels. You should check them out sometime. <|endoftext|>
What do you like about the new ones? <|endoftext|>
Oh god yes, public is the worst. <|endoftext|>
Are they expensive? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty awesome! What are the diamonds made of? <|endoftext|>
You deserve it!!  You have worked so hard!! <|endoftext|>
That is the worst.  The city can do no wrong and the people can't care if your trash is on the street. <|endoftext|>
That's good, are you always walking? <|endoftext|>
What is the issue? <|endoftext|>
That is very exciting and fun. I hope you have a good time! <|endoftext|>
That's good news and bad news. <|endoftext|>
Oh you! Congratulations! <|endoftext|>
That sounds fun! What do you like doing there? <|endoftext|>
What is wonderful about it? <|endoftext|>
What kind of car is it <|endoftext|>
Congrats! I know BMW is awesome! What kind of car was it? <|endoftext|>
That's nice. What kind of clothes are they wearing? <|endoftext|>
I agree. That's usually what I do <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I wish I could help you out too. I guess I just have to learn how to cook and save money. What do you like to eat? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I hate when that happens!  Does she know it was your idea? <|endoftext|>
True.. is there any other type of work like work you can do? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. That's why I only go to Starbucks or take public transportation. Lots of options available and it's not too busy. <|endoftext|>
You can do it! She is holding back the other person <|endoftext|>
When will you see them again? <|endoftext|>
Who is he <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that she's losing weight! What does she eat, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|>
Yes you should do that, when you have your family's money. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
i understand but sadly it's happening a lot <|endoftext|>
That is great.  I was just talking to someone about getting a degree and we are talking about going to a party and he was talking about making a reservation at a nice restaurant with great service.  What does that have to do with your original post above? <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
What kind of tv is it <|endoftext|>
wow thats crazy! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How is she doing? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that.  Have you tried online dating? <|endoftext|>
Yes, that is what everyone is saying but I think it's going to be a very long process. <|endoftext|>
I agree and disagree with everything you just said <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
I understand, what was the project about? <|endoftext|>
Aw how sweet.  How did she pass away? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry about that! They say dogs are our future and we have to look after them. <|endoftext|>
He's been working hard for what seems like nothing, I'm happy for you <|endoftext|>
Really? <|endoftext|>
You are right it is unacceptable. I am sorry <|endoftext|>
I have had that feeling <|endoftext|>
That sounds so fun! Were you ever scared at all? <|endoftext|>
That's really great.  It's hard to be around a crowd when they're trying to be intimidating. <|endoftext|>
Aww, I love getting pets.  What kind of dog was she? <|endoftext|>
What was her name? <|endoftext|>
Does he have a cold? <|endoftext|>
Poor little boy.  I have had one of those.  What does he lack / have done to make him so disloyal? <|endoftext|>
What is he going to college for? <|endoftext|>
Yes, that is the best part about being a mom, the peace and quiet! <|endoftext|>
Oh cool, what part of the country? <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  What are your favorite parts about italy <|endoftext|>
Indeed! I'm loving every minute of it. <|endoftext|>
Thats so nice of them!! <|endoftext|>
That's good! <|endoftext|>
Yea. People like that tend to cut you off and not look where they're coming from. It's annoying <|endoftext|>
I do not blame you. I hate people too! <|endoftext|>
Why is that? Is it a person, animal, place? Just something that interests you? <|endoftext|>
You got that right <|endoftext|>
I am the same way.  I rescue and I'm always so glad to see an animal and have their energy return to them <|endoftext|>
haha, yeah, that's true. It's very different- these dogs don't get to poo/ <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
oh cool, i like candles <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am sorry <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I bet that was awful! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? You ate a lot! <|endoftext|>
That sounds relaxing <|endoftext|>
Rain is very calming especially when it's loud - the tap dancing in the rain <|endoftext|>
That's no good. How are you typing these days? <|endoftext|>
Oh I hear you.. I'm in the same boat.. :(  Can you borrow a car for a little bit? <|endoftext|>
Yeah those were the days, <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I would be careful, it IS possible to get into a car accident and die...Not too fun! <|endoftext|>
I am glad you are enjoying your life there then.  It is always good to experience what is around you daily. <|endoftext|>
Ooo that sounds like fun! What dancer / instrument did you play? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That's not cool! <|endoftext|>
Wow! Really?? that's unbelievable... I mean he had a legit medical need and was having a bad medical condition, what did he do? <|endoftext|>
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>
Whoops. I meant to send that to who? <|endoftext|>
That is a wonderful story and I am very happy you stayed for a day. We all have limits and I am sure it smelled wonderful. <|endoftext|>
Haha that's the worst!  I know the feeling - it's too hot to touch the potty! <|endoftext|>
oh, when is that? <|endoftext|>
Great! That is the fun part. <|endoftext|>
Yes, it is a huge problem in college. It is no fun. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, are you talking about someone special that you know? <|endoftext|>
what did you do with it? <|endoftext|>
It's great when people care about you. Everyone needs a friend like you <|endoftext|>
That is terrible! Did you hurt yourself? <|endoftext|>
I am glad they worked out for you.  I have been through a lot <|endoftext|>
That's good! It's important to get everything you need ordered and stored correctly. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I always start early but am late <|endoftext|>
True.. or does it not always get crowded? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. What is going on? <|endoftext|>
Haha yeah. That was a bad day for sure! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. I bet those people were frustrated <|endoftext|>
I'm so glad you're back to school! <|endoftext|>
You and me both!  I've been doing that a lot recently.  And I'm back at work in just over two weeks!  That's when it's time to face the client.  It's so hard to shop online <|endoftext|>
Yep. That's how it always is.  That's why I always buy from those places. <|endoftext|>
That's no good, did it get you? <|endoftext|>
Oh god!! I am so sorry!! <|endoftext|>
How was it too much? <|endoftext|>
well, it IS a mystery..haha. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that is so sweet of him! It's always good when the unexpected comes around. <|endoftext|>
Oh yes, and it always results in a disaster. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome that you were able to do that, you saved a lot there <|endoftext|>
haha they work if you know how to do it. <|endoftext|>
Ah, the good old days of convenience. It's nice that you can always rely on those memories to help make you feel better. <|endoftext|>
Oh man! That's never a good feeling <|endoftext|>
I can get pretty anxious  while studying too. <|endoftext|>
Wow, thats amazing! <|endoftext|>
That's good, did she do it intentionally? <|endoftext|>
Whoa, that is intense. Did you play yourself? <|endoftext|>
Where do you currently am <|endoftext|>
That's great!  It's not too hard to learn.  Did you have a hard time choosing which degree to go for? <|endoftext|>
oh what was the reason? <|endoftext|>
Oh, sorry to hear that. What are you studying? <|endoftext|>
Well then maybe you should go to the movies with him again?? <|endoftext|>
I understand that. Is it with the same person or different person? <|endoftext|>
What kind of games do you play? <|endoftext|>
Well I am looking forward to the new Vegas game coming out. <|endoftext|>
Do you mean like the amusement parks in general or just specific ones in particular? <|endoftext|>
It's always good to take the time to spend with loved ones. They re-watch your favorite things and you can catch up on what you've been up to. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! <|endoftext|>
I'm an electrical engineer! Why do you ask? <|endoftext|>
What has been great <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, what is it for? <|endoftext|>
Aw, why is that? <|endoftext|>
I used to when I was a kid but not any more. I always wanted to try professional bowling. My dad works as a bowler  so I have seen him do some bowls at least <|endoftext|>
Well stay away from those areas, stay indoors and use those searchlights <|endoftext|>
You dog keep must be barking! Why don't you answer them? <|endoftext|>
Haha pro bowl or nah? That's pretty awesome if you are good at it. <|endoftext|>
That's ok. What game was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That sounds awful. You should tell them - do it anonymously. <|endoftext|>
You did the right thing.You gave her your heart and soul <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can still visit. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, you are very lucky <|endoftext|>
It really isnt that bad. If you have a dependable work-station then it is not so bad. <|endoftext|>
What do you do for work? I bet you're a hard worker, do you like engineering? <|endoftext|>
You will do great!! <|endoftext|>
That is understandable. It is hard to set specific goals for the semester. <|endoftext|>
That is good that you are feeling at ease.  What did you have on <|endoftext|>
What kind of pizza was it? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.  I hate when that happens.  They really do get you. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. I do not like either of those things either. Have you tried talking to him about it? <|endoftext|>
What game is it? <|endoftext|>
LOL....I have never even heard of that game. <|endoftext|>
That is what happens when you don't pay child support <|endoftext|>
I wish i could do that. I dont have to talk to them or clean up after them lol <|endoftext|>
Storms can be wonderful. I went skydiving a couple of years ago. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, that's rough. Are you alright? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  I remember when homework was a dollar.  I bet you'll be ready for it. <|endoftext|>
Hey you got this, work smart, not harder! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's neat! What was the name of the song? <|endoftext|>
I agree. Life is about enjoying the moment! <|endoftext|>
Your brother must have really learned from you. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
How do you like it so far <|endoftext|>
It is alright, you can get it done tomorrow <|endoftext|>
Exactly. I'm always learning and improving and never losing sight of that potential silver lining. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, Utah is a really fun place to go. Don't worry too much about it! They're probably all over you anyway. <|endoftext|>
Oh well what did you do? <|endoftext|>
what kind is it? <|endoftext|>
Aw well that's okay <|endoftext|>
Yeah I hate driving around in circles trying to figure out where you need to turn and then having to wait for your signal to come up. <|endoftext|>
Lol how long does it usually last? <|endoftext|>
I haven't seen that in a long time,  that is crazy! <|endoftext|>
It is pretty bad when they are doing work around the house! <|endoftext|>
I hate car1 <|endoftext|>
what happened <|endoftext|>
That's my biggest fear too <|endoftext|>
Yes it's like that <|endoftext|>
Oh thats a bad experience to have. But thats life <|endoftext|>
Well yes or pets. Dogs need love too :/ <|endoftext|>
That's awful...what did you do <|endoftext|>
Oh that is a terrible thing to faceplant into. People are never honest <|endoftext|>
What is your major? <|endoftext|>
That's really nice of him! What kind of books? <|endoftext|>
Did you have a good experience doing it? <|endoftext|>
You did this for your country? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What kind of car is it? <|endoftext|>
What happened to it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah it's bad but, it's okay to take care of them when they're able to <|endoftext|>
What has? <|endoftext|>
That is unfortunate, maybe next time <|endoftext|>
That's really rough. Are you drinking more coffee now? That can help a lot with the stench. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Are you okay now? <|endoftext|>
That is good, where did you go? <|endoftext|>
Why not? It's the easiest way to get things done. <|endoftext|>
Well, for one, I do not have a car.. And two, we live in the middle of nowhere! <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
What? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, does that not exist where you are? <|endoftext|>
I love going to those things! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I bet you had a great time. <|endoftext|>
Turning corner? Why is that? <|endoftext|>
That happens to me all the time with my niece. It's the worst <|endoftext|>
Did the person die? <|endoftext|>
Yeah that is really annoying. It takes them so long to verify the authenticator - it's not that hard to just call them and speak with them. <|endoftext|>
Have you tried calling them? <|endoftext|>
Why is that <|endoftext|>
I feel you.. i am always worrying if i have enough time to sleep or not <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a really weird experience, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
I've had that happen to me before. Did you go in the shower? <|endoftext|>
Oh god. Were you nervous? <|endoftext|>
I can totally relate. Thats why I always wear my safety glasses when presenting. I look away and feel more at what is being said. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
Oh that's rough! Were you able to raise her? <|endoftext|>
Whoa nice, how do you like her now <|endoftext|>
I love coffee! What kind did you get? <|endoftext|>
I have been doing that, but nowadays it's impossible to fix things. <|endoftext|>
That's the spirit. Nothing to be worried about <|endoftext|>
That's great, is it a management position or something else? <|endoftext|>
That's incredible, I couldn't imagine being a lawyer/ <|endoftext|>
wow thats sad <|endoftext|>
I have an xTerra! It's an awesome vehicle. Great choice for the money <|endoftext|>
How did you do? <|endoftext|>
All A's?   That's amazing!  Did you study or do you just know the material well? <|endoftext|>
Its always good to just lay around and do nothing! :) <|endoftext|>
You can always go wrong when you eat too much! I had too many last night. <|endoftext|>
Yeah its never too late <|endoftext|>
You shouldn't have any emergencies. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome that you had that view. <|endoftext|>
I am happy for you, we all deserve to go on a vacation someday. <|endoftext|>
That's great!  Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I wish I was financially independent like you... <|endoftext|>
What for <|endoftext|>
You got a car? I am assuming you got a good deal on one. <|endoftext|>
You must be so excited! Where was the work? <|endoftext|>
I can understand that. Who did they invite? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Why not? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a nice relaxing sunday. How does work usually get to you? <|endoftext|>
What did you do to spend the evening? <|endoftext|>
Was that wedding by yourself? <|endoftext|>
That is a blessing! What a relief! I wish I had friends like that <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm not sure what you mean, but I love watching tv.. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I have two wirehaired Japanese spitz spitzes. They're great as dogs <|endoftext|>
Is there any chance she could come back any time soon? <|endoftext|>
Do you have kids or animals? <|endoftext|>
How neat is that? Does he still have your stuff? <|endoftext|>
That's so cool. Did you enjoy the book? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Hopefully she will return soon. It's hard when someone you love isn't around. <|endoftext|>
Yeah that is rough.  If only we could talk every day like that and not worry so much about what's going on between us.  It's like the only thing we have in common. <|endoftext|>
What did you fight about? <|endoftext|>
Wow that's intense!  What happened next? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he better now? <|endoftext|>
well love is a powerful thing <|endoftext|>
I do too <|endoftext|>
Why do you need to wait? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I have one, he is awesome <|endoftext|>
That is great! I hope he is always happy <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That's unfortunate <|endoftext|>
How are you doing today <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Was it from a disease or was it from a natural causes? <|endoftext|>
Did he move away or something? <|endoftext|>
That is sad. Maybe try to get involved in some hobby groups to meet people you like. <|endoftext|>
It really is.  I need to warm up my face to talk to girls.  It's so hard <|endoftext|>
I have always wanted a sports car. What year is it? <|endoftext|>
You and me both my friend. You and me both. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Why are you not able to have a car? <|endoftext|>
what did you want it too? <|endoftext|>
What burned it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened then? <|endoftext|>
That can happen from not paying attention. <|endoftext|>
She sounds like a sweetheart. <|endoftext|>
What is so true? <|endoftext|>
Oh my! Was it an animal? <|endoftext|>
Aw that's unfortunate.  You could always try walking outside - I'm sure you could find an app to help you meet new people and have fun etc <|endoftext|>
That's cool man.  What kind of car? <|endoftext|>
Oh nice! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
Because they never invite you to go places, and they never call you <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's awful.  What did they do? <|endoftext|>
Friends really do have first-love * right? <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
I do hate those movies too <|endoftext|>
Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
Who is in Cuba?  A country, I assume? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's terrible! Why is that? <|endoftext|>
That must be embarrassing. How do you deal with it? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What's the movie about? <|endoftext|>
That's a great movie! Did you see it recently? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a lot of fun, were you by yourself? <|endoftext|>
That's good. It's so nice here today. <|endoftext|>
wow where is that? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a fun trip! How long do you stay for? <|endoftext|>
Well, you can have a piece now! <|endoftext|>
When did this happen? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing. Cancer is such a horrible disease <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
Wow!  That's rough!  Maybe he needs a bath <|endoftext|>
Wow!  That's quite the undertaking!  I wonder how did it go? <|endoftext|>
I always get nervous during those situations.. but you will do fine I am sure of it. Just remember to have a positive attitude about it and everything will work out okay <|endoftext|>
You must feel really confident then, interviews can be very nerve-wracking! <|endoftext|>
Why does it piss you off? <|endoftext|>
That's what I tell myself. Well unless I decide to travel anywhere <|endoftext|>
That happened to me last week.  It's not a good feeling! <|endoftext|>
Sometimes we have to face our fears.. I am glad you faced your fears.. <|endoftext|>
I did until I got sick. Then I just stayed home with the kids. But seriously, it's tough on the kids. <|endoftext|>
No, I am a teacher. It is a very important part of my job. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I am sorry to hear that. Is he doing okay? <|endoftext|>
that's wonderful.  It's so nice to have close family you can talk to and share life with. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
It's cool that you won the door.  Was it pretty important? <|endoftext|>
How is your daughter doing now <|endoftext|>
Sometimes you have to look on the bright side.. You did the right thing <|endoftext|>
That is true...I was sick all week..Drank alot..I hope you feel better tomorrow <|endoftext|>
That is very kind of you. How did the cab driver take it? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that you were able to go back. The beach is awesome but it's a very long drive. <|endoftext|>
It's always a great feeling to be able to go and have a great time.  Sounds great that you had a great time. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope you didn't get hurt! Did you win the fair? <|endoftext|>
I was at the club! <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry!  I hope you find it <|endoftext|>
That's what they tell me <|endoftext|>
Yes, but when thats the case a 4 year old will do something. <|endoftext|>
That's thoughtful. <|endoftext|>
Chewy is my go-to as well. What is your favorite kind of treat? <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad, are you going to get them help? <|endoftext|>
Well, he could go out and meet some new friends!! <|endoftext|>
That is awesome.  That is an accomplishment that most people dont even know about. <|endoftext|>
I mean its not all bad... <|endoftext|>
That sounds great! Was it from someone special? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Were those from your childhood? <|endoftext|>
That's really neat <|endoftext|>
Yes that is horrible!!  That AC needs some love too. <|endoftext|>
OMG I had the same issue. Now if I have enough money to see the horse I can afford a vacation lol. <|endoftext|>
That's great!  What area are you moving to? <|endoftext|>
Yes and more education is also good. <|endoftext|>
Oh I do that too.  What kind of run are you running? <|endoftext|>
I do sports actually. I play baseball and soccer as well. <|endoftext|>
I am happy for you <|endoftext|>
You deserve a thank you from your husband lol <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
What kind of job? <|endoftext|>
So you can do what? <|endoftext|>
Great to have a 4 year old in the mix. <|endoftext|>
Well, that's a relief. You probably have a lot of people that depend on you for your water supply. <|endoftext|>
What happened? Did someone run into their car? <|endoftext|>
That is really good. <|endoftext|>
Oh no.  Did everything go okay? <|endoftext|>
What kind of diet are you on? <|endoftext|>
It takes some to get the hang of it. <|endoftext|>
You should, the pay is not worth it <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is horrible. Have you tried telling him how you feel? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun. How old are they? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great time <|endoftext|>
You must be so proud of her. <|endoftext|>
She must be a very special lady. <|endoftext|>
I bet.  Is it far from your family? <|endoftext|>
10 years is a long time <|endoftext|>
Really? or do you mean on the team? <|endoftext|>
You must play a lot then. <|endoftext|>
That's horrible. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's quite a while. Have you been having trouble? <|endoftext|>
That is sad to hear about. <|endoftext|>
Absolutely, you just never know what life brings back. We are lucky to have had him <|endoftext|>
That must be really hard on your friend. I wish I had your energy and dedication. <|endoftext|>
I bet it's a good looking girl! :) <|endoftext|>
That's so sad! Where did they find it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That's a bummer, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
What did you do with it? <|endoftext|>
That is sad, those are nice though <|endoftext|>
That is amazing! You should be proud and also help him grow! <|endoftext|>
Wow, how long has it been? <|endoftext|>
Yes that is true. <|endoftext|>
That's horrible. I hope you can get a refund. <|endoftext|>
Oh man, you don't know about the good ol'bathroom stinking poolside? <|endoftext|>
I bet the bathroom was, but the roaches didn't want to come clean. <|endoftext|>
That's a really interesting way to frame it! That does sound crazy <|endoftext|>
What a nice Samaritan you are. I hope the doctor can treat your knee. <|endoftext|>
wow.  That is a lot of classes.  Do you know what you re doing now <|endoftext|>
What!!! That's so messed up!!! <|endoftext|>
Haha... yea that is no fun! <|endoftext|>
that is good <|endoftext|>
yes many times <|endoftext|>
That's too bad it didn't happen during dinner. Maybe you can get the manager fired. <|endoftext|>
I love music. What kind of metal was it <|endoftext|>
I have no doubt it was for the best <|endoftext|>
Yes I do. <|endoftext|>
You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event, but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. What is the tummy issue? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad he didn't suffer from cancer <|endoftext|>
Yeah that is how I remember it too. <|endoftext|>
Thats cool <|endoftext|>
Were you guys drinking <|endoftext|>
Thats actually a really good use of your time, where do you go to do that <|endoftext|>
Whats your fav place to drink? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. It's nice that you have something of his that you are very familiar with. <|endoftext|>
Those are the best times. <|endoftext|>
That is true <|endoftext|>
oh lol <|endoftext|>
Why? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean <|endoftext|>
oh wow where is that at? <|endoftext|>
Was that a bad experience? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.   Why did she break up? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I hope it gets better soon. <|endoftext|>
Me too. Were you burned alive? <|endoftext|>
You should go! October is a great time to enjoy the outdoors! <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
What did she do to you? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing. I would love to be able to do that <|endoftext|>
Whoa! That's incredible! I would never be able to afford that! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! I bet it's going to be a lot of fun. <|endoftext|>
wow great!! <|endoftext|>
Oh cool!  Where are you vacationing too?! <|endoftext|>
Yes, that's a wonderful place to go. You should do get to go there if you haven't already. <|endoftext|>
Did you enjoy it? You are not the only one feeling lonely. <|endoftext|>
I understand that for sure... I get sad thinking about my parents sometimes <|endoftext|>
That's so awesome that you were able to get your hands on the material before the test was over! <|endoftext|>
That is always a good feeling when you know you did well <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Why is that? <|endoftext|>
That is unfortunate, how did you get it fixed? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! That's the place or place? <|endoftext|>
That is a lot of places!! I need to learn how to swim!! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  What was the job? <|endoftext|>
It's so good when interviews actually hire and train people. <|endoftext|>
Oh that is rough, how does that make you feel <|endoftext|>
That would be pretty cool if it actually happened. <|endoftext|>
Oh that is too bad, you can still try to get one though. <|endoftext|>
What's wrong with your class? <|endoftext|>
They will and that is all that matters <|endoftext|>
What are your needs? <|endoftext|>
That is a hard- work- however you have to appreciate the education and your family's support when you reach your goals <|endoftext|>
That is good, what is her name? <|endoftext|>
That's what the alcohol is for. <|endoftext|>
Where do you go when you don't have any? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That does not sound good.  Maybe it was food from the grass. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh what? Why is that? <|endoftext|>
That's great. Babies are so fun. My wife and I use to get a lot of tick marks around the neck when we were little. Did you get your sleep on the go? <|endoftext|>
That's nice of them. It's nice when parents care about your interests <|endoftext|>
It's like the first time you take the training wheels off a bicycle <|endoftext|>
That's pretty neat. What did you guys do? <|endoftext|>
That is good, I am sure it will be an amazing experience! <|endoftext|>
Where did she fly? <|endoftext|>
Yes <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
What did you learn from your dad's lessons <|endoftext|>
I would hate to go through that! <|endoftext|>
Is that bad or good? <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful. What is his name? <|endoftext|>
Are you? <|endoftext|>
Are you happy or sad about it? <|endoftext|>
that must have been very fun <|endoftext|>
what did she do? <|endoftext|>
That would be exciting <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome! Congratulatios <|endoftext|>
What is that? <|endoftext|>
wow where was the river <|endoftext|>
What did you do while you were out there? <|endoftext|>
That's amazing, how did it go after that? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Are you doing alright? <|endoftext|>
Did you try to talk to her? <|endoftext|>
Did she come inside? <|endoftext|>
Wow. What happened that fateful night? <|endoftext|>
How did you deal with it? Don't drink and shower unless you know you can trust someone else to clean it up. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
How many people have you got / have you won <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. Do you guys still talk? <|endoftext|>
Who is he touching right now? <|endoftext|>
What happened next? <|endoftext|>
I have always wanted to learn guitar <|endoftext|>
Everyone is scared of what?!?! <|endoftext|>
haha that happened to me today. I really wanted to get off but couldn't. <|endoftext|>
What new house do you have? <|endoftext|>
Wow, where did you learn that? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, he wasn't able to take care of the kids while you were in the work-from-home? <|endoftext|>
Uhnnnnn...that's not a very nice thing to do. Why don't people just leave their kids at home with their parents? <|endoftext|>
ah... so what did they say <|endoftext|>
Thats so nice of him! I hope he gives you a gift for it! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have chronic illness / pain / whiplash etc.? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that.  Why are you stressed <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
Who loves what <|endoftext|>
That's good, what are you studying? <|endoftext|>
What did you do to make it longer <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's a bummer...what did you end up doing? <|endoftext|>
Do you like the job? <|endoftext|>
What was the sketchy part? Was it scary?! <|endoftext|>
Ok I will take your word for it <|endoftext|>
Ouch! I've done that before. It's hard to not take things too personally when there isn't much personal content being expressed. Are you still friends? <|endoftext|>
She is just playing devil's advocate. If you're not going to be around her again, don't even bother replying to her. <|endoftext|>
good <|endoftext|>
ok <|endoftext|>
Oh no!! I hope everything works out okay for you! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! It's nice to not have to worry about money. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope it wasn't too expensive, I am not too lit <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations that is awesome <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah I know what you mean.  But that is life though right? <|endoftext|>
That's not good, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh haha i misread that, sorry! Yeah there is no way I would get fired!! <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean.. people never look when you are busy <|endoftext|>
It is a good thing to have friends <|endoftext|>
wow, thats cool, where do you swim? <|endoftext|>
Nice! I used to swim when I was little. Did you ever do it again? <|endoftext|>
That's nice of you. Was it pasta or meat or what <|endoftext|>
That's great to hear! I am glad that's the case. <|endoftext|>
What is your family doing for you? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. It's nice to have friends who can also help you in times of need. <|endoftext|>
That is a nice surprise <|endoftext|>
What does your social group do to make you feel that way? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's scary! I'm glad you got it out okay <|endoftext|>
lol sounds scary! <|endoftext|>
Dogs are awesome <|endoftext|>
No problem, any time you need someone to help, just hit me up! :) <|endoftext|>
why is that <|endoftext|>
It's great that you got to spend some time with her.  Tell her I said congrats. <|endoftext|>
That happens sometimes, maybe you should talk to him about how much you appreciate him <|endoftext|>
Well, hopefully one day you will get what he has had.  That is just not right. <|endoftext|>
That's so gross. You shouldn't do that when enjoying food. <|endoftext|>
That's good, it stinks when a company won't take responsibility. <|endoftext|>
That sounds exciting! <|endoftext|>
Are you talking about roller coasters in general? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that.  It sucks when those kind people are just trying to get their rocks off. <|endoftext|>
Oh why not? what happened? <|endoftext|>
That is a major problem. <|endoftext|>
As you should be, but that doesn't stop people from saying things you don't like. <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
What happened <|endoftext|>
Which one was it? I've never seen one of those <|endoftext|>
What kind of challenges? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
I know that <|endoftext|>
That's too bad to hear. Why did she leave? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great time. Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
I bet. I haven't been in a thunderstorm in years. It was rough <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate, how come? <|endoftext|>
That's ok, I'm sure you are a great person <|endoftext|>
Food is the best <|endoftext|>
What is great about it? <|endoftext|>
Was it your birthday? <|endoftext|>
That's nice, where did you go <|endoftext|>
what is the reason <|endoftext|>
I am curious as to what the world is going to come to, hopefully good <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That's so sad. Maybe you should go to their homes and see them? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry? <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
OH. What do you do to make money? <|endoftext|>
Oh no.  He thumps his thump and bangs his thump on the door handle, while mumbling "OH MY BELT" <|endoftext|>
Well, that's different... But, yes, you should have done something <|endoftext|>
Oh trust me, trust is the key to everything. It's a tool to help you do something good, not to get you killed. <|endoftext|>
I do like hearing that. Do you have a go-bag for this? <|endoftext|>
Great, it's always nice to have things to look forward to.  When does the exam happen? <|endoftext|>
That's exciting! What kind of career? <|endoftext|>
It must be such a stressful experience, even to go to get a tooth pulled. What happened? <|endoftext|>
I hate that feeling... So you know what I mean... <|endoftext|>
That's cool to hear, what is the job? <|endoftext|>
I am determined <|endoftext|>
Are we still doing the 90's lifestyle <|endoftext|>
That is the best feeling. <|endoftext|>
What happened next? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome. It is always nice to have a car to drive around with. <|endoftext|>
I love my volvo <|endoftext|>
That's incredible!!  How did you get it out? <|endoftext|>
Oh dear. Well that would have been a good idea then haha. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful. What did you get from it <|endoftext|>
Cheese is so expensive where I live. <|endoftext|>
Oops. Yeah, Cabot is from Massachusetts. Must be that good stuff there, huh? <|endoftext|>
That is cool, I hope you find one soon <|endoftext|>
Oh my gosh no!!! I am so sorry to hear that!! What is going on? <|endoftext|>
Ah, so you didn't lose contact then? <|endoftext|>
Rain does crappy things to people <|endoftext|>
Maybe it's time to go outside then? <|endoftext|>
You must miss them, did you do anything special while you were there? <|endoftext|>
what do you do <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a fun day! What was the wine <|endoftext|>
It is never too hot to complain! How about yourself? <|endoftext|>
I do too.  It is getting worse. <|endoftext|>
Me too, that is the problem <|endoftext|>
My father died about 3 years ago. I know that is very hard, but it is normal for people to go through that at some point in life. <|endoftext|>
Man.. I am so sorry. It is hard when anyone close passes on. <|endoftext|>
What's wrong <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What did you think of it <|endoftext|>
what concert is it <|endoftext|>
Who is that? I know dragon but who is the other one <|endoftext|>
That's great! Have you lived here long? <|endoftext|>
I bet it stinks! Do you think you will move back? <|endoftext|>
That is good - is it a private school? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear you're getting back on the horse. Are you a teacher/inker/protective/whatever? <|endoftext|>
Oh well, count your lucky next time <|endoftext|>
I love Virginia Beach! That's a great place to go when visiting too <|endoftext|>
You got a lot going on man!  How old are they / do they like the beach? <|endoftext|>
Wow that is a lot of money, how did you do it? <|endoftext|>
oh yea <|endoftext|>
Nice!  I bet the bonus will help your marriage in some way. <|endoftext|>
what is shock <|endoftext|>
Cool - did you take a tour or something <|endoftext|>
What kind of car was it? <|endoftext|>
I have issues ordering take out from outside as well as having too many plates. It is a pain in the neck. <|endoftext|>
yeah, but like I do, I go with what everyone has to say <|endoftext|>
That sounds difficult. <|endoftext|>
It's friday? Where are you? <|endoftext|>
I am not familiar with this term. Do you mean that you received a large bonus from work, or that you received a large bonus from work? <|endoftext|>
Tell them to f***k off, loser gets reamed <|endoftext|>
Aw, why not? <|endoftext|>
That's a horrible situation!! <|endoftext|>
One time a friend of mine started sweating like crazy in the mirror because he ate too much chocolate.  I had to convince him to stop lol <|endoftext|>
Sounds very scary!  I am glad you are OK! <|endoftext|>
Tell me about it! My sister is an ex marine and I have no idea how they get away with it. <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
It's always nice when you get a gift your self / family wants <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
Does that mean you don't get to visit her during the holidays? <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear. <|endoftext|>
Yeah it's always nice to have someone who can help with whatever is going on in your life. <|endoftext|>
Oh you should have went. I love the beach <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I bet you and your daughter will always be able to visit and remember that. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! That can be really disappointing. Were you disappointed? <|endoftext|>
What does he do for work? <|endoftext|>
That's good, how many pets does he have? <|endoftext|>
It is a good thing that you had choices.  I'm glad you did. <|endoftext|>
Was it a good thing <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
What happened?? <|endoftext|>
Ha ha I bet that was embarrassing. <|endoftext|>
That sounds really nice.  What movie did you see? <|endoftext|>
Well that's good to hear. Are you always a dramasitter <|endoftext|>
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. How is he holding up? <|endoftext|>
Yes,  but you have to believe in the Riley magic. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's ok to forget about the past and be a good friend. <|endoftext|>
That doesn't sound good at all! Did they ever work together? <|endoftext|>
That is interesting.  I have a friend who had an autoimmune disease that they followed a recipe for and it worked so it's not a terrible diet.  What is your issue with the diet? <|endoftext|>
Whew that's a real stalker. Don't be nervous, be brave and speak to someone if you need help. <|endoftext|>
That is frustrating <|endoftext|>
Yeah it is the worst when you know she is going to say yes or no. Especially when it is a friend <|endoftext|>
Awwww man. I know what that is like, and I'm sorry.  I bet you're heartbroken <|endoftext|>
Awww what happened? <|endoftext|>
How much did you win? <|endoftext|>
Why's that? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's a lot of money! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
That is unfortunate. Did you get hurt? <|endoftext|>
That was very mean of your husband. Why were you angry? <|endoftext|>
That is a tough situation. Is she ok now? I am sure he understand <|endoftext|>
That is okay.  What happened there? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah that happened to me as well. We found the mutilated remains of a dead animal. <|endoftext|>
Well that is a pretty big place! Are you having a bad day? <|endoftext|>
That is a good idea.  We don't have a phone either, so I thought it would be easier <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's so nice. What did you eat <|endoftext|>
Was it for work or vacation? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, how do you think you're gonna do? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, good for you!! <|endoftext|>
That sounds cool.  Was it a team game or a kid game? <|endoftext|>
Aw no you should go <|endoftext|>
That is terrifying. Where did it go? <|endoftext|>
Ha!  I'm in Florida.  I always worry about that too, especially during the summer! <|endoftext|>
Thats so sad <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. It is so hard when that happens. <|endoftext|>
That can be tought. <|endoftext|>
That would do it. I bet you can hear them! <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful news! What is the job? <|endoftext|>
That is a really good idea. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, you must be proud <|endoftext|>
Oh no, are you ok? <|endoftext|>
It is, and I'm sorry you are having trouble.  What type of diet are you following? <|endoftext|>
Were you in a vehicle or walking? <|endoftext|>
You should always carry pepper spray.  It is very effective! <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's sad but also kind of a cool thing to know about a TV show you like <|endoftext|>
Cool cool. I am afraid of germs, so never been to a comic convention. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so nice. What show is it? <|endoftext|>
That's just awful, my dear! I think it's time to call up a midwife. <|endoftext|>
Who cares? You'll be alright man trust me. <|endoftext|>
That is a big change! How does that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
Cool!  Did you make any big changes? <|endoftext|>
MY daughter can too now <|endoftext|>
I hope it was ok <|endoftext|>
I know how that feels.  They sound like an awful company to work for, but I hope it all works out for the best! <|endoftext|>
I am glad you took him food!! <|endoftext|>
I love that family activity! Did you feed him? <|endoftext|>
I do hate those <|endoftext|>
Why didn't they believe you? <|endoftext|>
That's amazing!  I thought you guys were having multiple.. or did you find out the hard way? <|endoftext|>
Yes, that is what nature does. Sometimes it is nice to surprise ourselves. <|endoftext|>
Did you go to a haunted house? <|endoftext|>
That's good that people agreed! It's still pretty terrifying though. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry! That really is a bummer though. Were you able to recover? <|endoftext|>
That is always good. Glad nobody was hurt. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, desert was rough for sure. <|endoftext|>
Wow! Did the man actually drive the truck or was it more like, "You got this", "Ok" <|endoftext|>
How did it go <|endoftext|>
Was it a lot of planning? <|endoftext|>
I am not sure what that is, but it sounds like a good movie <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean. I can barely wait for the next Avatar movie to come out. <|endoftext|>
I did that too. Its a good time to look back. <|endoftext|>
lol, if you're willing to go that far... I love seeing old friends too! If only we had social media to keep in shape. <|endoftext|>
I hear you, I am so sorry that happened to you.. <|endoftext|>
What was a good idea? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How did that go? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's embarrassing, maybe someone will let you borrow theirs <|endoftext|>
That is great.  You must be proud <|endoftext|>
Is it an old one or an impala <|endoftext|>
You must be excited!! Where are you going?? <|endoftext|>
That sounds amazing.  That will be incredible!!  Are you a fan of racing or just a fan of the fun? <|endoftext|>
where are you wanting to go <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I've always wanted to go to the casino <|endoftext|>
That is such a cool game, I used to play it all the time when I was young. <|endoftext|>
Well that is a good friend and your boyfriend! I am sorry you were turned away <|endoftext|>
What happened?  Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
It's so nice to have those memories. We always cherish them. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be horrible <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's awesome.  It's nice when you win and just barely cover your purchase <|endoftext|>
You should <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome - you should always give your wife the respect she deserves. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations. I hope it meant a lot to you. <|endoftext|>
I see, how do you like your assignments so far? <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
What does she do that is so wrong / <|endoftext|>
It's nice that your husband and you bought his gifts that year.  It's one of the few times a husband can buy a gift for a wife. <|endoftext|>
I have never had a chrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrchrrchrchrchrchrch <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That must have been a super embarrassing experience.  Did anyone see it? <|endoftext|>
I hope it turned out ok though. Were you flirting with him? <|endoftext|>
I wish I was able to do that. <|endoftext|>
Absolutely, financial freedom is where I go when I need it the most. <|endoftext|>
Oh god, are you ok? <|endoftext|>
What?! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that, that's really rough <|endoftext|>
Why would you want a woman that doesn't love you? <|endoftext|>
That happened to me when I was in senior year of high school. I was terrified. You never really know what some people will do. <|endoftext|>
Oh no do you get a lot of mail? <|endoftext|>
Well done! I bet you got a scholarship too. <|endoftext|>
haha no problem. Were you having a bad day or what <|endoftext|>
Very cool. What were the locations? <|endoftext|>
That is quite a trip!  I love Blackjack! <|endoftext|>
I think that's when you make the decision to tell your mom what happened <|endoftext|>
What did you lie about? <|endoftext|>
That's nice!  I've never won anything <|endoftext|>
I've never been to Florida!  I'm not too fond of it, but I can't imagine being without humidity. <|endoftext|>
Oh cool!   What did you do with it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry - what does that have to do with what I said??? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
What is the problem <|endoftext|>
Oh, no! So sorry to hear that. But glad you are alright! <|endoftext|>
I'm not interested in a car. What would you have to do to get a car worth keeping or what happened <|endoftext|>
That's so lucky! How did he do? <|endoftext|>
You'll need to let go as soon as you can. He's probably your best friend. <|endoftext|>
That is good to hear!  It is important to have healthy relationships <|endoftext|>
No, not really.  But they know how to get to me. It's like they know where I live. <|endoftext|>
Really? What was it <|endoftext|>
Who is it and where is it from? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's what she said <|endoftext|>
Is that a good thing? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Yes, I love that show and the actor who played Darth Vader <|endoftext|>
i love them too <|endoftext|>
Oh no what happened? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it does. Thinking of where we came from can always give you a different perspective. <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it wasn't a long day she was probably happy to see you <|endoftext|>
Oh no! My first child was pretty stressful too and it wa still a toddler. What is making you anxious? <|endoftext|>
We all deserve that trust <|endoftext|>
Why would you ever want to hurt a friend or family member!! <|endoftext|>
Oh really? I only have one teenage daughter. <|endoftext|>
That's when you bring a family from home <|endoftext|>
You must be excited <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, I bet you have a wonderful time <|endoftext|>
Yeah me too, when I was younger. I wish it was every year though. <|endoftext|>
yeah we would need something to keep us busy <|endoftext|>
Stay safe! Is it a tornado? <|endoftext|>
I grew up in the panhandle and had to use a lot of public transportation. <|endoftext|>
What game is it <|endoftext|>
Oh cool. <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! That's great to hear <|endoftext|>
Well that is great, good to have a place where you work <|endoftext|>
It helps you stay organized when you get a bunch of stuff from different places at once. <|endoftext|>
That is where I am too, you just have to get it off or take off, so annoying <|endoftext|>
How did you find out? <|endoftext|>
that is interesting, but why are you staying in a hotel? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that is a big accomplishment! <|endoftext|>
That is cool. diapers are not fun but they do the trick <|endoftext|>
That's what I thought. Until now, I had no idea he was that adorable. <|endoftext|>
she is <|endoftext|>
That's very smart! Is it your first degree? <|endoftext|>
That is a lot of kids. That is a lot of money to disapoint and worry about. <|endoftext|>
That's never a good feeling <|endoftext|>
What is the big one? <|endoftext|>
How old is she / you? <|endoftext|>
Nice. I never saw it. What movie is it? <|endoftext|>
? <|endoftext|>
What happened?  Did they move away? <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. What's wrong? <|endoftext|>
You will be fine if you work hard enough <|endoftext|>
What country is that? <|endoftext|>
What is the disagreement about? <|endoftext|>
Why? Do they not live nearby? <|endoftext|>
It sure is.  Have you ever gone to Alaska? <|endoftext|>
That does sound awful.  I hope it gets better. <|endoftext|>
Well that is a very trusting relationship. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I know that must be tough. I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I always wait till my wife says shaken up <|endoftext|>
Storms happen a lot here too! My power is always off. <|endoftext|>
Who is agree <|endoftext|>
That is a hundred dollar bill? <|endoftext|>
Why is that <|endoftext|>
I hate spiders! I am sorry that happened to you <|endoftext|>
Oh lord. What will you do if you find it? <|endoftext|>
That's always rough, are you a student or what? <|endoftext|>
What are you studying? <|endoftext|>
I hope it goes well. Is it about a family or work occasion? <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate.  Do you have certain pre Asian traits that make it hard to prepare for a speech? <|endoftext|>
How did that work out for you? <|endoftext|>
That's good! <|endoftext|>
Well, trust is the key to a happy marriage. <|endoftext|>
That is the truth, we are not meant to rom a partner. <|endoftext|>
That is so scary!  What happened? <|endoftext|>
Were you at least scared of what happened? <|endoftext|>
Wow.  That seems unnecessary but maybe they had something to do with it?  Were you scared? <|endoftext|>
oh thats good <|endoftext|>
that's cool that you won <|endoftext|>
Yes, those friendships and the permanent family visits can really heal any wounds that one wounds. <|endoftext|>
I do too. I love going with my dad too <|endoftext|>
I have a 1 year old boy. I love seeing him play. He is so sweet! <|endoftext|>
I would have thrown up! <|endoftext|>
Oh my.  Are you a supervisor or just a regular joe-w <|endoftext|>
I hate that happened to you.  I always stop and get a spare battery if it happens again. <|endoftext|>
That's how I keep my cool <|endoftext|>
Same here! Who's your favorite team? <|endoftext|>
What does that mean?  Are you in student-body or something? <|endoftext|>
Did you? What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's rough <|endoftext|>
You know, that sounds like a dream come true for him. <|endoftext|>
it all <|endoftext|>
Thanks for trusting that person. Sometimes companionship is needed. <|endoftext|>
Was this a stranger or friend that was trying to take advantage of you? <|endoftext|>
oh my word! what did you do <|endoftext|>
That's why I only have one dog :(  and even that is hard when you know someone is outside every where <|endoftext|>
that stinks!!  What car is it?  What did you have issues with <|endoftext|>
What do you do with it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I was like that when I was in middle school. We had a football game and I remember doing things to my room. Then I was allowed to leave and go home. <|endoftext|>
wow that is awesome how did you like it? <|endoftext|>
What tools did you have? <|endoftext|>
Lol. Who did ya see playing? <|endoftext|>
They are still touring <|endoftext|>
That's cool, I can never bowl <|endoftext|>
Yup. The bowling alley I go to is far and away the best one. I love it. <|endoftext|>
That is the worst, I bet it smelled even worse on the outside. <|endoftext|>
Oh boy, I bet you are sweating bullets. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a plan! What did you do to make your new phase? <|endoftext|>
What will be good? <|endoftext|>
It's never a mistake if you've learned from it. You'll always have that knowledge when you try again. <|endoftext|>
It's very important to have a positive attitude! <|endoftext|>
That's good! Good grades are always helpful to have <|endoftext|>
It is always important to have a plan B when dealing with kids <|endoftext|>
Its good he paid off his debt though <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, especially when those places go from being a necessity to a backup in case something bad happened. <|endoftext|>
Ha ha, that's ok. We all go through that when we play bowling. Was it a clean break. <|endoftext|>
Well, that is a ball that I have had... I like it as a ball or toy, but what I do like is that it makes you fall and break things, like a football or tennis ball <|endoftext|>
Oh man I love those things! And those are so expensive! What kind of car did he get? <|endoftext|>
I think so too. It is quite interesting and different from what I have been taught <|endoftext|>
That's great! What kind of car did you get? <|endoftext|>
That is very good feeling <|endoftext|>
Nice, what was it about? <|endoftext|>
What was Nelly and 2pac famous for?  Was it a good album or bad? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
I agree, I am praying that they will learn something from this. I have been feeling anxious about this test <|endoftext|>
That's great! Are you always loud? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so nice! Is it locally owned? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did you hurt their feelings? <|endoftext|>
Oh, well there's your mistake then. <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful news. Family is one of the few things that matters in life. <|endoftext|>
Aw yeah.  That's where I am at now. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's fantastic! What do you do at the gym? <|endoftext|>
You will feel better when you do it. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, what do you do? <|endoftext|>
wow thats a huge accomplishment you are having <|endoftext|>
That's cool. You must help him a lot. <|endoftext|>
I remember he used to do that over there too. <|endoftext|>
That is normal though, it is the people upstairs who have issues. <|endoftext|>
I love being shouted at in public like that. <|endoftext|>
You should talk to a counselor <|endoftext|>
Music is a great relaxation tool as well! <|endoftext|>
That is interesting. What did you hear? <|endoftext|>
That is the worst <|endoftext|>
Oh man. Where did ya go? <|endoftext|>
OH wow what did he do?! <|endoftext|>
I love those times. They give you those warm fuzzy feelings and makes you want to go to bed with the lights off. <|endoftext|>
i know what you mean <|endoftext|>
Thats always a good feeling and confidence killer <|endoftext|>
I usually have to go to the store to get them all lol <|endoftext|>
Whoa! That's scary. Are you alright? <|endoftext|>
Haha that's amazing!  That sounds like a scary situation <|endoftext|>
You need to control it in order to have a good life. You are amazing for doing that! <|endoftext|>
I understand. What is making you so unsure? <|endoftext|>
That's cool. What kind? <|endoftext|>
Haha, its funny because I envy you. I don't own a car. <|endoftext|>
I think what you want to do is find a new phone cover and buy that. <|endoftext|>
Aw sorry to hear that. He will be back soon though. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I wish I had a place like that <|endoftext|>
That sounds very exotic. I bet there will be some sweet sounds around too! <|endoftext|>
How did you feel about that <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. Did they take your social security number? <|endoftext|>
thats pretty cool, what do you do for work? <|endoftext|>
It is hard to imagine life without a car. <|endoftext|>
What was the problem with the sawing machine? <|endoftext|>
Thats amazing,  I only have one child but wow it can be very inspiring when your having a healthy baby <|endoftext|>
Yes that is good that you enjoyed yourself. <|endoftext|>
oh what is a face time <|endoftext|>
That is a very good feeling <|endoftext|>
it's always a thankful experience when you can appreciate the things that have gone on in life <|endoftext|>
Awesome.  I'm glad your dog is a good friend.  How long have you had her? <|endoftext|>
I have a dog but she is my little angel. <|endoftext|>
Oh boy, just take it easy. You'll be fine. <|endoftext|>
Because summer is awesome. <|endoftext|>
I'm not either, i'm neutral, i don't judge. People just have different opinons i guess, <|endoftext|>
I understand that feeling <|endoftext|>
That's good. What are you studying? <|endoftext|>
Part time is good, but you need to stay as focused as possible. Do you have a passion for work? <|endoftext|>
Is his first car a mustang? <|endoftext|>
Oh those are nice looking cars!  What does he drive? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What kind of car did you decide on? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah,   What about them do you like? <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary! Did you end up getting into a hit and run? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. It's always good to have company though <|endoftext|>
So what are you doing to enjoy your ÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ <|endoftext|>
had a rough time <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I've been there. It gets better. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  What kind of restaurant was it? <|endoftext|>
OMG!!!  That is awesome!!!  I hope you took your time to cook it.  I am SOANT to have some of that right now!! <|endoftext|>
That's cool I will do that next time <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool.  What's your favorite thing about this store? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Hahaha.  I would have been like woooowwww, what did I do!! What did I do!! <|endoftext|>
Thats the best thing to do honestly to get rid of the bad stuff! <|endoftext|>
What did he do? <|endoftext|>
Oh I am sorry to hear that, it must have taken a lot for you to be so sad. <|endoftext|>
It absolutely is.  That's why I want to move to a better place when I become older. <|endoftext|>
Yes, we do too. Its the root of all problems we have. <|endoftext|>
That's sad to hear. Do you see her often? <|endoftext|>
That's so awesome!  How old were you as a child? <|endoftext|>
Wow that must have been so exciting. I wish I can remember such things. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds fun, so do the beer glasses come with the winnings? <|endoftext|>
What do you mean?  Are you in school or something? <|endoftext|>
Right, so true.  As you get older, it's easier to stay the same or learn new things. <|endoftext|>
Was this in the city? <|endoftext|>
It does. It's the worst feeling when you know you are doing a good job, but are getting no credit for it! <|endoftext|>
Aw how wonderful, that's a wonderful learning experience. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow,  Do you have a warm up routine or do you have to do a lot of talking? <|endoftext|>
Wow that's a large change!! <|endoftext|>
That's right, I'm going to be in Vegas.  I'm guessing that means lots of drinking. <|endoftext|>
that is amazing!!! what did you do with it? <|endoftext|>
I would love to get a cat if i could!! I have one and i love them but i would be scared!! <|endoftext|>
That is so inspiring and loyal! <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, i can't read your mind. I thought you said she quit smoking. I need to learn how to read better. <|endoftext|>
Ive never tried it <|endoftext|>
I've never seen it. I will have to check that out! <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That is horrible. I bet you are crying right now! <|endoftext|>
What happened to the animal? <|endoftext|>
I bet those were very devastating. <|endoftext|>
Was it a sad story about a killer? <|endoftext|>
That is great that you have such friendly friends <|endoftext|>
So what did you do to make it a nice gesture? <|endoftext|>
what kind of orders are you expecting? <|endoftext|>
ah.. what area are you in? <|endoftext|>
Really? Why do you say that? <|endoftext|>
Absolutely, people who mistreat and brutalize animals are so disgusting. <|endoftext|>
Yes, there is a tree outside our house that I grew up around. I moved away when I was in my 20's, so that took a while. Are you in Hawaii or something? I do love Hawaii <|endoftext|>
Indeed. Life is much more complicated when you're putting all your eggs in one basket <|endoftext|>
I've never been into that myself. It's just what I hear on TV...not a lot of common sense <|endoftext|>
That's quite a sum of money to spend on eating out, shame that they underpay you! <|endoftext|>
That is great. I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
Does Texas offer a degree like that where you can work your way up to a full time job? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's good preparation. We don't get those where I live. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
That's great!  My brother and I use fb Messenger all the time.  Is fb still popular? <|endoftext|>
Yes! I get that so much as well <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what is she in the emergency for? <|endoftext|>
My grandmother was an amazing lady.  Her funeral is in a week. <|endoftext|>
That is sad to hear, I am really sorry <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you were able to get help. It must have been very distressing. <|endoftext|>
That is good, I had to leave on vacation once and we were all right back to square one. <|endoftext|>
Oh my! Are you losing your luggage? <|endoftext|>
I used to rush pretty often in college.  It's a very bad feeling <|endoftext|>
Well that's great to hear! I wish I had a good friend like that. <|endoftext|>
I am pretty satisfied with my old age too.  I would say it gives me the chance to grow still <|endoftext|>
What was the name of the station? <|endoftext|>
I still have my copy of that CD-ROM <|endoftext|>
How do you think you did? Did you study hard or what <|endoftext|>
What made you decide to wait? <|endoftext|>
Did you pay any money? <|endoftext|>
I know that's right, but what is the PGA? <|endoftext|>
How long has he been playing? <|endoftext|>
wow thats interesting... how long do you have to teach them? <|endoftext|>
I am in the midwest.  I am not familiar with it but it sounds amazing. <|endoftext|>
haha you are the cool kid who doesn't stick to the norm. <|endoftext|>
Well that's a good motto then! <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean. <|endoftext|>
Oh man that sounds pretty amazing.  You definitely got a steal from this place.  I hope you stay clean! <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. I am sorry for your loss. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that.  I hope it's easy for you to get some rest. <|endoftext|>
Good for you! Being outdoors is actually great for health. <|endoftext|>
Where is he coming from <|endoftext|>
That is awesome. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Wow!  That's incredible!   What are you going to do while she's away? <|endoftext|>
Ohhhh yeah I remember that.  It was fun though I bet she had a blast. <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow!  Where is she going? <|endoftext|>
Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being bad or good, just... having a clean house. <|endoftext|>
How embarassing!  Why did you do that? <|endoftext|>
That is awful.  Does that happen often? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
I hope you got your money back <|endoftext|>
Were they expensive items? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Hopefully it wasn't too embarassing! Were you alone? <|endoftext|>
Oh no,  How are you holding up? <|endoftext|>
A long time is a good time to be having.  Do you have plans for the weekend? <|endoftext|>
I bet it was. That is always rough when you don't know anyone. Especially when you don't have family living with you. <|endoftext|>
Wow that's quite a long time. How did you manage to make enough to afford the rent? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. Do you have any family in nearby areas? <|endoftext|>
I went toCali to visit family. It's a beautiful state <|endoftext|>
Did you have any problems while driving or was it all good? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool. Was it for work or fun? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I bet that was rough. How was she doing? <|endoftext|>
Is she ok now? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I liked that too. <|endoftext|>
Why did you stay home? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  Maybe she will do ok <|endoftext|>
Ah, no good!  Well, I hope it works out for her <|endoftext|>
That's no fun, loss can be good though <|endoftext|>
race relations is tough <|endoftext|>
What has? <|endoftext|>
I am looking forward to that as well. That is amazing <|endoftext|>
That is so sad, I am sorry for the loss <|endoftext|>
Ha you'll have to get new dogs.  Dogs are SO GOOD <|endoftext|>
Aw man, I am sorry to hear that.  I hope he is okay! <|endoftext|>
What did he do to you? <|endoftext|>
What did you do while she was away? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, you sound hopeful. What's going on? <|endoftext|>
It must have been tough for you. It's nice to have supportive parents <|endoftext|>
What was the biggest one? <|endoftext|>
What are you waiting for? <|endoftext|>
Nice, who are you seeing? <|endoftext|>
I understand that, I don't like them either. <|endoftext|>
So why were you scared <|endoftext|>
That's amazing!   Did you have fun <|endoftext|>
How does one expect to walk into an apartment to look <|endoftext|>
Yeah that is annoying.  I know how that goes. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty interesting. <|endoftext|>
Oh god. What happened. <|endoftext|>
Maybe she had a heart attack. Why stop there? <|endoftext|>
ball of hair... i think it's a hair in your food that you eat <|endoftext|>
That is the best part about going back to a hotel!  They are a little more comfortable.  I am a poor college student so stay away from those areas. <|endoftext|>
Whoa, that's horrible! Did you apologize or were you just mad? <|endoftext|>
Oh, sorry about that. I know garlic bread is pretty good, but still... <|endoftext|>
Where did you get that feeling from? <|endoftext|>
What did he give you as a gift? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad. I am so sorry to hear about your neighbor.  Be careful next time. Be with family. <|endoftext|>
That's kind of you to catch him when you're trying to do something nice.  Sounds like you had a good childhood. <|endoftext|>
No I do not unfortunately.  I do have a cat who likes to sit outside when it's raining though. <|endoftext|>
I love her a lot, I can't wait till we get a house. <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so good <|endoftext|>
That is a good way to spend your day. <|endoftext|>
Did he know what questions were even asked? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What is the record time? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a good plan. What do you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that's interesting!  I bet it'll go well! Do you have any family in particular? <|endoftext|>
No problem buddy <|endoftext|>
I love that place! I was there recently with my family and it was so cool. <|endoftext|>
Oh man that sounds like a crazy experience! What was the elevator malfunction? <|endoftext|>
Those are natural though, don't worry about it. <|endoftext|>
Hey music brings people into battle  I do love me some viking though <|endoftext|>
I am not in a car crash but have been hit a few times while driving. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible! I've had to use public transportation ever since I was very young. So sorry you had to go through that. Yes, it is scary, don't worry. It's ok :) <|endoftext|>
Do you think it's related to her job? <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. Its hard when you are losing family. <|endoftext|>
That would be bad <|endoftext|>
Good, we have to learn from our mistakes and never do the same thing again. <|endoftext|>
No I have never and never will unfortunately.  I hope that changes someday for you. <|endoftext|>
That is too bad to even talk about. I hope you find peace and happiness. <|endoftext|>
No I have not.  I think I will get a dog some day though. <|endoftext|>
You must be exhausted as well as stressed <|endoftext|>
You are a good person. <|endoftext|>
oh no what a bummer <|endoftext|>
Oh man....I would have a heart attack!!! <|endoftext|>
What did you confess to? <|endoftext|>
What are you struggling with? <|endoftext|>
OH no! I am so sorry that happened to you! Is it fixable? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's really nice of her! You should give it to her as a thank you. <|endoftext|>
Thats cool <|endoftext|>
Wow! Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
Awesome, what did you do on your trip? <|endoftext|>
We did. We had to do it this time. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes those things happen. Hopefully you have someone to call to bail you out. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Did you ask them why they didn't allow you to go? <|endoftext|>
How old was he? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is incredible! He is one of the best singers <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's always strange dealing with those situations. Were you in one of those meetings where they talked about something magical happening or was it more along the lines of what's your area-worker's name/tags/ etc? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awful. What happened next? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! <|endoftext|>
Has it ever stopped them before <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
I'll bet it does.  I'm glad it's getting better. <|endoftext|>
Wow. You are like that guy who places all his bets on underwear. <|endoftext|>
I know! I didn't learn until I was 20 or 21 <|endoftext|>
I think those are scams. <|endoftext|>
OH man, I just had a bag of those last week - my kids must have gone to the store while I was at work. <|endoftext|>
How do you think you did? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, glad to hear it! <|endoftext|>
What problem are you having <|endoftext|>
We need to find that person. <|endoftext|>
Is she a good girl? <|endoftext|>
Oh what is the job? <|endoftext|>
Oh I know, was is this your first Christmas? <|endoftext|>
What is your favourite time of the year? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you didn't will anything. That would have been a lot of money <|endoftext|>
That's awful! Are you ok? That's terrible! hahaha <|endoftext|>
Really? <|endoftext|>
Was it a long time ago - or did something happen? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, how do you feel about it? <|endoftext|>
How come it would feel bad? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty exciting. Do you have a rough idea what the client might want? <|endoftext|>
Why do you think that is? <|endoftext|>
That is crazy <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should take up a relationship <|endoftext|>
Good for you!  That's a long time to go.  Do you have a job lined up? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What happened? <|endoftext|>
What do you do when you get caught? <|endoftext|>
Wow that is so nice of you!! You are very lucky!! <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Maybe one day you will get to go to a beautiful city like Seattle. <|endoftext|>
Oh that sucks. Do you still have your buddy? <|endoftext|>
Oh okay, do you like her? <|endoftext|>
What is she doing that is making you kick her out? <|endoftext|>
Who's Ring? <|endoftext|>
That sucks, I know what you mean <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that sounds horrible.  Were you able to get it all cleaned up? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad she didn't scold you. <|endoftext|>
Haha well it worked. Is that your favorite kind of candy? <|endoftext|>
oh my god!  Did he come in your house?! <|endoftext|>
Who is this guy?  I hope it wasn't a stranger/date?! <|endoftext|>
I used to do that with alcohol, not sure if it's still a thing. <|endoftext|>
I wish i could do that, I am too lazy <|endoftext|>
hahaha. <|endoftext|>
I  can't wait to  go to the  ocean <|endoftext|>
That is a perfect way to describe it. I love when life just hits you with a good time. <|endoftext|>
That sounds incredible, is that your normal city area? <|endoftext|>
oh my thats bad!! <|endoftext|>
why is that <|endoftext|>
I agree with you, but it is so convenient at this point that it's hard to turn it down <|endoftext|>
Ugh that's the worst! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's neat, what kind of arcade did you build? <|endoftext|>
That's neat. I built a computer also. What was your favorite part <|endoftext|>
I wish I could get a toothache. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That's awful.  I hate when that happens <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, what did you buy? <|endoftext|>
What a hustler! <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. Did she hurt herself? <|endoftext|>
That was very nice of you, what kind of ice cream was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! How long did it take? <|endoftext|>
Those things are pretty cool though <|endoftext|>
What kind of weights? <|endoftext|>
what do you mean? do you have a powerpoint on how much energy you could have stored if you wanted to? <|endoftext|>
That's true <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened to make you want to chat in a chatroom? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  What did you win? <|endoftext|>
oh wow.. where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Oh cool, was it a play that you were familiar with? I know those are fun though, so you were curious to go. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. So where did you go when you read it? <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's great! <|endoftext|>
She's a girl for those who love their exotic pets. <|endoftext|>
How was it <|endoftext|>
yeah. Those were the good old days. <|endoftext|>
Fido is a cute name, what kind of puppy is it? <|endoftext|>
That's interesting, what do they do to help take care of it? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad the goose doesn't have a better steed. <|endoftext|>
Did you do it on purpose? <|endoftext|>
Wow, thats crazy. Did it do any damage? <|endoftext|>
That is no good.  I hope your alright? <|endoftext|>
what was it <|endoftext|>
that must be so scary <|endoftext|>
Do you still have the job interview? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that... what was it about? <|endoftext|>
That is always smells <|endoftext|>
That is disgusting <|endoftext|>
oh no sorry to hear that. are you ok? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I hit a car when I was crossing the street and it left me red faced. <|endoftext|>
Is this for work or for fun? <|endoftext|>
Oh, so it's more like the battle of the rings <|endoftext|>
Weird.  Did you do the thing that let's you do that? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I hope it didn't close all of a sudden. <|endoftext|>
that's good news.   What is your future endeavor comprised of <|endoftext|>
That's okay. If there's one thing you can learn from studying is that you can put together an answer! <|endoftext|>
That's really cool.  Did you spend a lot of time with them? <|endoftext|>
I agree. It is like we are looking back to yesterday <|endoftext|>
That's cool. Did you have a good time? <|endoftext|>
Nice, I like the Rockies too. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Thank you so much, that means a lot to me. <|endoftext|>
Was that the car hitting you or the other driver? <|endoftext|>
Oh, then you are in no trouble at all. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, good for you <|endoftext|>
Well that's certainly Chevrolet's fault then. Chevrolet makes great cars. <|endoftext|>
I always find those tests tiring. What is the GRE? <|endoftext|>
Whoa! Congrats! That's awesome!! I hope you enjoyed that degree. <|endoftext|>
Did you do well then? <|endoftext|>
Was it with friends or family? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hope nobody stole it.  That is a terrible thing to happen when buying tickets online. <|endoftext|>
I don't know where those things are but they are always on my list of things to do when I have a vacation coming up! <|endoftext|>
I agree. I always try to give as much as I can to people. <|endoftext|>
That is incredible if true, but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast! <|endoftext|>
Nice! What did she do to deserve that kind of reaction <|endoftext|>
Wow thats impressive <|endoftext|>
What do you do for work? <|endoftext|>
Well, here's to hoping you get a break soon.  It's rough work with kids and all that stuff.  Keep hustling! <|endoftext|>
That is so cool. I wish i was that smart. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That is great!  You should contact your internship agent and let them know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
I hear you.. does the city have trash collection services you could send that would cover the cost? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, how do you deal with the noise? <|endoftext|>
What was the conventional dish? <|endoftext|>
OH man, that sucks <|endoftext|>
How do you think they will go? <|endoftext|>
Well, I am so happy for her and hope things go well for her. <|endoftext|>
well that is what marriage is for.. trust and all that good stuff.. <|endoftext|>
Well that's a good way to tell her what happened. Hopefully he doesn't hurt you. <|endoftext|>
lol it's ok - there are SO many other people it could go either way with <|endoftext|>
I know. It's frustrating when you have things like that happen, and you just don't see it coming. <|endoftext|>
What system do you play on? <|endoftext|>
For you <|endoftext|>
I've only been to one bar in America.  I love craft beer too! <|endoftext|>
that is great news!! <|endoftext|>
Oh that's okay, you can have the other guys buddy- Look at my gorgeous girl who works nights shift at the grocery store. She's the only one who understands me. <|endoftext|>
She pays attention to you?! She knows you care about her <|endoftext|>
That is sad. Bourdain is one of the best alive. I love the show he is on. Parts Unknown. <|endoftext|>
That's so great! It's always good to see people reaching their goals. What kind of passion was it? <|endoftext|>
That was thoughtful and lovely of them! <|endoftext|>
What was it about? <|endoftext|>
Oh, thats so nice of you!! <|endoftext|>
It is, i have never been but i will go soon. <|endoftext|>
Where did she go? <|endoftext|>
That's neat, did she make an entrance exam for that class? <|endoftext|>
lol.  What are you going to do now? <|endoftext|>
You must have prepared well for this upcoming meeting then. <|endoftext|>
Outsights always stink <|endoftext|>
Really? I hate it when that happens <|endoftext|>
did they catch it? <|endoftext|>
The cops actually did come to my door. They said it was my brother playing video games when they should be talking to someone else. I was like, what did I do? Then I realized what I was doing was blowing hot air into the air. <|endoftext|>
Cool what does he do? <|endoftext|>
Doesn't he want to move? <|endoftext|>
Good for you! I wish I could do that for a change <|endoftext|>
What soup is it? <|endoftext|>
That's not too bad.  You must have prepared well. <|endoftext|>
bug them to whom?? <|endoftext|>
That's cool <|endoftext|>
Good - do you love all those places? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Is it a sports bar or is it a restaurant or what? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  What are you going to do while she's away? <|endoftext|>
Yes it will be.. I hope it's a happy and caring relationship <|endoftext|>
That's no good, how did you like the work? <|endoftext|>
I have had a lot of issues with those that have given up on me too. I hope it works out for you. <|endoftext|>
where has she been? <|endoftext|>
It is but you have to love those dogs and let them know who is boss. <|endoftext|>
I can understand your feelings. Did you get it? <|endoftext|>
Oh how interesting! What do you do there? <|endoftext|>
That would be annoying.       Did he get the good stuff? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should have checked your privilege before messaging me. <|endoftext|>
I hear you.. that's no fun <|endoftext|>
Oh what does she do <|endoftext|>
Aww I bet you were scared! Was it an adult? <|endoftext|>
What did he do? <|endoftext|>
Yeah? That's got to be rough...not to mention the bites... <|endoftext|>
Where do you live? I live in FL and have never been out of the country. <|endoftext|>
That's cool. What kind of spider? <|endoftext|>
Sure is.  And they are usually so much bigger than you <|endoftext|>
Skydiving is pretty amazing. Are you doing it yourself? <|endoftext|>
What kind of extreme stuff do you do? <|endoftext|>
What happened?! <|endoftext|>
I know right!  It always tastes better when there are none left to eat!! <|endoftext|>
What is your doctor's name/ preferred numeral form? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Wow thats great! I went by myself once. <|endoftext|>
She is a very caring person. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I was using one at work and I dropped it which sucked <|endoftext|>
Ah, that's too bad. I know how you feel though, just never hear about it. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that, I am sure he is in a better place <|endoftext|>
That is terrible, I am so sorry. <|endoftext|>
Why is that <|endoftext|>
Oh? What beach? <|endoftext|>
That will be so fun, I'm sure! <|endoftext|>
My is a 2005 Honda Accord. I love driving that car. <|endoftext|>
Wow. Is everything alright? When will she be back? <|endoftext|>
Dogs are the best <|endoftext|>
Oh yea, I have been for a few years now. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow.  Was it big?  That spider must have been huge - like a foot long!! <|endoftext|>
That is awesome that you have that kind of confidence. <|endoftext|>
What game are you talking about? <|endoftext|>
I know the feeling.  It is really rough when you have to worry about support <|endoftext|>
That's the attitude.  We got this <|endoftext|>
That's great.  I am from India, I've never been to India.  How does that place hold up? <|endoftext|>
Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
That's always great when your neighbors are good and helpful. I wish mine was like that :) <|endoftext|>
Yeah that's no fun... brushing your teeth is the only time i'm ever awake. lol <|endoftext|>
That is never a good feeling, but when it is you know it is over. <|endoftext|>
good luck with that <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Did you work indoors? <|endoftext|>
That would be no fun! Were you just drunk? <|endoftext|>
That sounds very sad and the lines are always long. <|endoftext|>
I love the smell of BBQ and Chinese food in the morning. <|endoftext|>
Why did it take so long? <|endoftext|>
Ah ok. When is your first college game? <|endoftext|>
Did you not go to school last week? <|endoftext|>
Yes it does, so do i.. it gives me the chills when i think about it <|endoftext|>
what happened the day before? <|endoftext|>
I have never seen a turn out that happy! <|endoftext|>
My neighbor is terrible with dogs. <|endoftext|>
Did you ever do any research on him before making your decision? <|endoftext|>
Awesome, that is great news. <|endoftext|>
That is so good for you and his work!! <|endoftext|>
Did it spill on the floor? <|endoftext|>
Wow... I don't blame you. People who are monsters should know better. They will find ways around it I'm sure <|endoftext|>
Cool, what did you order? <|endoftext|>
What was it made of? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine that was rough. Was it something that was constant? <|endoftext|>
Very wise words from you. I am saved by God but I am always willing to sacrifice for the Lord. <|endoftext|>
That's good you have a lot of stuff you can carry. That's what life is supposed to be about, hahaha. I'll keep you in my thoughts. <|endoftext|>
Wow, you got a good looking guy on there. I am not surprised <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I'm sorry.  I've lost many over the years too so I understand your pain. <|endoftext|>
What happened to you <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, are you going to have any fun times together or does he have to work? <|endoftext|>
He can come visit you when he wants? <|endoftext|>
That is really sad, do you live with yourself now? <|endoftext|>
What was the issue that made it so hard? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you found her. Were you scared she was gone? <|endoftext|>
That is awful.. <|endoftext|>
I hear you! I was injured too and never played again <|endoftext|>
Thank you. I had to walk a long way to work today. <|endoftext|>
I agree, but I have always wanted to do it. <|endoftext|>
that's awesome!  Congregation was the best <|endoftext|>
That is awesome.  What kind of tv did you get? <|endoftext|>
Which ones are you favorites? <|endoftext|>
Omg.  I have heard of those things that gather on you when you sleep.  I hate those things. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible!  What did he say? <|endoftext|>
You will be fine. Just be yourself!! <|endoftext|>
I wish you the best of luck! <|endoftext|>
That's great.  I'm not really a big fan of those types of dreams. <|endoftext|>
Oh no.  I am sorry to hear that.  Were they friends from high school? <|endoftext|>
Oh cool, what did she say? <|endoftext|>
That is really awesome.  What did you get her for her to bring over? <|endoftext|>
Are you going to spoil him? <|endoftext|>
That's crazy! I saved up for a couple of those dresses. I always want to buy from a store when it's on sale. <|endoftext|>
How much is needed? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you have a stroke while you were eating them? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I know. I wish I could have stopped it - but I couldn't. <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that, it's awful when something bad happens to someone you love! Have you tried praying or going to the doctor? <|endoftext|>
That is good, I wish you all the best buddy <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great time.  I am still in the early stages of joining a crew.  I am still trying to learn how to do it on my own. <|endoftext|>
I understand that.  It is always nice to see old friends <|endoftext|>
Nice! I am not golf fan but have heard good things. How is the playing? <|endoftext|>
it is boring. i used to play when i was young, but recently i've been doing it professionally. you should try it if you haven't before <|endoftext|>
OH no.  Why didn't she cry when daddy fat called her? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you worked it out. What did she do? <|endoftext|>
Were they your pets or what <|endoftext|>
That is disgusting <|endoftext|>
Yeah it breaks my heart too <|endoftext|>
Yes!!! You say that <|endoftext|>
What was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds scary! <|endoftext|>
That's great!  What for?  Does he know that you're a good friend? <|endoftext|>
What was the bind? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that sounds scary! How did it go? <|endoftext|>
that's awesome! I love when they set the mood like that <|endoftext|>
I have not seen one fly, that is very cool though <|endoftext|>
Yeah you got a source for that? <|endoftext|>
That's rough man. It's the worst when people are that nosy. <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I know, I have lost many.  It's always sad <|endoftext|>
Who is acting strange? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Is he okay? <|endoftext|>
Oh, they sound like good people. <|endoftext|>
That sucks, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
That sounds so frustrating and expensive! What kind of trucking company is it that is covering your truck? <|endoftext|>
I think I need to do that too. <|endoftext|>
Oh my! I am so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
What do you do? <|endoftext|>
You're very welsome <|endoftext|>
What coaster did you get on? <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I am content with my home life <|endoftext|>
Yeah that's true.. I wish we had a time machine <|endoftext|>
It  sucks so bad to lose a pet but what's worse is you don't get to keep your pet <|endoftext|>
That's really inspiring!  What did he or she do to deserve that? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, how did it go? Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
What was the thing that was the complete opposite of what you wanted? <|endoftext|>
That's a shame - so many girls go to school these days <|endoftext|>
Oh cool, why is that? <|endoftext|>
it's been a long time since  that has happened to you.  You must have felt pretty spooked <|endoftext|>
What is your address? <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of it. Is it good? <|endoftext|>
What happened? What happened near your car that had to do with being rear ended? <|endoftext|>
Did you find what is the issue? <|endoftext|>
Oh yea? I can imagine <|endoftext|>
Did you have fun with the cake? <|endoftext|>
Yes. I try not to eat them because I know what I am getting <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it went okay. Were you okay? <|endoftext|>
Oh that is sad.. I have had that happen too.. i cry every time <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's terrible, hopefully your dog is okay <|endoftext|>
What did you find him doing? <|endoftext|>
It's really rough when that happens.  Were you just never meant to see them again? <|endoftext|>
Well you tried your best, that's all that matters <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that's super nice! I don't know anyone who would do that for me. <|endoftext|>
You never know... unless you're there sitting or taking care of them. <|endoftext|>
Nice.  What does he major in? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I wish he could go back to do what he loves doing. What does he love? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Hey you just gotta hold your head high buddy. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Was it coffee or soup?  That is what happens when you don't tip your waitress :( <|endoftext|>
Why is that <|endoftext|>
oh my <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  Maybe turn the tv off and go do something else. <|endoftext|>
I do hate that too. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow.  What happened? <|endoftext|>
Me too, are you doing it for the first time or do you have a plan B? <|endoftext|>
That's always a great feeling! <|endoftext|>
I like saving money too <|endoftext|>
That is so wonderful! I wish you the best and am sure it will. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow.  I'm glad that you're excited.  What subject do you teach? <|endoftext|>
that is so sad <|endoftext|>
that's such a shame! i'm really sorry about that <|endoftext|>
Which one do you use?  Any issues with transferring credit or just not being able to get approved for new cards? <|endoftext|>
That really sucks. I hope everything works out for you. <|endoftext|>
Cool!!! <|endoftext|>
She's an accountant, hmmm... does she have a PHD? <|endoftext|>
Wow that's awesome of your friend!  It's always nice when your friends help you as much as possible. <|endoftext|>
Aww that was nice of you man. <|endoftext|>
You're good preparation will do that.  If he doesn't you'll miss him.. <|endoftext|>
oh that stinks! but i hope it works out for you <|endoftext|>
You will always have to find that control freak.  If it's not there, who will? <|endoftext|>
What does he do? <|endoftext|>
oh cool, those were the good old days! <|endoftext|>
I remember those days, too. What game did you play? <|endoftext|>
That's got to be rough... I am so sorry.. I wish I had a B- to make studying easier <|endoftext|>
How did that make you feel <|endoftext|>
I am glad. That is a lot of cooking <|endoftext|>
My daughter is also the only one who plays video games as a kid. How does that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
Yes!  The worst part is that we have a habit of leaving food magazines with the kids at home.  I didn't make it to the store without having to go with the kid.  My sister would always bring it to me. <|endoftext|>
I bet it was! I would have been super stressed about work. I really hate the morning head and their energy drinks! <|endoftext|>
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>
Oh that is interesting. How did you find out what it was? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry, I hate to hear that. <|endoftext|>
wow good for you, you should be proud of yourself <|endoftext|>
Where were you when you noticed your happiness / <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah what makes you happy? <|endoftext|>
That can be really aggravating. Did you go to the doctor to get checked out? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that sucks, yeah.. nasty <|endoftext|>
Why did you eat it then? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  I can't imagine how difficult that would be for you. <|endoftext|>
Wow thats terrible. She was not very good at all. <|endoftext|>
Awww :(  I've been there. <|endoftext|>
What was the problem that you had? <|endoftext|>
A what on the sidewalk? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry about what happened but I'm glad you attacked it <|endoftext|>
Yeah i know what you mean.  The first time you do a test though.. is the worst. <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you'll do well <|endoftext|>
That is unfortunate. I am sorry about what happened <|endoftext|>
Oh okay. I'm sorry to hear that. What were you breaking up over? <|endoftext|>
Yes, they do have to always be on the lookout for the danger. <|endoftext|>
hahaha nice. I bet that was embarrassing <|endoftext|>
Yeah, that is terrible. But we're talking about peace of mind, right? <|endoftext|>
No he didn't. He was just acting a little childish. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible, did you try calling your local or online? <|endoftext|>
I dont blame you, I am terrified of ghosts <|endoftext|>
Wow where did she learn such fine techniques!! <|endoftext|>
I tried to find something similar to where I live. I even tried to google anime girls but found nothing. <|endoftext|>
Thank you for your service! What is her name? <|endoftext|>
Is the lease still on your home or did you sell it <|endoftext|>
Oh, sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I see.  That's a good thing.  You don't want to deal with a difficult time, you want to be under control.  So, do you have a doctor's appointment to see? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is pretty scary! <|endoftext|>
wow what a brave person you are!! <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That's no good! <|endoftext|>
Must've been taking care of business when you guys were neck and neck <|endoftext|>
Oh wow.  I'm so sorry.  How are you doing? <|endoftext|>
You can always have kids. It's hard work, but totally doable. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  Was it pokemon go or something else? <|endoftext|>
That game was the best one as a kid <|endoftext|>
Oh, were you nervous about it? <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
That is frustrating, i'm type 1 and i'm so happy that it's finally fixed <|endoftext|>
Well he could be thinking that you are saving money or something. <|endoftext|>
That stinks... did you not enjoy it? <|endoftext|>
I saw that movie when I was a kid. I was super scared! <|endoftext|>
Did he get a tummy ache? <|endoftext|>
That is the best part about having a dog, he will do whatever you tell him too <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh yea? When do they start? <|endoftext|>
That's hilarious! <|endoftext|>
I just knew it was coming <|endoftext|>
Oh, no.  Are you alright? <|endoftext|>
it is tough <|endoftext|>
That's the way to do it buddy..don't listen to family. <|endoftext|>
Why was it the least thing you could do? <|endoftext|>
thats great! that is what happens when you teach kids <|endoftext|>
That is a rough period in life for sure <|endoftext|>
Wow I had no idea! That is amazing. <|endoftext|>
That's cool <|endoftext|>
I mean that is a lot of dogs, not a whole lot of calories lol <|endoftext|>
I am afraid to challenge you. I am too chicken to even try. Thank you very much. I will keep a look out for it <|endoftext|>
Oh that sucks.  Is it better now? <|endoftext|>
Good, nothing to worry about then. <|endoftext|>
You better cherish that photo. That's one that means a lot to you. <|endoftext|>
Was this a very long time ago? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it didn't get everywhere. Was she able to clean it up? <|endoftext|>
Why do you have to clean up a bad dog? <|endoftext|>
wow <|endoftext|>
Ha ha, I've done worse.  Have you ever won a cash prize? <|endoftext|>
That stinks. Maybe you'll get asked back? <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate.  I'm a pretty loyal person and don't mind people asking me questions, but don't blame you if he doesn't like you <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. How old was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no I am sorry.  What happened <|endoftext|>
Oh that's sad. How long were you together <|endoftext|>
That's a shame. You have a lot to learn about life before trying to make a permanent change. <|endoftext|>
what kind was it? <|endoftext|>
I LOVE apple sauce!  What is it that you did to it> <|endoftext|>
How did you like the new yeezys? <|endoftext|>
Well I love Yeezys. But these were a special kind made for hipster millennials. They only wear them at Walmart not at a club. <|endoftext|>
What do you do to make the fire? <|endoftext|>
Oh man I forgot about that part. What was the name of the band? <|endoftext|>
That's no fun! I love being alone. Hope it gets better soon <|endoftext|>
thats always good <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Really? Like what kind <|endoftext|>
Why did you do that? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, because they're the only ones that have a sensor on your phone to track you. <|endoftext|>
I know how you feel, I have issues with money too sometimes. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible.  What did you do to fix it? <|endoftext|>
Ah thats a long time. You must have felt loved. <|endoftext|>
Oh cool, which ones did you play? <|endoftext|>
Did something wrong? <|endoftext|>
Good. Do you have any medical problems that would make you want to switch? <|endoftext|>
Wow I would be worried too. <|endoftext|>
I am not worried at all. <|endoftext|>
you got this homie <|endoftext|>
Well you are very fortunate <|endoftext|>
Awesome.  I'm sure it came in handy for your poor, unfortunate roommate! <|endoftext|>
You could always go outside and try and eat sushi <|endoftext|>
Well done, that's an accomplishment! <|endoftext|>
Maybe you have!  No - LOL - I have never had a child so I can't help you - but it sounds like she has a great mom. <|endoftext|>
It will be nice <|endoftext|>
They are being loud and inconsiderate. <|endoftext|>
LOL!! lol that is awesome, i just sold my house a few months ago, moved and bought a tiny house!! <|endoftext|>
It is nice to have that <|endoftext|>
Only when I need to see the past. <|endoftext|>
yeah but that can change at any time <|endoftext|>
Yes, those were the days!  What was your favorite part about them? <|endoftext|>
They are always with us when we are traveling <|endoftext|>
That's great, when you have people like that it's hard to know when to stop being mean <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear that he is good at doing things for others. <|endoftext|>
That's what I use to say about my ex-girlfriend. I miss her too <|endoftext|>
I would consider moving there if I ever had the opportunity. Do you have any family in that area? <|endoftext|>
I feel like this is a good life situation. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I love to read as well. Its been awhile since I read a novel. <|endoftext|>
what did you see? <|endoftext|>
That's terrifying!   Why is it so quiet and ugly? <|endoftext|>
Yeah - the people are always leaving trash everywhere and no clean clothes allowed! <|endoftext|>
Where did you grew up? <|endoftext|>
That is what my wife does as well. She has a very good boy. <|endoftext|>
Why do you love him so much? <|endoftext|>
Wow that's a good surprise <|endoftext|>
What did you do <|endoftext|>
yeah i know what you mean <|endoftext|>
That's really cool of you. I wish I could find some local charities like that. <|endoftext|>
Nice.  I love those things <|endoftext|>
What was the prize? <|endoftext|>
Saving it is always a good outcome. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool of you.  What kind of potato was it? <|endoftext|>
Any idea what it was that you were doing to feel that connection? <|endoftext|>
I hate that! <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
What was the prize <|endoftext|>
That is a great gift card. Did you get any cool stuff for it? <|endoftext|>
That's cool. What kind did you go with? <|endoftext|>
What were you going to get? <|endoftext|>
That is a big step though right? I can only imagine. <|endoftext|>
What happened <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! I've only been to my home country once. What do you like the most about it? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, what is wrong with your parents? <|endoftext|>
You are very lucky to have such parents <|endoftext|>
I know right. Even if you are only a temporarily tenant. You can always come back to that place. <|endoftext|>
Very nice <|endoftext|>
Dogs do that! <|endoftext|>
Heh... thats where I lost my toys.   It was really embarrassing. <|endoftext|>
What does she do? <|endoftext|>
That's a very nice thing to do. <|endoftext|>
I bet you will! I'm a huge nerd. <|endoftext|>
Ah okay..  How do you like it so far? <|endoftext|>
i bet so, skydiving is a thrill that cannot be denied <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! Is this your first time? <|endoftext|>
That's fantastic, you must have worked hard to get there. Do you have a doctor's appointment to check on your progress? <|endoftext|>
No problem my friend <|endoftext|>
Oh no!! that must have been very scary for you <|endoftext|>
Maybe you should get a new car <|endoftext|>
What kind of bet are you taking? <|endoftext|>
Oh cool! Which one are you going to get? <|endoftext|>
Oh my god. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
What did it bark at? <|endoftext|>
What do you mean <|endoftext|>
You know what they say, don't know what it is, hit the SAP button or something. <|endoftext|>
Well that's no good. What kind of cake was it? <|endoftext|>
What was? <|endoftext|>
That is a blessing <|endoftext|>
Is it like a gym or what <|endoftext|>
Horror movies terrify me. <|endoftext|>
What was the first Purge?  Did you do something bad? <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome. <|endoftext|>
We don't have a ton of those where I live. I have to drive an hour to one to get decent groceries. <|endoftext|>
That is so gross! I never do that...it's like they think your mouth is too clean <|endoftext|>
Food is always so messy where I live. My kids and I ruined it <|endoftext|>
Is there a specific reason? I just found out my daughter had a case of retained PHD who reads books at a university <|endoftext|>
Do they?  It's usually just covered in trash or thrown away.  I'm talking about the ones in your own home not the ones with kids. <|endoftext|>
I do too. How do you deal with it? <|endoftext|>
Yeah it sucks, some people just dont care about others <|endoftext|>
I know what that is, but what is the story behind it? <|endoftext|>
I understand.  It is terrible when people take things so serious <|endoftext|>
What kind of restaurant is it? <|endoftext|>
I understand that.  I think its important to try new foods <|endoftext|>
Oh, that is great - what is the name of the store? <|endoftext|>
What does she do for work? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, have you been practicing a lot?  Do you feel confident you shot on target (or did you not) <|endoftext|>
Oh wow how does that work?? <|endoftext|>
Oh I do that too. I always tune into the AM station <|endoftext|>
That is crazy <|endoftext|>
Because we're living in a shitty society. If you don't like someone there just hit them where it's natural to. It's how you get better not the other way around <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I am sorry that happened to you <|endoftext|>
That is right, everything happens for a reason. <|endoftext|>
how many people are you going with? <|endoftext|>
lol <|endoftext|>
Whoa. Congrats. That is a very exciting time to be in a place. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! You will enjoy it much more then <|endoftext|>
No. I work from home. It's a wonderful place- but I wish I was in a office lol <|endoftext|>
Oh my! That's a TRAP! <|endoftext|>
That sounds pretty painful <|endoftext|>
Awesome! where are you taking a long drive? <|endoftext|>
That's funny! <|endoftext|>
What computer did you get? I love computers, did you get a good deal? <|endoftext|>
I love those! They are reliable and cost a lot <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What kind of groceries do you get delivered to? <|endoftext|>
yes it does i have a disability too, poor person's grocery shopping <|endoftext|>
What is the name of the book? <|endoftext|>
You won't believe how often I get asked where my people are <|endoftext|>
That is cool how did you get to ten <|endoftext|>
What did he do? <|endoftext|>
I like the park too <|endoftext|>
Oh man thats rough! Did it hurt? <|endoftext|>
Did you cry? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, do we win or lose? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty scary <|endoftext|>
Oh goodness no! I hate skunks! That's a pretty serious issue. Was it in a store or grocery store? <|endoftext|>
How did that go? Did you like it? <|endoftext|>
I love all over Asia too. What about you? <|endoftext|>
lol that's wonderful!!! <|endoftext|>
What do you mean by wonder? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What was the comment that made you think that? <|endoftext|>
How did that go? <|endoftext|>
I have hiked that before too <|endoftext|>
oh no <|endoftext|>
Yeah, slamming things is never cool. Are you doing alright? <|endoftext|>
Oh no :( I am so sorry :( <|endoftext|>
That's a shame - what's wrong with her? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, how long did it take? <|endoftext|>
I heard that's hard <|endoftext|>
where to <|endoftext|>
California is beautiful. Have you been to Texas? <|endoftext|>
Why would you do such a thing?!?! I mean, it is perfectly legal to do so right? If it's a citizen..oh no. If it's a dealer..that is no problem....but if it's a dealer- tagged trash can..well.. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm not doing it any more. It's too easy. <|endoftext|>
I understand where you are coming from.  I've heard that isolated areas have higher rates of depression.  You should try to be as social as you can <|endoftext|>
What kind of animals do they visit? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, i would start using those cards again <|endoftext|>
Oh cool - what cards did you get? <|endoftext|>
That sucks. Why is that? <|endoftext|>
I've always wanted to go to a place like that with my kitts <|endoftext|>
What kind of job do you want? <|endoftext|>
That's always a tough situation to be in! What do you do currently that is making you so frustrated? <|endoftext|>
How much was it? <|endoftext|>
Those are sweet ride <|endoftext|>
That is definitely something to watch out for. <|endoftext|>
That happens over time. Are you enjoying it? <|endoftext|>
That sounds really neat.  What did you see? <|endoftext|>
Me too - what is it <|endoftext|>
Did you have fun at least <|endoftext|>
WOW,  are they really that far away? <|endoftext|>
Cool <|endoftext|>
Oh that makes a whole lotta sense, I mean isnt that the whole reason yeezy is popular? <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a fun event to participate in. <|endoftext|>
Are you nervous about it? <|endoftext|>
It's okay, it will be okay. Just try to have a good time and smile <|endoftext|>
That is ok... do you have any id's? <|endoftext|>
Nice...was it a bad area or just a general area you were in? <|endoftext|>
How did you do that? <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's awesome. What kind of memory was it? <|endoftext|>
They can be exciting! Did you see any? <|endoftext|>
Did you pay a lot of attention to what was around you? <|endoftext|>
Oh geez. I hope they had ID on them? <|endoftext|>
That's no good. What did they do <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What happened? <|endoftext|>
It's the scariest thing I've ever seen, hands down.. <|endoftext|>
Holy cow!  That is incredible!  There is nothing like the real deadlift! <|endoftext|>
wow thats impressive!! i guess you have never seen anyone that big.. <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun.  I want to get a cat but never have the time <|endoftext|>
That's sounds like a fun time! <|endoftext|>
Ouch, is it deep? <|endoftext|>
What was that? <|endoftext|>
hahahaha I bet that was fun to clean. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, gotta be a good Samaritan when it comes to inconvenient things. I had to get my foot caught in the parking lot once..not fun. <|endoftext|>
oh man. i bet it stinks that he's gone <|endoftext|>
I had a cat that was pretty much the same. Have you ever had a pet with cancer? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it brings back good memories. What was the name of the song? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, what's your favorite band?  I like them too, but specifically the band reference haha.  But seriously, I like a lot this music. <|endoftext|>
Oh, man! Did you find your dog? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow.  That's the worst..  She literally had her hands up telling the vet to do what they were doing.  That's why I advise not to fight them. <|endoftext|>
Did you pet it or put it outside? <|endoftext|>
Wings are a lot more fun to deal with though <|endoftext|>
Are you going to see them? <|endoftext|>
Yum!!  I love a good steak and cheese dinner. <|endoftext|>
That was nice of him. Who else would he give you a raise? <|endoftext|>
Nice! where are you vacationing too? <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate.  What kind of deadline is it? <|endoftext|>
What is it that you have to get worked up about? <|endoftext|>
Well at least you have something to do.  What's keeping you from getting anything done? <|endoftext|>
Maybe it's time to find a new hobby <|endoftext|>
oh no, i hope she gets well soon <|endoftext|>
Oh thank god she did!  That is such a relief to hear! <|endoftext|>
That's gotta be a relieving way to look at it. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's great!   Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! So many options and it's a whole new experience! <|endoftext|>
That's great, where is your plate from? <|endoftext|>
What food did you have? <|endoftext|>
That sucks, get some rest and get out of the basement! <|endoftext|>
We've been burning oil for years. <|endoftext|>
Work does that to you, buddy.... <|endoftext|>
What? Really? That's so crazy I have never heard of that before. <|endoftext|>
I love mac and cheese <|endoftext|>
Yes, the right amount of pepper always does the trick. <|endoftext|>
Nice, where did you get it? <|endoftext|>
Well if you put effort into it maybe then someone will notice. <|endoftext|>
time to get a new dog then <|endoftext|>
That is a wonderful idea, I like dogs and I wish I had a dog. <|endoftext|>
That is great and also a great way to live your life! <|endoftext|>
I am currently working there and I could not agree more. I cant wait til I am finished <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun, where is the park? <|endoftext|>
My kids used to not like it but now they will always love it <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a wonderful time.  What kind of cat do you have? <|endoftext|>
What kind of kitty is it <|endoftext|>
That was nice of her!! <|endoftext|>
That is cool I bet it will give you good memories <|endoftext|>
Congratulations!  I am sure you will love it. <|endoftext|>
Yes on a honeymoon!!! That is a dream come true. How sweet... how long did you stay <|endoftext|>
You may want to call up your local ABC <|endoftext|>
That sounds bad. Why are they cutting so many department? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you had to go through that. Were you OK? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome.  Is she doing something that you like? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing.  What does she do for a living? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Were you okay? <|endoftext|>
Did you bring it to the garage with you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I hate flies. Did you try anything to help it land? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! That's no fun <|endoftext|>
Yuck! That cat probably had rabies or something. <|endoftext|>
hahahah.. that's quite harsh. What's causing your difficulties? <|endoftext|>
That's good <|endoftext|>
You sound confident. Is this for work or fun? <|endoftext|>
That's gross.  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That is horrible I would throw up if I had hairballs in my mouth <|endoftext|>
oh my god. It was a simple roll of toilet paper. that is not good. <|endoftext|>
I agree with you. I have so much anxiety whenever I go to a store and there's a teenager there. <|endoftext|>
Nice, what kind did you get? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! What happened? <|endoftext|>
Did you check on Translator for that address? I know many that do not know the full meaning of address <|endoftext|>
It's cool.  How did you do? <|endoftext|>
Were you hurt? <|endoftext|>
Oh I ran when I was little. There's nothing like running outside to get outside and see the world! <|endoftext|>
Really? <|endoftext|>
What about <|endoftext|>
What did you guys eat? <|endoftext|>
I don't really like to warm up to people <|endoftext|>
Oh, that sounds scary. Did you knock? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Did you find out who did it? <|endoftext|>
Lol that's funny <|endoftext|>
Was it something good? <|endoftext|>
Music can be bad sometimes. How did you do? <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Uh oh.  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Is there any specific reason why? <|endoftext|>
That would be a good idea. Sometimes there is a chance it gets stolen. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh nice what did you get? <|endoftext|>
What kind of things? <|endoftext|>
Taxes have to go somewhere. It stinks that my property taxes are going up.  Are you doing anything to try to fight it? <|endoftext|>
Why high taxes? <|endoftext|>
Me too, but then it's a bad day. <|endoftext|>
I am in a relationship. What about you? Do you have any significant other? <|endoftext|>
That's a wonderful thing to have going for you.  Did they tell you what happened? <|endoftext|>
Were you worried going in? <|endoftext|>
Did she have a good reason not to? <|endoftext|>
Try to be positive! She may not remember! <|endoftext|>
How did it go <|endoftext|>
What!!? Why!! did you need to do that!! <|endoftext|>
That sounds like so much fun! <|endoftext|>
That's alright, everyone has their own opinon. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I bet you were super sad.  What happened? <|endoftext|>
My husband had an ingrown toenail. We had an argument about it, but i got him to go get a cast put <|endoftext|>
What is important? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean.   Have you tried saving? <|endoftext|>
Yeah. The great depression and the black and white world. <|endoftext|>
I love that feeling of being home with your family. <|endoftext|>
I used to a lot but now not as much <|endoftext|>
I like action movies and stuff like that. <|endoftext|>
oh thats a nice way to wake up, hope you enjoyed it <|endoftext|>
Yum, what kind was it? <|endoftext|>
How was it? That's what I want to learn how to do.. How do you like it done? <|endoftext|>
Why is that <|endoftext|>
I know where this is going lol. I was always a cool kid though <|endoftext|>
It's always easier when you know the trouble- There's no fun unless you're having fun! <|endoftext|>
Oh yes, it's very important to have a source of income <|endoftext|>
That is the good news. <|endoftext|>
That sucks... I used to live in a house that was being sold to recover from an insurance claim and the closing was cheaper than buying it new. I wish I knew how to get around the noise. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. That's quite a while to wait to find a place. Maybe you can find something quickly during the sale then. <|endoftext|>
Oh no what happened? did someone hit you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. <|endoftext|>
Not especially <|endoftext|>
Fallout 76 is a perfect game. <|endoftext|>
It is.  They work harder.  It makes me feel like they are less developed <|endoftext|>
How come you get a bit jealous sometimes? <|endoftext|>
I did well too, but I just wanted to vent. You know how that is <|endoftext|>
That is for sure, I hope so. I don't think it will though. <|endoftext|>
I am good. It is taht  is nice that your are so prepared. <|endoftext|>
Well that's great news! Congratulations! <|endoftext|>
that is awful, i hate bees <|endoftext|>
You should put a face cover on it, you'll look more intimidating! <|endoftext|>
Sure do. What about you? <|endoftext|>
yes i do, it brings back so many memories <|endoftext|>
Pretty good. I'm happy with what I got <|endoftext|>
I'm sure you will be alright buddy <|endoftext|>
What did you do <|endoftext|>
Oh, now you are throwing shade at her. Maybe you can give her a place at one of those jobs. <|endoftext|>
I bet that was embarrassing <|endoftext|>
Ha, that was a good choice. <|endoftext|>
That's the worst. <|endoftext|>
That's good. What was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's terrible. I know how that feels, mine is still with us. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, why didn't you call him? <|endoftext|>
Wow that sounds exciting <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That is pretty deep. What was the issue with the fear from the deep web? <|endoftext|>
Did you get it <|endoftext|>
That's cool, I'm not super close with my family so I'm not super informed about these things. How old are you?! <|endoftext|>
was it good? <|endoftext|>
Why hide it better? <|endoftext|>
Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
I'm actually very afraid of heights.  There's no turning back from that fear.  Are you afraid of heights or something else? <|endoftext|>
That's good advice. It can help you grow in a relationship. <|endoftext|>
I wish more people were like you. You are so kind and a good person. <|endoftext|>
I do actually <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  What game did you like <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, how come? <|endoftext|>
I know right. It's crazy how one thing can have so much negative connotations with the next. <|endoftext|>
that's wonderful! How was it? <|endoftext|>
That is cool, what did you used to do when you were younger <|endoftext|>
Nice. Did you get burned or just don't have enough money? <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Kindergarten is pretty fun. What did you do during her first day? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, as a woman I've gotten bigger and older too, It's kind of a transition period for sure haha <|endoftext|>
I hope he pays you back. <|endoftext|>
Is this a cash offer? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Do you still skydive? <|endoftext|>
lol  I have never had that fear,  I think its more along the lines of not being able to stop falling with style <|endoftext|>
did somebody tell you what happened? <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I would have been pissed, is it deep fryer? <|endoftext|>
Good, what caused the breakup? <|endoftext|>
ah.. thats a good reason <|endoftext|>
That is good, Sometimes you need a set of checks to be complete. <|endoftext|>
Good.  Do you like it there? <|endoftext|>
Yes, I work in retail, but I enjoy the peace and quiet too sometimes <|endoftext|>
I am afraid of heights. <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens. I hate that it ruins your plans. <|endoftext|>
Me too- We still have work to do but I'm glad it's over. <|endoftext|>
That sounds so good right now. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a restful and interesting nap. <|endoftext|>
I have never been to that place <|endoftext|>
Me too. What do you love about it <|endoftext|>
That is awful.. I don't understand how people don't think when they are dying. That is just terrible to hear, you don't know what you are going through! <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. It sucks how rare it is to lose someone close to you... even if it's just close family. <|endoftext|>
That's so sweet. Was it for a gift? <|endoftext|>
That's ok, do you have a future endeavor/? <|endoftext|>
I am happy for you <|endoftext|>
No expectations, just do what you want to do. <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. Maybe it's time to go pick up a new one. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you got it turned out ok <|endoftext|>
That is so nice of you! <|endoftext|>
Great to hear! What happened that made it fun <|endoftext|>
that's awesome, glad to hear that! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear that you are doing good.  I'm glad you are on a good track :) <|endoftext|>
What about it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no that is horrible! I'm so sorry that happened to you <|endoftext|>
oh man! is the car expensive? and also what kind of car? <|endoftext|>
I understand how you feel, the car was built to last and i am sure it will always be oper 8r. <|endoftext|>
oh my god what happened <|endoftext|>
What did? <|endoftext|>
Drunk at the party, how did you find out? <|endoftext|>
That's how it is for me too. <|endoftext|>
I know right.  I do the same thing <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. <|endoftext|>
What breed is it? <|endoftext|>
What's the deal with the lake? <|endoftext|>
That is pretty creative, I bet it is expensive too! <|endoftext|>
That's good they are able to do what they want to do. My dad had a lot of problems. He was always telling me what to do.. <|endoftext|>
Yeah. That's tough work <|endoftext|>
You and me both. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. What kind of projects did you have to do? <|endoftext|>
That can be a rough time. Did you find the problem? <|endoftext|>
What next one? <|endoftext|>
Oh I am sorry to hear that.  Do you diet well? <|endoftext|>
I am glad to hear you are. I am working my way up to go to a Doctorate so that is a bonus too. <|endoftext|>
That is pretty commendable considering your predicament.  I am sorry that you had to go through that <|endoftext|>
Oh man.  That's a lot of protein.  How many pounds is that? <|endoftext|>
That is never a fun thing to have to deal with! What is the certification exam for? <|endoftext|>
WHY THAT IS? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, was there other people there that were also having a meeting? <|endoftext|>
Happy Birthday! What did you do with your present? <|endoftext|>
Thats good, is it medical? <|endoftext|>
It's always awesome to find someone who loves you <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. It's always rough when you have to say goodbye.. <|endoftext|>
Wow how old is she now? <|endoftext|>
Oh, you're one of the lucky ones! <|endoftext|>
Ive had a few bad experiences. I mean bad driving or crashing <|endoftext|>
That's great that you have someone like that. I am not that lucky. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. What an awesome guy <|endoftext|>
That must have been embarrassing. <|endoftext|>
Oh no lol. What a loser <|endoftext|>
Where are you guys going? <|endoftext|>
That's great! I have never been to the Smithsonian but I hear it's great.  Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. It's cool you have that. knives are cool <|endoftext|>
You're a good friend then <|endoftext|>
You shouldn't let those stop you! You can always get pregnant again if you work hard! <|endoftext|>
I hear you.  It's hard to be happy when you are in a bad situation. <|endoftext|>
Good for you.  Are you wishing to work in the company now? <|endoftext|>
Oh cool what did you get? <|endoftext|>
Did you at least have a car? <|endoftext|>
I was just venting out some frustration, I'm in a good place :) <|endoftext|>
That is cool <|endoftext|>
Yeah, life is very complex, it's nice to know there is something natural that we can do to make it easier. <|endoftext|>
Nice. Which ones? <|endoftext|>
What is it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, why did you put two different color sx on? <|endoftext|>
I hope not. Pink is a bad color. What is the other one of? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool, what kind of dance do you do? <|endoftext|>
Do you dance professionally or just a fan? <|endoftext|>
Oh man, I have done that, I was like what is this? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
What happened if you don't mind me asking. <|endoftext|>
You must have felt confident in yourself there. <|endoftext|>
Where did you start? <|endoftext|>
I agree <|endoftext|>
What do you do during those sprints? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that is super fast!  Is that your only dashing activity? <|endoftext|>
maybe <|endoftext|>
Why the milk? <|endoftext|>
But they always come ready for some catch like that <|endoftext|>
lol I have tried that before.. it's hard! <|endoftext|>
How did they do that? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
I think so too.  He just needs to learn his place. <|endoftext|>
What was the text from? <|endoftext|>
Why is it so important to pick one person per day? <|endoftext|>
Oh no haha. That's no fun <|endoftext|>
Why not? That's a very interesting choice of words. <|endoftext|>
Well done! Did it come out ok? <|endoftext|>
What did you expect? <|endoftext|>
You can if you believe in yourself.  What is your progress <|endoftext|>
LOL....I am on that level too! :)  My husband swears he sweats like crazy. <|endoftext|>
i used to watch them all the time as a kid <|endoftext|>
When and where <|endoftext|>
Yes, I am too afraid to do that <|endoftext|>
That sounds very interesting! What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
What happened next? <|endoftext|>
Wow.  Sucks that people who are homeless can't afford decent clothing and things to shelter. <|endoftext|>
Me too <|endoftext|>
Me too!! I am too busy to do that though <|endoftext|>
Nice job! What kind of gym were you at? <|endoftext|>
That's good! chest exercises are great! <|endoftext|>
That is pretty funny to read. <|endoftext|>
Its good you did that. We cant have nice things around here <|endoftext|>
That's dedication, where did you go? <|endoftext|>
Wow, I hope you didn't have to go again. Were you worried about the after effects? <|endoftext|>
We can never get over the ex, they always comes back <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  That has got to be rough <|endoftext|>
I do too.  What's got you feeling sad tonight? <|endoftext|>
Yeah it hits hard when trying to sleep. <|endoftext|>
Oh, that must have been awful! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, were they okay? <|endoftext|>
More food? Never! I mean into your mouth! <|endoftext|>
I understand. <|endoftext|>
That's cool. What do you like about it <|endoftext|>
What next big goal are you referring to? <|endoftext|>
That's pretty awesome.  What kind of puppies? <|endoftext|>
No one left behind to bring them food or water. That's what's up <|endoftext|>
Oh I was the same way! And the people who collected them didn't care... I guess they were just afraid of the evil eagles. <|endoftext|>
What?! <|endoftext|>
Were you? That's the worst part about cloves. It's just hard to eat. <|endoftext|>
What? Are you taking medicine? <|endoftext|>
That stinks. How did it get cold? <|endoftext|>
oh no. that stinks! <|endoftext|>
How often do you have to do that? <|endoftext|>
It'll be alright...if it is <|endoftext|>
That is very nice, what was it? <|endoftext|>
I was talking about the one in the background <|endoftext|>
I need a root canal, how did you know about this? <|endoftext|>
That is unfortunate. <|endoftext|>
The good ol internet service provider? <|endoftext|>
Yes it is.  Especially if you are studying abroad. <|endoftext|>
That's interesting I've never been an animal person. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry <|endoftext|>
OH no! My dog has been hit by cars. I am so sorry! <|endoftext|>
What happened to him <|endoftext|>
That is a wonderful attitude to have. I always had fun, did whatever I wanted, and had as much fun as I could. I miss those days. <|endoftext|>
Did you have fun with your friends / family / what have you learned etc <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful, what are some of your favorite memories? <|endoftext|>
A what? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome. Were you stressed? <|endoftext|>
That's good. It's rough going through busy periods sometimes. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, why is that? <|endoftext|>
Did it? did you try to pole-dump it?? <|endoftext|>
That's good. I need to hit that new rep button <|endoftext|>
Yes buddy. <|endoftext|>
That's the worst feeling! Did you get the grade back yet? <|endoftext|>
What was it? Maybe they thought it was your ID? <|endoftext|>
Good, you should hit the ground while you are doing it. <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite part about this? <|endoftext|>
Did you ever try yoga or something else? <|endoftext|>
wow. 50 minutes is a pretty long time.  How did you do? <|endoftext|>
That is awful!  Did you confront him about it? <|endoftext|>
Why would he want you to break up? <|endoftext|>
That's impressive. It's always great when your friends work with you. <|endoftext|>
You must be some kind of military personnel <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That must have worried you a lot. How did you handle it? <|endoftext|>
aww thats amazing!  I love the love life <|endoftext|>
What does that have to do with what I said <|endoftext|>
Where do you go out to eat? <|endoftext|>
oh, im sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I can relate to that. Being vulnerable is part of being human. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, do you work out a lot? <|endoftext|>
Well I was a high school teacher.  I'm in college now.  I try to think of how I was as a child <|endoftext|>
Yeah that sucks <|endoftext|>
i can relate to that <|endoftext|>
How is she doing today? <|endoftext|>
Well you never know until it's too late. Do you have a dog already? <|endoftext|>
Glad you came to your senses. What happened? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. It makes you want to leave when you know it will all pay off. <|endoftext|>
That is very sad <|endoftext|>
What's her name? <|endoftext|>
What kind of cat did he get? <|endoftext|>
That's good!  I love cats <|endoftext|>
Ah yes, do you have a second child? <|endoftext|>
I can imagine. I am very fortunate to be able to have kept my baby healthy. <|endoftext|>
They are over for me too.. I don't have to pay $10 an hour! <|endoftext|>
I try to go out and hit the gym and eat at the sampler places, but it never works <|endoftext|>
She is a lucky lady to have such a good sister. <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds rough! I'm sorry that happened to you. Maybe there's something you can do about him eating you out there, but you know what you mean! <|endoftext|>
That's great. I love going to the store for clothes <|endoftext|>
Wearing what to a party? <|endoftext|>
Good for you.  It's always nice to have a plan B if you're having trouble. <|endoftext|>
It's always good when you feel confident and push through <|endoftext|>
Nice! What kind of work is it? <|endoftext|>
What's good? <|endoftext|>
Did you do well / <|endoftext|>
I love that saying <|endoftext|>
That is so messed up, did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad it was so time consuming. What was it about? <|endoftext|>
Oh what happened? Did they not call you? <|endoftext|>
That's good that you have those memories. <|endoftext|>
Sounds like fun! Are you going anywhere special? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a great time. <|endoftext|>
Oh, I know that feeling.  It's terrible when you can't see where you are going.  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That is a terrible feeling, i am sorry <|endoftext|>
What are you waiting for? <|endoftext|>
Are you working? Sometimes if you work hard enough it can pay off <|endoftext|>
did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I'm jealous! <|endoftext|>
That's fun! <|endoftext|>
Wow that's quite some time ago. How was the summer for you? <|endoftext|>
Really?? That's insane <|endoftext|>
Oh my, what horrible service?  Did they take care of you when you needed it? <|endoftext|>
What happened recently? <|endoftext|>
Everything happens for a reason. You got this bro! <|endoftext|>
What do you mean exactly? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's like they have no shame! They lie, cheat, steal, everything!! <|endoftext|>
That sounds fishy <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Why did you have to do that? <|endoftext|>
Are you? Are you a professional? How fun. Are you diamond? <|endoftext|>
That's cool. Well I'm curious what kind of climbed you did. <|endoftext|>
i do too <|endoftext|>
That happens to me sometimes too.  I don't like giving away my personal space...but if there is a WILL there is a way...you just can't do it <|endoftext|>
Wow, that must have been a pretty intense work out! <|endoftext|>
You will get it soon, it is a material object. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you feel that way.  My girlfriend had a miscarriage :( <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you were able to overcome the pain. <|endoftext|>
wow thats awesome. nice job <|endoftext|>
You can if you work hard. <|endoftext|>
That really stinks.  Are you going to attend college in the future? <|endoftext|>
That is a good idea. If you are looking for a new friend you should always talk to people that are near you <|endoftext|>
Don't worry too much! You'll do great! <|endoftext|>
Oh! Well do juggle well and enjoy the new life. juggle well <|endoftext|>
Why do you love her so much? <|endoftext|>
No, I am not a romantic person. I just like people. <|endoftext|>
They really do..  I went to Florida for the first time this summer and absolutely hated it <|endoftext|>
I like how you can find them almost anywhere these days <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried dating? <|endoftext|>
Yes, always stay strong. I know it takes work to feel strong, but it is worth it. <|endoftext|>
That's interesting! I bet that was fun, but how long did it take? <|endoftext|>
That is not too bad! Do you have any family in florida? <|endoftext|>
That is no good!  What happened? <|endoftext|>
Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
Maybe it's time to let go of her and be with someone else? <|endoftext|>
Absolutely, anything to distract us from the difficult task at hand, right? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. Maybe you can get her trained a little. I always found it interesting learning about different personality types. <|endoftext|>
Well I hope she stops fighting rats then. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. <|endoftext|>
Cool! I love riding coasters! <|endoftext|>
Which ones did you visit <|endoftext|>
What kind of pet is it <|endoftext|>
rat bodies are just the worst <|endoftext|>
How come? <|endoftext|>
Does it? <|endoftext|>
Oh man.  That must have been embarrassing.  How did you manage to put your trunks back on? <|endoftext|>
It's okay! You can do better next time. <|endoftext|>
You are ok to let go. You are still looking <|endoftext|>
What is wrong with you? <|endoftext|>
What kind of album is it <|endoftext|>
Oh wow!  What do you plan to do during the intermission? <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of that. When is it due? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, you should be an educated man then!!? <|endoftext|>
Yes we can! What do you mean exactly? <|endoftext|>
People are good sometimes but if you are always looking, there's no good. <|endoftext|>
Oh god that sounds like a bad dream. What happened next? <|endoftext|>
What was <|endoftext|>
Did your dog react? <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I hope that you are doing okay. <|endoftext|>
Well that's very nice of her - you have a source on that? <|endoftext|>
That is so nice <|endoftext|>
how fun <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. You are planning a trip or something? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad, I am so sorry <|endoftext|>
I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's when I was young. It's a really scary disease to deal with. <|endoftext|>
You should especially if you want a high paying work life balance. A bad attitude can lead to a lot of stress and depression. <|endoftext|>
Did you drive fast <|endoftext|>
I have never even tried driving that far- But I know that road well, it's a long ways <|endoftext|>
How's he doing? <|endoftext|>
WHOA! That is awful! Is he working it full time - or is he working part time/skilled? <|endoftext|>
Oh I feel ya, i have a friend like that too. What did you do while you were away? <|endoftext|>
I have tried to have a care in the world but we all have those days <|endoftext|>
That's interesting.  So what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
Well, as long as it's a woman's restroom. That's what I use <|endoftext|>
I love those things.  We use paper tickets at the store we use to go to as kids.  They work pretty good for that too. <|endoftext|>
Oh, no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun! <|endoftext|>
Where did you go? <|endoftext|>
Cool, was it for work or pleasure? <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful!  You must have felt very special! <|endoftext|>
That's sounds exciting! <|endoftext|>
How is the changing of her / you / you doing? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, are you and your significant other celebrating anything special? <|endoftext|>
Wow that is awesome, what did you do to her? <|endoftext|>
That's terrible, I live in Texas and that is a real thing. <|endoftext|>
Third what? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Were you able to get back to your house? <|endoftext|>
I am loyal to my principles, that is why I do not eat meat, because I love life <|endoftext|>
Then you can go on to something even more vegetarian. <|endoftext|>
That's terrible. Did she do anything bad? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Why couldn't you just wait until she was ready. Were you angry with her or what <|endoftext|>
What is the certification for <|endoftext|>
That's great- how does that help you? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad.  I hope they were tears of joy. <|endoftext|>
Where? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome.  How did you like it? <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. What was the occasion? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  What happened? <|endoftext|>
Why are you so lonely? <|endoftext|>
Have you tried looking for organizations or making friends locally? <|endoftext|>
Yeah.. I do too. Is there any chance you meet some cool people though? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. How do you think you did? <|endoftext|>
That is sad, but you will have to keep going <|endoftext|>
That's frustrating, sometimes those things happen and you need new music or something <|endoftext|>
I know right. She needs to learn her place <|endoftext|>
I remember that too! Those were the good old days! <|endoftext|>
I still have a nice pen from my mom.  I use it all the time <|endoftext|>
What is your house worth? <|endoftext|>
What is it sold for? <|endoftext|>
what happened? <|endoftext|>
Who is she? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what was it? <|endoftext|>
I hate when that happens <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry, I can't stand bad people <|endoftext|>
Lucky you <|endoftext|>
I agree with you.  What is the next step- work? <|endoftext|>
What was it? <|endoftext|>
lol I know exactly what you mean.   It is like that when I am sick I don't want to eat but I am craving something.  It's horrible! <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.  Was it sudden? <|endoftext|>
The force is strong with this one <|endoftext|>
That is always nice <|endoftext|>
Wow she works nights? That is awesome and lucky she didn't know she was coming! So what did you do? <|endoftext|>
That is really sad. I am so sorry! <|endoftext|>
That is the way to go buddy <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened to it?? <|endoftext|>
Oh no what happened <|endoftext|>
Does your brother live far away? <|endoftext|>
You must have been irritated today then? <|endoftext|>
I agree.  Nothing gets you more than just being alive. <|endoftext|>
That's true. I used to spend summers in FL with my family and had lots of fun there. How about you? <|endoftext|>
That's no fun... <|endoftext|>
OMG! I just had the worst image in my head of a bunch of angry boyfriends staring. <|endoftext|>
Omg, that's sad.  Why does he/she like you now? <|endoftext|>
Well, that's his prefered seat/ <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that must have been quite a shock. <|endoftext|>
Antiques! wow that is interesting <|endoftext|>
Well, you must trust your father with your life's savings. Why did you have to borrow your car? <|endoftext|>
What a good driver, who takes care of you <|endoftext|>
What happened? I'll bet you don't want to tell me. <|endoftext|>
It must've been pretty embarrassing then. <|endoftext|>
That is so nice of you,  It is always nice to help the animals and see what they eat too. <|endoftext|>
That is cool. I like bears but not to the point where I want to be killed. Do you live in bear country? <|endoftext|>
That's great!  I bet your having a great time with him! <|endoftext|>
Those are awesome dogs but are not so much fun to bring along in public <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness. That's awful.  How did you find out? <|endoftext|>
Exactly. Some people say its unethical to cheat.. but I say hit the gym and hit the lawyer. <|endoftext|>
That is dedication.  What do you do for work? <|endoftext|>
What did you do to get rid of it? <|endoftext|>
How did you end up feeling? <|endoftext|>
It probably was, or it could have been a lot worse. What did she think it was? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's aweseome!  What sort of games did you play when you were a kid? <|endoftext|>
I have never heard of that game. Is it like an old russian generals game? <|endoftext|>
Oh no what happened? You need any help> <|endoftext|>
What was the interview for <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah, that happened to me too when I was younger.  You got your life together, buddy! <|endoftext|>
That is true for some people. But as I said above, I want the best for everyone. Why waste your time if you are not prepared? <|endoftext|>
20 foot? wow nice. have you always wanted to go on a boat? <|endoftext|>
That is a lot of money. Do you have a plan for the future? <|endoftext|>
You should go for it! That is the best way to do it <|endoftext|>
I totally agree <|endoftext|>
thats what i do and they like it too <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, well congratulations on your friend! <|endoftext|>
That is terrible. Did he come home? <|endoftext|>
That is so sad to hear.  That poor baby. <|endoftext|>
Nice! I wish I could learn to skate. <|endoftext|>
Where do you live? <|endoftext|>
Did they not want to meet you? <|endoftext|>
I agree. I think my wife would have blown out of waht <|endoftext|>
that stinks <|endoftext|>
That's the same thought process I have when I am in a good mood. <|endoftext|>
What clothes did you run out of <|endoftext|>
That's okay, is it clean now? <|endoftext|>
What does that have to do with what I am saying? <|endoftext|>
The things the do not work right? <|endoftext|>
How fun! That's so cool! <|endoftext|>
That sounds nice. What did you do with it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I'm glad they didn't take anything. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that <|endoftext|>
That is so great that your pastor was willing to help her!  Is she still alive? <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's always good to have hands on support when you need it. <|endoftext|>
That's great! I'm sure he'll do great in school <|endoftext|>
And then what happened? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome,  your family sounds like super people!! <|endoftext|>
That's good that you trust, but why do you need to believe in the Lord? <|endoftext|>
I bet that was very nostalgic. Were they any good? <|endoftext|>
It is beautiful when that happens <|endoftext|>
Oh no, sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
I'm with you. It's hard to imagine life without a smartphone now. <|endoftext|>
I love red beans. They are expensive though <|endoftext|>
Yeah thats how we make them <|endoftext|>
I hope it's good news <|endoftext|>
Wow that's interesting.  How long did it take you to get the paperwork ready to do that? <|endoftext|>
You did!!. Were you prepared? <|endoftext|>
Do you have plans for tomorrow morning? <|endoftext|>
That's exciting! Is it the first day of college? <|endoftext|>
Well its good that you are prepared.  What are you going to do? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it physical? Or is she being yelled at? <|endoftext|>
That's good that you're caring <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.   How did it go? <|endoftext|>
Okay, bye then. <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Is he ok now? <|endoftext|>
It is always good to be caring <|endoftext|>
aww that is a nice thing to do. <|endoftext|>
Yea I have a cat who is very sweet. I also have a cat that I like but it's quite elderly and it never does this and it doesn't like to snuggle or get fussy. It needs you to provide constant contact with it so it doesn't want to leave you alone. <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful! What was your competition over? <|endoftext|>
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! That is incredible! <|endoftext|>
I hope they didn't notice, I hate when that happens! <|endoftext|>
I know but still <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's not right! You'll have to explain that to him/her! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like he needs a vacation <|endoftext|>
Does it have to do with money? <|endoftext|>
That sounds terrible, I hope the parties he was invited to weren't too loud. <|endoftext|>
Aw man that's the worst, they always catch you off guard. You're not the only one who was let down by that <|endoftext|>
Well, as long as you went out and had a good time and didn't forget what you were eating <|endoftext|>
That's nice of you. <|endoftext|>
Aw. That's good to hear. How old is he? <|endoftext|>
.. <|endoftext|>
Wow that's gross <|endoftext|>
The Japanese bottled water industry is the source of all <|endoftext|>
I bet you are nervous! I used to play soccer when I was a kid myself. Are you playing well?? <|endoftext|>
Don't worry about it, you are better than this! <|endoftext|>
Was he a bad dog or a good dog? <|endoftext|>
Wow.  Did he die?! <|endoftext|>
Aw that's too bad.  Was your bet on what? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! Congrats! <|endoftext|>
Cool <|endoftext|>
I know, if you have to make a promise then it is a bad idea. <|endoftext|>
Oh man I bet that was embarrassing! I don't know much about hiding things from people. Were you two okay? <|endoftext|>
That is awful <|endoftext|>
maybe. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes we have to dust off and move on. <|endoftext|>
That is such good news.  I am happy for you. <|endoftext|>
You're not the only one who's thinking that! <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That is terrible. Did you have insurance? <|endoftext|>
That is annoying,  What did they do? <|endoftext|>
Oh I bet you miss him! What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Aw, you and me both! <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that is a great accomplishment! Are you married? <|endoftext|>
Oh really? <|endoftext|>
Did you go with anyone special or was it just a lot of people? <|endoftext|>
That's rough, but I bet that is what they wanted. <|endoftext|>
You must be thrilled about that!  That is incredible. <|endoftext|>
Haha sounds like fun <|endoftext|>
That's nice to hear!  Where is it headed? <|endoftext|>
Cool. I am a bit further south. But yeah, it's always nice to think outside the box <|endoftext|>
That is mean of him.  Did you say something to him. <|endoftext|>
hahahahahah it's ok buddy. everyone knows it's easier just to brush on the shoulder and say hello. It's like he's not even there <|endoftext|>
Great, that's always good. What are you most interested in doing? <|endoftext|>
Do you work in real estate? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing!!! I never win <|endoftext|>
Thats cool.  where abouts are you from <|endoftext|>
Yikes, where was it? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
Oh yea, being ahead is important. Being prepared is the key here! <|endoftext|>
That's the worst, when people just don't care if you get hurt or not. <|endoftext|>
Yea, those dent places are so busy you have to look the other way. <|endoftext|>
Those were the days, my friend. What kind of dog is she? <|endoftext|>
You ever cut someone off on the way to work? <|endoftext|>
Well that was nice of you <|endoftext|>
What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's absolutely disgusting! You shouldn't watch or be around those people - they do not deserve your compassion!! <|endoftext|>
what country do you live in <|endoftext|>
News is always good but we need to know what happened. <|endoftext|>
Why do you hate waiting? <|endoftext|>
Oh no,  that's terrible,  I hope you find something soon <|endoftext|>
Me too. What do you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. Was that your fault? <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, those stinking lights. <|endoftext|>
Where are you moving to? <|endoftext|>
Maybe you could ask around the neighborhood? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Was it expensive or what <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that you got a pet from that. <|endoftext|>
It was a doberman. She was so docile <|endoftext|>
That's good!  Are you going to stay? <|endoftext|>
Great! Do you like it? <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about it? <|endoftext|>
That's the spirit! What is your assignment? <|endoftext|>
What did he need it for? <|endoftext|>
oh no, what happened. that's awful <|endoftext|>
Well thats good <|endoftext|>
That sounds interesting, any in particular?  I like those <|endoftext|>
That's amazing, what was it about? <|endoftext|>
That's great.  How do you like the job? <|endoftext|>
Ok then what is the job about <|endoftext|>
Oh that's always good - good friends are always welcome here -D <|endoftext|>
Do you have any plans for retirement? <|endoftext|>
What was the brand? <|endoftext|>
Worked well in what?  Are you refering to someone specific? <|endoftext|>
Do you work too? <|endoftext|>
We need some rain to turn the frown upside down <|endoftext|>
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. How is he holding up? <|endoftext|>
Who did? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I hope that's coming your way. We're already getting some pretty bad storms out here. <|endoftext|>
Oh cool!  Gulf is very temperate. <|endoftext|>
That's really awesome of her! What a wonderful woman. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that's sweet of her. How often do you get to see her? <|endoftext|>
I can totally understand that, but unfortunately, so many people don't do that which I find annoying. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible,  I'm sorry you had to go through that. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's crazy!  That's actually the coolest thing that ever happened to me! <|endoftext|>
What a great idea. I would love to do that. How did you get the syrup bag to empty? <|endoftext|>
Kids these days are so precious. <|endoftext|>
It is hard to let go <|endoftext|>
That is so nice of her! I am glad you feel better! <|endoftext|>
That is wonderful <|endoftext|>
what do you like about your wifes <|endoftext|>
That's no good!  You should talk to her often to show your appreciation for her efforts! <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? Well I hope you're right and that you're 100% secure with him. <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of you! Good for her I'm sure she appreciates you <|endoftext|>
Yea. That's what I do. I try to help. <|endoftext|>
Its a life changer! <|endoftext|>
I have a BRAT! <|endoftext|>
I wish I could afford a new home!! <|endoftext|>
You're gambling <|endoftext|>
I imagine that is embarrassing. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I am so sorry that you had to go through that! <|endoftext|>
What kind of toy was it. <|endoftext|>
What does he do that you want to know about <|endoftext|>
That's incredible! I've never been on a cruise! <|endoftext|>
You should.Cruises are the best. <|endoftext|>
That is a good thing that he provided for you. Why did he call you? <|endoftext|>
Is he ok now? That is very scary <|endoftext|>
Try to imagine if your parents were doing the same thing <|endoftext|>
That's cool that it worked like that. <|endoftext|>
Why junk food? <|endoftext|>
Those things are good but we are talking about the suffering and death that is losing a loved one <|endoftext|>
What did you do with your son? <|endoftext|>
Wow. So he's your child? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that you played a part in raising her. That's a great moment. <|endoftext|>
What do you do when you don't have any family nearby? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that.. are you okay now <|endoftext|>
Did you have surgery? <|endoftext|>
Oh I am sorry to hear that!  Have you been taking care of her? <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds terrible.   Any idea why she is doing that? <|endoftext|>
What is the cat doing? <|endoftext|>
Is it a cat <|endoftext|>
how did that go <|endoftext|>
About what? <|endoftext|>
That's quite interesting. <|endoftext|>
What is that you are looking for? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!!!  What happened?! <|endoftext|>
Well that is certainly disgusting <|endoftext|>
Did you guys have a good time? <|endoftext|>
Awesome. She is going to learn how to ride a bike. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome I bet he's a great man and it's nice to have help in these trying times. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that.  What is the issue? <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds rough.  What was wrong? <|endoftext|>
I understand what you mean <|endoftext|>
Thats always good news and sad at the same time! <|endoftext|>
Do you like the quiet or do you hate the loud? <|endoftext|>
oh wow that sounds bad did you manage to get it organized? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes we have to do what we have to do <|endoftext|>
Did you get the items you ordered? <|endoftext|>
What was your order? <|endoftext|>
How was the funeral? <|endoftext|>
They really are sad. At least they have something to look forward to these days. <|endoftext|>
Where are they going? <|endoftext|>
Where are you going? <|endoftext|>
You are making me feel nostalgic. It's been a long time since I saw some of those folks. <|endoftext|>
I hate it when that happens. Makes it so easy to avoid people. <|endoftext|>
Oh ok.  What about now? <|endoftext|>
What a wonderful story. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes we need to do those face pulls and palm wipes to get ourselves out of the lie. <|endoftext|>
That's a tough situation. Did you say something to her? <|endoftext|>
yea, they are everywhere. even in my own apartment <|endoftext|>
Dang, I hate when people take that approach. Maybe you should tell her not to do that then? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry. If you have kids it's great to see them every now and then. I see them every other day while on vacation. <|endoftext|>
Yeah that's always rough <|endoftext|>
Nice, I have some things coming to me as well. I need to learn to self-employed but I'm going to have a blast with my girls before school starts back. <|endoftext|>
Wow how impatient! So what did you get them for? <|endoftext|>
How did it go/ <|endoftext|>
You will be okay buddy, everything will be alright. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Was this recent? <|endoftext|>
They arguing? <|endoftext|>
Did you play at a competitive level or just on a fun or pleasure-Rival? <|endoftext|>
What is your fav part about your life? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome. When is the catch? <|endoftext|>
LOL.  I love blue catfish.  What is your secret? <|endoftext|>
That sounds fun <|endoftext|>
That's always fun, but I'm not too familiar with them.  What's the drink? <|endoftext|>
I understand that.  Are you close with them? <|endoftext|>
I hate messy places. How many people do you have? <|endoftext|>
What is it? <|endoftext|>
Hopefully you get a good deal on one! <|endoftext|>
That is too bad. But maybe they need you to drug them more so they don't run off like crazy. <|endoftext|>
You better not jinx it! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. camping is the best <|endoftext|>
What's the temperature where you are? <|endoftext|>
Oh, wow!  Did you go check it out? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! I hope it came back on for you <|endoftext|>
Do you live in a house or a street/street/aven? <|endoftext|>
lol. I love pool. <|endoftext|>
Ew, that's unfortunate. What kind of cake was it? <|endoftext|>
oh sorry <|endoftext|>
That's a great idea, I should do the same thing. <|endoftext|>
Well maybe it was a lucky charm down south? <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite kind? <|endoftext|>
Oh yes!  Those are the best <|endoftext|>
How was that for you <|endoftext|>
Wow, that is very nice, how long have you been with her <|endoftext|>
That's nice that you have that kind of relationship with her. <|endoftext|>
i agree, i watched my dad play that a long time ago <|endoftext|>
Aw man.. I have never tried that dip. What is it made of? <|endoftext|>
I am the same way <|endoftext|>
Oh how exciting! Good for you! <|endoftext|>
That's awesome! What does that mean? <|endoftext|>
oh thats cool. <|endoftext|>
Sometimes that is all you can do. Or do.  It gives you a lot of discipline and a different perspective. <|endoftext|>
That's interesting, are you a doctor? <|endoftext|>
Oh my goodness, so what did you do? <|endoftext|>
People who can't do much to defend themselves usually just run amok. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  Was it like the 98th or 101st minute or what <|endoftext|>
That's great! What team do you support? <|endoftext|>
How did it feel? <|endoftext|>
I hear you.  I miss having kids myself. <|endoftext|>
I remember when my daughter was just a baby. I would play catch with them every week when we were young. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I can imagine it was! That must have been scary. <|endoftext|>
I love frog legs <|endoftext|>
That is so sad.  Are these people innocent? <|endoftext|>
Yes it is very sad.  I was not around any farm when I was a kid and a lot of that stuff was around my area <|endoftext|>
I agree. I think its amazing how many people we have that are out there killing each other. <|endoftext|>
Yep agree 100%. You know what I mean? <|endoftext|>
You must be feeling pretty happy about that! Sounds like your giving him a lot of credit there! <|endoftext|>
He's such a good guy.  What does he do for work? <|endoftext|>
They did. What grade are you in? <|endoftext|>
Ha ha, I have never heard that one before <|endoftext|>
Almost 12 <|endoftext|>
You should find a new hobby <|endoftext|>
I'm the same way. I have so many things going on, I have no time to do anything. <|endoftext|>
Oh gosh that's horrible!  I would have had to leave my apartment and call animal control.  That's what I do usually -) <|endoftext|>
That must have scared you! <|endoftext|>
Oh no.  I'm so sorry to hear that, what kind of kitty was it? <|endoftext|>
That is terrible, so sorry for your loss <|endoftext|>
She's learning, that's for sure. How old is she? <|endoftext|>
Very true, things change a lot as you get older. What things did you like the most? <|endoftext|>
OH. IS she going to pay them? <|endoftext|>
I use my cell phone to keep my receipts too. It helps so much <|endoftext|>
That sucks.  Are you OK now? <|endoftext|>
i wish i was much better <|endoftext|>
You should have kept her around. <|endoftext|>
I understand that, it is quite annoying and I guess everyone does. <|endoftext|>
Uh oh!  That is not good!   Why did you get caught? <|endoftext|>
It's like a dying animal. Hope your mom is alright <|endoftext|>
Well, you can always watch it again and forget about it. <|endoftext|>
I saw that movie a long time ago! <|endoftext|>
That is terrible! I am sorry that happened to you <|endoftext|>
Whats the matter? is he a bad person or just a good one? <|endoftext|>
I have had some bad burn out from working from home.  Did things improve? <|endoftext|>
Oh... What's a nonstop effort with her? <|endoftext|>
what happened? are you nervous? are you excited? are you going somewhere special? <|endoftext|>
It's better to get it out of the way so that no one else can hurt you. <|endoftext|>
eww thats disgusting. worms are nasty <|endoftext|>
Uh oh. What is it then? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow. Did you bite them? <|endoftext|>
Why not? <|endoftext|>
What kind of dog is it? <|endoftext|>
Really? I'm sorry, I don't know much about australian shepherd <|endoftext|>
Maybe next time you can save it <|endoftext|>
Is she going to get a new one? <|endoftext|>
Wow I would have ran. <|endoftext|>
That's what makes it fun, though. It's still fun to think about it <|endoftext|>
You should always have a fear of the outdoors <|endoftext|>
oh really, how much was it? <|endoftext|>
That's cool! what kind of work have you been doing <|endoftext|>
I hate that! <|endoftext|>
Why not? <|endoftext|>
awww, those are the best kind! I love those. <|endoftext|>
Oh cool!  How does that make you feel? <|endoftext|>
Oh my!  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
haha, yeah it is  at least its fresh water..haha <|endoftext|>
Wow was the cat trying to get in? <|endoftext|>
That's when you know you've got a problem <|endoftext|>
Nice, it's very hard to find a job that requires a good understanding of the business environment and the typical questions they typically run <|endoftext|>
Why are you nervous? <|endoftext|>
That's a bummer.  Were you okay? <|endoftext|>
Was the car parked? <|endoftext|>
That is terrible!  I always tell people the odds are not in your favor.  But never do that <|endoftext|>
What do you mean? <|endoftext|>
That's scary!  Don't answer the door if they have a gun. <|endoftext|>
did you ask him why? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, are you alright? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, I am sorry to hear that.  You never know what can happen in life.  You are never prepared unless you are prepared. <|endoftext|>
Oh cool! Did you go anywhere special to see him? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I bet that was embarrassing! <|endoftext|>
Congrats! I bet you were so excited to present it to them! <|endoftext|>
I bet it was, is that where you work now? <|endoftext|>
what is the name of the song? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I know that feeling. It's really bad <|endoftext|>
I don't think it went quite as planned. <|endoftext|>
Web Development <|endoftext|>
Oh my! Were you trying to apologise? <|endoftext|>
oof.. i can only imagine. <|endoftext|>
That's interesting. Is he careful with it at all times? <|endoftext|>
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, how did that go? <|endoftext|>
What is your major? <|endoftext|>
N nursing is very cool. <|endoftext|>
How's it going? <|endoftext|>
What's wrong? <|endoftext|>
Oh no what happened? <|endoftext|>
good to hear, what were you doing that was stressing you out? <|endoftext|>
That is a good idea. How does the relationship hold up? <|endoftext|>
ok <|endoftext|>
Yea. It makes me a bit anxious too <|endoftext|>
Yes that is a very important part of the experience. <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry you're going through that <|endoftext|>
Maybe it's time for a change of scenery. <|endoftext|>
I can relate to that <|endoftext|>
What do you have planned? <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have family nearby? <|endoftext|>
I suppose so,  I was never very close with my sister <|endoftext|>
But we will not get there till its too late <|endoftext|>
I understand.  It is tough to leave them with their parents though.  It is a lot of responsibility <|endoftext|>
Is it that bad? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, I am so sorry. That is a scary situation but it is so wonderful you had such caring doctors around to help you. <|endoftext|>
Oh my, that must have been a very scary experience for you. <|endoftext|>
wow cool <|endoftext|>
I use a potato pot all the time lol <|endoftext|>
Cool, did you do anything with them? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I would cry. <|endoftext|>
I know that must have been embarassing, I had that happen to me once. <|endoftext|>
What did you drink? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. <|endoftext|>
Oh I bet! I had a stinker do that to me as well. <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, exciting! <|endoftext|>
I hope its not too bad <|endoftext|>
That's rough. What was the diagnosis? <|endoftext|>
that is too bad..is it treatable? <|endoftext|>
What does she do now? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
That's cool. You guys hang out a while? <|endoftext|>
As in driving? <|endoftext|>
what is the test about <|endoftext|>
What is your favorite dish? <|endoftext|>
What was the song? <|endoftext|>
Why does it have you feeling nostalgic? <|endoftext|>
That is horrible, what happened <|endoftext|>
You got this! <|endoftext|>
I'm so sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
did she not listen to you? <|endoftext|>
Good for you <|endoftext|>
Was it a restaurant or what? <|endoftext|>
Oh man, how did it go? How many people were you talking to? <|endoftext|>
They are usually very mean and irresponsible. <|endoftext|>
You should definitely try a different kind of drink! <|endoftext|>
You have to give in and do what has to be done. Just do it slowly <|endoftext|>
Good luck!! <|endoftext|>
Waiting is the worst part <|endoftext|>
Thats fair enough, toys are usually the most fun <|endoftext|>
Oh no. I remember when those came out. So many toys! <|endoftext|>
I would not like that <|endoftext|>
What happened <|endoftext|>
That can be embarrassing. <|endoftext|>
What went wrong <|endoftext|>
That is a problem no matter what you do <|endoftext|>
What happened next? <|endoftext|>
It is wonderful. <|endoftext|>
i don't know if it's just mine or what, but my wife makes me feel this way.. and I can't explain it <|endoftext|>
Were you close? <|endoftext|>
What did you and her do? <|endoftext|>
What kind of gear does he have? <|endoftext|>
You know what they say, never settle down <|endoftext|>
That's definitely a different experience. <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear that. My girlfriend always tells me I need to take a picture of myself before a big outdoor trip - it terrifies me! <|endoftext|>
Oh no. What happened? <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
oh no.. were they ok? did you hurt yourself? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
That is pretty neat,  do you still wear it? <|endoftext|>
I am glad you have something to remind you of her like that <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! What was the award for? <|endoftext|>
That's dedication.  I admire that a lot <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome. I love going to the park <|endoftext|>
Really? I know we use too many words here to explain it. We just love to play sports <|endoftext|>
I agree, it's always great to hang out with friends and family. I have a beach house I could go and hang out in too if the weather is good. <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's not cool! Hopefully you are able to control yourself and eat healthier! <|endoftext|>
That is awesome I will keep trying <|endoftext|>
oh no, that's unfortunate that it's gone <|endoftext|>
What's your issue? <|endoftext|>
That was nice of her. Did you let her use the skateboard for transportation? <|endoftext|>
She does <|endoftext|>
Oh no. How bad was it? <|endoftext|>
What did they want blamed on? <|endoftext|>
How nice of her! I bet you are glad she was able to help you <|endoftext|>
What was it that made you feel that way? <|endoftext|>
Sounds rough. What did you do in the end? <|endoftext|>
What happened, did you hurt your feelings? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Why did you cancel? <|endoftext|>
Woo hoo, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awesome.  I love being able to go back to the place I came from! <|endoftext|>
That's so great to have such a loyal partner! <|endoftext|>
Those are really fun and comfortable. What kind are you going to get? <|endoftext|>
I've had alot of rough riding around. That's no fun. <|endoftext|>
Did everything go okay? <|endoftext|>
Were you able to clean it up or is it still in the process? <|endoftext|>
Did you have to stay for a check up or what <|endoftext|>
That is not good at all. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a lot of fun <|endoftext|>
How did they get it? <|endoftext|>
They are wonderful! Take lots of photos, that's what I do. <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary! Did the car get damaged? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah that is a tough decision to make. It's always great to have a car though. <|endoftext|>
Wow, that's awesome, you must have worked hard for that. <|endoftext|>
What is the difference if I may ask? <|endoftext|>
I hope it works out well for you <|endoftext|>
Awesome! I was there 5 years. I'll never work anywhere else <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, you do a lot for your charity! <|endoftext|>
That's so nice of them! I was hoping they would be around during the day so I can get some work done. <|endoftext|>
Thats so awesome. How long have you been together? <|endoftext|>
Oh cool, was it fun? <|endoftext|>
What does your fiance do for work / social media / what does he do that you dont know about him doing that lol <|endoftext|>
Did you go to Disney World when you were young? <|endoftext|>
How did that go for them <|endoftext|>
Who is he talking about? <|endoftext|>
How do you feel about it? <|endoftext|>
How do you find those <|endoftext|>
I'm glad you got the job. It's always nice to work from home. <|endoftext|>
Where do you usually get your information from <|endoftext|>
what was the name of the movie? <|endoftext|>
Do you have a favorite memory of your visit? <|endoftext|>
That's horrible!  Did you try to find another job? <|endoftext|>
Yeah I get that. I feel so bad if someone doesn't take care of their pets. They deserve it. <|endoftext|>
Why the dog do you have to do that <|endoftext|>
That is so nice, I have a pit mix myself. I love them <|endoftext|>
That sounds frustrating!  Do you know what your doing wrong? <|endoftext|>
That's good. We only get one body <|endoftext|>
I love candies! My husband got me some new ones. What kind were they? <|endoftext|>
Maybe one day you will be able to <|endoftext|>
OH no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Is your nephew alright? <|endoftext|>
Yeah, I'm not expecting anything new, just that he's doing good. <|endoftext|>
Ouch, I hate when that happens. You did the right thing. <|endoftext|>
That's all you have <|endoftext|>
That's the worst <|endoftext|>
I am sorry.  He must be a big doggy if you cant find him. <|endoftext|>
That's good, keep at it buddy. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. You can get busy or do something you're passionate about often though. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty cool.  Do you go pro or do you just play a lot? <|endoftext|>
Do you have a future together? <|endoftext|>
I love the beach. <|endoftext|>
that's great! <|endoftext|>
That sounds so nice. It's summer vacation where I am <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  Did they compensate you? <|endoftext|>
You should have worn something then? <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome that she got you something.  I love when people get happy with their watches <|endoftext|>
How come not <|endoftext|>
That's so nice, was it going to be private conversations or open with the boss? <|endoftext|>
I like to go to those too <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome.  Did it come with or without <|endoftext|>
what did you win? <|endoftext|>
Wife is dying of cancer? <|endoftext|>
What car is it <|endoftext|>
Exactly.. If you want to do anything then do it yourself.. But if you need people you need to bring them along <|endoftext|>
I bet it did.  Do you still keep in contact with them? <|endoftext|>
Was it like a karaoke party or what <|endoftext|>
I would like to get a new laptop as well. You know how it is - technology never gets old! <|endoftext|>
That is a terrible thing to experience <|endoftext|>
Oh. A fellow employee at work? <|endoftext|>
Absolutely! It's nice to have those extra days to do fun stuff with your friends and family. <|endoftext|>
That is always a bonus <|endoftext|>
I wish you a happy workplace. You will do fine!! <|endoftext|>
I really wish I could work that job <|endoftext|>
Who is playing <|endoftext|>
Oh thats cute <|endoftext|>
That's great hope you get it <|endoftext|>
That's good.  What type of job is it? <|endoftext|>
That is great!  What kind of job is it? <|endoftext|>
That's what she said! <|endoftext|>
Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.  How is he doing today? <|endoftext|>
That was nice of them. I'm sure he appreciated it. <|endoftext|>
How did that go? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Was it from a work- related issue? <|endoftext|>
Your welcom <|endoftext|>
I would be furious if that was me. I have psoriasis and wish I was dead. <|endoftext|>
That's too bad, I hope things get better for you soon. <|endoftext|>
You must be so proud! <|endoftext|>
He is amazing what is your favorite sports play <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! How embarrassing! Did she mess up again? <|endoftext|>
hahah oh well i guess she has good ear then. play is play right? haha <|endoftext|>
That is good!  Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Wow that sounds like a very complicated situation - but I bet you had a great time playing it! <|endoftext|>
Were you playing Mario or was it for nintendo? <|endoftext|>
I need you to listen to what I say. I know your pain. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah. That happened to me when I was a kid. I was like whoa what did that guy do, I wonder how did he get so drunk. I have no idea, lol <|endoftext|>
No... maybe you should re-examine what you have been experiencing and maybe discuss treatment options. <|endoftext|>
Does it work? <|endoftext|>
It's definitely not the miracle cure we need but it is the right thing to do. I'd never cheat on my family either. <|endoftext|>
That's awful!  I hope it is all ok.  Was it perhaps an outdoor cat? <|endoftext|>
That is good news! <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I hate driving in a busy highway.  Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
That can be dangerous when trying to get somewhere legal.  Did you go somewhere safe? <|endoftext|>
No one will listen to you. We always tell ourselves it will only get worse. <|endoftext|>
That's no fun.  If your area requires astro-fisical instruments (like an observatory or meteoroid observatory) I recommend using your phone as a phone cover-up. <|endoftext|>
Me too.  Do you have any special plans for tomorrow night? <|endoftext|>
Exactly, it's like getting into a grocery store and seeing if anyone is selling certain foods. <|endoftext|>
Oh my god. You are telling me that you ARE the bull shark?! <|endoftext|>
Holy cow, she's alright now, what was she in for? <|endoftext|>
That always stinks but they will come back to you <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she's feeling better! <|endoftext|>
I know right, those tweets are like 140 characters! <|endoftext|>
Yeah? Do you think they'll do anything about it? <|endoftext|>
What did you find <|endoftext|>
yes, it sure was <|endoftext|>
Oh. Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|>
I was envious of you <|endoftext|>
Oh that's neat. Is that your major? <|endoftext|>
That sounds like fun. Were you studying in a university or for work? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome. Did you have a good time looking through it? <|endoftext|>
I love that she is still kicking herself <|endoftext|>
Me too! What are your favorite things about it <|endoftext|>
Oh that sounds like fun I love Halloween.  I am hoping it is as exciting as the movies suggest <|endoftext|>
Who was is that? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
That's interesting <|endoftext|>
Did you? <|endoftext|>
That's great! Are you happy now? <|endoftext|>
You are so lucky. <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry to hear that. Are you alright? <|endoftext|>
That's awful, I bet you were shaking <|endoftext|>
That's very sweet of them, what kind of party? <|endoftext|>
Oh nice! What kind of shoes? <|endoftext|>
Nice. I hope you get the job then. <|endoftext|>
How is that working out for you? <|endoftext|>
That's the worst!  It's been super hot here too. <|endoftext|>
That is spooky <|endoftext|>
Good luck! I hope you win <|endoftext|>
Whoa... that's a large amount of money!  I hope you're able to get that money back quickly! <|endoftext|>
how? <|endoftext|>
Did you have a toe injury <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that.  What was the number1 reason you did not win? <|endoftext|>
Oh my, how long have you been without a car? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome, do you play any other video games? <|endoftext|>
I do too.  I am always scared to move away from my home town. <|endoftext|>
Elect them. That's what we need to do. <|endoftext|>
I care about my country <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that, what was wrong with your goldfish? <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh, that's too bad. I hope you do fine in there. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
I have been there. I know how it feels. How long did you have to wait? <|endoftext|>
Oh man. How long did it take you to do it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Me too. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, are you going to go to the doctor? <|endoftext|>
Maybe it's time to invest in a new scratching post. <|endoftext|>
That's cool man.  Was it a show that was good or bad? <|endoftext|>
Who is he pulling out? <|endoftext|>
Cool. Is it a call center job or what? <|endoftext|>
I am excited for you <|endoftext|>
How did you do? <|endoftext|>
That is cool <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! That is very nice of her, where do you live? <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful to hear. Many people take the easy way out when it comes to their kids' needs. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Why do you miss them <|endoftext|>
That's so sad. What did you do? <|endoftext|>
Oh my that's wonderful of your aunt! It's nice that you have family! <|endoftext|>
Did you have fun? <|endoftext|>
Nice, its always nice to have a nice family.  What kind of tv was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh, what state? <|endoftext|>
Aw, I'm happy to hear that. Are your kids still children? <|endoftext|>
Well that's a nice thing for your parents to do. Not many people are that considerate. <|endoftext|>
I have never done that, i always go out and make money myself <|endoftext|>
That's so nice.  I'm glad you passed your time with her.  Take care of it. <|endoftext|>
We all do. Do you have kids or is she still with you <|endoftext|>
Oh no!! were you hurt? <|endoftext|>
Disaster - it's like we have a losing record against you :( <|endoftext|>
That's so exciting. What is the name of the paper? <|endoftext|>
What is a really big deal? <|endoftext|>
What was it <|endoftext|>
Oh really? That's awesome <|endoftext|>
oh how do you like it? <|endoftext|>
That is amazing!!  You must be so proud <|endoftext|>
They will be back! I trust you will do fine!! <|endoftext|>
I am so sorry <|endoftext|>
That is great decision, how long will you stay with him? <|endoftext|>
did he refuse to leave? <|endoftext|>
Aw that's alright man, he'll get over it. <|endoftext|>
Haha oh yea, I can see why that would bother him. It's almost like the ice cream was his to give. <|endoftext|>
How did it go? <|endoftext|>
Congratulations! It's tough to start, but it will pay off! <|endoftext|>
what was it <|endoftext|>
What were your favorite times of the young world <|endoftext|>
Oh wow, that's pretty neat what they did. <|endoftext|>
what happened? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. He will get through it though. You must give him your love and support. <|endoftext|>
Sorry to hear that. Have you tried yoga and meditation <|endoftext|>
That's really nice of them! <|endoftext|>
Any particular reason why? <|endoftext|>
Whoa that is SO corrupt. <|endoftext|>
Same here. It is so bad when people are like that <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
I was glad I wasn't too busy  to do anything <|endoftext|>
That's sad. Maybe you can do something fun together. <|endoftext|>
Who is she? <|endoftext|>
Was it parked? <|endoftext|>
Did you take it to a repair place? <|endoftext|>
That's cool you got to spend time together. I moved away from Texas a long time ago and still have family living here. <|endoftext|>
You must be a great guy to be around. <|endoftext|>
That's pretty benign of you. Why do you think she likes you instead of giving you a straight answer? <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a good way to go about things. <|endoftext|>
What is the exception? <|endoftext|>
That's amazing!!! Those posters were amazing <|endoftext|>
That's good! You must have worked hard! <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, what is your favorite part of the game? <|endoftext|>
What was the location? <|endoftext|>
Oh wow that's a lot of money! <|endoftext|>
that's really neat, I bet that made you smile a lot <|endoftext|>
I was just saying the same thing. I miss the good ol' days. <|endoftext|>
Did she pressure you to get on the horse or what <|endoftext|>
That is quite a long time.  Why didn't your friend help you? <|endoftext|>
Yeah we understand. How old are you? <|endoftext|>
Ahh, I am sorry to hear that. Do you have somewhere special that you wanted to go? <|endoftext|>
It's good to be around your husband. Often times they are away doing work or whatever. <|endoftext|>
It's the best when it works out that way! <|endoftext|>
That's the worst!  I'm sure you'll do fine if you prepared!  Do you have a good head start going in? <|endoftext|>
Try alcohol <|endoftext|>
That is a big step. I wouldn't be nervous. <|endoftext|>
That's great!  What does he do?  Where is he from? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, poor dog. <|endoftext|>
Oh no, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I have been there before.  Are you doing well now? <|endoftext|>
Yes I do that all the time too. <|endoftext|>
That's great.  What did he do for you? <|endoftext|>
That's awesome that you have a Mexican restaurant nearby like that! <|endoftext|>
Why is that? <|endoftext|>
Congradulations. <|endoftext|>
I know exactly what you mean, I listen to music all the time <|endoftext|>
My dad was the best, my mom never was lol <|endoftext|>
Awww  that's nice <|endoftext|>
That is true. Its nice when they do that for you <|endoftext|>
Oh no, did you get his insurance information? <|endoftext|>
What?!?!? I would love to hear why not if you don't mind me asking. I know I'm not supposed to talk about it. <|endoftext|>
Whoa, I hope you caught him. <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah that is not cool. Why didn't you ask him? <|endoftext|>
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure he is in a better place :) <|endoftext|>
Oh, yeah. My mom left me by myself for the third time in a row. But my brothers were able to hang out for a while <|endoftext|>
That sounds like a great time. What shows are you enjoying? <|endoftext|>
That is the best show. I cannot wait for the fourth <|endoftext|>
That's too bad you had no choice. You made a wise choice to stay in school. <|endoftext|>
You will find a new job, don't worry about it. <|endoftext|>
Are you ok <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Was it pretty bad or were you alright? <|endoftext|>
That's really thoughtful. <|endoftext|>
That sounds interesting. I am not very good at cooking. <|endoftext|>
That's always rough, are you still waiting on them to take notice? <|endoftext|>
That is the best way to do it. Do not look away! <|endoftext|>
That's a good sign!  Are you ready? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? I always thought presenting a presentation was kind of intimidating - LOL! <|endoftext|>
Oh my, why on earth did you do that? <|endoftext|>
Aww what does she do to you? <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Do you talk to him often? <|endoftext|>
maybe if you move closer you will lose less <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, do you have a job lined up or what <|endoftext|>
What do you have planned? <|endoftext|>
What happened to it? <|endoftext|>
That is a shame, what type of plant? <|endoftext|>
Oh nice.  I bet you have lots of fun. <|endoftext|>
That's kind of you <|endoftext|>
That is nice, does she make a lot of cookies? <|endoftext|>
She's pretty good for who? <|endoftext|>
You should also get off your chest and get off your chest yourself. There is so much harm happening around these parts these days. <|endoftext|>
Do you have kids or just work a lot? <|endoftext|>
I bet you were!  What did he end up getting offered? <|endoftext|>
He's going to be a legend. <|endoftext|>
I am very sorry to hear about your sister, she is in a better place now <|endoftext|>
Oh, well that's easy to deal with then. I am sorry you went through that! <|endoftext|>
It is a rough time but you will get over it. <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awesome, yeah I love those sorts of engineering degrees! <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a nice time. <|endoftext|>
You got that right. Life is too short to be stuck in it. <|endoftext|>
Whoa! What is going on next week? <|endoftext|>
oh thats a nice thing to do. what is the meal? <|endoftext|>
That sounds awesome. <|endoftext|>
Yeah man, that's great that you stay close to each other. <|endoftext|>
Aw, that is wonderful! I bet you're really proud. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
thats great, im happy for you, what kind of work is it? <|endoftext|>
I'm glad to hear that. What is your occupation? <|endoftext|>
Aw that is so mean!  Is your son ok? <|endoftext|>
Yes. I couldn't believe it <|endoftext|>
It's great that she's learning though, is she excited? <|endoftext|>
That is a bummer. Hope she didn't take anything too personal. <|endoftext|>
well, it was your lucky moon <|endoftext|>
Oh no that's unfortunate. It's hard to forget something so important when you're excited about it! <|endoftext|>
Why was it sneaky? <|endoftext|>
That is too bad. Hopefully she wasn't too close to him. <|endoftext|>
Wow, what was it? <|endoftext|>
What was it that you ignored? <|endoftext|>
You are so lucky to have a party like that! <|endoftext|>
What age is it <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  It is never too late to apologize.  That must have hurt deep. <|endoftext|>
That's okay, it's a difficult thing to do sometimes. <|endoftext|>
That is terrifying. Did you call the police? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's awesome. I bet that was a relief. <|endoftext|>
I get you. Sometimes we have to do those things. <|endoftext|>
I am sorry you had to go through that <|endoftext|>
That's amazing!  I have three kids, so I know exactly how you feel.  I wish I could experience that joy with my kids. <|endoftext|>
Good for you! You must be quite proud of them <|endoftext|>
That's unfortunate. Did you find a new job? <|endoftext|>
I agree 100 percent percent <|endoftext|>
Oh wow! I bet it drove like a tank <|endoftext|>
Oh that's no good! Civic's are reliable, but yeah people are crazy about those suVs and Jeeps!!! Just take your time getting used to driving safe cars :) <|endoftext|>
Thats awesome.   How many people <|endoftext|>
Where are they from? <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that seems like a lot of studying.  What happened? <|endoftext|>
I did not get that far, what is the next question? <|endoftext|>
I love those cards. <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean, it's just a social constructs that people use to feel better about things. <|endoftext|>
I am sure he had a lot of help. <|endoftext|>
What happened?! <|endoftext|>
Slippy-slingy? <|endoftext|>
So what happened next <|endoftext|>
What happened <|endoftext|>
That could be why! Do they want to break up? <|endoftext|>
Are you sad or excited or both? <|endoftext|>
OK tell me what it was then <|endoftext|>
Thats wonderful <|endoftext|>
She's so lucky to have a dad like you! <|endoftext|>
Yes work hard. Youll do great <|endoftext|>
That is great.  It's wonderful when your hard work pays off.  What is your profession? <|endoftext|>
That's too bad. I bet it's a fun house though if you had any family that was around too <|endoftext|>
Sounds like a plan. <|endoftext|>
You are lucky to have a brother like that <|endoftext|>
Yes, it is always good to have a good human being around. <|endoftext|>
That's great. I love being able to have those moments where we can say we got closer! <|endoftext|>
Yes but I want to break up so badly first. <|endoftext|>
That's awesome!  I wish my son would be like that! <|endoftext|>
That's wonderful to have these talented people around you.  There's a lot of hidden talents and personality there. <|endoftext|>
What kind of route are you going? <|endoftext|>
Why didn't you go out and do it yourself? <|endoftext|>
Oh I'm sorry to hear that.  What did you do when you found out? <|endoftext|>
I understand that.  I was only alive for a few years. <|endoftext|>
That is a very interesting story :) <|endoftext|>
oh no <|endoftext|>
Wow. Xbox one S. It is the best one. Just make sure you do what I say about it being used. <|endoftext|>
Dang, that was a while back. I like the series, but not the Halo games. Was that your first Halo game? <|endoftext|>
Oh no :(  That's too bad. <|endoftext|>
It is hard! Yes we do take them for granted. <|endoftext|>
Clam is a pretty cool dish to have as a lunch to hang with friends. <|endoftext|>
That is so annoying! I would just sit there and listen to the games. <|endoftext|>
That is awesome! What did you guys do? <|endoftext|>
Wow, is it a little bit like a mime <|endoftext|>
That's so sad <|endoftext|>
That is so great!  I am very happy for you! <|endoftext|>
Aww, that's sweet. What kind of bird was it? <|endoftext|>
How old were you when you put it in? <|endoftext|>
Did you graduate? <|endoftext|>
Which class was it? <|endoftext|>
Oh no. Who is she? <|endoftext|>
Oh that's okay! It doesn't always have to be about the birthday <|endoftext|>
Was there someone else there or was it just you? <|endoftext|>
Haha I wish.  Dresses stink <|endoftext|>
hope you feel better! <|endoftext|>
That sounds scary! I am glad you made it okay. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, sometimes things are just not worth stealing. <|endoftext|>
What happened? <|endoftext|>
Ohh! i bet that was a nice feeling <|endoftext|>
Headspace is awesome. I have listened to some pretty sad music on there. <|endoftext|>
oh that's great, where did you move to/what for the holiday? <|endoftext|>
That would be fun! You must be really fond of it <|endoftext|>
When will you find out? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah thats pretty cool. What was your major? <|endoftext|>
I'm excited about that too! What kind of book? <|endoftext|>
I'm not great at either.  I really like Chinese though.  What about you? <|endoftext|>
Awesome, what was the occasion? <|endoftext|>
Where is the cliff at? <|endoftext|>
Oh no thats impressive!! what did you do? <|endoftext|>
That's good that everything is going well. <|endoftext|>
That is the best thing that can ever happen to a human being!  Do you have any proof? <|endoftext|>
Oh you will <|endoftext|>
That's awful!! Are you ok? <|endoftext|>
that is good <|endoftext|>
oh man.. that stinks.. i know how you feel. <|endoftext|>
ok <|endoftext|>
That is good that you had access to that kind of information. <|endoftext|>
Why didn't it cost more? <|endoftext|>
I bet you were excited! <|endoftext|>
What is it <|endoftext|>
Oh no.  Did they know it was stolen? <|endoftext|>
What were they? <|endoftext|>
Oh no :(  I'm so sorry!! <|endoftext|>
Amazing, i bet it was fun <|endoftext|>
Yes you did.Life is what you make out of it. That is the key <|endoftext|>
I'm sorry to hear that. <|endoftext|>
That was nice of you! <|endoftext|>
Where did they go? <|endoftext|>
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <|endoftext|>
what kind of paper <|endoftext|>
Oh no! Did you find them afterwards? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? What about now>? <|endoftext|>
What?! It is the best thing ever!!! <|endoftext|>
That sucks. I have never tried something like that before <|endoftext|>
Why did you feel bad? <|endoftext|>
Did you ask him why? <|endoftext|>
That's a bad attitude. Just take it easy, I have to work with people who run a business <|endoftext|>
yea its like that sometimes <|endoftext|>
I agree. They should grow back and not be so flabby. <|endoftext|>
Have you seen a doctor about it yet? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes for health reasons? <|endoftext|>
It's okay, it's been 20 years. I'm not too old to remember <|endoftext|>
I am sorry, I have been there too <|endoftext|>
My wife is very proud of how much I've grown as a person :) I'm not wild about the idea of competing for the same thing. <|endoftext|>
I did that too.  Such a thrill <|endoftext|>
What was? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah?  That's great.  What do you love about it? <|endoftext|>
That's cool.  What kind of music do you produce. <|endoftext|>
That's cool man. Do you have a job lined up? <|endoftext|>
Yup. There are lots of books I've learned from the internet! <|endoftext|>
That's good to hear. Why do you think that is <|endoftext|>
What is going on? <|endoftext|>
Sometimes it's good to take a break. I like to watch youtube videos or read a good book when I get lonely. <|endoftext|>
Yeah I know how you feel, and it sucks, you will get there buddy <|endoftext|>
That's the truth <|endoftext|>
That is true <|endoftext|>
It is all about the diet and exercise. Dont let what you eat control your health! <|endoftext|>
What are you doing currently? <|endoftext|>
How fun! I love camping. What is your favorite part about it? <|endoftext|>
Oh yeah? I'll keep my fingers crossed it stays that way for you. <|endoftext|>
That is terrible and makes me sad <|endoftext|>
That's awful! <|endoftext|>
Was it pretty heavy? <|endoftext|>
Oh darn.  How old is it? <|endoftext|>
That's got to be a bad luck  cat.  It must have been a feline issue. <|endoftext|>
That is always a good sign. <|endoftext|>
What do you mean it's important to do that? <|endoftext|>
I know right <|endoftext|>
Oh no!  I can only imagine.  How come you can't take a breather in the day? <|endoftext|>
That's a rough state of mind I am assuming <|endoftext|>
I know what you mean!  My friends and I liked these fads too lol <|endoftext|>
Did you have any problems socialising with someone or just reading books? <|endoftext|>
wow, that is a great way to look at it. <|endoftext|>
I have heard that bath salts can increase anxiety and mood wh..��Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â <|endoftext|>
You got this! <|endoftext|>
How are you keeping the faith? <|endoftext|>
I do not either. <|endoftext|>
Who is that? <|endoftext|>
That's adorable. Did you help her open the bottle of dip sauce? <|endoftext|>
Oh that is not cool! <|endoftext|>
I have not heard of that, tell me more! <|endoftext|>
Well, it's like finding out a gold mine on your own. <|endoftext|>
Yes, how did you do it? <|endoftext|>
Really? I wish I could afford a new car. <|endoftext|>
Oh no. That's terrible. Did you get it back? <|endoftext|>
What?! thats a lot of money, what did you do? <|endoftext|>
Did you find a new place? <|endoftext|>
Oh no what happened??  What did you do? <|endoftext|>
That really stinks.. you should talk to him about going out again. That's annoying to hear about often. <|endoftext|>
I hate teething. It's not fun and makes you feel ill. <|endoftext|>
I know.  It makes me angry <|endoftext|>
I like the way you think <|endoftext|>
Why are you nervous? <|endoftext|>
That is awesome, I am happy for you <|endoftext|>
Oh no, that's unfortunate. <|endoftext|>
I can only imagine the excitement that went through your head watching that <|endoftext|>
Ah - that is too bad. <|endoftext|>
Yeah, it's stressful, but you need to do something when you're that close to retirement, right? <|endoftext|>
That happened to me last month. I have never been able to sleep with the lights off. I am a light sleeper so I cannot do that <|endoftext|>
haha.. ok. You ok? Was there something wrong? <|endoftext|>
I nearly stole too when i was younger...crap was scared of the cops <|endoftext|>
What did you learn on it? <|endoftext|>
Wow! Is this your first? <|endoftext|>
Everything is always good in a bag of holding. It's like your body is telling you to do something. <|endoftext|>
I agree 100 percent.  Now it's just about the holidays.  It's the period the kids go to hang out with their parents. <|endoftext|>
I know that feeling, man. We always worry about the bad stuff. <|endoftext|>
did you say anything? <|endoftext|>
Whoa, that's intense, what happened? <|endoftext|>
Wow...That is crazy. Someone hit a car that was parked?! <|endoftext|>
Well, you're a good person then, customer service is where you need to be! <|endoftext|>
What kind was it <|endoftext|>
That is amazing. I love that candy, how is that made? <|endoftext|>
That's good. Is she a gymnast or dancer? <|endoftext|>
They do remember. They were always talking to you when you were younger. I can remember because I had one when I was in my 20s. <|endoftext|>
I am happy for you. <|endoftext|>
Did he get fined for doing that? <|endoftext|>
That stinks...was it to somewhere else? <|endoftext|>
His work said what <|endoftext|>
What is that? <|endoftext|>
I don't normally but I was scared when I had to go into work on saturday. <|endoftext|>
Yuck! that is gross <|endoftext|>
I would have to agree with you there, I would prefer if they were not common at all. <|endoftext|>
You will do fine! Don't worry. <|endoftext|>
Good for you. It's always good to sleep when studying. <|endoftext|>
