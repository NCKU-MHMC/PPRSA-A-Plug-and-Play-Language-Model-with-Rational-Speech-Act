That is really scary.  What happened?
That's good that you are a good person.
How did you do it?
They are not punished for his actions.  They are just held accountable for their actions.  It's a very hard time for the family of the victim.
That is terrible, what happened?
Well, I'm glad you guys can agree on things.
Oh that sounds fun! What was the concert about?
Oh that is awesome! I love U2!
That is so sad. It is so hard when people don't want to help.
That is so sad. I am sorry to hear that.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Did you take him to the hospital?
That's a great time to be a kid.
That is good to hear!  What kind of job is he looking for?
What was it that you are thankfull for?
Oh no! I am so sorry.  You must be so scared and worried.
Oh, that's good. I hope everything goes well with him.
That's awesome! What is the next month?
Did you not like them?
That is so unfair.  I would have been very upset as well.  That is not a good job to have.
Oh no, that's terrible!  Did he get in trouble?
That's a bummer.  What did you do?
What happened?
That's very nice of you. I am sure you will be well received by your friend.
I'm glad that it worked out.
I love it when my kids are sleeping
i agree too
That is so sad, how do you communicate with your friends?
Why did you want to join a group for local moms?
That's really annoying. You're right, she doesn't discipline him. She's always letting him do what he wants and it's really annoying.
That's awful. I just don't understand why people can't just let their kids have fun.
I'm sure it was just a tiny little bug.
I wish I could be like that with my ex, but that's not possible. I'm glad you were able to have a good conversation with her.
That's nice to hear. I'm sorry to hear you miss her.
I bet that was an amazing experience.  What was it like?
I agree, and I'm sure you are very happy with your child.
I'm glad I have my bank account, it's always a relief when you get that check!
I know. I was in a car accident and I was in the hospital for a few days. I was scared, but I was so grateful that I was alive.
That must be a tough situation, but I hope you are okay.
I am sorry to hear that. It must have been very difficult for her.
I think that's one of the most important things to do in life.
That's a good way to put it. I've found that to be true, especially when I'm on a journey of self-discovery.
That sounds like a fun party!  I love surprise parties!
I hate when that happens.
I understand that, I have a friend who is a single mom and she lives with her 3 kids.  It is tough.
That is so sad.  Do you have a girlfriend?
I know that feeling. It's like they're going to grow up and be so different from you.
Yeah, I would be a little surprised by that. I can't imagine that would work.
What was it?
Oh no, you must have been late.
I'm glad you were able to visit an orphanage.
I love that. Kids are always full of knowledge and wisdom.
That is good to hear. I hope that so too.
I'm sure it did. But I'm sure she was able to find a way to make it work.
That's not good. What did you do?
What happened?
I am so sorry to hear that.
That's good to hear! What kind of work is it?
I'd like to see a lot more of that. It's a great feeling to know that I'm making a difference, I think.
I have a lot of things I need to do.  I am trying to make a new start and that is a scary thing.
Oh no, that's too bad. I hope you're all doing well.
That is really long. I am glad you are having a good time with your family
That sounds awesome!  What was your pace?
Wow, that's so awesome! I love running in new places, and Venice is so beautiful!
What marathon?
That's so disappointing. What did you do?
That is unfortunate, I am sorry to hear that.
I agree with you.  It's like you are saying that we have to be stronger to stand up for what we believe in.
I know what you mean. I am a very angry person.
Oh, that's terrible.  I hope she is okay.  It's always hard to tell kids that their pets have passed away.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm going to have to do that with my kids as well.
Oh I can imagine, that must have been an exciting experience!
That sounds like a great time to grow up. What was your favorite part of the trip?
That sounds like a great time.  Did you have a good time?
I'm glad you're happy about your life.
That's really nice of her. I love organizing and decluttering.
That is true, I have a few bins and labels. It helps me keep the house organized!
I agree. I've gotten a few responses and some where i just get a blank space.
I agree.  I'm a text person myself.  But I think there are ways to make emails more effective.  I don't know if I could do that as a work person though.  It's just too much work.
That is bad. What happened?
It seems you are in a difficult situation.
That must have been really tough! I can only imagine how you felt.
Did you travel alone or with a group?
That is true. People tend to do that all the time.
I know what you mean. I had a bit of a rough day.
That's not good! Did she get upset with you?
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you can get over him
I am so sorry to hear that,  was the son able to defend himself?
That is nice of her, she must have been a good person to be so kind.
That's a good attitude. What are you doing to stay healthy?
That's good.  Do you have a family?
I'm sure that feeling is normal.  It's good to look back and remember the good times.
I have two young kids.  Are you a parent?
I bet you felt so confident.
I know what you mean.
That's a good point. It's hard to know what to expect.
I love that you have a part-time job that you love.  That is a good way to make money while you are still in school.
What happened?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What is his name?
Oh, wow! That sounds amazing!  I've never been to a large beachfront condo before, I'm sure it's really nice.  Are you guys planning a romantic getaway?
I love that! The beach is so beautiful! I am so excited for you guys!
What happened?
That's so rude of her.
That is so scary. I am sorry that happened to you and your mom.
Oh no, that sounds very scary. I hope you were able to get away from him.
Oh no, what happened?
What did you say?
I bet you did.  Did you talk about it with her afterwards?
Oh no! I hope you are okay.
Oh yes! I'm sure you did!
That was a bummer. I would have been so disappointed.
That's a pretty cool story. I can't wait to hear it!
Oh no! How is he doing?
What a wonderful surprise!  I love surprises!  What is your favorite thing to get as a gift?
I would have done the same thing, I love that kind of kindness!
I'm sure you will do great, that is a big opportunity.
That sounds like a great project.  What was it?
I'm sure you did, what happened?
Did you find out what happened to DiDi?
That must have been so uncomfortable.
Oh that's terrible. I am so sorry. What happened?
That is a bummer!  I hope they got it fixed soon.
I'm sorry to hear that, how long have you been relying on them?
That is a bad move. You should have told her.
I would have felt bad for her. I would have felt bad for me.
Oh wow, that sounds like a funny moment. What happened next?
Oh no, did you have a good laugh?
That sounds like a great time! I'm jealous.
What's your favorite place to go there?
That's amazing! I'm proud of you too!
That's great.  You're making money so you can do what you want.  You should be proud of yourself.
Wow, that's a pet peeve of mine too! I hate it when people just leave their carts there.
That's a good idea. I like to do that too.
That must have been exciting. How old are you?
That's great! Do you have any plans or things you're looking forward to?
That sounds like a really productive way to spend your time.
I think I have heard of that before, I'm not really sure what it means.
I agree. It's so refreshing to see leaders who are willing to surround themselves with people who can help them grow.
Yes I agree. It is a trap to be in a position of power, but a leader is not a leader when they are too afraid to take a stand and lead.
That's so sweet. I love baby animals.
I've seen that movie. It's funny how we tend to remember it better as a kid.
I can't imagine how special that must have been. What did you get for mom?
That's so sweet.  It's nice to take the time to think about what you're giving.
I think it went wrong because the person was too lazy.
I think they did, I am sure of it.
I am sorry to hear that.
That is great! What kind of baby is she expecting?
What a wonderful surprise.  Do you have a baby on the way?
I was watching Netflix. I don't know what I was supposed to do instead.
That's a pretty good show.
That sounds interesting. What kind of mystery?
That's good to hear. I've been there myself.
That is amazing. How did you win?
Oh that's terrible, what was the reason?
I am sorry you had to go through that!  I hope you are okay!
That's really scary. What happened?
Oh? Which ones?
That is amazing.  I am sure she is very proud of herself.  What is her major?
That is awesome. I love friends like that.
Oh no! That's not good. Are you sure you didn't kill it?
I hope everything is okay.
Oh wow! I bet you got lots of responses. Did you get a puppy?
What was the ad for?
That is so awesome that you have a good relationship with your parents!
I'm sure you will do great things, you have a great support system.
I can understand that.
I wish you all the best.
That is so unfair!  He is a great surgeon though.  I'm sure he would be a great friend.
I'm sure he has good insurance.  I don't have a lot of money, so I'm just glad I don't have to deal with a lot of lawsuits.
That sounds like a very positive conversation. I hope you get a job soon!
I'm glad to hear that! I'm sure you'll do great in your new role.
I don't know. It was really scary.
Oh that is true, I agree.
Wow, that is a pretty generous friend you have.
Oh wow, I bet you are super excited about that!
I love geckos! I have a bunch of them at home.
I remember when I was a kid, it was the best place to go. I would go there all the time.
That's awesome! I'm glad you had a conversation about it.
That's awesome! I'm a bit old to remember the 90's.
I used to have Facebook too. I remember the old days.
I am 37. I was a child in the 80s.
I feel you, I hate bullies too
I am trying to be more patient. I am not very good at it.
I love the movie!
I agree. I think the movie is going to be a disaster.
That's not good. Why do they do that?
That's true. I'm always running into something I need, but I never have enough. I wish I could save more.
I would say it's because they are young and inexperienced.
I like ants.
Why is that?
Oh no, that's terrible.  Do you think she will be okay?
That's a nice name. What did you do?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What was it?
That's really tough. Did you ever get one?
That is so awesome! I am so happy for you!
I'm glad you are happy.
It is fun, but it can be stressful.
That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.
Oh no! That was so scary! I hate it when the power goes out!
I don't have lighters. What are you going to do?
I love studying for exams. I'm a psychology major myself.
That's great! What kind of test did you take?
I do, I have 3 dogs.
Oh wow!  I have never had a cat.  Do you think it would be a good fit for you?
Wow! Congratulations. What a milestone!
Oh, what's it like?
That is very hard.  I am sorry.  How did you cope?
I am sorry to hear that, I hope you are doing alright.
That is really cool.
That's awesome.  Are you a fan of coffee?
That's terrible. I would be very upset if I had to lose my favorite things.
That's pretty cool! I love that necklace!
That is so nice. I have been trying to get my daughter to donate some of her old toys to the kids at the local hospital.
I have! I love oldies.
That's a good point. I'm glad you're able to find some happiness in it.
That is too sad, I am sorry.
That is so sad.  What happened to him?
That's unfortunate. What happened to your dog?
That's so right! I'm so sick right now.
I'm sorry to hear that! What did you end up doing?
I have never tried raw shellfish.
I love ketchup, I'd have been dead by now!
That's great! What happened?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. What are you going to do?
That's a tough situation. You will have to make a decision that you will be happy with.
Oh that sounds scary. Are you sure you're ready for it?
Oh that sounds like fun. Are they really friends?
It's tough when that happens.  I hope you can find another girl to love.
What is your dream?
Oh wow! I have never been in a relationship before.
I hope that happens!
I have had a few.  I had a friend that passed away a few years ago.
Oh wow! I am glad to hear that!
I'm curious, what is it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think it's going to be a long time before you two are friends again?
Oh no! Did you see who was doing it?
What happened?
I do, it's so cozy.
I've never tried it, but I'm open to trying it.
That's great. I'm sure you appreciate her.
It's a nice gesture to try to keep in touch with someone.
I am sure it will happen again. It happens to the best of us
Oh yeah, I did.  I was really nervous, but I did okay.
That's so sweet! You're lucky to have such a great mom.
I love my mom.
That's terrible. Did you try to get her attention?
That is understandable. How long will she be out for?
I have no idea. I am so sorry.
I am not sure if I get paid well. I'm a teacher.
That's great! You must be feeling very confident.
I can imagine. What is your passion in life?
I'm sorry, that is terrible. Are you a scared person or just a fearful person?
I'm glad you're interested in them. I've always been interested in them too.
Oh, I love all kinds of movies. What is your favorite movie?
I'm not really a fan of scary movies. I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings series.
I'm sorry, but I don't think that's correct. He's the president of the United States.
I agree. I think he is a disaster.
That's exciting, I'm sure you'll do great things.
I am glad you have a major you enjoy!
That is nice.  How long have you been together?
Wow, that's really nice! What's his name?
I do! I love looking back and remembering my childhood.
That's so cool, I love animals.
That is quite a turn of events. I bet you are upset.
I'm sure you'll get it together.
I am not sure what you are asking.
I don't know. I am confused.
That is really nice of her.  I bet you were happy for her.
I agree. I hate to see people being mean to each other. It's not the way to make friends.
That is awful! I am so sorry. Did he die?
I hope you do.
I can understand that. Is it a new or old car?
I am sure you will! What made you feel inferior?
That is great.  I am sure she feels the same way.  What is your name?
I have a special one!
That's great to hear. I wish I had a family like that.
I'm close to my husband and kids. We are so happy to have them.
What was it about the card?
What happened?
Oh no! Did you ever get them back?
Oh wow, what was so scary?
That is amazing! What did you graduate with?
I've been thinking about it too.  I think it would be a great place to live.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Nice.  I bet you were a little disappointed.
Oh? Why?
I'm sure you'll find something to do.
That is exciting! Are you going to enter the contest?
I bet it is! I hope you win!
I am sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan to help him?
That is quite interesting. What are they?
That's a relief. Did she have a good trip?
I know that feeling. I'm sad when I have to leave my family
Oh no! What did you do?
That's a bummer. Did you get it all cleaned up?
That's a tough situation. What did you do?
I am sure it is very frustrating. What did you miss out on?
I'm sorry to hear that.  How did you respond?
I am so sorry to hear that.
Oh yeah? What kind of job?
Yeah, Steve Jobs is a legend.
I know the feeling, we had a couple of years of being apart after the baby. It's hard to adjust to new life with an older child.
That's awesome. I'm glad you found someone who loved you.
I love Bill & Ted! What is it?
What kind of car is that?
I bet he is a great kid!
Oh wow. I bet that's quite a situation.
I have! She's a reality TV star!
Oh yeah, I'm sure you have a lot to tell me about. What's been going on?
I don't know. I don't know what you are talking about.
I hate when that happens. What do you order?
I love a good coffee. Do you?
That is amazing. I hope he is happy.
How wonderful! What a wonderful family you have!
Oh no! What did you do?
I hate when that happens.  What did you order?
I know! I hate when that happens. I think it's because they don't check the ingredients.
I agree, I feel the same way.
I know the feeling.  How did she react?
I can't believe that. You should have asked for a refund.
What a stinky mess! I hope you cleaned it up.
Did you wear them all the time?
I agree, I can't make chicken and rice without it being a disaster
Oh I'm a bit of a messy cook, so I'm not sure I could do that.
That's awesome! Did you know the baby's gender before?
Yeah, it's a boy.  I'm glad I got to meet him.  Did you have a good time?
That is terrible.  Did you talk to him about it?
Did he listen?
Well, I hope you did well on it!
What was the question?
I bet it was! I am a bit of a blind person myself, and I have been to a few concerts where the performers are blind.
Oh no! I hope he is okay.
That is horrible! What happened?
That's terrible! I'm sorry to hear that.
That is so cool! How is he doing?
Oh wow, that's a lot of babies! I bet you're exhausted!
Oh my, is that the house of your neighbor?
You're crazy!
That is terrible.  I am so sorry.  How long has he been in prison?
What a terrible situation! I hope you get to be reunited soon!
That is great news!  I am sure he is very happy.
That is cool.  I bet he is going to do great things in the league.
That's amazing. I am so happy for you.
That is great!
Oh my goodness! I am so scared!
That sounds like a pretty wild ride. Did you get away with the diamonds?
That's wonderful.  I'm so glad you are grateful.
Wow, that's great. I can only imagine how nice it must be to have someone take care of you.
Oh man! That sounds like a disaster! Did you get the chance to get them back?
That is great!  You must have been the funniest kid in the class.
That's awesome. I love his music too.
I'm sure you have had a lot of fun!
Yeah that's terrible. Did you try to find out who was responsible?
Oh no! I hope they are able to get it cleaned up and produce safe food again.
I'm glad you have a lot. I have to work hard for the things I have.
I agree. It is very good to help people.
What were you doing?
I am sure she will forgive you.
That is hilarious.  Did he get mad?
Haha! That is hilarious! I can imagine you looking like a victim, but at least you got a good story out of it.
Did you confront her?
I'm sorry, what happened?
That is very admirable of him.
That is amazing.  I bet he was grateful to have been able to save up those days.
I would be mad.
that is good to know.
What did you do?
I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding.
That's so sad, why did you have to leave?
I can understand that.  I have never had to shower in front of guys.  I think boys should shower at least once a week.
I remember that time very well. What happened?
That's awesome! I'm glad you have such a wonderful mom.
I know right?  I got a job offer from a company I had never heard of.  I didn't even have a job lined up.  I was like "yes" but I had no idea what the job was.  It was nice to not have to worry about it.
That is a terrible thing to have happen.  I hope you were able to find some closure.
That's cool! I don't know much about him but he is a popular actor.
That's really cool. I've always been a bit of a scaredy-cat.
That is so cool.  What happened?
Wow, how did you find out?
I'm sorry to hear that. I would be too.
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Did you ever see him again?
Oh no, what happened?
That is a lot of hard work.  I am sure you are very proud of yourself.
That's great, I'm sure you'll have an easy time in the future.
That's awesome! I have one daughter.
That's great! I'm so happy for you.
You must have been very motivated. What was it for?
What happened?
Oh, that's funny. What were you doing?
I love music! I used to listen to a lot of rock and pop music when I was in my twenties.
That's true.  It's always hard to find good music these days.
That is so awesome! I am so excited for you!
I love Far Cry, I think you will love it too.
What a great move! Congratulations!
That is very cool. Did you get the position because of your talent or your work ethic?
That sounds like a great opportunity, I'm sure you will excel.
I am sorry to hear that. Did you try to improve?
I can't do it either.  I always feel like I am going to get hit.
I feel the same way, it's frustrating.
I know right? I've been through a lot myself. I'm glad you're where you are now.
Wow!  That is amazing!  What made you get sober?
Oh that's great! I hope you get the job!
That's not cool. Did you get upset?
Oh no. What happened?
That's great! I hope it works out for him!
I am a security guard.  What kind of security do you have?
Wow, that is scary. Did you have any friends around?
That's so scary.
That is awesome!  Congratulations!  I bet you are so proud.
Oh wow that is amazing!
i have. i was in a car wreck a few years ago.
Oh no, what happened?
I have. It was a guy. I got beat.
I am sorry to hear that. Did you win the fight?
I have, I loved it when I was younger.
That's awesome! I've never heard of it. I need to go check it out!
I have. I love it! What was your favorite?
I can understand that.  I'm a little short on money, so I don't have the ability to eat there often.
I have, and it was terrifying!
Oh my goodness, what was it?
I have, but I don't think I would have been scared enough to ride it!
Oh that's really cool!  Did you find it more rewarding than other jobs?
That's not cool, I don't understand why you would do that.
I bet you were very upset.
I hope you are and that you have a safe trip!
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it a place you have been to before?
That's amazing. I am so happy for her.
Oh, that's good to hear. What job did she get?
That is bad. I hope you find a new job.
That's so sweet! I'm sure it was a great surprise.
Oh wow, that's great! I'm happy for you!
That's good you didn't let her get to you.
Oh that's great! Did you make any mistakes the day before?
Oh, that's bad. Did you get to meet the steakhouse anyway?
That is nice of her! I'm glad you made it up to her.
I know right?
I get it. I'm a mom too. I like to take care of my kids and then have some time for myself.
That's a bummer.  I bet you missed out on some good weather.  Are you planning on going on the next nice day?
I can understand that. I have a lot of experience driving in the snow, but I still have my hands on the wheel.
That's so smart. I have to admit I wouldn't be driving in the first place.
I bet. Did you ever get used to not having a mom?
I think it's a bit different for everyone.  I think it's good that you have time to think about it now.
Oh no! Did you guys have to get back to the house?
That's great! Did you go anywhere exciting?
That's cool! What did you do?
I bet that was fun!
That's not a good feeling to have, but I'm sure you can find a way to make it right.
Oh no! What happened?
What happened?
Oh yeah, I've been there too. I used to play a lot of games when I was younger.
Oh no. I'm so sorry. I know how that goes.
I'm sorry to hear that. What do you mean by "options"
That's awesome!  How did she do that?
I bet that was a great feeling.
What is the height of the ride?
Why?
Oh no! Was she flirting with him?
Oh that's good! I hope you can forgive him!
That's crazy! What did you do?
That is terrible.  I am so sorry that you are not able to get a job on the top floor.
What subject did you graduate with?
I can see why. You must have worked really hard to get to that point.
That sounds like a pretty rough situation. What happened next?
That is very good. What did you do to fix it?
That's cool. What did you do?
That's so cool! I think you should too.
What happened?
I bet you were sad when he passed away.
Oh no!  Did you try to clean it up or just let it be?
That's the truth. I was at a concert last year and the singer was really bad.
I am sure you will be fine.
That is good. I am sure people will understand.
What a wonderful day you had!  I love spending time with my kids and family.  I can imagine you all had a great time!
That must have been difficult.
That's great to hear, I love it!
I agree with you, I have been trying to get people to see the beauty of nature. It's really amazing.
That is the worst part about working in a company, when someone who you admire is a jerk
That is so true.  I was reading about a guy who got a huge promotion at work and was told he was going to be promoted to a higher position.  He thought he was going to be promoted because he was the only one that was promoted.
It's funny how those things stick with you.  It's funny how they can make you remember them so long after they're over.
That's too bad. I think they're a lot more common these days.
That is awesome. It is always good to have a good parent.
Oh that's bad. I hate when that happens.
That is a great way to do it.
That sounds amazing!  What are you moving to?
I've heard of that, sounds really interesting.
Oh no, what did you get?
That's great.  I'm glad you got to experience that.
I am glad you received something you wanted.
I am sure you do not have to work hard.
Who is he?
That's terrifying. You should be scared, but you should also drive carefully.
that sucks.  do you have any glasses at night?
I hate when that happens. It always makes me so mad.
That sounds really rude. I hope you didn't get mad at them.
I know how you feel. Sometimes I just yell at my baby and then I feel guilty when he gets all snuggled up and falls asleep.
I can imagine. How long have you been a mother?
That's great.  What do you do?
I do, but I'm a little busy this time of year.  I don't have time to take care of them as much as I used to.  I hope you have fun!
That's awesome! I'm sure they're going to be great!
I'm sorry to hear that. It's never easy to have kids with disabilities.
That's great! You must be so happy!
I'm sorry you're struggling financially.
I bet you worked hard.  What did you study?
I hope you felt good about it, you must be proud!
What was your surprise?
I know how that feels.  I used to be able to buy just about anything with it.
Oh man that is terrible. What did he say?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's really good that you got your driver's license! It's a pretty scary thing to do.
Oh no, what happened?
That sounds like a great idea. I've never tried it before.
Did they grow really long?
Wow, that is awesome. What are you going to do with them?
I agree. I hate driving in traffic.
I hate when people don't use their turn signals.
That is really cool. What kind of game was it?
I met my friends on Facebook. We all connected on a few different things.
I am sure that is true
I am good, but I do hope you are too!
That sounds like a wild ride! What happened?
I bet. Did you ever get to see her?
That is amazing!  She must be smart and hardworking.  I am so proud of her!
I agree. I've always been a self-taught person.
That's terrible! I'm sure you are so mad at her!
I have that problem with my dog. I hate to take her outside in the rain.
I agree, being with someone you love can make you stronger and more confident
I am sure that is true!
That is so true. I hate it when that happens too.
I've seen that happen.  It's hilarious!  What is the dog's name?
Oh really? What do you mean?
Oh that sounds great. What do you like to do when you have time?
Oh yeah, I've never been one for social interaction.
What happened?
What kind of party?
How do you feel when you forget things?
Oh no, did you say anything to her about it?
That sounds like a lot of fun, where did you go?
Oh, I don't really know.
That is awesome!  Did you have a hard time getting there?
I bet you feel a lot of pride! What did you study?
I hate when that happens too. I had to clean up his vomit from the carpet.
How did it end?
That is so annoying.
That is a good point.
I love Qdoba.  What did you order?
Oh that's so cool. I love queso.
That is amazing. I bet he must be a very talented child.
Wow, that's amazing! What was their major?
Are you talking about his intelligence or his talent?
That is amazing.  What industry is he in?
That's awesome! I bet he had a blast playing.
I can see that.  Is he a good teacher?
Yeah, that can be tough. I'm sorry that happened to you.
That's a good thing, I don't like to waste time on things that aren't worth it.
I hope you have a great time with your dogs and that you meet some new people!
I love dogs, I think I would be a good fit for a dog.
That is so nice of him, you are lucky to have him as a neighbor.
Oh, I think I do! Did you get a gift?
That's pretty annoying.  I have a dog that barks at everything.  I wish she would just keep it inside.
That's okay. What's wrong with him?
Oh my, what happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope everything is okay.
That is really nice. I would love to go hang out with my friends.
That's tough. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing okay.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm so sorry.
I am sure you appreciate it.
That's so frustrating.  I hate waiting around for anything.
That's great! I'm glad to hear that you found a job you enjoy.
That is sad, she must be feeling a bit lonely
I bet she is.  What does she like to do?
I'm sure you will. You seem like a very prepared person.
I think that sounds like a lot of fun.
That's awesome! Did you have a good week?
I bet.
I feel the same way. I have a lot of friends.
How did you overcome it?
That's not good. I'm sure you didn't mean to, but you should have talked to him about it before.
That is very true.
I can understand that. It's a huge gap, but I'm sure you'll get there too
I know what you mean. I have a hard time keeping up with my kids' school work and it's so frustrating.
That's awesome. What kind of job were you interviewing for?
Yes, you are so lucky to get this job.
That is cool. I have a few too.
That's nice, I hope it's not too expensive to clean it up.
That is a good point. I always thought that kids should be happy to go to school.
I agree. They should be worried about the kids' education.
Wow, that's so nice of you! I bet he was so scared and lonely.
That's a nice name. I'm glad you were able to get him to your son.
Oh, I understand. I have two teenagers too and they're both going to college this year.
Oh? You mean like what?
Oh wow, I hope she gets it!
Well, that's a good thing. I'm glad she is happy.
That's terrible. I'm so sorry for your poor dog. Did the vet find anything?
I know it's tough to deal with them, but they're just a minor phase. They usually go away on their own and it's not a big deal.
That's the worst. I think I would have felt that way too.
I think you should tell her.
Oh no, that is so frustrating!  How did you get caught up in it?
That's a bummer. Did they yell at you?
Oh that sounds amazing! What are you going to do?
That is a good thing to be nervous about.
That sounds very pretty. Did you get to see her?
I'm sorry to hear that.
What kind of bird was it?
Oh, was it a good dog?
I am sorry to hear that. How is she?
That is terrible.  I am so sorry.  Is there anyone that can take care of him?
That's awesome! What a wonderful surprise!
That is a lot of time.
I am sorry to hear that. I hope everything is okay.
Oh that's ridiculous.  I love the sound of tupperware!
Oh wow! Did you get it?
That is great! Congratulations! What award?
I am just happy that I got the job, it's a great opportunity for me to learn and grow.
I agree. I am always looking forward to the future.
I feel you.  I was going to interview for a job I really wanted, and I was really nervous.  I felt like I was going to break down.
Oh yeah, I've had that before. It's a good way to get to know the interviewer.
I understand.  I am not a good parent either.  My kids are 19 and 22.  I am not sure if I am good enough to be a good parent.
That is terrible, I hate when that happens. I bet you felt so grossed out.
I know what you mean.  I think that's the worst feeling in the world.
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't imagine how hard it must be.
Wow, that's a bummer. How old is she?
That sounds fun! Did you get a great deal on anything?
Oh that's great! Where are you going?
Did you hear that?
Oh no! Did you catch her?
Oh wow, that sounds like a nasty situation. I hope she got cleaned up pretty good.
Aww that sounds like a great day!  I'm glad you're having a good day.  What are you watching?
Well you can't go wrong with a good night's sleep, so enjoy it!
What happened after?
That's nice, what kind of lab was it?
I am too. I am a big believer in my spouse
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you're okay.
I am glad to hear that.
I am so sorry, but I am not sure what you are talking about.
I'm glad you're thankful. What is it that you are thankful for?
I am so sorry to hear that. What happened?
Wow, what kind of garden?
I'm glad to hear that! What happened?
Oh no, that's terrible. What happened?
Oh no! What did you order?
I hope they do too. I am so glad you have someone to speak to.
Oh no, what happened?
That's okay. I'm glad you are feeling better
I am happy for you, what is your job?
Oh yeah? What association?
I can imagine.  Did you try to talk to anyone?
I agree, I used to do the same thing.
What type of food is it?
I'm curious what you have planned?
That sounds like a great place to live!
That's quite a long time to be stuck in one place.
Oh that is amazing.  What did you think?
Oh, what happened?
Oh, that's great. I'm glad everything worked out for you.
I am sorry to hear that.  What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have a close relationship with her?
I'm happy to help you out.
Oh wow! That is so exciting! I would be so happy!
That is great! I hope he is a great boy!
That is good to hear.  I am sure she appreciates that.
I'm glad you were honest, now you can get the support you need to make things right.
That's awesome! What kind of truck is it?
I agree, I am a trucker, and I love my truck.
That is great! I hope it is too!
That's a great attitude to have!
Oh no! I hope she feels better soon!
I don't know what it means, but I'm glad you are doing well!
I think that's a very good idea to believe that.
That's very good.
That's great! I'm glad to hear that you're a proud parent!
I'm glad you have a nice girl in your life.
I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm not sure what to say.  Do you have a reason for not loving him?
I know what you mean. I was watching a game the other day and a fan of the opposing team made a joke about me. I was not happy
I hope it works out for you!
That's great news! I'm sure it is a lot of openings. I love tech.
That sucks! Are you looking forward to it or are you panicking?
I'm sure it's good for her, but for you it's just a little uncertain.
That's terrible. I'm sure you are not a dinosaur.
I am sorry to hear that.
I would have done the same thing!
That's a bummer. I wish I had self control.
Wow, that's great news! I'm so happy for you and your husband.
He sounds like a good man! I'm glad he's working hard for you!
What kind of dog?
That is good, I hope you don't have to deal with car noise too much.
I've lost my favorite hoodie before. I'm so sorry!
I know that feeling!  You should do it!
That's awesome! I bet you haven't seen them in a long time. How old are they now?
Oh, that's nice! I'm sure it's a fun time for you!
That is awesome, I'm glad she was able to make it home.
That's true. It's hard to know where to start when you've just moved.
That's annoying. I'm sure you felt like you were being disturbed.
That's terrible, it's like they are not even listening to the people.
I can imagine.
I am sure she did. She must have heard something that scared her.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.  How did you feel about it?
That sucks. Did you ever have a girlfriend?
I am glad to hear that. I know that life is tough for many people, but it is nice to have good things to look forward to.
I am glad you have been able to assimilate it.
Well I think you are right, you have to take responsibility for your life.
I love that. What kind of condition are you talking about?
That's so sad. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
I'm sorry you are going through that. I hope things get better for you.
Oh no, what's the problem?
I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.
I think that's a great day to do that.
I feel the same way about my kids. I love having them in my life.
I know how you feel. I'm a little lonely too.
I totally get that. I'm a bit awkward myself.
That sounds great, I hope you get to go and pick her up quickly.
What happened to her?
That is great! Where are you going?
That sounds so much fun!
That's terrible.  I hope you can find a good caterer.
I guess that is a good thing though, if she was a guy, would you expect the same?
I get that. Sometimes we can't help how we act.
That's not nice.  I would have told her it was free.
I had a good day. Did you?
I'm so sorry, but I'm not a human. I'm an AI.
yea it was alright i was tired
I would have thought it was a bit of a bummer to have a great day and then not be able to go out.
I know what you mean. I wear the same pair of socks to church and to work, and I wear different pairs for different occasions. But I can't be too picky. I have to be able to run fast and be able to hear the pastor's voice.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet you were glad to have friends to party with!
I'm sure you did! That's great!
Oh I'm sure they will!
That's tough. Do you have a good support system?
I can understand that. I've always been a shy person, but I've worked a lot on my social skills over the years.
That is really sad.  Why did you feel bad?
That's too bad. I hope you have some fun with the dogs.
That is really scary.  Are you okay?
That sounds like a real jerk.
Oh no, what happened?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?
That's nice. Did you ever leave?
I know the feeling. It's hard to let go of the past.
That is so crazy.  I don't like that kind of atmosphere.  Was it a party?
That's terrible. I hope your friend is okay.
What did you do during the interview?
I hope that it turns out that way.
Oh no, that's a bit of a disaster!
I am glad you are not too hard on yourself, it is okay to make mistakes.
I don't know what you're talking about. What is going on?
That's a good point. I know I've ordered some heavy things like 40 pound boxes and they often come in a box that's too small for the box.
Ahhh! I hope everything is ok too! How did you do on the test?
Oh that's always good to have a check up on. I hope everything is fine.
I have been flooded so many times.
I love the summer. We always have a blast.
That's awesome. What kind of car is it?
That's great to hear!  What kind of career are you thinking about?
I completely agree. It's hard to see things go wrong when everything seems to be going right.
That is true. I never really thought about it but I agree with it.
Wow, that's tough. I hope you get another chance!
I'm sorry to hear that.  How long have you been looking for a job?
I'm jealous of my coworkers. I have to work with them all day.
I was. I did not get the promotion.
That sucks! You should have a friend or family member to take care of him.
You are probably not bored at all!
Oh I see. What did you do?
I agree with you. I think in a situation like this, there should be consequences.
Oh no, that's terrible! What did you do?
That is horrible. I am so sorry.
Oh that's so nice. I wish my niece was here.
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can get through this.
That's the best way to be safe!
I'm a doctor!
I am happy for her, I am so proud of her.
That's great. It's great to see people succeed at an older age.
That's a pretty good reflection.  How did it make you feel?
I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of job are you in?
What a terrible thing to happen.  I hope you were able to get the tree down.  How did you feel about it?
That is really nice of him. I bet it was a lot of work.
That's cool. I'm sure you will get famous too.
Oh that sounds awful. I don't know why people are so hard to get along with.
I understand, I think it's when things go wrong in life that you appreciate what you have now more.
I think you're right.  I used to think that I was the smartest kid in school, but my parents would always give me money and I would be so happy.
That's terrible! I hope you can get some help from the police.
That is horrible! I hope they get caught!
I would be so upset. Did you call the police?
I hope they do too
Oh no.  Was there anything you could do to try to get another shot?
That's a good attitude to have. Are you looking for something more stable than what you're currently doing?
I am sorry.  What did you do?
Oh no! That's so sad!
That's pretty annoying. Maybe you can buy a vacuum?
You're right, it is. I guess she's trying to tell you something.
That's great. Where are you going?
Oh wow! Are you going to Somalia?
That's no good. I am sure you felt bad about it.
That's not good. I hope you are taking care of yourself.
Oh wow! What was the prize?
Why did you win?
I hate that.  Did you tell him to stop?
I agree. I feel like if you ask how you're doing, you get a lot of unnecessary chatter.
Oh no, did you open it?
Oh I see.  Do you think it will happen soon?
That's really embarrassing. Did you get upset?
I'm glad to hear that.  I feel better about this.
What did you do together?
That is a lot of time to be like that.
That was a cute sight.  What was the baby doing?
That's a good memory! What happened?
That's a bummer.  Did you try to get another client?
Did you have any problems with the old idea?
I hope she answers.
That is a bit stressful. Hopefully it goes well for your son.
I'm sure you will get there one day.  What do you do for a living?
I agree, it's nice to know we have something to fall back on.
I am sorry to hear that. It seems like the world is always going against you.
Oh no!  That is really tough.  I hope you find a new place to live.
That is really bad. I hope you get out of there soon.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you can do to fix it?
That's great to hear! What kind of help do they provide?
I feel the same way.
That is so nice of her! What is wrong with you?
That is very nice of her
That is so cool!  I love to watch skateboarding videos.
I had a similar experience.  I tried skateboarding too and just ended up falling over.
I hate when that happens, but it's hard to see others being so cruel!
I agree.  I was once a mom, and I would be so rude to people.
That sounds like it's going to be a tough time. Are you going to a doctor to get him checked out?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope he is okay.  Did you give him any other meds?
That's awful. Did you try to get the dog back?
I bet you were worried, but I bet they just wanted to keep each other safe.
That's very sad.  Did you have to clean up so much?
I'm so sorry to hear that.  My brother was in a car accident and ended up with a broken back.  It was very painful and he had to get a lot of surgeries.  He is now 40 years old.  He's now in his 50s and is back to normal.  It was very hard on him.  He was 30 when the accident happened.
I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of vet did you go to?
I'm glad he is okay.  What kind of medicine?
Yeah I do!  I've been to a lot of places and have some of the best moments, but there's nothing like a simple cup of coffee and a quiet moment in nature.  I really love it.  I think that's what makes life so special.
I have a pet rabbit. I have to keep an eye on her for her to not escape. She has to be in her cage. I just got her a new cage. I have to make sure she is safe.
Oh? What happened?
That's great! I bet you're a little nervous.
I don't think I have, but I've heard it's a very difficult process.
I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?
I do.  What is the worst thing they do?
I have a similar situation with my kids.  My son can talk about how he is playing Minecraft and I have to listen to him talk about it.  I don't think I can handle it anymore.
I bet you have.  I hope you are doing well.
I hope she gets better soon.  I'm sorry to hear that you are taking care of her.
I have never failed a driving test.
I agree. I have been studying for years and I am finally passing my exams.
I would be so mad.
I don't know what you are talking about. Have you been to a restaurant that had a bad experience?
She is on the basketball team.  She is a great kid.
What a cool thing to do. I bet she is so proud of herself.
That's terrible, did anyone see you?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can get to work without any issues.
That's frustrating. I hate waiting in line.
I would agree. I don't see how you can get people to come into a store.
I love animals! What kind of puppy was it?
I agree, it is a very special moment.
Yeah, I can imagine.  When was the last time you went back?
I know what you mean.  I had a very good childhood.
That's great! What kind of science fair did you win?
What kind of project were you doing?
I'm sure you are doing a great job! I'd be scared too!
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. How old is he?
That sounds so much fun! I love going to the beach.
That sounds like so much fun!  Where did you go?
That is great!  How old is he now?
That sounds like a fun time to have!
That is unfortunate. What happened?
Oh no! I hope he is okay.
I bet you are! What are you planning on doing after graduation?
I am so happy for him, I hope he gets a good job.
Oh wow! I am glad to hear that!  Is he getting better?
I have two. I would love to have a kid. I'm 27 and I'm ready for one!
What did you do there?
Yeah, I have those too.  I used to collect them.
Oh wow, that is so cute! What did you do?
That's a good girl. You should teach her how to do chores.
I am so sorry! That's awful!
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope everything is okay.
That's so great to hear!
That is great to hear.  I hope she is feeling better.
That is so kind of you. I would have done the same thing.
I'm glad you were able to develop that trust. Cats are very loyal animals, but they can be very temperamental.
Oh man. What happened?
What did you do?
I'm sorry to hear that. I don't know what you are talking about.
Oh no, what happened?
I'm sorry, did she die or is she still alive?
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you not enjoy the trip?
That's a good point. I try to stick to my budget as much as possible.
Oh, are you expecting?
I hope he's good and not a disaster.
What's that?  Are you going to be on it for a long time?
That's awesome. I love how libraries can be a treasure trove of free resources.
What a surprise! I bet you were excited.
What's the baby's name?
What did you do?
How long ago was your birthday?
That's awesome! How long have you been away?
What did you study?
I am so sorry to hear that.  Are you doing well?
I agree, I have been trying to build up my willpower for years.
I was the same way. I always hated milk. I remember when they didn't have almond milk
That is pretty good. I love the taste of 2% milk!
I know the feeling. It's always nice to be able to enjoy something again
I'm glad you are happy with your choice.
I can imagine. Did you make it?
Oh yeah, I can't imagine driving all that time, it's so exhausting.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's so sad.  I think you are right, you have to take care of yourself first.
That was frustrating. I can imagine how you felt.
That was a nice change of scenery.
That's really nice. Is that a surprise gift?
Oh wow, that's so sweet of him.  What did he get you?
Oh no, that is terrible. Why did you do it?
Oh no, that must have been a very unpleasant experience.
I bet that was an exciting find. What was in it?
You are a good caveman. What did you do?
That is a big accomplishment.  What is the baby's name?
I'm so sorry! I bet you were scared.
Oh no. I hope everything is okay!
That is so wonderful!
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I lost my dog a few years ago and it was so hard.  I didn't put him down.  I kept him with me as long as he was able and even gave him a special home.
That is awesome! What happened to her?
Oh, that's terrible. Did you get a good look?
Oh no, how did that happen?
Oh that is great. I am sure you will be happy to see him when he comes home.
That's so true.  We have to do what we can and try to make sure our kids are safe.
That is so wonderful! What kind of pups were they?
Oh no. Did you have a dog?
I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?
That's so cool.  I just had a baby and it's so hard to enjoy anything.
Oh, that's amazing! I'm so happy for you.
That's so true. I mean, if you can't get enough of a certain food, it's hard to get rid of it. I always try to cut out foods that I know I don't need.
That's a long way to go for a dress. Did you get it?
Oh wow.  That is a little frustrating.  I'm sure she was not trying to get the dress.  Why are you so upset?
I'm glad you enjoy them. Are you a gamer?
That's really cool! I'm not sure I'd want to play games like that, but I can see how they would be fun. What's your favorite game?
Oh my gosh! I hate it when that happens!
Oh no, did you call the police?
What are they doing?
I am sure she has a natural talent.
Oh?  What did you mean?
Oh no, what happened?
I am sure it was a very stressful moment!
Oh, I love cats. I have a cat named Luna.
What country was she to?
That's so exciting!
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that!  I hope you're safe!
I hope it did, I hate the thought of a fire!
That's great! Congratulations!
You are right, he is 23 and still trying to save money.  I know he's trying to save money, but it is hard to save when you are young.
Why?
That is a great car, but it is a bit pricey.
I'm sure he'll be a happy baby!
That sounds like a lot of time.
Oh no, that's awful! I hate when that happens.
Yeah, I have had some problems with shipping from Canada to the US. I ordered a big item from a company that ships from Canada.
Oh wow that's a lot of money.
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's terrible. Did you find a new car?
Oh no! Did you have to go to the bank?
I am sorry to hear that. Do you think you will be able to get back on track?
That is so not cool.
Oh, that's a terrible situation. I can't imagine that.
That's so sweet. Did she have any experience with it?
i think she would be happy to have the money for a trip
Oh, that's good, are you excited?
Oh no!  I hope they get better soon.
Oh no!  That's a terrible situation.  I bet you were really upset!
Oh no, that's terrible!  That sounds like a pretty horrible situation.
Oh no! Is everything okay?
I'm glad that you didn't make her do it.
That's great to hear!
What a wonderful goal!  I wish you all the best!  I hope you are able to save for your little one!
Did you get a new job?
I'm sorry to hear that, you must have regretted it.
That is interesting.
Did something happen?
That's not good.  Did you wash your clothes?
Oh wow, that's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.
That's terrible.  I bet she doesn't feel the same way.  It's easy to do things like that and then regret them later.  I'm so sorry you're in this situation.
That is true. I would be happy to help her.
That is so sad.  I am sorry to hear that.
It's good to have a five year anniversary.
oh that's great, how old is she?
That's great to hear.  What did she do?
That's sad, what did you do?
I am sorry to hear that. Is it related to something specific that happened?
That's good. Where are you going?
I am sure you are right
That is amazing! I'm so happy for you!
Oh no, what happened?
That's sad. I'm sorry to hear that.
I understand that.  It is a little too early for you to be thinking about things like that.
Did you try to talk to him?
Oh wow, what happened?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
I am sure you will do great, I have never taken one in my life.
I have never heard of it! I would love to try it out!
What happened?
i bet. i've had my share of problems
That's terrible.  Did you get your pants repaired?
That is the worst!  Do you have a spare set of clothes?
Oh that's nice. Are you excited?
That is fun! I love playing bingo!
I bet it was! What did you do?
That is so gross. I hope you make it through.
Oh, it was good. I was tired all day.
That is great!  What do you like to do?
I am sorry, I don't know what you are talking about.
I bet you were mortified.
oh no!  did you get a bruise?
That's good.  Why do you?
That is good.
You should get plenty of rest. It will make a big difference.
That's a tough one to study for, especially with a summer class. You're going to do well, though.
That sounds like a lot of fun!
That is so cool!  Do you have a favorite animal?
Oh man!  That's a pretty gross thing to do!  How did you feel?
I think you should, they are probably trying to cover something up.
That is good news!  What happened?
That's great. What did you do to get it?
That's true.  How do you feel about it?  I'm a teacher and it's always stressful for me.
What did you do to get the help?
I love watching racing in TV.
I hate to see people get hurt in accidents
That is good. What is it about that that makes you happy?
oh that sounds exciting!
I'm glad you did.  What car did you buy?
i dont know what that is. is it a car?
That's so nice of her.  What kind of watch is it?
I know the feeling, I have been looking for the new one for a while.
Oh wow, that's great! What major did you graduate with?
That is good to hear. Are you looking for a job in a field that you are interested in?
I am sure it will be good.
What a relief! Did you get it?
Oh no! I'm so sorry! Why did you have intercourse with her?
I don't like it either. Is it a friend or someone you know?
Yeah, I've been there.
Oh no! Is she okay?
I would have been upset. I hate when that happens.
That is a good decision.
I would be too, I have a few childhood homes.  Do you have a favorite?
I am close with my parents. I have a good relationship with my grandma.
Oh wow.  That is sad.  Did you know they were gone?
I'm glad you had a good time. I'm sure it was a lot of fun.
That's scary, I hope you were safe
I'm fine, but the house was a little worse for wear.
I hate doctor visits! I am afraid of them too.
That sounds like they're not sure what they're looking for.
Oh wow! That sounds like a lot of work.
I used to build treehouses all the time! I used to love building them.
I bet.  Did you go to the funeral?
That's very sad, I'm sorry.
That is so frustrating. Did you get anything out of it?
I hate when people do that.  It makes me feel like they don't really care about me.
I am sorry to hear that.  I guess you should have spoken up and told him you needed to talk to him about it.  It's usually best to ask him first before talking to him.
That's cool. Are you studying?
That's great! I hope you do well on it.
Oh, that sounds so nice! I've always wanted to go there. What are you going to do there?
That's awesome! Yes, I love it!  What are you going to do?
Oh wow!  That's so sweet of him.  I would be so happy!
Well, that's nice. What kind of food do you like?
Yeah, I think I do.  What happened?
I've never heard of that.  Is it a necklace?
Oh no. That must have been frustrating.
Oh my, that must have been so embarrassing!
I bet! I would be so shocked.
That's good, you don't want to be too attached.
Well, that is just the way it is.  Everyone has their own special bond with their parents.  I'm sure they do not really notice you as much as you think.
That's a good point.  I think you should.  If you don't tell them, they're going to think you're not interested in the relationship.
That is good news!
That's awesome! Congratulations. What did you get?
I know what you mean! I was on a plane a few years ago and a baby was crying. I was so upset.
I hate when people act that way.
That's good that you did that. What was the new company?
I love when they do that.
Oh wow! That's great. I hope it was something nice.
That is very sad. I hope she gets the money she needs
Did you guys make it out okay?
What was the tornado?
That's nice. I have a big garden too, but I don't have a lot of plants. I just try to keep them happy.
I love that, I'm a romantic at heart.  What is it that you feel?
That's awesome! I hope you have a great time too!
I love surprises! I am sure you will have a blast!
Oh wow! I am glad you are happy!
That is so bad. I know it is hard to tell.
It's always better to be honest.
I'm sorry you had that, I hope you're feeling better now.
Yeah, that's a terrible name.
I would have been so grossed out.
That sucks. Did you get it checked out?
I know how you feel. I once stole a TV from a store. It was a 55 inch and it was an amazing TV. I felt bad, but I didn't do anything wrong.
I would say keep it, I love to watch tv
That's a little frustrating.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were going to eat there.
You must have had a lot of fun
That's great! I hope you guys had fun together!
That's great! College can be hard!
That sounds really out there. Did you get the church to confirm?
That's great.  I have never been financially stable, it's a lot of stress!
I am very excited about it.
You should really appreciate them then.
I understand. I feel for you.
That sounds scary.  I hope you were safe.
That's crazy. Did you get out of there?
I am sorry to hear that.  I know how it feels to have a disease that can make you feel like you are losing your life.  It is so hard to stay positive when you feel like you are not going to be able to do anything anymore.
I hope you can find a cure for it.
Wow, sorry to hear that.  What happened?
What is the tunnel?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you call the plumber?
Oh no, I'm sure it was a real mess. Did you have to call a plumber?
That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Have you tried talking to her?
I am pretty sure it is okay to yell at people.
I think they could be great if they used a lot of sound effects, and a lot of noise.
I understand.  What's going on?
I hope he says yes too. I've had hip surgery and I know how much you want to go back to your normal life.
Oh wow. That's so sad. You must be so frustrated.
I got a surgery for a tumor on my arm. I had to have it surgically removed.
I am so glad you are not a victim of this creep. If you are, I hope he gets what is coming to him.
That is so nice. I would be shocked too.
I hate yard work. I hate mowing the lawn.
I understand.  Are you going to do one?
I agree, sometimes you just need to keep trying until you figure it out!
I used to love watching kid movies. I used to watch all the Disney movies.
I've seen Harry Potter 4 times! I love the movies.
I agree, I have seen some movies that were not what you expected, they were really good.
I'm not sure I agree. I think kids are getting more smart with the internet.
That's great! What kind of job did you get?
Oh, I bet that was a disappointment
That's good to hear. What kind of job did they have?
Oh that's good. I'm sure it was a good time.
That is great to see.
That's awesome. I'm glad that person was nice and wanted to do the right thing.
What a thrill! Did you have to stop suddenly?
Oh man! I hate when that happens! You could've gotten hurt!
Oh no, I hate that feeling.
I know the feeling. Sometimes you just have to let them go and move on.
That's great! You must be very proud of yourself!
That's awesome, I bet it was a great surprise!
I have been there for 6 months.
I've been a good worker. I'm not sure about talking to someone about it.
What were you doing at the time?
What kind of laptop do you have?
That's awesome! What kind of performance?
That's awesome! I've never been to a restaurant that has a gift card.
That's a great attitude to have. I'm glad to see you're proud of yourself.
That is bad. Did you get him some today?
I know the feeling. I used to be able to do that.
I know what you mean.  I love when he is old enough to get his own chips.  I'm sure it will be a good time for him.
I know the feeling, it's like that with the list for a lot of things.
Oh no! Did you get them?
Oh no! I hate when that happens.
Oh man, I love chips!
That is good to hear. Did she have a good attitude?
I'm sure she will be cool about it
Oh yea? How was it?
Oh yeah, that was a tough one.  Did you make them feel bad for not knowing?
Oh no. What happened?
That is sad.  Have you been together for long?
That's awesome! That's great news.
That sounds like a lot of work! I am sure it is.
Oh wow that is amazing! I have never had two children at the same time. I am so happy for you.
I have two kids and I am going to be a dad soon!
It's always a surprise. I'm sure you'll be okay.
That's funny. I think we all have those moments.
I'm sure they are excited. Do you have them in any special classes?
That is awesome, do you think you will be able to use all of them?
Oh no! What happened?
What did you get?
Oh I bet you were not looking forward to it at all.
I know the feeling. What happened?
I love when people speak from their heart
yea. i bet he got it because he was the best.
I know how you feel. You can't save money if you don't know when you need to save it.
What is the due date?
I am sure you will get it!
I love 5 months.
Oh wow that is amazing!  I bet it was a long and hard fight to get that spot!  Congratulations!
I hope you can do well.
I am sure it was a great time.
Yeah, I think that's pretty cool.
That's really rough. I hope you were able to overcome that.
Oh wow! Was it a big hit?
That's good. I'm always trying to change my routine so it's more exciting.
I love breakfast.  It's my favorite meal of the day.  What's your favorite breakfast food?
Oh wow! That's great! I hope you can keep it up!
I am a bit of a carb addict myself. I put carbs in everything.
Did you file a claim?
That's bad. Are you staying with friends?
Wow!  That sounds scary!  Did he get hurt?
I am sorry to hear that. What happened to him?
That's nice, what did she say?
That is so nice of her. Did you like the book?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh really? Why?
Oh wow! Congratulations! I hope you're excited and ready for the new baby!
That's pretty sad. Did you lose something important?
I know the feeling. I just pray that I will be able to take care of it all.
I know what you mean. I have a baby girl and it's hard saving money for them. But it's worth it.
That is awesome. I bet you felt pretty good about yourself!
What school was it?
That's good you were able to understand.
I am sure you will not.
Wow, that's great! I'm sure she will be so happy!
I'm glad she's okay.  What happened to her?
Oh wow that's really exciting! Did you do well?
That's great! What is your favorite subject to study?
i have a few old games i play with my brother
I have never played Sega Genesis, I'm not really into gaming.
That sounds scary. Did you get on?
I'm glad you are safe.  I don't like going on roller coasters either.
Oh yeah, that's awesome! I hope you get a new car soon!
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
What is Fight Club?
That's cool.  What movie was it?
That is great to hear. What are you feeling unhappy about?
That can be frustrating. Is there something you are looking forward to?
Why did you not tell them?
Oh no.  What happened?
That's great! I love to ride my bikes!
I can't wait for you!
Yeah, that's awesome.  I'm sure it's going to be a lot of hard work, but it's going to be worth it.
Oh wow! I bet you're excited about that! I love renovating!
That is really frustrating.
I understand that. I'm not very good at managing my finances. It's hard to save.
That's terrible!  What is the prognosis?
That is very sad. I am sorry to hear that.
That is a bummer.  I hope you get paid for it.
That is frustrating. I can understand why. I had to do a lot of work on my computer.
That's nice, what's the picture of?
That's nice. I bet they have great memories of that time.
That's great. What was it?
I'm glad you have some fun money to spend!
I can imagine. Are you safe now?
I agree. I am not good with money and I never thought I would be in a situation like this but I am glad I can help.
That's terrible! I would have been so angry at you.
That's terrible. What did you steal?
Well, if you were one percent off, you probably passed.
I agree.  I feel that way about my math test.
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you were safe.
That's awesome! I've never had to do anything like that in my life.
I love baseball, where did you find them?
That's great! Are you still collecting?
That's awesome! What did you do to get a new job?
I am sure it is a lot of fun.
What was so amazing about it?
I think I know which show you are talking about.
How did you feel when you were there?
I love the ocean. I am so jealous.
I bet it was.  How did you feel after you did it?
Oh no, I'm so sorry! What did you do?
Oh, that sounds like fun. Where are you going?
That's so true.  I'm sorry you guys.  I hope you can get out soon.
That is sad.  What happened?
That is terrible.  Did she get hurt?
That is sad. I am sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are doing okay.
What did you do?
I love the ocean! I can't get enough of it.
That's awesome! I've never seen it. Did you like it?
That is a great artist. I am a big fan of his work
Did they have a big family gathering?
What happened?
Oh no! Did you get away?
That must have been so scary. What happened?
I know that feeling! I have a little sister too.
Oh that's very nice of you. What do you do?
Aww, that's always nerve-wracking. I hope everything went well!
That's good to hear! Did you have fun?
That's a pretty scary experience. Did you end up getting your dog back?
That must have been very scary.
I'm not very good, I don't think I could sing.
I understand that. I'm sorry.
I hate when that happens. I always end up leaving them to figure it out.
What kind of chores?
That is disgusting.
That is good. What happened?
I'm glad I'm not alone in my thoughts!
I don't know what you have in mind.
Oh no! That is bad. She should have called you first.
That sounds nice!
Oh no! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Oh no! Did you try to get rid of it?
oh, i can imagine!
Oh no. I am sorry to hear that.
That is good. You will do well.
I bet you did!
That is a bummer.  I hope you were able to get back on track.  What kind of car did you get?
How did you like it?
That's terrible. How did you get caught?
I am sorry to hear that, I hope that she forgives you.
Oh no, I bet it was very embarrassing for you.
Oh my, what happened?
Oh, that's cute. I'm sure you felt that.
That is so sweet. I love when people do that to me.
That must have been very nerve-wracking. Did you have a good time?
Oh that's great. What was the meeting about?
That is very noble. What is your major?
That's so sad.  I'm sorry to hear that.
How did he pass away?
I am. I just feel like they are not doing their job.
I'm sorry to hear that. I have a dog of my own, and I can only imagine how you feel.
That sounds like a lot of fun.  What kind of running do you do?
Oh no!  Did you get a picture of him?
I think so too.  I am a big fan of them.
I am sorry to hear that. What kind of dance is it?
Oh no, how big was it?
Oh no! What happened?
Oh that's smart of you!  What happened?
Oh no! Did you lose anything?
I would have been very upset. I would have thrown it away.
Did you spit it out?
That's so sad.  Did you have a favorite pet?
I'm sorry to hear that.
I am so sorry.  I am so sorry that you are still feeling that way.  It takes a long time to get over it.  I know you did the best you could.  I hope that you can eventually find a way to move on.
I know how you feel. It's hard when someone close to you dies.
I agree. It is a lot of fake news these days.
I think it is because people are always looking for something exciting to happen.
Oh, I think I know where this is going.  How old is she?
Well, that's a good thing for you.  I bet she doesn't know how to make sugar free desserts!
Oh no, what happened?
That's terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that.
That is so cool! I love shopping at Aldi's!
I like to try new things, what's the brand you're talking about?
I think they will do well this year.
I hope you do!
What happened to him?
Oh no, that's terrible.  Is he in remission now?
That is a scary thing to hear!
I know what you mean. Sometimes you have to know someone very well to be able to trust them.
That's great! I hope everything goes well for you!
That's great.  You're going to get there.
I love that show.  Did you like it?
Aww that is so cool! I have never seen it. What is it about?
That's great! She must be so happy and healthy!
What happened?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I can't imagine not having a dance crew.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet it was cool to battle with other teams
I am sure you will! You must be very fit!
I don't like steroids either.  I am vegan and I don't need to worry about that.
That's awesome! What school does he go to?
That is very sad.  I am so sorry to hear that.
Oh yeah, I'm sorry.  Did you have a good time or something?
That's always a big deal. What happened?
That's great! What happened?
That's a nice house.  How did you feel?
That's sad. How old is your son?
That is a big deal.  Did you talk to her about it?
I'm sorry, I'm sure he was trying to do it for a good reason.
I know what you mean, I love the outdoors
That sounds like a lot of fun.  I used to love to garden, but I got too old and now I just have a few flowers and a few herbs.
I love that show, what was your favorite part?
What show?
That's awesome! How old is she?
How old was she?
That's not good. I would have to go to the police.
I think you mean faith, but I'm assuming you meant that.
I am.
I think that's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.  How does it happen?
I'm sorry to hear that.  It's not easy to deal with.
Wow! What happened?
I hate flying. What was the worst part of it?
That is amazing! I love flying! What was the reason you found out?
That is great! I hope you can pay it off soon.
I am glad you are trying to do better.
That's so weird. Did you ever fight about it?
You are a wise person to realize that.
Oh that's so nice. What are you planning to do?
Oh wow that is a great way to spend time with family. What a wonderful experience.
That is very unfortunate.  Have you tried talking to him about it?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope he understands the importance of paying off a loan.
Did you lose weight?
That is great! I've been trying to get into a regular routine with exercise and healthy eating, but I need to lose some weight. I'm happy you were able to do it!
I bet that was a wonderful moment.
I am glad for her. It is a good thing she was willing to work hard to achieve it.
That is bad. What happened?
I am sure you did.  I have had to do that many times.  It is always a difficult thing to do.
Oh that's great! How long has it been since you've seen each other?
That's cool. I've never had the chance to go to high school and middle school.
That is good. You must have worked hard for it.
I bet. I used to be competitive, but now I am just happy to not be competitive
That sounds like a lot of fun! What's your friend doing?
That is so sad that she has to move away.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried any other treatments?
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry to hear that.
I know how you feel, I lost my dog 5 years ago and I miss her every day.
Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that.
That's pretty rude.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you can do to help him?
That's awful. I would be so mad at them.
I am sure they did!
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you go on a road trip?
I understand.  I have a pet parakeet.  I have to leave it with my neighbor.  It is a sad thing.
I am sorry to hear that. It is always a disappointment to have something you have been looking forward to.
That's so sad, are you all okay?
That's great! I'm glad to hear that. What did you do together?
Oh, that sounds like a great time! I love the beach!
I have the same problem.  Do you like being alone or do you get lonely?
I bet you will. I'm sure you will have a great time.
Oh no! That must have been terrifying!
Oh, was it a car?
That sounds like so much fun! I hope you can have a great time with them.
I agree, summer is still going on for me.
I bet that does bother you. I hope you are able to resolve the issue.
That's a great idea. Where are you thinking of getting them from?
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope she's doing okay and that she's getting better.
That's very sad.  Are they going to go get help?
I don't like rejection either. But I have learned to just keep on moving forward.
That is true.  We are all different in some way.  I just wish life was easier.
I bet that is a big change.  Are you moving to a state in the South?
I can't imagine how hard it would be to live in Anchorage. I live in Hawaii.
That is a fun activity. I would love to try it.
I agree.  The future is always uncertain though.
That's a good hope to have.
I am sorry to hear that.  Have you talked to her about it?
That is not good.  Have you talked to her about it?
Did you have a pregnancy test?
I love Chicago too. What a great city!
Yeah, I love beluga whales. They are so cute!
I hate that horror movies, I don't want to watch them. I only watch them for school and for work.
Yeah, I haven't seen that one in a long time.  What did you think of it?
Oh wow! Congratulations! That's a great achievement!
That's good!
Oh, that's awesome!  What kind of car is it?
Oh wow, that's a nice car!
I'm glad you did it. What kind of degree did you get?
Did you like it?
That's terrible.  Why did you do it?
I am sure it will be a good thing.
That's exciting! I bet you can't wait to see them.
That's nice. What are they?
That's good. Do you still see them?
I am sorry to hear that.
That's crazy! Did you know it was going to be scary?
Oh I don't get it. What video?
That is very sweet, I bet you are very happy.
Oh that's cool. Have you ever gone back before?
That is terrible. I am sorry to hear that.
Oh, that is nice! I love dogs.
I agree, it's crazy how things work out.
I'm not sure I agree with that. What did he do?
Wow that's a terrible thing to happen.  I hope you're not too hurt.
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope it heals soon.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Where are you from?
That's good to hear.  What are you planning to do next?
That's a bummer, I hope you were able to get it done eventually.
Oh yeah. I know what you mean. I once got a bonus from my boss, but I felt like I didn't get it because my coworker who was 2 years older got it.
Oh no. I hope they don't bother you. I hate those bees.
Well, you'll be able to take care of it yourself. It's good that you're taking care of it.
I hope you are okay.  I don't think I would be so prepared.
That's a good point. I hope you're not too stressed out about it.
Oh that is great. What was your experience like?
What are you doing?
I can't believe that you were able to do that.
I know the feeling.  I'm so tired of flats.
That sounds very scary. I'm not sure I could do that.
That's crazy, I bet you were shaking with fear!
What a great job! I bet you will be so happy to be there!
That is so true. Sometimes we need to take a step back and remember how good life is, even when we're stuck in our own personal bubble of boredom.
That sounds exciting!  What state are you moving to?
That's a great point. I've never been there but I've heard it's really pretty.
That's great.  How long do you meditate for?
I can relate, I've been feeling the same way lately
That is so scary! Was it a real person?
Oh wow, that's interesting, I bet you were terrified!
I'm sorry to hear that. That's very unfair of them.
That is true.  I have had to make some tough decisions that were hard to make.
That's bad. What did you do?
That's a good thing. What was the presentation about?
That is so nice of him! I would have done the same thing for him.
That's great. I've always wanted to live in a city with such a great community.
I love golf, I know a lot of people who play it!
Oh wow! I have never been stung by a wasp.
Oh wow! I hope you are okay.
Oh wow, that's really bad.
That is good that they did that for you. I would have felt the same way if they had not.
That's great. Did you have a lot of money?
I can relate. I have my parents to thank for that. They've been good to me.
I love that! I would love to do something similar.
Oh, wow! You are so lucky to work with a company that shares your values. What a great job!
That is terrible. What did you do?
I bet you did.
That is good. Did he do anything to make you feel that way?
that's crazy! what kind of lottery?
That is a nice surprise.  What did she do to win the money?
That's awesome! Are you planning to take any more exams?
That's great! I'm glad you were able to prepare. I wish I had more time to study.
What is it for?
I am not sure if you are talking about the USA or some other country.
I am so sorry. That must have been very scary. Did you see where they were going?
What were they doing?
That's great. It must be very difficult for her. I'm sure she feels better now.
That's a tough move to make, but you're lucky to have had the opportunity to make it happen.
Oh no! Did you do well in the class?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope everything worked out in the end.
I agree.  I like to be glad that they are not hurting my driving experience.
That's true, and also a lot of people are too distracted while driving, which makes things even less safe
Oh that is great. I have friends who are in Electrical Engineering.
I have.  I was accepted to college, but had to drop out.  I am very excited for my new job.
Oh no!  What happened?
I hope it doesn't get worse, I don't like storms.
I am so sorry to hear that.
I agree. It is a very difficult disease to deal with.
That's very polite of you.
That sounds like a great job! What kind of job is it?
That's awesome. Are you going to ride all of the rides?
I do! I love Cedar Point!
That's great!  Are you trying to save for something in particular?  I'm a little jealous.  I'm trying to save a little bit myself.
That is good to have a plan in place.
That's awesome. Did you have a lot of family members coming?
Oh, that's true! I've never heard of anyone dressing up as Santa. I love Christmas.
That's terrible. Did you get a replacement?
That's too bad. I hope it doesn't happen to you.
I know, I have a TV show that I watch every week. It's about my life and I get really attached to it.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Is it something that you can't avoid?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
I did. I went to the one in Tampa. I saw a lot of people there.
I agree. I think that's why I don't get so sick as often. I think it's because I don't touch things and just cover them up with soap and water.
That's pretty funny. I've never seen that before.
Oh no! What happened?
That is a lot of responsibility.
That's really nice of you to take care of them!
That is terrible. I hope you are okay.
Oh no. I hope they have a good insurance plan.
What a wonderful experience! I bet it was very fun to see them again!
I know what you mean.  I have a few close friends that I am still in touch with.  We've been friends for a long time.
I'm sure you'll have a great time with them.
I'm sure you do. What is it about your family that makes it special?
That's awesome!  I love watching those things.  Did she have a favorite dance?
Wow! I am so jealous!  What was the show you were watching?
That's a good thing to say.
That is so sweet of him!  I bet it was a lot of fun!
Oh wow, that's awesome! I bet you were grateful for it.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you'll do great!
I'm glad I could help! I'm sure you'll be okay!
Oh no!  Did you eat it?
That's good to hear. Is it a new fridge?
That is so cool. I would love to see a store like that.
I love shopping at those big box stores, they have so many things.  I have never been to this one, but I'm going to try to go there this weekend.
Well that is great! I bet it is nice to have someone to hang out with
It's nice that you have a loving husband to help you with the baby.
Oh wow!  I love the idea of expat communities.  What was your experience like?
That's so cool! I love seeing the world!
That is really nice to have a family to take care of you in times of need.
That's really cool.  What do you have to thank them for?
I agree. It's so easy to rationalize the worst of human behavior.
A lot of things are changing these days.
That is a terrible betrayal. I hope you have a good relationship with him.
That's not a lot of time.
Oh no, that is so frustrating. I hate when that happens.
I agree.  People are so selfish.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I know how that feels.
That's sad. Did she get better?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What kind of job are you looking for?
I understand, it's tough to make friends when you are in a field that is competitive.
Well I hope you are happy for her. I have a sister that is in college and she is 19.
I hope you have a good relationship with her.
What kind of company?
I think you mean relaxing during the school year, right?
I've never done it, but I've seen a few videos.  How did you feel?
I love praying. I always feel so much better after.
Oh, what kind of chance?
That's really cool!  I'm not very into meat, but I love fish.  What do you like to eat?
What type of health issues did you have?
Oh, that's terrible. Are you sure you don't have any other options?
That's so nice of you. It's always good to have family to support you through tough times.
That is good news. What happened?
That's nice.  What's she like?
I do. I love her.
I love a good Dodge.
That sounds like a cool car.
I am sorry about that. I hope your dog was not too attached to them.
Oh no! I hope she didn't break them.
Oh wow! That is a nice surprise! I hope you liked it
That's nice! Did she make them from scratch?
I love spaghetti!
That sucks.  I'm sorry.  I hope you find a new person soon.
Oh I know. I've been in that spot.
Oh that is nice. What did he make?
That sounds so good! I love a good pot roast.
I am so happy for you!  You must be proud of yourself!
What kind of promotion?
I am happy for you and your daughter!
I do. I have two. I am so glad I had them.
Oh wow, that's a long way to go. Are you feeling anxious about it?
That sounds exciting, have you ever been to Japan?
Oh that's great! What did they get you?
Well that's great! I love sushi.
That's awesome, I bet you were excited.
That sounds like fun, how long did you ride for?
Yeah, I do. I love walking through gardens. It is so peaceful.
That's sad. I like my solo time too.
Well, that is a bit of a long way.  I am glad you have family.  I am sure it is hard.
That's a good thing to have.
Wow! I hope you have a good time!
I bet you're excited!  That's great.  I'm glad you're excited.
I'm sure it will be better. I don't see why you would want a junk car.
That's awesome!  Are you going to throw a party?
That's great!  Yes, I have two younger siblings.  I am so grateful for the life I have.
Oh, that's great! What did you talk about?
I hope she is okay
That's a good point. I think a lot of people have to be flexible and adapt to their new environment.
I have been able to visit often but it has been 8 months. I am looking forward to going
Oh no, did she make you feel good?
Well that is great, you have a good relationship.
Oh that's awesome! I love theater.
Oh that's good. What happened?
I know what you mean. I'm always driving home and I think I'm going to be alone for the whole ride.
I'm glad I could help.
Oh wow! I have never tried that sauce before. What is it made from?
That's awesome! I love making things in my free time. I'm a crafty person.
I hope so! I always feel like the more I learn, the more I have to learn.
That's true.  Do you have a job lined up?
I am sure you are. How many children do you have?
I am so happy for you! I hope your baby is healthy and happy
What kind of videos were you watching?
I think I do, I had something like that happen to me in the past. It was a really scary experience.
That's awesome! Do you have a favorite team?
That's a great rivalry! What is your favorite team?
I love BMX! Did you watch it for a long time?
Oh I know what you mean. I was at a movie one night and someone was being really rough on another person. The person who was being rough was being very aggressive and the other person was trying to protect him. But it was hard to see because the other person was so scared. It was really crazy to see.
That's very kind of him. What kind of restaurant is it?
I would be too. I'm glad you got it fixed.
That's awesome! You should be proud of yourself!
That's awesome. What was the subject?
That's awful. What happened to them?
I know what you mean, they sound like they could be in a tough spot.
That is so exciting! I am happy for you!
I'm glad you are okay. What happened?
Oh no, that sounds bad. Did you have a plan for it?
Oh wow. I hope that all worked out well for you.
I bet it was a real nasty feeling to be in that situation.
That's a terrible thing to say, especially to a 17 year old.  What did you do?
That's so sweet of you.  I hope they feel better soon.
That's good. I hope he is doing well.
That is awesome! What school are you in?
That's great! What did you get?
Oh yeah, I remember that movie.  What was it?
Oh cool! What movie was it?
I have had that before.  I was so nervous I had to walk to the bathroom a couple of times!
That's good! What kind of job was it?
Oh no! That is really uncomfortable. Did you call the police?
Oh man, I bet that was a bit frustrating.
That is so embarrassing. I'm glad you were okay though.
I am sorry. What happened?
That is awesome!  I am sure you are proud of him.
That's good.  Is he a bit of a messy eater?
That's crazy, I love long dates.
Oh that sounds like a fun night. I wish I could have been there with you.
Yeah, that's terrible. I'm so sorry. Did you have to find him?
Oh no, I hope it didn't.  I've had a friend who has diabetes and he's been on it for a long time.  How did you know it was diabetes?
I'm sure it was tough, but you must have been proud.
I have no idea what you are talking about.
That's awesome!  What school is it from?
That's good, I don't think I would have been able to afford it
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened?
Oh no! Did you have a good laugh at them?
Wow, did they make you laugh?
That is awesome!  I have two kids and my oldest is 10 and my youngest is 7 so I feel for you!
That's so cute. I love kids.
I bet it was frustrating!
Yeah, I've been there too.
Oh no, did they find it?
That's nice of you. I hope they came.
That's so sad.  Have you seen her in heaven?  I hope she is at peace.
That is so sad. My sister took her own life a few years ago.
Oh really? What kind of job?
I agree.  I feel like I have a higher energy than most people.
Why do you feel grateful?
Wow, I bet you must be very good at it.
That's terrible. Did you lose it on the street or at the store?
That's good! How long did it take?
Oh wow. That sounds like a great surprise! What did you do?
What does that mean?
That is sad. I bet you miss them a lot.
It's great that you're making memories with your son!
That is pretty disappointing. Did you miss any episodes?
Oh yeah?  Did you enjoy it?
Oh, that is a very important skill. What did you need to show them?
I hope you get the answer you need.
That's bad. How long will you be gone?
That's understandable. I'm sure it's not the end of the world.
That's a good thing to do, that's what friends are for.
That is good. I am sure she is not interested in you.
That is great. I have to do a lot of chores every day.
I'm sure it gets that way in the summer. I have to do a lot of gardening to keep mine from getting out of control.
Oh no!  How did it get that way?
I am glad you are happy and that he is committed to you.
That's so cool, I've never heard of that before.  Do you work in that field?
What happened?
Oh no! I hope everything turned out alright in the end.
That's great.  What kind of talent does she have?
That is awesome, how old is she?
I am sorry to hear that. It must have been very upsetting for you.
I would have felt the same way.  I don't like that kind of situation.
That is understandable. What is he doing?
That's really tough. Do you live nearby?
That's nice. Is he getting a bonus?
I am so glad you got back from that vacation! I love the beach!
I know the feeling, I hate watching horror movies too.
That is disgusting.  I am so sorry.  I am glad you are okay.
Oh, that can be frustrating. Did you ask him about it?
What do you think he will get?
That is really tough. Have you ever thought about moving to another country?
I understand. I am sure you will be fine.
I am glad to hear that.  Do you have a son or daughter?
I can understand that, I've had some of that experience with my kids.
Wow that sounds scary! Did you see who did it?
I'm glad you were able to get out of it. Did you find it?
I am so sorry to hear that. It is very tough.
That's a terrible thing to go through, I'm so sorry.
Did you get a promotion?
That's so bad.  Did you tell her she did something wrong?
I would be too.  What did they do to you?
What did you do there?
Oh wow. I bet that's a lot of fun! What are some of your favorite memories?
I would be too! How did it happen?
That's interesting. What's his job?
That was a great show.  Did you enjoy it?
That is awesome, I'm not sure about the Grammys but I like the sound of it.
That is so embarrassing. Did you feel like you were going to die?
Oh no, did you end up getting a cab?
What did you do?
That's normal, what's going on?
That's terrible, was it a friend?
Oh, sorry to hear that. I hope you're okay.
That's really tough. I hope everything is okay for her.
That is great to hear, it is always good to have friends that are far away.
Oh wow! I bet it was a special moment for both of you.
Did he propose?
I'm glad to hear that, it's great to see people who are like that.
I've heard good things about that company.
Oh yeah! Those were so cool!
I love those!  They are so cute!
I know what you mean, I am the same way!
I know how you feel. I can't sleep at all. I feel like I am always ready to go.
I hope you get a great deal!
Oh that is exciting! I bet you were so happy.
Oh that sounds nice! Do you live close by?
That is terrible. What happened?
I feel you, I used to play all the time but now I have to work too
That is very sweet of her
That is really cool. I bet she thought you were really cool.
That is awesome. I bet she was happy you liked it.
That's good. Did they do well?
That's awesome! I'm glad you got to spend quality time with them
I hope so! It's always exciting to have a job lined up!
Oh that sounds good. You have to be careful though, they might try to manipulate you into staying.
Wow, that's a good thing?
It's always nice to remember the good times.
What did he do?
That's the worst, I hate when that happens.
That's awesome. Are you planning on going for it?
I bet you did great! It's not easy to get a job, but it is great that you are trying so hard!
I love ice cream cake! Did you eat it?
That's too bad! I hope you can still enjoy it.
What did you do?
That's great! I bet you have some amazing memories from that time.
That is no fun.  Did they have a good excuse?
Oh yeah? I don't know what you are talking about.
That's great!  That's the best kind of job interview, where you get to go in and really know the company and the person you're interviewing with.
That's interesting. What kind of work did you do?
Oh no, that's really scary. Did you get out of the restroom right away?
I hate waterbugs!  I can't believe you didn't throw it away!
I can imagine! That must have been very scary. I hope you were able to drive again.
That is great!  I am sure it was not easy for you.  What was your fear?
That was a bad day. Did you find a good replacement?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you take an online course or something?
Oh no! Did you tell her?
I bet. What happened?
Well that is nice. What is your name?
Wow, that's very exciting. What happened?
Did you find out?
Oh wow, I bet that was a difficult conversation to have.
That's great! Are you excited?
That is a good thing.  I would love to have a renovation of my home.
I'm glad you did! How is it?
Oh wow that's awesome! I am sure you enjoyed it.
Oh no!  I would have been so scared!
Did you know it was coming?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What are you going to do to make up for it?
That sounds like a good time.
I bet you are! That is a tough competition.
Oh really? How long have you been studying?
Why are you trying?
That's great to hear! What was wrong?
Oh that's really sad. I'm sorry.
I bet it is. Do you guys have a long distance relationship?
That is so sad. What happened to your dog?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you in a long distance relationship?
That's awesome! I hope you have a great time together.
That must be really hard.  I'm sorry you are going through that.
I don't like scary movies.
I know, they can be really annoying.
That is exciting! What country are you going to?
That is awesome! What are you looking forward to?
That is awesome. I hope you have a great time with her.
I'm a big fan of Germany, have you been there?
That sounds like a lot of work. Did you have everything ready?
That sounds like a great time.
Aww, what was the movie?
How did it make you feel?
I can imagine. I love seeing old love letters.
Did you get her a gift?
I bet that was terrifying! I hate being alone in the woods especially at night.
I know what you mean.  I like to think that the trees are talking to me.
What for?
I am sorry to hear that. Is it a bad relationship?
Oh no! Did he do it by accident or on purpose?
That sucks. I've never had to buy a new car.
Oh, I'm sure it will go great! What kind of job is it?
I agree, I'm always worried about the future.
Did they have a good home?
I'm glad you didn't get upset.
That's great! I hope you're excited!
I agree with you. I have been really busy with work and family. I don't have time to play games.
That's so tough. I'm sure you're looking forward to having her back.
That's good. What are you looking forward to?
That can be scary.  What are you worried about?
Oh, it's always scary to move to a new place. But don't worry, you'll figure it out.
I bet that was frustrating.
Oh wow. How many people were there?
Oh yeah, I love the Avatar movie!
You should go see it. I think it's called Alien?
That is true. I wish I could have that life.
Yeah, I know how that feels. I don't think I would be able to go through that.
What was on the table?
Oh wow, that's interesting.  I'm not sure I'd want to try them.
That is so wonderful to hear. I have a lab mix too and he is so sweet.
Wow. That is nice.
Oh no! I feel like that would be a lot of work! How old is the dog?
That's great.  I think I would love to live there too.  I'm thinking of moving there myself.
That is a great goal to have. It is nice to dream.
Well, that is not good. What happened?
I think you meant to say you dropped them with time, not stress.
I know the feeling.  Have you tried to explain to them that the bills are going to be late?
I think that's true. I just feel like it's the kids who are being a bit extra.
Oh wow!  That sounds like an amazing adventure!  Where are you going?
I went to the beach. It was nice.
Oh no. What happened?
That is kind of creepy. What did you do?
Oh no, that's terrible! Did he say he would do it soon?
That is very good of you, I am sure he will pay you back
I'm sure that's a good thing.  What are you going to do with it?
That's terrible!  Did you forget anything important?
I'm glad you have a supportive partner.
That is nice. Did you do anything special for her?
I love spending time with my friends, especially when we can do it all at the same time.
That is a good thing to do.
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I'm sorry you had to do that.
I hate horror movies. How did it make you feel?
Oh yeah. I've heard that one before.
I'm sure you will.  I've had two and I'm so happy.
That's so cool!  I've never been one to keep track of my body, but I like to know what's going on.  How did you find it out?
That's awesome! I hope it's worth the wait.
That's nice of her.  I hope it's not too long.
That's true, my in-laws are super loving and I've never felt so happy to have them around.
That's good. I hope you don't have to worry about it for much longer.
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you are able to get him to sleep on time.
I agree with you!  I am worried about him too, he is 15.
That's awesome! I bet she was very happy when she found out.
I love surprises like that.
That is great to hear. What made you grateful for her?
Why are you so happy?
That's okay. I have a pet rat and I love him.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Did you ever work out a plan for them to get rid of the roach?
Oh, what was the reason?
That's not good, why not?
I understand that.  I miss my mom too, she passed away.
That's terrible!  Did she go back to work after?
I am too! I love going to the movies.
Oh man, I have seen that movie. It is very dark.
oh wow! thats so kind of you!
I think they are a type of food.  I am not sure.
That sounds like a lot of work. Did you do it yourself?
I love Etsy! I have a few items on there. I've been looking at it for years!
That is a long trip. Did you drive a car or truck?
Why did you go to the country?
I can't believe how many places there are now where you can get coffee and a good meal.
I know what you mean. I hate when it's dark.
That's great. You must be excited to see it come to life.
That's good to hear, what happened?
I bet.  Did you have to go to the graduation?
I bet you are. That's really cool
What happened?
I love swimming! What is your favorite exercise?
I know the feeling.  I'm always lonely as well.
Oh no!  Did she leave for any reason?
That's a great song. I love that album.
I love the 80's.  What made it so special?
That's really cool that you're trying to teach him how to be motivated, I mean that's great.
I am sorry to hear that.  I am sure you will find a way to do it.
What happened?
That's pretty scary!
They can be frustrating sometimes, but I have found that most of the time they are worth it.
Wow, that's pretty frustrating.
I'm glad to hear that.  I love seeing people who care about others.
That's good.  I would want to go to London too.  How long is the journey?
You should ask her.
Oh, I understand. I'm sorry you're going through this.
That's a bummer. Did you end up ordering from them or something else?
I've heard that as well! I have some friends that are ranchers and they make a lot of bison steaks.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Is it a big issue for you?
I would say that. I have a dog that smells bad and I have to throw him out. I don't want to smell him at home!
Oh no, how old is the toddler?
I am sure he will get called. I have a friend who is in the military and I know he is always ready when called.
That is not good.  How did you get away with it?
That's cool. I bet you were so happy to see her.
That's so sad. Is he coming back soon?
That is great. I hope he is safe.
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.
Did she get better?
What kind of issues?
Oh no, what happened?
Oh no. Did you finally complete it?
I bet you will be successful.  I've been trying for years.
I'm glad you got to see it! I've been waiting for years to see it!
I've never seen it. What is it about?
Oh no.  How did it make you feel?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That is so frustrating!
Did you have to go to work or school?
That's great! I hope everything goes smoothly for you.
I can't wait either.  What are you going to do?
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure it's not easy.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have a new cat?
I agree.  I'm a homeless myself for a little bit.  It's very hard.
That is very generous of you, I wish I could do that.
What happened?
That is so nice of him!  You must have been so happy to see him!
That's a pretty harsh statement.  People cheat for all sorts of reasons.  It's not that bad.
I have, but that's just a crazy story.
Oh no, I hate the stormy weather. Are you going to wait for it to pass?
That is good. I hope you get to go out and enjoy it.
Oh, that is sad.  I hope they have a good relationship.  How old is the baby?
I'm sure you feel that way.  I've got a 5 year old and a 10 year old, and I don't feel like I have as much time.  I wish I could just take a nap.
It's nice to have such a loving family. I hope you guys have many more years together.
I think I would be really sad if I had to leave my mom. I know she would miss me too.
Oh no! Why?
I can relate, I live in a remote area. I am also far out, but it is not as bad as you are.
Oh I love Disneyland. I can't wait to go back!
That's good. I've stayed at a few hotels and I'm always glad to be there.
Well that is very impressive.  Did you feel confident in your abilities?
It's always nice to see people work hard to get where they are!
Oh really? That's great to hear.
Well, that's great. I'm sure it's great for you to have such a loving family.
I am sorry to hear that. How long has he been working extra hours?
Oh wow! What did he do to deserve it?
That's terrible! You have to stay positive and keep looking for a new job.
I hope so! What kind of positions are you applying for?
That is great. What kind of job is it?
You're welcome! I've applied to a few, but I haven't found the right one yet.
Oh no. What did you do?
I bet it does, I'm sure she's a great person.
I am so glad you got to see your cousin.  That must have been so exciting.
I bet that was a surprise. I bet you were excited!
I'm sorry to hear that.  I love coffee too.  Is it a Keurig?
Wow, that's disgusting! I know what you mean. I used to drink it all the time.
That must have been tough.  I hope you have a good experience in your new job.
I am sure you will do well!
That's not cool at all. That's a horrible thing to do.
Oh wow! I would have laughed! What happened next?
Oh no! Is he in pain?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it gets better
That is nice. Are you all happy to see each other?
Oh wow, that's really bad. What happened?
I hope you do well!
I understand, how do you deal with those?
I love that. I've been going through some old stuff myself.
Yeah I've had that feeling before. What happened?
Oh wow, did you remember?
Oh wow, I bet that was a moment to remember.
Oh no, what did you do?
I hope that didn't happen to them. I would have been so scared.
That's awesome! I hope she is a good girl.
That is so cute! What breed is she?
That's so cute!
Oh my goodness! Did you get it back?
That is terrible.  I am sorry to hear that.  How did you get the paint on your car?
Did it storm during the night?
I can imagine! What's your fear?
I'm happy for you.  That's a big step!
That is good! Are you going on a vacation?
I love the garden, I always feel at peace there.
I hate when that happens. Is it a good thing or a bad thing?
That is very nice of them. I hope they are not doing well.
That is very kind of them.
That is amazing!  I am so proud of him.
Are you happy for him?
I've never been there, but I've heard it's a lot of fun.  I'm sure you will have a great time.  I've never gone there either, but I've heard it's a lot of fun.
I am taking a trip to the beach!  I love the beach!
That was scary. How bad were the injuries?
Oh no! I hope you are okay.
Oh my god, that's awful. I would have been so angry.
Yes, but the current state of CS is so bad that I'm considering taking my business elsewhere.
Why do you hate queue jumping?
That is terrible.
That was a big storm.
That's a great idea, I'm glad you were safe.
That sounds like a great surprise.  How did you feel about it?
I am glad to hear that.  What was it?
That's a nice tradition. I bet you're happy for them.
That's terrible.  Do you have a special diet?
That is so exciting!  I have only one, but I know that I will be an amazing grandma!
I bet! How old is she?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope he is doing okay.
Oh I bet.  That is a good attitude to have.
oh that is nice
Oh wow!  How did they know?
I hope you do too.
That's good! What are you studying for?
I bet you are! What is his age?
I hope you got it.
I hope it's not too much to wait!
What is the waiting game?
I'm sorry to hear that. Is he your brother?
What happened?
I bet you will
That is so true.  You know what I always say?  "If you know what you want, you know what you need to do to get it."
That is terrible, do you still have feelings for her?
I know, that's why I need to find a new place to live.
That's good that you were concerned. How long did the flight last?
That's great to hear.  I'm glad everything went well for you.
I feel you, I can't get with anyone right now.
I'm sorry to hear that, what happened?
That's really cool of them. I know that can be really hard to do.
That's good. Where do they live?
That is awesome! How much did you win?
That is good. Did you have to do anything specific to make it happen?
I don't like spiders either.  Do you have any pets that you have to feed?
I bet. What is the fear?
I've been playing video games for years.
I agree, I'm a gamer, I have a lot of fun playing games.
What happened?
That's good.  I don't get why people can't just be happy with their food.
I bet it was nice to have her back.  Do you guys have any kids?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends?
That's awesome!  How old is he?
I can understand that, I had a friend like that.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh no.  I am so sorry.  How are they doing?
That's great! What did you graduate with?
its a good thing i was not there
I hate when that happens. Did you get to the repair shop?
Oh wow, I am sorry. I am not sure what that means.
I hope the tornado passes quickly.
The power outage is going to be long.
Oh wow!  I bet you were so happy about that!
Oh yeah, I think that is so sweet, I hope she likes you
I'm glad to hear that!
I'm glad you have a supportive partner!
Oh no!  That is a terrible thing to do.  How are you feeling now?
That's so annoying!  Did you catch him?
I feel you, I'm terrified of snakes too!
That is crazy! Did you get bitten?
Wow, that's pretty rude. Did she do something wrong?
I am sorry to hear that. Is it a job thing?
Oh no, why were you afraid?
I know that feeling. I was always alone when I first started dating.
That is great. I am glad you have a good relationship.
That's good.  Is he doing well?
I hope so as well!  What are you having?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?
I know the feeling.  How long have you been doing it?
Yeah, I'm glad you're feeling good about your life.
That's great, what is the occasion?
I'm glad for you! How long have you been together?
That's awesome! Do you know what you're going to do with it?
What game did you play?
That's so nice of her. I'm sure she will be happy for you.
I don't understand why you were left out either.
I hate when it rains on vacation.
That's a great point, I think I'd be a little upset if I had to pay a fortune for a beachfront!
I am so proud of you!
That's awesome! What kind of opportunity did you get?
Oh no, that's terrible! Did anyone see it happen?
I know what you mean. It's tough to stay positive when things aren't going your way.
That must be so hard on you.
That is really weird. I would be scared if I was alone at night.
Aww, that's a scary situation! I hope you have a great time in your new place!
That sounds amazing! I bet you'll have a great time there!
That is so rude. I hate when that happens too.
I'm sorry to hear that. What happens?
I love the Star Wars movies!
I have never heard of the new ones. I think it's hard to keep up with the latest technology.
I have done it too.
That's really bad. Are you eating too much?
I'm happy for you, but I have to ask, did you ask him for the ring?
That's great! Congratulations!
I agree, some people do have a bad habit of not caring about the impact of their actions.
Oh, I love those. Are you walking to the grocery store?
I know that feeling! I'm afraid of heights too, but I'm not really sure why.
Oh man, that's hilarious! I'm sure it was worth it though!
I'm sorry, that's too bad, you can try another one.
Oh, that's great! I'm glad you were able to get it!
That's exciting! What are you going to do?
That is always exciting to travel with family! What are you planning on doing during your trip?
Oh that's great.  I hope you get it in a good condition.
That's a good trade. I've had my car for about 5 years. I'm getting a new car soon.
That is really nice of them.
That is great.  What kind of things do you sell at Goodwill?
I agree, I've been going to that store for a while and I'm so grateful for them.
That is terrible.  I would have been so upset.  Did you talk to her about it?
I can't believe you did that.  Did you do it for school?
That's unfortunate.  What do you do when you wait?
Yeah, that's a good thing. You need to learn to be patient.
That is sad.  I am sorry to hear that.
I can understand that.  Do you live close to each other?
That's great. I have had to start working out recently to lose weight and walk.
What are you referring to?
I know what you mean.  I hate seeing people mistreat animals
That's true, we all have our own struggles, but it's hard to see someone else's pain
What did you do?
Oh, that's a bummer.  Was it for a good reason though?
That sounds exciting!  I wish I had one!
That is a big TV!  What kind is it?
That's really tough.  I'm sorry.  Is she doing okay?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope she gets better.
That is the only way to go.
That is very true, but I am not sure I agree.
That sounds boring.
I'm sorry to hear that, but at least you did it.
I'm sorry to hear that, what happened to her?
I am so sorry to hear that.
That's great, what's he been working on?
That is impressive.  What division is he in?
That is horrible. It's not right for anyone to abuse their pets.
That must have been a terrible feeling.  Did you get hurt?
That is sad, I am sorry. Did you meet anyone?
Oh, I bet that was a great experience.
Oh that's nice! I know how that feels.  I had to get rid of my puppy 6 months ago.  I miss her a lot.
That is so nice of you.
I have a son who is teething. I think he is just teething.
That's so sad. I hope he is okay.
Did you try to get him to sleep through the night?
Oh, I understand.  You can't be a baby anymore!
Oh wow! I love Italy! Where did they go?
That is a nice place to visit.  Are you traveling there soon?
I love traveling too, I was just thinking about it.  I think I'll go to Paris next!
Did you like it?
I love burgers. What did you have?
That's the worst.  I hate when people are in the way of the road
Oh man, that's so frustrating. Did you almost hit anything?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I used to be the same way.  I would be scared of the dark and hear creepy noises.
That's not good, are you at home?
What a wonderful job!
Wow, that sounds so fun! I love dogs!
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. What were you doing?
Oh no. Did you find out who did it?
Oh no!  That must have been very upsetting for her.  I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh okay, what happened?
Oh no, that's terrible. You must have been so upset.
I know how you feel.  I am pretty much the same way.
I love rain. It's so peaceful.
That is so nice! What was your favorite part about it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you hit another car?
Wow! I would be so sad if I was in that situation.
I bet it was a fun time.
Oh man.  That sounds like a wild ride.  You're a good person.  I bet you got a lot of good tips.  I'm not sure I would do that though.  I don't think I could handle that kind of cash.
I know what you mean. I used to live in New York and I can't get over how exciting it is to go anywhere in the city.
That's a pretty cool thing.
I totally know what you mean. I had a friend who was always trying to get me to do stupid things. He ended up burning me.
That is a terrible thing to do.
I'm not sure what you're referring to.
I'm sorry.  Did you intend to send something else?
That sounds like a fun experience.
Oh man. That sounds horrific. I would be so scared to go there. I would be like, "I don't know if I can go in there."
Oh nice, did you get it done?
That's great! I have to say I'm not sure I understand the context of those numbers. What are you working with?
Yes, it happened once to my friend. I know her better than anyone, and he was at a friend's house, and I went to the bathroom and left for a bit. I came back and he was gone.
I know what you mean. I was at my friends house all night and she never showed.
That is so awesome!  I would be so happy for you!
That's great! I'm sure she's glad you appreciated her gift.
Well, you'll have to do it when you're feeling better.
What did you do?
I bet!  I am sure they are excited.  Did you find what you were looking for?
Oh wow, I guess that makes sense.  How long have you been doing this?
I know. I hate when that happens.
Oh no! What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get another cookie?
That is amazing, how did you do that?
Oh yeah, I can imagine. I'm going to school tomorrow too. I can't wait for the first day. I'm so excited!
That's not a bad idea, I would never do that myself
That's a good point. I'm not sure I agree though. I love the store and I always go there!
That is a creepy thing to see.
Why would you hate that?
That sounds like a lot of work to get to.
That's crazy!  I've never heard of that.  Did you try it?
What makes you think he will get the bonus?
That's true.  I can't wait for something to happen but at the same time, I hate waiting.
That's awesome that he was so honest with you.
I bet that was fun.  Did you have to be careful?
That's awful. Did you get in trouble?
Oh my, that must have been so embarrassing!
I am too.  I have been working on it for a while now.
That's so cool, I bet you were surprised!
That's so sweet. Did you get up to see her?
That sounds like a lot of fun.
I have been there.  I went to college at 21, and I was 10 months pregnant at the time.  I'm glad I did, it was a lot of hard work and I was able to finish.
What made you decide to go back to school?
Oh no. What college?
That sucks! Did you have to go back to school?
oh no! that's not good at all. did you try to get a new date?
I can relate. I feel like I have to compete with my daughters.
I agree, I was really happy when I first started playing Fortnite
That's cool! Do you play a lot of games?
That's a bummer. What's your favorite amusement park?
I know what you mean, I have a big trip planned to Canada in February, I'm so excited!
That is great! I am sure you will do great things!
I'm a computer science major. I'm so happy to meet you.
I know that feeling.  What do you have?
That's cool.  Did you win a prize?
That's cool. What kind of bowling do you like to do?
I do but I am too old for it.
That's terrifying. Are you going to keep the lights on all night?
That's so cute! I have a dog too, I love her so much!
Oh no, I hope you had fun trying.
I bet.  I've had those moments in the past.  I know how you feel.  It's a good thing you didn't have to go to work.
That's a bad situation to be in.  How did you handle it?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Oh, that is sad. I feel the same about my hometown.
I agree. It's hard to find friends when you're a bit shy or busy.
I'm sure you'll be fine. It's normal to feel overwhelmed.
That is a lot of work.  I hope you can get everything done!
What are you going to major in?
That's not good. How are you feeling?
Oh that sounds amazing! I love dinner.
I love bowling.  I bet it was a fun evening.
That's so sad.  Is he a boy or girl?
I can't imagine.  That must be very hard.
That sounds like fun. What game is it?
That's great. I know it's not easy to meet people that you can really connect with.
I know that feeling. It makes me want to do something.
That's good.  I'm sure they are very grateful for it.
That is unfortunate. Do you have a generator to help with that?
Oh that's too bad. I bet you felt a little scared.
That's good news! Do you have a plan for staying on top of it?
I'm sure you will.  I am studying to become an engineer too.
I love music. What artist was it?
I agree.  I'm not really sure what's more important, growing up or staying young
That's a little scary. Are you a little envious of his skills?
I'm a female bowler so I don't have to worry about that, but I do know how hard it is to do.
I'm sure it's going to be great! You're going to do so well!
That's nice. Are you feeling stressed?
I can understand why you would feel that way. I'm sure you'll do fine.
I agree. Mistakes happen to everyone.
That's nice. I bet you missed your friends.
That is great. I would love to visit those places.
I'm sure you're happy! What is the vehicle?
I am sure you will be happy when you find the right one!
I'm sure it's not so bad.
Oh, I understand! I feel the same way about my old car.
Oh man! I hate those people. I was in a similar situation once and I had to chase them away.
Oh no, I'm sorry. What happened?
Oh no! Did you call a tow truck?
That's bad.  I've been with my 2002 Honda Civic for 11 years now and I'm starting to think about replacing it.
I know what you mean. I hate it when I have to talk in front of a lot of people.
That sounds terrifying!  What happened?
What kind of dog did he have?
I have a dog. I wish I could say the same.
Oh no, that's a bad feeling. Did you want them to talk to you?
Oh my goodness, that's crazy! I can't imagine what you would have to do to get that kind of reaction from someone.
I bet, but how did you do it?
That's really sweet of him.
I'm sure that was a tough job.
That is great, what was it?
That is great to hear!
That's great!  I bet it is.  What made you choose it?
That's unfortunate. I'm sorry.
Oh? What do you mean by that?
What are you working at?
oh that stinks
That is terrible.  I am so sorry for what happened to you.
That is good to hear, I hope you all are safe and sound!
I do too. I am the only one in my neighborhood that flushes the toilet.
Oh, I go to church and go to the gym.
That is a good feeling.
Oh wow. What did you expect?
Oh no, did you do it?
That sounds like a lot of fun!  I hope you had a great time.
Oh, that's terrible! How did they plan it?
What happened at that corner?
I have heard of that before.  I hope she was okay.
That's great, I hope she is okay.
I understand that. I've had that issue before. What did they say?
That is weird. Did you try calling them?
Oh wow! I love off days! I'm glad you're able to enjoy them.
That is terrible! Have you tried sleeping in a different room?
That's always a bad sign.
I know what you mean. That's pretty creepy.
I bet.  Did you do well?
Yeah, I get that. It is a big deal.
I am so sorry.  What happened?
What happened?
What did you do after that?
I would love to get coffee with you.
That is awesome! I have a pocket knife, but it's not the same.
That's a good attitude to have. I'm sure you will be prepared for anything.
That's exciting. What kind of job is it?
I bet! I bet you will do a great job.
That's nice. What kind of car is it?
That's a great choice.  Are you looking to buy one or build one?
I am sure you will do well
I am sure you can keep up.
That's always nice, what kind of food did you have?
I love sausage and pancakes! What's your favorite type of sausage?
I hope you don't need it though.
I'm glad you feel more secure.  Do you have any kids?
Did you have a healthy pregnancy?
That's great to hear.  It's a big step to make.  I hope you're successful.
That sounds like a lot of fun! What are you looking forward to?
What kind of work do you do for them?
I'm sure she is.  What is she doing?
That's awesome. What kind of car?
That is amazing, I hope you have a great birthday!
Wow that's sad.  I bet you really wanted them there.
That is good.  Are you trying to convince them?
That sounds like a really relaxing time, I bet you just felt good after it.
Oh? What happened?
That was rude. Did you find out who did it?
I know what you mean.  That is pretty frustrating.
Wow, what kind of dogs do you have?
That sounds cute! Did you take them out for a walk?
That's sad, but I'm sure she'll be happy to be back home with you.
That's very brave of you.  I am so sorry for the loss you are going through.
What was in the box?
Oh that's nice. I bet you had a lot of memories.
That's so sad, I hope she had a good time.
That's great, you're in a good relationship.
That sounds scary! Was it just a customer?
Did you get any answers out of it?
I hope he is feeling better now!
That is a very nice thing to feel.
I know that feeling. Do you have a problem with waiting?
I feel you.  I hate when that happens.
I love dogs too.  I have two myself.  They are great companions.
I am sure you will love him for the rest of your life
Oh no. Did she get the surgery?
Oh wow, I'm glad to hear that. I would have been so scared too if I had to pay for my own vet.
I am sorry to hear that.  Did anyone get hurt?
I am sorry to hear that, what happened?
I am sorry to hear that, how old was he?
That's so sad. I'm so sorry to hear that.
I am sorry to hear that.
I understand.  Do you like talking to people?
Oh man, that's a nice car. I've never seen one like that before.
That is so cool. What do you do for a living?
I bet you are. Why not?
That's okay, there are always ways to get around.
I'm sorry. Did you order from a restaurant or a food truck?
I am sorry to hear that. What did it taste like?
Oh no! Did you get in trouble?
i would have been mad at you too
That's great!  She must be a great sister!
What happened?
Oh no, that sounds terrifying!
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! What happened?
I am sure she did it out of the kindness of her heart.
What kind of Mustang?
I'm sorry to hear that. What is it that makes you ashamed?
Oh that sucks. I would be angry too.
I hate it when people do that too.  I hope you guys can find a way to stop it.
I think it's a prank.
Oh no! What happened?
What kind of horror film?
Oh no, that's terrible. Is there anything you can do to help?
Did you know that? I don't know what that means.
Oh no.  Is there anything you can do to change her mind?
Oh no. I bet you feel so terrible. What is she doing?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you going to the cinema?
I have seen it. I loved it.
I love the beach.  I've never been, but I've always wanted to.
I love days like that. The rain is nice and it's a great time to relax and have a picnic.
That sounds like a lot of fun! Where are you going?
That sounds like a great time! What are you guys planning on doing?
Oh man, that's a good problem to have, or bad problem to have?
I feel you. Sometimes I have to do something that I don't want to do.
That is amazing! What a wonderful husband!
I'm so happy for you.
Oh no, how long has he been working on it?
Oh wow, that's a long time to wait. What was it that he promised to do?
Oh no! Do you think you'll do okay?
That is a great idea!  I am sure you will do well.
Oh, that is so annoying.  Is there something specific that they are arguing about?
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Oh no! What happened?
Oh no. I hate when that happens.
I do.  I am trying to get my son to eat his veggies.  He eats nothing but junk food.  I am so frustrated.
I do, I have to attend to it. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.
That is so sad. What happened to your father?
I love my parents too. I wish I had more time to visit them, but it's hard to find time when life is busy.
Oh wow. What happened?
That's hilarious. I hate it when something like that happens.
It can be hard to lose control when we are mad.  I think it is good that you are realizing that you need to work on that.  I hope you have a good relationship with your daughter and that you are able to work on your anger issues.
That is so bad. I hate when people do that.
I have been in that situation. I was so angry when I saw him, but I didn't want to make a scene so I just looked away and left.
Oh wow, I am sorry to hear that.  I hope he is okay and he can get home safely.
It's nice to have a vacation. Do you guys have a big house?
That's awesome! I've never been to a state park where you can camp and stay at the park. I've been to many.
Oh no, that sounds like a terrible experience. I bet you were scared.
Yeah, I have been in that situation before.
That's sad, do you have a plan for the puppy?
That's the best way to put it.
What did he do?
What a good boy!
I don't do that. I'm too proud.
I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of ice cream was it?
I bet it's frustrating.  How did you take care of it?  Is your husband coming over?
What kind of friend is he?
That is amazing! How old is she?
Why is it?
oh wow that sounds so sweet
I'm glad you are happy!
That's awesome! What kind of pictures were they?
Did you have a great time?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is it a new house or an old one?
Oh god, that sounds terrifying. Did you throw it out?
I'm excited too!  I live in a state that's not that far from the one you're moving to.  I bet you can't wait!
That is nice. Having a better paying job is always good.
That's awesome! How often do you run?
I'm a cyclist, I do a lot of road biking and mountain biking.
I bet that was awesome! I love mornings.
That is amazing!  I wish my husband did that for me.  I would love it if he could be more helpful!
Oh, I'm glad to hear that! What's happening?
That is great.  How did you feel about it?
That's the best part of being a parent. I know it's going to be hard when she's all grown up and can't see me.
I am so happy for you!
Oh my gosh!  That sounds like a terrible experience.  Did you get to see the fire?
I hope they are too.
That is great.  I wish I could get that feeling again.  It is very nice.
I bet you do.  That would be a pretty long night.
I bet.  What did you eat?
Why is it hard?
That is a big decision, how are you feeling about it?
I hope you are able to get things sorted out.  I would be very upset if that happened to me.
Oh, what did they do?
That's awesome! What kind of trip did you go on?
I am so happy for you! I bet you have a lot of fun together!
That's cute! I have a Jack Russell too, but I don't cuddle with them as much as I should. I think they are just too cute.
I am sorry to hear that.  How did you like it?
That's great! Where are you moving to?
I bet you are! What position do you play?
I love that. You sound like a leader!
I'm sorry to hear that, what do you do to cope with it?
Oh no. What is happening?
That's really sad. What happened to your father?
That is good. I am sure it was a sad time for you.
That's not fair. You should be able to eat whatever you want.
I bet you are. What do you look like?
That's terrible.  I would have been so upset.
Oh, that stinks!  Are you going to file a complaint?
Oh wow. Did you get it?
That's no fun. Did you try to clean it up?
That is amazing! I have a 2 year old. I am so proud of him too.
That's so true! Time flies by so fast.
You're right. Sometimes you just have to roll with it.
Oh no, that's terrible. It's so unfair.
What were you doing?
Wow, that's a very good point.
I can see that, but I'm sorry you got hurt.
That is good to hear! What happened?
I am sorry to hear that, but you are a strong and capable person.
I am sure that is not the most desirable score.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it a computer repair job?
That sounds like a tough situation!
Oh yeah, it happened to me once. I was so embarrassed.
That is quite a scene! How did you react?
That's awesome! I love the music.
Oh no, that's terrible. I hope you both can work things out.
Yeah, I like that, especially if it happens with a friend.
That sounds like a fun time!
Why would they discover a tumor?
That is really sad. It is hard to deal with the loss of a loved one.
I love that too!
Oh man, that sounds like so much fun!  What was your favorite part?
Oh, that is a fun experience. I bet it was a good time.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I have never been to one before.
I'm sorry. You need to be more honest.
I am so sorry to hear about your loss.
Yeah, I know how you feel. I remember some of my friends from my high school.
I can imagine.  What did you do?
I'm glad you were able to stay away from her. I hate when that happens.
What makes you scared?
That's not a good feeling at all. Are you a brave person?
oh wow, i am not sure i would want to go there
What happened?
What happened?
How did that happen?
I know what you mean. I was too.
I'm sure you will go and have a good time!
That's so annoying! Do you sleep with earplugs or something?
That is a good thing to be angry about.
Oh wow!  That sounds amazing!  What did you do?
That is awesome! I love playing at the casino.
I am happy for you. What is the name of the baby?
that is awesome.  What is the name of your baby boy?
I bet you are. Where are you going?
That would be so cool!
Well that sucks. How long did you have her for?
I am sorry to hear that. What was going on?
Did you get a good grade?
That is great! I'm sure you will do well on the test.
That's too bad.  What happened?
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Is she traveling?
I am happy for you too!
Oh that sounds like a lot of fun! I bet you would enjoy it!
That is awesome. What was the job?
That's great. What kind of interview were you having?
I am sure it was a fun game.
That is awesome, what was the table game?
That's so frustrating. Did you apply for another one?
That's the way it is with life.
I agree, but sometimes it's hard to know.
I hope you get something you really want!
That is great.  She must be proud of herself.
That is great, what is she doing?
I understand that.  It's hard to feel lonely sometimes.  But sometimes it is a good thing.
I can relate. I like to think of it as being "me time" but I know I have to take it.
Oh no, that's gross. Did you take him to the vet?
I'm glad she is ok.
Why are you happy about that?
I hope you get to take a shower soon too.
That is so sweet, I love that.
What did you do?
I've never done that before. What was it like?
That's a lot of traveling. Did you find a new place to live?
I am sure she was very proud of herself!
I've had to do that before.  It's frustrating.
Oh no, why not? What happened?
Oh that is a great reminder to always trust your instincts.
What kind of Jeep is it?
Oh that's a good deal!  What are you going to do with it?
That's good, are you sure you're going to be a mom?
I love that. How happy are you?
That is awesome! How long did it take you?
That is nice. I hope you had fun.
That is so sad. What did she do?
Oh, that's sweet.  Is he single?
What a wonderful thing to be expecting!
How exciting! What do you do in October?
Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. What was the water like?
That's crazy!  What kind of float are you talking about?  I'd love to float!
That is so cool, did she have a cute name for her?
That is so sad.  I hope you are okay.
Oh no, that is horrible. I would be ashamed.
It sounds like a really bad time. I'm sorry that happened to you.
Oh no! What happened?
Oh no!  That's so bad!  He had to get a court order to get rid of him.
That is exciting! What are you guys going to name him?
Oh yeah? What is it?
That's very sad. How did you feel?
That's awesome. What happened?
Oh wow. I am sure she must be very nervous about it.
I'm glad you went. What kind of music did you listen to?
That is right.  I have never been in one.
That's so scary! Was it in a building?
I love my home too, it's so nice!
That sounds amazing! What kind of swimming pool?
That's pretty tough. Did you have to go to work?
That's a scary thing to hear, especially if you are alone.
That is awesome, are you confident in his ability to speak in front of a crowd?
I bet you were very proud of him
I do too.  Do you get angry?
I know. I feel the same way.
That's great! I love pizza.
What do you mean?
What did you study?
That's good. What was that journey for?
That is terrible. What job?
What was the position?
That's not cool. How did you feel?
Oh no! What was it?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Did she notice?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Did she say why?
Oh, I'm sure you are.  Are you moving to a new city?
I'm sorry to hear that.  How long do you live in this house?  I have been looking around for a new place to live.  I would like to find something to buy that is affordable.
Wow, that's great! I hope everything turned out okay.
That's great! How much do you make?
That is awful.  I am so sorry.  It is hard to be that drunk.  I am sure you learned from it.
Yeah, sometimes we have to laugh at ourselves.
I am sure that was a great accomplishment.
Oh that is a lot of change! What a time to be a kid!
That is so rude.  Why did you not tell him to calm down?
What do you yell back?
I understand that, I feel the same way sometimes.
Oh I see.  What kind of things do you like to do with your friends?
That sounds fun.
I love the feeling of being in the water.  It's so relaxing.
That's very kind of you.
That's nice.  You must be a good father.
I bet that's something to be proud of. What did you guys do?
Oh, that's great!  What are you doing that you need help with?
I'm sure you were.  How did they plan it?
Oh wow, that's amazing! What were they doing?
That's terrible.  I hope the tree wasn't too damaged.
I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a tree branch or something else?
That is so cool! How old is she?
Yeah, I'm sure you are very thankful for her.
Did they move away?
How old is she?
That's not cool.
I feel for you. I've had my share of financial struggles and it's hard.
That is terrible. How did that happen?
That's good. What were you doing when it happened?
Did you have a good time?
I love roller coasters! I have been to one a couple of times.
That's really rude. Did you tell them how you felt?
That's unfortunate. Did you ever have a chance to talk about it?
I am sure you will make some friends in no time.
You should be proud of yourself. You are not shy, you are just smart.
That's so sad. Why was she talking to them?
I do too.  I am glad you are talking about it.
Oh, that sounds scary. Did you get any nightmares?
Did you have to do something specific to accomplish it?
Oh my, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?
Oh, what did she do?
Oh wow! Did you have fun?
That sounds like a great time.
I hate it when people do that.
I know what you mean! Sometimes we just need to find someone else to talk to.
That's awesome. What kind of food do you like to eat?
Oh? What's that feeling?
Oh that's great, what did you do?
What did you do?
I agree.  I hate when people are mean to others.  I wish people would treat others the way they want to be treated.
I know right.  It's like we have a lot of choices and not a lot of consequences.
What are they doing?
I feel you.  It's scary to start a new conversation.
Oh no! I hope you were able to fix it.
What is the pay rate?
I bet she does. I would be very upset if she was.
I am sure they will take you up on your offer.
That is a good quality to have.  I don't trust anyone.
Oh no, I hope it's not you!
That is amazing. What kind of jobs do you plan on doing?
What is your new career?
I know. I hate going to the dentist too.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's a tough time for us.  I hope you get through it.
That's awesome. What job did he get?
I am sure you can!
That's a good idea. I'd like to be a Kardashian. I'm not sure if I'm good enough though.
I have a friend who is a huge Red Sox fan, he always cheers them on.
I love watching sports, I'm sure you enjoyed it.
That's great! I'm sure you're happy!
That's a good choice. Have you been thinking about it for a while?
That sounds awful! Did you have to call a pest control?
That sounds like a pretty dramatic move. I would have run in my room too.
Did you eat it?
I love cheddar, I love cheddar!
You will find it in most grocery stores. It's a very popular cheese.
I've never done that either. I think I would love to go!
I am sorry to hear that.  I am sure you are grieving.
I'm glad you guys were able to keep in touch.
Oh no, that's a bummer. What are you going to do?
I hate when that happens, it's always more fun to go out.
That sounds like a fun weekend, did you have a lot of fun?
I hope you can relax and take it easy
That sounds like a great time.
Oh that's nice. I like hot days.
I agree. I don't like how our country is so divided.
I completely agree. We need to work together to solve this problem.
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope you are doing okay.
I am sorry to hear that.  Do you have any family members left?
That is understandable.  What is wrong?
Oh that's sad. I bet you were happy to see her.
That is awesome!  I love concerts!  What band are you going to see?
I'm familiar with them. They're both great artists!
What a great person to have! I wish I had someone like that.
That is unfortunate.  I hope they do move soon.
Oh no. What a bummer.
Oh great, I hope you're having a good year!
That's a bummer. I know how that goes.
Oh wow. That sounds like fun.
That is amazing! You are so lucky to have such a wonderful family.
That is a pretty big jackpot. I am so happy for you!
That's nice, did you have a good time?
That is awesome! Congratulations!
I'm glad to hear that.  Was it a surprise?
Oh that's nice. What kind of house did he get?
What is it?
Oh man. I can't even imagine. I'm sorry.
I was thinking that too.  I wish I had more time to think about it.
That sounds like a pretty good excuse.  I would be a bit hesitant to make PB&J, but I can see how it could be a good reason to sue.
You should be! Friday is the best day of the week!
I do it too. I love the peace and quiet. I wish I could work 4 10 hour shifts
That's sad. What happened?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope it works for you.
Oh no, I hope you are able to get off it.  Are you doing something to help you get off it?
That is so scary! I am sorry to hear that. I hope they were able to help you and your family.
That's terrible. What kind of destruction?
Did you like it?
Oh, that's so sweet of him. That's the kind of man.
I agree with that, I enjoy decorating my house for Christmas.
I love Christmas, but I can't imagine my mom's house without her decorations!
That's a great sister-in-law.
That's great to hear.
I think rain can be a bummer.  I have had to cancel plans like that before.
I bet she was scared.
That is great news! Congratulations!
Oh wow, that's awesome! What did he do?
That's a good thing. I hope he doesn't get too attached to the pets.
That's so true, you have to make sure you're not letting people in that you don't want to have pets with.
That is very good of her. I hope you have a good relationship with her.
You should be more careful around people you trust.
That's a pretty scary thing to see.  Did you get a good look at what it was?
That is so creepy. I would be so scared.
That sounds very nice. What movie did you watch?
Oh that's great! Did you do anything fun?
That is so sad. I am so sorry for your loss.
I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
That's so sad, I'm sorry.
That is very sad. I hope she is doing okay.
I'm sorry to hear that.  I've had it for years and I know how hard it can be.  What kind of diet are you trying?
That sounds scary.  I hope everything works out for you.
I understand. It's frustrating when someone doesn't follow instructions.
I know, she must be a little bit of a wild child!
That's terrible.  I'm so sorry.  Did you get to say a few words to the cat?
That's awful.
Oh wow, that's amazing! You must be so happy!
What was the surprise?
That is great. What kind of bills?
I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
What happened?
That is horrible.  I would have been very angry too.  What happened next?
It's just so hard to see someone trying to help you when you are feeling like you're in a situation that is making you feel like you're in a situation that you don't want to be in. I know how you feel.
Oh no! Did you find out something bad?
Oh no! That's terrible. What did you do?
Yeah, I can understand that.
I think that's a great idea. I was thinking that we could do a lot of things that are illegal and we could get away with it if we did.
That sounds like fun! What did you eat?
That's not good.  How long is she on a road trip?
What are you studying for?
That's great!  Do you have any experience in that field?
That is so cool.  What team did you watch?
Oh no, how long have you been away?
That's so sad, I'm sure the dog was scared.
What happened?
That is terrible, I am so sorry to hear that.
I am so sorry to hear that.  It's going to be tough.
That must be very lonely.
I don't understand why people do that.
That is great news!  What is the job offer?
That is great.  How long did he serve?
That is awesome. What did she take?
I know how that is.  I got a tummy ache.  I'm glad you are okay.
I know right! I am a bit of a foodie so I try to stay healthy and fit but it's hard when you have to eat out all the time.
Did you get the driver's seat?
Oh yeah, I think I would too.
I've never seen it. What was his name?
I'm not familiar with Modern.
That sounds like a great time! I love watching my favourite shows
That's awesome! I hope she gets a lot of rest.
That's a big change, but hopefully you'll be excited for it and enjoy the new place.
That is exciting!  What are you going to do to help him?
That's exciting. What kind of home are you in?
I am sure you are happy.
That sounds scary. Did you go well?
Oh no. Are you going to go back and make sure they are not running late?
Wow! I would have been so sad!
That is amazing!  I bet you are very happy with the new addition to your family!
I would have been mad. What did you do?
Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you finally get it right in the end?
That's exciting! Are you and your husband happy about it?
That is great news!
I love that! I have a costume to dress up as too.
I love how people can make you feel like you're in a horror movie. I bet you had fun with that!
That's terrible, I'm so sorry. I'm sure you're devastated.
Oh wow, that is so sad!
That sounds scary. Did you find your way back?
Oh, that sounds great! Did you have any issues?
That is nice, I bet she is very nice.
That's great! What are you teaching?
Oh man! What happened?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I hate it when movies or shows are too violent.
That is always fun to do.  Did you find anything interesting?
Oh yeah, I've been there. I used to go to the gym all the time.
I am sorry to hear that.
Why?
Oh, what happened?
Did he yell?
Wow, that's quite an accomplishment.
That sounds like a pretty sweet deal. Did you have to pay a lot for it?
That's great! Where are you going?
I bet you are excited. I'm a big fan of racing.
I am sure you will have a great time.
That sounds like so much fun! I love going to the casino.
Well, I hope that you all get to play soon!
That is terrible. How did you react to it?
I would be too. I would be very upset.
That is sad. Where did you go?
I'm sorry. I hope you found a way to honor his memory.
Did you have a plan in place?
Oh wow, I bet that was a great surprise! I hope you have fun with it!
That's great! I'm so proud of you!
That is awesome. You must be very proud
What happened?
That is pretty rude.
I would have done the same thing, she is not a woman to be treated like that.
That is so nice of you.
That is so nice of you to say that!
That sounds scary. Did you get hurt?
I can imagine! How did you feel about it?
I am sure that you are grateful for it.
Did you have a good reason for wanting financial freedom?
That must have been a little scary.  I'm glad you were okay.
What was that?
I know how you feel. I used to be that way. But I have learned to enjoy the time with my friends.
That's right. I'm talking about the fact that I am not a good father, and I don't have the ability to do it right.
I can understand that. It's hard to let go of the children you have growing up.
I know what you mean. It's hard to let go of the memories and the place. But, it's also good that you have a new beginning.
Oh that's awesome. I'm sure you must be proud.
I'm sorry to hear that. You can always do better than that.
I would be so happy! What did you do?
That sounds like a great time! What was the trip for?
Oh no. Did you get in trouble?
That's so terrible.  I would not lie to my mom either.  I would tell her the truth.  I would not lie to my dad either.  I would tell him the truth.
That's a nice reward for your hard work.
That can be boring.  What do you like to do there?
Oh that's great. How much did you win?
I'm sorry. I can't imagine having to pay that much.
I'm sorry to hear that, but maybe you can get in touch again.  I would do that for my best friends
I'm a bit jealous.
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that! What was your car's value?
That's a bummer. I'm sorry to hear that.
That's so cool! What happened?
I can understand that. What kind of dog do you have?
What are the relationships?
I am, I like to know when someone is interested in me.
Oh wow! What was it?
Oh that's nice. What did you do with it?
That's terrible. Did you tell her?
I guess it's the fact that you were so honest that it's not the biggest deal.
That is bad. What is wrong with the baby?
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that.  What's his name?
I've seen it!  It's so good!  I love the competition and the talent.
That's so cool! Do you have any favorite characters?
I was sad when I heard that.  I have a lot of toys there and it was a fun place to go.
I bet it does. What are some of your favorite memories?
Oh no!  Did you have a good reason for forgetting?
I know that feeling.  I have two of my own and it's hard to keep up with everything.  I hope you have a good time.  I hope they have a good time as well!
Oh, I love my husband too!  We are so lucky to have each other.
That's really bad. What did you do?
Oh, I'm sure it can be, but it's hard to resist the temptation of them playing games or watching videos.
Did you try to talk to someone?
Oh wow! I bet that will be a fun celebration!
I love that! I hope you have a good time!
That's great. I love the holidays too.
Yeah. It would be nice.
Oh no! I hope everyone is safe!
I hate it when the wind is blowing and rain is coming!
That's awesome! What game is it?
Oh, I love WoW. I play it a few times a month.
I'm so happy for you. Congratulations! What was the promotion for?
Oh that's awesome! What position were you promoted to?
That's a very organized person, I like that.
Oh that is annoying. What kind of stuff do you put in them?
That is terrible.  What is he doing?
I feel you.  I've been there before too.  Its a good feeling to be able to think.
That is amazing! I am so proud of you!
I am happy for you! Diapers are expensive.
What breed is your puppy?
I know right!  You are lucky to have her!
Oh that's so exciting! I hope you do well in that degree.
That's a pretty high number. Are you a fresh out of college type?
Oh that is so sad. I am sorry to hear that.
I love little things.
Oh, that's a great movie. I love that movie.
I love that movie, it was so fun!
I'm not sure what you mean.
I'm sorry to hear that. You'll miss them, I'm sure.
I understand, but is it a friend or family?
Oh no, what's wrong?
I hope you are able to find a new job soon.
How? What is wrong?
I am so sorry to hear that.
That is the worst. I would have been home with my family.
How long do you have to be away from home?
That sounds terrible.  Is he okay?
What is his name?
That is terrible. I am so sorry.
That's a good thing!  I bet you were excited
I hate that too, it makes me nervous and I have to wait for it to go out.
Why do you agree with what?
Oh wow!  What did you do with it?
That's okay, it's not like it can happen to everyone.
That is so scary! What did you do?
I hope you can.
That's so nerve-wracking. I hope you do well.
I know how you feel. I am also a student and I am worried about my exams.
Wow, I bet that's exciting! Are you nervous?
I understand. I'm not one of those people.
Oh yeah? What did you sell?
That's nice. I'm glad you had a good one.
I bet you do! It's wonderful when couples have that kind of trust.
I see, I know you would be very happy with someone who would be honest with you.
That's so sad. Did you get to come back?
Oh no! Did the fire start in the basement?
Oh no, that's terrible. Did you get to your destination in time?
That is so true.  I would be very upset if I was traveling with them.
That's awesome. I hope you get a lot of out of it.
That's great. I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad that you are a good person.
Yeah I love fishing! I've never been. What kind of fish do you like to catch?
I have a 2 year old, we met at a church meeting. I think we would have been a good match
I bet you felt pretty bad about that. Did you get in trouble?
Oh no, what happened?
That's a good story.  I'm glad you got to be on the receiving end of a good act.
That's a good point.  I don't think I'd be able to drive my car without the battery, and I'd be worried about the car dying on me.
I'm glad you're excited. I'm more of a baseball fan, but I love the whole season!
I know! I love them!
That's so silly. Did you get caught?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I can't imagine how frustrating that must be.
That's awesome! Congratulations!
That's great. I hope he doesn't get too comfortable.
That's really nice of him, I'm sure he didn't expect anyone to be there when he was!
I bet he did. I'd do the same thing in the same situation.
Oh my goodness, that must have been scary. Did you get it fixed?
That's horrible!  I would be so mad at the dog!
That's great! I hope it's not too expensive.
That's good, so you are ready for the mortgage payments.
Oh no!  Did you get a license plate number?
What happened?
It was a great experience! I'm sure it will be one of the best experiences you have in your life!
That sounds really great. I'm glad you were able to do that.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
What band was playing?
That's awesome! I've never been good at that. Did you bowl with a friend?
That's cool, I like that about it, it's a fun way to play.
I am sorry.  Did you get your dog to clean up?
That's okay. They are in good hands.
I am sure you will do great!
I hope so too. I'm always nervous when I go on a first date.
I'm glad you're taking a step in the right direction!
Yeah, it's hard to stay positive when things aren't going well, but I think it's good to be optimistic.
I love school.  What are you studying?
That's great. What are you studying?
That's great for your friend. I am happy for him.
That is very sad.
What did you do?
That is really cool.  Did you win?
That's a pretty cool car!  Are you happy for him?
Did you get him something?
That is a great feeling!  What kind of car is it?
That's great! You must be very happy!
That is a good playlist. I love throwback music.
I love hip hop!
That's terrible. I hope he is okay.
Oh no! I hope they get the results soon!
That is amazing! I bet you are so happy!
That sounds like a great place to live.
Oh no! Was it a pretty ball?
I bet you did, I am sure it was not the first time you made a mistake like that.
Did you plan anything fun for the weekend?
Why are you excited?
That is great! What was your personal record?
I know that feeling, it's like when you start to feel like you're not good enough.  But I've heard that if you work hard at it you can get there.
That's awesome! What are you doing to get in shape?
I am sure it will work out for you. I have been struggling to stick to my diet for a long time.
That's awesome! I bet it was a lot of fun to watch him play.
I have a friend who is on his high school bowling team. It's cool to see them improve.
Did they have a party or something?
I bet they were all upset.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it a relationship or something else?
I think you'll find it's harder to get people to listen to classical music than you think.
That must have been creepy
That's weird. I've had that happen a few times too.
That is so exciting! I bet you are super excited.
Oh wow. I can't wait to meet him.
That's good, I've had a hard time getting into Christmas spirit this year.
That's sad.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Have you talked to your neighbors about it?
That is very impressive. Did you get the job offer?
I know, I'm always feeling down.
That is so terrifying! What happened?
Oh no! That's so scary. Did you get mad at her?
I bet you feel great about it.
Oh no! Hopefully you'll be fine and you'll have the energy to do what you want!
Oh wow! What kind of car?
That is so sad. How long have you been driving?
That's a good idea.  I'd be a little nervous too.
That's tough. Do you have a support system?
That sounds like a great place to live! I'm sure it will be very quiet.
Oh no! I hope it works out!
That's terrible. What happened?
Oh no! Did you have any overdraft fees?
That's great! I am so jealous of you!
I agree with you. I feel the same way.
That's awesome. What kind of blankets are you making?
Oh that is so nice of you.  What kind of gifts do you like to give?
Oh wow. I've never been to Scotland. But I know it is beautiful.
That is so nice. I never thought I would say that about my phone but it is nice to have that kind of connection.
That's a great attitude to have!
It's true, it's hard to appreciate the good things when life is tough. But I'm glad you're appreciating them now.
I love dogs too! I have a dog named Luna.
I have a cat, but I love animals! Do you have any pets?
That's okay! I'm sure it will be okay.
I am sure you will have a good time at the end of the summer.
That's so frustrating.
Yeah, I do that too.
Oh that sounds good.  Is it the fall semester?
What job are you going to be working at?
I bet you are! What kind of car is he getting?
I bet you are so excited!
That's awesome!  Are you ready to drive it off the lot?
I like SUVs, I have a Ford Ranger.
Oh no, did you get into an accident?
That's good. Did you get any tickets?
I'm sure it's nice.  How old is your oldest?
Wow, I'm 30 too! I feel old too, but I like thinking about how I was a kid when they were.
I know right! What happened?
I'm glad you're working out, how's it going so far?
That sounds like a great experience! I love shopping for food.
That sounds very tasty!  I love eating beans.  What are you going to do with it?
That's interesting.  I've never seen green beans with red streaks before.
That's a great thing to have in your life, and it's good for the environment too.
What did he do?
Did you jump out too?
Oh wow, that's so cool. Did he tell you how he got it?
I would have done the same.
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you are able to find comfort in the fact that you are not alone in this.
It is a very tough issue. I agree that more resources need to be put towards it.
That's really cool. It's really sad to see them struggling.
That's unfortunate. Do you have family nearby?
That's wonderful.  I love when I can go back to places and they feel like home.
Dude, that's amazing! I am so happy for him!
I love racing.  Do you like the race?
Oh no, I didn't know that either. I thought kids were all in the same teacher all the time.
I agree.  I went to high school in 1978 and changed classes at 16.  I was so excited to do it.
I am glad that you are prepared for a disaster.
Yeah, it's great to be ready!
That's awesome!  He's a smart one.  Did you teach him?
Wow! You must be a good teacher.
That is terrible. Did you have to move?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were going to say that.
Oh no! What happened?
That is not good.  I hope you are safe and that it was just a coincidence.
Well that's just amazing.  You are so lucky to have a friend like that.
That's great.  What's your favorite sport?
I have been trying to get Hulu for a while now. I am so glad you are enjoying it.
I love that too! I have been watching home and family on that show for years!
That's terrible!  What's going to happen?
Oh wow. I hate when that happens.
Oh no! That's terrible. I hope you are okay.
I know, it's very sad.
That is nice of them. I'm glad they didn't forget.
That is good to hear.  What did you do?
That's exciting! What kind of orders are you waiting for?
That's a good thing. I'm glad you guys are safe.
That is so sad, I hate to see animals get hurt.
I know what you mean. It's so sad to see people being so cruel to animals.
That sounds like so much fun.  I used to love decorating the tree too.
That's a good point. I remember when we would have picnics on the beach with my family.
I do know someone like that.  I'm not really a foodie, but I do like to eat out sometimes.  I like to try new places.
That is a lot of money.  What do they do with it?
Oh, what are you moving to?
I love Texas. It's such a beautiful state.
What was the hurricane?
That's great. I hope you didn't have to go through all that stress.
I am sure that was a nice surprise.
Oh wow, that's awesome!  I can't imagine having such a wonderful family.  I bet you have so many fun times together!
I'm sure she'll be fine. She's a good girl.
Oh wow, I didn't know that. I would probably have to get a second opinion before having a dog.
Wow, I'm so sorry to hear that.  What is Alzheimer?
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
Wow that sounds like a stressful situation.  I would have been very frustrated.  Did you guys have any other plans?
I'm glad that someone was able to help you.  Did you have any other issues with your vacation?
I know, I feel the same way, I can't wait to get there!
Oh, that's a tough one.  I don't like rushing either.
That's awesome, I'm sure you'll have many happy years together!
That's awesome. What kind of activities do you do together?
That's great! I love discovering new music. What station were they playing?
Ahh, yeah, I'm with you on that. Those are some of my favorite artists.
That must have been nerve racking!
I am sure you did well! I am sure you will get a great job.
That is awesome! What did he win?
That's a pretty good game. I hope he does well.
That's awesome! What country is he from?
What is your favorite part of teaching?
I live in the UK so I can't go there.  I wish I could!  I love adventure sports.
That's really cool. I like routine too.
That is so cool.  What kind of activities do you do?
That is awful. How did you react?
What happened?
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you give your horse a proper burial?
It's always sad when that happens, but at least you have a good vet.
That's probably so you can be ready for him. I bet he is always waiting for you!
That is good to do.  Do you like him?
That is awesome. Did you get a job?
That's awesome! I'm sure it was worth it!
Oh, that's great! I hope you have a fun time!
That's a good idea. I think it's a good idea to take a language course if you want to get a job.
I bet you are excited!  Is she going to be coming back with you?
I can imagine that. I have a wife and kids and they can be very messy.
oh no! I hope you are okay!
Oh, I think I know what you might be talking about!
That's unfortunate. Did you go with a friend?
Well I hope you were able to get something out of it.
Did you get in trouble for that?
That's too bad. What did you do?
That must be tough for her.
What do you mean by long and lonely summer?
That's terrible, I've moved a couple of times and it's always been a little scary.
I can understand that.
I know, I hate when rent is so high.  I am still paying 3,500 a month for a 2 bedroom apartment that is really nice.
I am going to California next month. I am excited.
That's a long drive. Did you enjoy it?
Oh that's great. I'm glad you made it.
That's terrible. Did she recover?
That's not good. I hope you guys get better soon.
I can understand that.  What are you studying?
That is so cool! I love staying home with my family.
Oh, that must be a big deal.
I hope she has a good surgeon and that everything goes well.
I know the feeling.  What did you lose?
I can understand that. What kind of race is it?
Oh, that is great! What happened?
That's great! I love cruises!
Oh no! I hope they are okay. I'm sure it was a horrible experience for them.
That is so sad. Did you find out what happened to them?
What are you doing for the four days?
That is good news.
That's a lot of distance and time, I hope everything went smoothly for her.
I'm glad to hear that you are on the mend.
That's really nice of your parents.  Did you have to pay a lot of money?
I am so sorry to hear that, do you have any idea what happened?
I love going home to my family.  I have family there too.
oh man, that is a long time.  I bet you are looking forward to it!
I know how you feel.  Do you have a fear of any animals?
I am sorry, I understand that, i am afraid of dogs too
That is so sweet! What was it like?
That's amazing.  I bet you were surprised.
I know the feeling!  What did he do?
Oh, I think I know what you might be talking about.  Are you talking about the kid you are talking about?  I would say he is around 10.
That must have been frustrating! Did you get a good look at her truck?
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you are okay.
That's funny! Did you try to find the owner?
oh nice, that's good.  Did you get a new card?
That is the worst!
That is terrible.  I am so sorry.  I bet you were so disappointed.
I'm sorry? what did you feel surprised about?
That's nice of him.  What did he get you?
I am sorry to hear that.  I have lost my beloved dog a few years ago.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you were able to see him again.
I do! I love them! They are so sweet. I was just thinking about getting one.
I think so too, but it's not easy.
Oh, that's a nice thing.  I hope you don't get too scared of cooking.  I know he's scary to you, but it's good that you have a husband.
Oh man, that sounds really bad.
That's great! Did he get it done?
That is amazing. I would be so proud of him.
That is amazing, what time is it?
I'm a huge fan of training. I have a personal trainer and it's been really good for me.
That's scary! I've never had a playdate with friends. I think it would be a lot of fun.
I am glad I could help.
That's so cool. What did you think of it?
That must have been scary. I bet you felt like you were going to die.
Oh no! What happened?
That sounds like a great idea. I've been trying to find music that gets me pumped up for workouts.
i have been a few times, i have had to deal with a lot of insurance and law enforcement.
That sounds so terrifying. What was the car?
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope she feels better soon.
That's so sad. Are you guys close?
I would be shocked if that was true, you have to check your account regularly to see if it's still in good standing.
That is terrible!
I have. I am sorry.
That is very sad.  I am sorry to hear that.  Did you have any idea that he was struggling?
Oh yes! I have two. They are so cute!
That's awful!  I've had to deal with dogs that poop in the house too.  Do you have a dog?
Oh, that's not a bad idea. I use the same technique for my coffee.
Oh no!  What happened?
Oh no, that's not very nice.
That's great! What was it that you felt bad about?
That is terrible. I am so sorry to hear that. You are going to be okay
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that.
That's awesome! I love getting stuff like that to look at.
I can imagine how exciting that would be
That's horrible. I bet you were worried.
Did you go to a new place?
How did you bail?
I know what you mean. I hate when plans fall through.
That is so frustrating. Did you try to find another group?
Oh no, that's terrible! Did you ever get to meet him?
That's pretty crazy! I bet you were shocked.
I bet. Did you do it for a living?
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. Was he in a hospital or at home?
What do you do?
That's too bad. I have a dog. He does the same thing.
Oh no! I love it when people let go of their old hair!
That's great, how long did you have it for?
Oh no! Was that a funny thing?
What happened?
That is expensive!
That's disgusting! What were you thinking?
I hope you did well.
What did you study?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope everything is okay.
I am glad to hear that. I am happy to have you as a friend.
That sounds like a great opportunity to help her grow.
Oh, nice!  Are you her boss?
Oh, I'm so glad you are excited! I love shopping for Christmas. What are you looking for this year?
What time of year?
That's terrible, why did you do that?
Oh wow that's crazy, did you try to get your money back?
Oh no! I hate it when that happens. Are you okay?
Oh wow, what are you doing?
That's exciting! What's the first date going to be like?
I bet it will.  I bet you will be fine.
That's exciting! I'm sure you're going to nail it!
I can relate.  Do you have any doubts about the project?
Oh, that is quite annoying.
That's weird. Do you have a pet?
That's awesome. I am sure you will do well.
Oh yeah? What are you studying?
I love playing games like that. I'm so glad I have a good friend who loves playing games like that too.
That is the worst thing that can happen to a family.
I feel you. I have a similar feeling.
Oh no!  Did you end up going anywhere?
I'm sorry to hear that.
What's going on?
Oh, you must have been excited. I bet it was a lot of fun to watch.
That's really annoying! Are you worried about something?
I can imagine! I bet you were really nervous!
I hope it was just a bad dream.
That's not very nice of them.
I bet you felt pretty guilty after that!
oh no, you need to call the police.
I'm sorry that happened to you.  Did he get caught?
I like it when I find out I can do things myself.
Oh, that's a good start. It is hard to stop it from happening.
Oh wow! I'm so jealous. What did you do to wake up?
I don't know what that is.
Oh my, how was it?
Oh wow! What a fun way to spend time with your spouse
Oh no! I hate it when that happens. Do you think they know about it?
I'm sorry to hear that, but you can't avoid everyone
I know the feeling, it's tough to keep track of so many accounts.
That's too bad.  They should be paying for that.
Oh that's really cool! I bet you were happy to see that!
Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. You're referring to a machine that you built together?
Did you find out what was wrong with your tooth?
Oh no! I hope it is not that.
That's pretty cool. What movie is it?
That's so annoying. Did you complain to the manager?
I'm sorry to hear that, how are you doing?
Yeah that's a good way to pass the time.
I can imagine that would be a shock.  Did you have to chase her out?
I'm not a fan of furry things either.
That's cool. I bet you felt very strong.
That's a great idea. I can't believe I forgot to do that at work.
I know what you mean.
I don't know what you are talking about.
Oh that's great! You must feel very lucky!
Wow, that's a lot of money. Where are you going?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
That sounds like a fun movie!  What was the movie?
That's really fun! I'm sure she's cute and playful too!
That's a pretty cool name. What's her personality like?
Oh, what a fun experience! Did you have a great time?
I bet. Do you still live in the same city?
That's awesome! I bet he's adorable.
I have two dogs, I love them. What kind of work do you mean?
Oh my goodness, that's so gross.  Did you chase him down?
Why do you hate that goose?
Yeah, I bet it was a real pleasure to see.
That is hilarious! Did you get hurt?
That sounds creepy. Was it a person?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you ever catch something?
Oh no, did you feel better about it afterwards?
What did you get?
That's really gross. Did you call a mechanic?
That sounds disgusting. I hate animals that die on my property.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you get any tickets?
I hate when that happens, it is so scary.
I am sure you are going to do great!
I've heard that, I bet it was a wild ride.
Oh that was so mean. I hope they got in trouble.
That is good, how did you do it?
That's great! You must have studied hard!
I know that feeling. I had that same experience in school.
That's awesome! What did you think of it?
That's really cool. I'm sure you have many happy memories of your childhood.
That's a fun experience.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I love the Rockies.
That must have been a surprise. What did you find?
That's a terrible situation.
Oh no! Did he injure anyone?
Oh wow, that's not good. I hope it's not too much to pay.
That is awesome! Did you do a lot of driving?
That's a good car! What's your favorite color?
That's great! I've never taken it.
That is amazing! What program is it?
I am sure you did great!  I have been studying for my finals for years.  I am sure you passed.
That's great! I hope you can keep it up.
Oh my, that is so rude. Did you get anything else from the movie?
That is good to hear. I hope you enjoyed your find.
Aye, I agree. People are so entitled these days.
Oh that is awesome. I love rock concerts.
That's great. What did she accomplish?
That's awesome! I bet she was very nervous!
I feel you.  I wish I could get time off too.  I'm too busy.
That sounds very stressful! Is there anything you want to do to get away?
That's great! What clubs are you in?
That is great news! I am sure it will be an awesome experience.
I know how you feel. I don't like to do it either.
Oh no. I hope you're not going to have to go there.
It sounds like something that would happen at a restaurant.
That is awful!  I can't believe you would go near that stuff!
That is a good thing, she has been working hard and hopefully it is good news.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope she's doing well now.
That is nice of him. What happened?
That's some pretty crazy stuff. I would have reacted like that.
How do you feel about that?
It sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now.
I love that too, what are some of your favorites?
I know how you feel.
I bet that was a great experience for you both.
Oh wow, that's great! I hope you get to try it!
I get that, but how do you stop it?
You must be a fan of the lady. What's her name?
I can understand that. That's a terrible loss.
Oh that's nice, what kind of food did he cook?
Oh wow! That's so sweet!  Are you happy?
That is awesome! What did they do for you?
I am so jealous, I would love to have some peaches.
Yeah that is a great feeling!
That is so awesome!  I am sure you are looking forward to it!  What country did she go to?
That's nice. I bet you were happy for her.
That's kinda cool, I'm sure you'll have a great time in your new place.
That's a long time to go without hearing from someone. I hope he's doing well.
That is terrible. I am sure you were not happy with that.
That's not fair. What are you supposed to do?
Oh no! That must have been really gross. Did you call the police?
I'm glad you're safe!  What's the worst that could happen?
That's awesome.  He must be doing something right.  I am so happy for him.
That's cool. I bet he is very smart.
I love coffee! What's your favorite kind?
What's in the soup?
I am sure you were very excited. Did you end up getting the job?
That's a good point.  How did you guys end up together?
What a nice story. I bet it is a great time for them.
That's really cool. I bet you are very jealous.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you are able to drive again soon.
That's great! What are you going to do while she's away?
Oh wow! I bet that's exciting!
Wow, that's frustrating. What did you do?
That's the way to go.  Keep them on your side.
That sucks, but I guess you have something to look forward to now?
That is terrible. You must be worried.
What happened?
I'm a lab technician at a university.  What's the most interesting thing that's happened to you?
That's a shame.  What do you think about that?
That is awful. I am sorry to hear that.
That's really tough. Do you guys have a good plan in place for the next two months?
That's a long time to wait.
That must have been very annoying
I am glad you are safe.
What do you do to get rid of them?
I have to agree. I hate when it is rainy.
I hate spiders.  Are they really that big?
I am so scared of them. I think they are the scariest things in the world.
I bet you are so excited.
It's awesome! I'm glad you like that.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get it?
Oh man! I'm sorry that happened to you. I bet it was disgusting.
That sounds scary. Are you in the process of getting the surgery?
Oh no.  I hope it's nothing serious.
That's really nice of your friend, I'm sure you were overwhelmed
That's nice to hear! I bet you appreciate her a lot!
I'm not sure I agree with that. I love my phone, I always have it with me.
Oh no!  Did you get a reaction from the person playing?
I'm so sorry to hear that. It's never easy losing a pet.
I'm sorry to hear that.  She must be very upset.  I hope she gets better.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you going to go on vacation with your daughter?
Oh that's great! What did you do?
I bet you are excited! I'm excited to move into my new apartment next week.
That's what mine do.
That is very nice of her!
That's a bummer. What kind of dogs do you have?
I've been waiting for my application to be approved.
That is disgusting. Do you have a vacuum cleaner?
i hope so! what position are you playing?
oh what game?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you and your wife are doing better now.
That's good. What do you do?
oh that sounds amazing! what are you going to do?
That's great!  Are you going on a cruise?
Oh wow, that is so nice of them. I bet you felt very happy.
Oh no, that's terrible. What are you going to do?
Oh that sounds like a good time to be alive!
That's good. I hope you get a good deal on the apartment.
That must have been embarrassing!
Did you have a good laugh about it?
oh? why is that?
That's too bad, I think LA is a very nice city.
That is awesome, I am sure you will miss him.
Why do you think he will be seeing you soon?
That's so cool. What year is he in?
That's great, what's going on?
I am sure it was a good time.
That sounds great! What was the best part about it?
That's a bit rude.  I would do the same.  Maybe you should try to get him to pick it up.
Wow. I hope he does it this time!
Oh, that's amazing! I would love to be a minister too!
I am glad you are happy for him.
That's quite an unexpected event. Did you clean it up?
That is so rude! You need to tell her that she is not allowed to eat.
I love food! What kind of resturaunt is it?
That is terrible.  I would have been so upset too.  Did you get it to go?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you were able to resolve the issues.
I can't even imagine! How did that work out?
That is great.  I love to do DIY projects and it's nice to have a helper.
That is a nice story!
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.
I am sorry. I understand.
What do you think you will do?
That's good that he gets to spend time with you.
That's terrible, I'm so sorry. I hope you were able to find closure.
That must have been really tough. I hope she is doing better now.
That's great! I hope you haven't lost her again.
That's terrible. Did you take her in?
I bet you do!  I am sure you will get back to it.
That's great.  You're so strong.  You must be a superhero!
I'm not a fan of skydiving.
I bet that was a good experience. I'm sure you two had a lot of fun together.
You must be so happy!
That's awesome! What are some of your favorites?
I bet you freaked out!
That is terrible!  Did you tell him it was just a dog?
I hope you do well. It's normal to be nervous.
That sounds like a great job. I bet you'll do well.
Oh that is so cool. I love those kinds of dreams.
What a sweet thing to do. It's nice to show your true feelings to the people you care about.
That's awesome. How did she respond?
Oh wow, that's so cute! I bet you were so happy to see it.
That's great! I have a dog too. I love playing with him all day.
Did you end up buying it on Ebay?
What is it?
That is a bad idea, I would have been very upset if I had done that!
You should have done what?
I hope he feels better soon. I know it can be so unpleasant.
Oh no, I hope he is feeling better.
That sounds like a lot of fun.  I bet you had a lot of fun.
That's a sad thing.  I'm sorry.  What happened?
I love golf.  How do you know the Ryder Cup?
I agree! I was a bit bored with my old console, but the new one is amazing!
I can imagine. What did you do?
Oh no, that's too bad. What happened?
Oh, you must have found a dead animal.
That's so funny! I would be so angry!
I agree. I hate animals too.
Oh no!  What were they doing?
That must have been scary! What did it sound like?
That would be terrifying! Did you call the police?
I hope so!  I hope you don't lose any money to him.
What is he doing?
That sounds like so much fun! What did you do?
That sounds like a lot of work.
I have never seen a drone flying at night.
Wow, that's quite scary. Are you watching it with your kids?
I am sorry to hear that.  I don't have a friend, but I know a lot of people who do.  How does she know you?
That sounds like a real bummer!
I know what you mean.  It's just so sad.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of testing?
Oh no! What did you do?
That is a long distance. I am sure you are worried.
That's awful. Did you call the manager?
That sounds like a nightmare! Are you able to get back home?
That's a good idea! I have never packed a kit for my car before.
That is awful. Did you have to change it?
Oh no, I hope you do well!
Oh, that's a lot of data to collect.  I'm sure it's very interesting.  Did you collect all of it?
Oh no! You were scared?
That sounds like a fun experience.  Are you a thrill-seeker?
That's a bummer!  I bet you were bored!
I know that feeling. What are you going to do on the weekend?
I agree, but it is hard to let go of a pet.  I lost a cat, but it was a very short time.  I miss her so much.
That's not possible, what happened to him?
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I can understand how you felt.
That's cool.  It's always nice to have a good time.
That is so sad. I am so sorry.
That is cool.
That sucks. Did you get to go out?
What happened?
Oh man! What a great movie! Did you enjoy it?
oh no, did you get hurt?
I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to say.
I'm not sure I agree with that.  Do you have a policy?
Oh no! You should have shared it with your friends
I know how you feel.  I have to be so careful with the sweets in my home.
I hate that. I hope you were okay.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will be able to get them again soon?
I would be too. I am sorry.
That is good to hear. Is he okay?
That is so sad. I hate ghosting.
That is understandable. I am sorry you went through that.
I feel you.  I have been there.  I can't believe how nice people can be.
I know, that is what friends are for!
Oh wow.  Congratulations!  Is he a man or a woman?
I am sure you are very proud of him, it is great that he is getting out
Wow! I would be devastated too.
Oh no, that's terrible. What a bummer!
Oh man, that's so close!  Did you get hurt?
That is crazy. I would be too. I guess you can't help it sometimes.
I've been having some issues with my computer lately and I'm sure I'll have a horror movie night soon.
That's crazy, I hope you don't have to go back there anytime soon
I can imagine. I would be so frustrated.
It does get annoying.  Have you talked to them about it?
That's awesome!  I love pizza.
I am glad to hear that.
That's great!  What kind of job did you have?
That's good to hear!  What are you saving for?
I hope it goes well too!  I'm sure you'll be great!
That's great! I bet you will do a great job.
Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  It's unfortunate that there was a lack of communication.  I hope everything works out for you.
That's frustrating. What do you do for work?
Wow, that is frustrating. What can you do?
That is great, good for her!
That's really cool.  I bet she's a great person.
That's great.  I bet she was thrilled.
That is awesome! I bet you are happy about that!
I'm sure he will do great! What kind of school is he going to?
I know how you feel! I am not a mother either.  I have a brother who is 10 years older and I always feel like I am not good enough for him.
That's great that you are able to let go of that part of yourself.  I'm sure he will appreciate it.
Oh that sounds fun! What is he going to do?
It sounds like you were really excited
That's a pretty cool story. What game was it?
That sucks. What course is it?
That's awesome! I bet you're so proud of yourself.
Oh wow! I would be so grateful for that! What did he make?
That's great! He must be very nice to have a wife who doesn't want to be around him when he's playing games!
I agree, I never forget to buy coffee filters. I am so bad at remembering things.
That sounds like a real struggle.  What kind of job do you have?  Was it a lot of stress?
What's that?
Do you have one?
Well, that's a good thing. It's always hard to go through something like that.
That's good to hear. I'm sure you'll be able to make it.
That is really nice.  What made you so happy?
That's great.  I feel you.  I'm just a little more aware of how much I have.
I am sorry you had a bad cold, I hope you feel better soon.
You didn't throw them out?
That's crazy!  Are you guys in the same room?
I think you are right, I had a friend who was lactose intolerant and he had a very bad reaction to a cheese he had eaten.
I don't know how she does it, but I think it's a good thing.
That's a lot of responsibility. You'll be a good dad.
You should read some parenting books.
That's awesome. I love cats.
That is funny. What did you do?
That's good! I hope you do well!
That's great. I've never had a major major grade before.
Oh no! That is a lot of stuff! Did she at least leave you some?
That's a good point.  You have to have the guts to move on.
That's a good point.  They are just trying to do their job, they should be treated like everyone else.
Oh, that's quite a move. Did you get a good look at what you were doing?
What did you do?
That is so terrible!  What was he doing?
Oh no! That's scary! Did you find it?
That sounds terrifying! Did you find it again?
I would have been embarrassed too if I had to draw. My sister is an artist.
Oh wow, I love anime! I'll have to get a copy of the manga for her.
I bet she has! I am sure you will never have to worry about that again.
That's really nice. What is she like?
Oh my goodness, I am so sorry to hear that. What is the prognosis?
That's tough. You're going to be okay.
That's scary. Were you scared?
That's terrifying! I hope you are okay!
Wow that must have been so scary. Did it go well?
That is so sad, I hope he is doing well.
Oh my goodness, I am so sorry to hear that.
That is a good point.  I think you could have kids, just be careful.  You are 25 so it is a good time to start.
That's cool! I have a lot of old games too.
I love playing it. I have it on my Nintendo 3DS.
How did it go?
Oh no, what happened?
That's terrible! I hate when people get to cure diseases and then they do it for personal gain.
That's not good. I am sorry to hear that.
How did you enjoy it?
That's a good movie. I liked it.
That's so rude of him. I would be upset too.
I am sure he is a very humble person.
That's a sad day.
That's a good point.  It is a big election.
Oh no! I would have been so scared.
I think it's a good thing.
That's terrible. What are you going to do?
That's a pretty tough situation.
That's very nice of you.  It's always good to be there for family.  How did he end up doing that?
That is nice of you. I wish I had a friend like that.
That is great!  How old is he?
That's not very good.
That's so cool! I have a dog too.
I'm not even sure what Immanuel Kant is.
That's awesome! I would love to eat some hot dogs if I got to eat one!
Oh, I see. I guess I won't be inviting you over for dinner anytime soon.
Oh no! I hope you're feeling better now.
That is good. How did you feel before?
That's nice! I have a few of my own too.
That's a bit of a tragic story. What happened to her?
Did you punish her for it?
That's so mean. Did she get a good beating?
I have no idea what you are talking about, but I bet he's a smart kid!
I am sorry to hear that. Is he in trouble?
Why did they hire someone outside of the company?
I would be hesitant to question him. I would tell him how he is making me feel.
Oh no.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry for that.  I would have been devastated if I had lost my cat.
I am sorry to hear that.
That sucks, I'm so sorry to hear that.
That's a bummer.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have a plan?
That sounds delicious. What kind of pie?
That sounds delicious!
Oh wow! How long have you been waiting for that?
I agree with you.  I think they are a good brand.  I am glad you are happy.
I'm sure it was a pretty warm fire.
I love it when that happens.  Was it a sleeping bag?
That sounds like a scary night! I hope you made it through okay.
Oh no. Did you put out the fire?
That's a big city.  Are you a Muslim?
Oh I know what you mean! I live in a country with a huge Muslim population and I have seen some of the crazy things they do.
Oh no, did you get it back?
I'm glad. How about you?
That is a very common feeling. What are you worried about?
Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a good mechanic.
That must have been tough. Did you feel like you were lonely?
I love playing games on my console.
That's really tough. I'm sorry to hear that.
That's great. I hope it continues.
I think you must be kidding me.
That's a pretty good point. A school desk is a simple and practical thing.
That's good. What kind of job is it?
That's the worst, what do you do?
Oh wow!  What kind of cleaner does it have?
I know exactly what you mean. I have a friend who lives in a house with a lot of dust and it's always a bit gross.
That is so great, I am sure she is doing a great job.
Oh that is so nice of you. I am sure it's a great job.
I hope so too. Are you moving for work?
That would be so bad! What are they like?
That sounds like a crazy adventure! How did you and your partner do it?
I am so happy for you!  I am sure you are very happy and grateful!
I do. I wish I could go back to when I was younger and be a better person.
Well I feel the same way. I love my life too but sometimes I wish I could go to something simpler.
I do that too. I sometimes feel like I missed out on things.
That's a tough situation. I hope you are able to find them.
That's really nice of them.  Did they give you a tip?
Well, I'm glad you appreciated the effort. It's nice to have people around you who are willing to go the extra mile.
I'm sorry to hear that. I have a friend that is the same way.
I understand, I wish I lived closer to her.
Oh, I'm a bookworm too! What kind of books do you like to read?
I do not read much. I like to read, but I am very lazy.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What did it say about your village?
What kind of buildings are they?
Yeah, I don't like seeing things go to waste.
That's cool, it's always nice to be able to go back to where you grew up.
What is his name?
Oh, that's very sweet of you. What is he?
You must have been really surprised!
That's so funny! I'm glad you got to see them in action.
That makes sense.  I feel the same way.  I think they deserve to have a place to call home.
Oh that's great. I hope you can make a difference in people's lives.
That is awesome! I have never won anything like that. Are you going to spend it all?
I'm glad you won. Did you win a lot?
What did you save for?
Oh that is so funny.  Did you feel better?
Oh yeah, I know that feeling!
Oh, what a bummer!  I have a cat too and I just love her, but that's not the most fun to deal with.  Did you get the shoes back?
What did he do?
I hope you did.  Was it a monetary prize?
Well, you'll get another chance next time!
Oh yeah? I can't stand that. I don't like them.
What was it?
That is really tough. I am sorry to hear that.
That is terrible. I hope you all are okay.
Oh wow, that must be a big deal for you. What are you going to do?
I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm sure you'll be back soon.
That's awesome! I'm sure it took a lot of hard work. What were they studying?
I agree, I think most people are a little too scared to go to college.
Oh no! I hope you don't get lost
Oh my god, I am so mad at you. I would have been so upset.
Oh wow! That is pretty funny. I bet he was so proud of himself.
Oh wow, I would be too. I've never been camping before, so I think I would be very impressed!
That's good to hear. Did you have a good time?
What are you playing?
I'm not a gamer. How did it go?
I love skydiving. I hope you have fun.
What did you do for 25 years?
That's good to hear! What was it for?
I'm sure it is. I'd be nervous if I had to start walking again.
That's terrible. I'm sorry.
I can imagine that. I have a lot of car trouble with my car. I just got it fixed today.
Oh, that is exciting! What is it?
Oh really?  Is it a rare comic book or a rare collectible?
Oh no! Were you scared?
That sounds scary. I hope it was a stray dog.
Oh really? What kind of technology?
I know right!  I still have a 1990s computer.  I am so nostalgic for those times.
Wow, that's quite a feat. Did you enjoy it?
I bet you did. Was it food?
That is a good thing.  Do you have any family members that need help?
I know what you mean.  I am not a big fan of the weather right now.  I can't even get my coffee ready.
What was the movie?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, did you see it?
That's great. I love it when you can find a variety of places to go.
I would like to see some organic grocery stores.
Yeah, that's gross. Do you like to make the dishes yourself?
Oh no, that sounds really bad. Did you eat it anyway?
That is not good. How do you keep it clean?
I love that, I hate litter
I hate that too! I don't have time to wait for someone who does that.
That's understandable. People have a lot on their minds.
That must have been very scary!
I can imagine!  I've had to deal with some pretty horrible people in my life.  I think we should all try to be kind to each other.
What made you decide to try it?
I have been there and I am glad I went. I feel the same way.
Wow, that's so cool! I love trying new foods.
That is nice.  How long have you been having it?
That is awesome. I am sure you will be able to make it
That sounds fun! I bet you're excited.
I hate that. I don't know how anyone can stand it.
That sounds like a real problem. I bet you are annoyed.
I know right! I hate when that happens.
That is really frustrating. I would have been so angry at him.
That's true, I've always felt that life is too unpredictable for us to be sure what the future holds.
That's so awesome. Where are you staying while you're in Vegas?
That sounds like a lot of fun, you must be excited!
That's awesome! I hope you're happy.
Oh that's great. I live in a huge apartment. Do you have a new house?
That's good. I do, but I am getting out of my parents' house.
That's terrible! I hope you were able to get rid of it.
Oh no, that is horrible. I hope you are okay.
Oh, that sounds like a nice drive.  What are you driving?
I'm sorry to hear that.  You must be worried about getting into an accident.
I bet you were excited.  How did it go?
Oh, that sounds like a great model. How does it work?
That's great! I always have to go to the store to pick up my groceries.
Oh, I can understand that. I've got to get the groceries out of the way first, and then I can go shopping. I think you'll be able to get used to it.
Oh, I've seen that. It's a classic.
Oh no! What happened?
Wow that is amazing!
That's good to hear. What did he do?
What did you do?
Oh no!  I hope you are okay.  That can be painful.
Was it a big glass?
That's too bad.  I bet you were ready for that.
Oh no! What kind of animal?
That is so scary!
Oh wow! Did you have a great time?
That's a lot of places to visit!
What a nice surprise! Did you find everything organized and tidy?
I agree. I've never been to a big game in my life, I just enjoy the excitement.
I hate when that happens.
Do you like ziplining?
That's cool. Did you get a good deal?
Oh no, that's terrible. How bad is it?
Oh no! Did you get in trouble for slamming the door?
I'm sorry to hear that. I know how much you loved him.
I'm sorry to hear that, do you have any plans to help her out?
That's great to hear!
That sounds like a lot of work. I hope you are feeling better now.
I bet you are! What are you moving for?
Oh that's a good thing. What are they going to be in?
I agree, it's so bad
That's really bad, why would you do that?
That is not a bad thing.
Oh, I feel you. I have a cat. I don't know what I'd do without him.
That's sad.  Are you going to play with them?
Oh wow, I love collectibles.  What kind of cards?
That sounds like a fun vacation. I hope you guys have a great time!
Oh no!  I hope you can take her!  Are you going with her?
That's awesome! I'm sure you'll find a better job.
I wish you the best of luck with that.
Oh that sounds like fun. Do you like fair food?
I bet you do! What are you going to do?
Wow, that's very scary. I would be too.
I love my home too. It's hard to leave it when you've lived here for so long.
That sounds so peaceful. What were you doing?
Well that's good. You are a very intelligent person.
Oh wow, that's nice of them.  What did they do?
That's understandable. I don't have many friends either.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by that.
Oh, that's terrible!  That's the worst, it's like they're trying to drive you crazy!
That's crazy. I have one, but I don't know how to use it.
That's so cool! I've never been to a marathon before.
That's cool. What do you have to talk about?
That's not a problem at all. It's good that you're preparing.
Oh no! I'm so sorry! Did you find it?
That's great to hear. Did you see any suspicious activity?
That's really impressive.  I wish I could do that.
I love your confidence and I'm sure you did great.
That's not good.  How often do you look at them?
That's really scary. I can't imagine being in that situation.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you get your bags back?
That is terrible! How long has it been?
Oh no. I hope he recovers.
I can't imagine what it would be like.
Oh man that is awesome.
I bet you were amazed. I bet he was too.
What a fun experience!
Oh that sounds fun! I bet they were so happy to see you.
Oh my gosh!  What did it hit?
I hate those things!
I bet it's gross
Oh that's pretty annoying. Did you have it locked before?
That is nice of you to remember that.
That's sad. I've never had a cat, but I know how you feel.
I like that. Do you still listen to songs?
That's awesome. What kind of emo music do you like?
What did you do?
What is it?
Oh no, what did you do?
I hope it is okay too. I have a pet cat that is very sick and I don't know what to do.
That is a little creepy. Do you think they are coming to visit you?
Oh, that sounds really good. I love roasts!
That is great news! I bet you feel very happy and proud of yourself!
I am too! I love the winter!
Oh no, what do you have to do?
Oh no!  I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried telling them to leave you alone?
I am sorry to hear that. Is he going to come back?
That's true. Maybe you should join a club.
That's terrible. Are you taking her to the vet?
That sounds horrible. Did you find out what kind of dog she is?
I hope they are not too afraid of it. I hate having to do a fecal test.
That sounds like fun! Where are you going?
What was the activity?
Oh, that is nice of your roommate. I would have done the same thing.
Oh wow.  How did you do that?
That's scary. Are you prepared?
I can't agree with that. I think it's a natural disaster.
Oh no!  That would be a bummer.  What will you do?
That's terrible, what did you find?
I love mac and cheese. I'm a big fan of it.
I know that right!  I love spicy food!  What kind of food did you eat?
Why did you buy it?
Oh yeah? What are you doing?
I am sure you will find the problem!
Did you have a dog when you first brought the new dog home?
That's great.  How long have you been working there?
That's true. Sometimes, it's hard to find a place to work and get a job, especially when there's a lot of competition.
What a great time!
What is the destination?
Oh, that sounds really nice.
I love YouTube!
Wow! That is a nice gift from your mom!
That's awesome! I bet she loves playing with it.
That's amazing! Congratulations!
Well you are lucky. I hope you guys have a very happy honeymoon!
That would be a big change.
That's terrible. I'm so sad. That's a lot of people working there.
Oh no. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for your loss.
That must have been very sad.
That's so cool!  Do you have any idea what the prize is?
That is really cool, how old is she?
Why was that?
I love winter.
Oh no, that's awful. Did you try to swat it?
Oh no! Did you get hurt?
Oh no! I hope she didn't eat too much of it. That would be gross!
Did you call a plumber?
That's good, do you feel confident about it?
Wow, that's great! You must be confident!
I bet that was gross. Did you have to do anything with it?
I've never seen someone do that.
That's hilarious! I bet that was embarrassing!
That's true. I've had some of those kids in my past. They're just so mean.
I love pizza! What kind of pizza did you get?
I hate that kind of pepperoni.  What happened?
I bet! Did you get it fixed?
That's frustrating, I'm sure you did okay.
Oh no, I hope you're okay! What happened?
I'm sorry that happened to you.
ohh that's so rude of you.
I was not sure what you were going to say
What did you have for dinner?
Aww, I'm glad you were able to find some peace!
That's crazy! What did you do?
Oh my goodness, I hope they were able to catch him.
That's so sad! Did you call the dog's owner?
Oh no! Did you get something else?
Oh no! What did you do?
Oh man, that is a scary situation.  I hope he did not get hurt.
I'm sorry to hear that. I've never had a pet that tried to eat poop before.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.
You didn't get a good night's sleep?
Oh that's nice! What kind?
What do you mean?
Oh no! That's terrible. What do you think you could do to stop it?
I think it would be a great idea!
I do the same.
I do! I have been with her for 4 years now and we have a child together.
Oh wow, that is amazing, I wish I could afford to buy a house.
I'm glad it's been a painless process for you!
I would be upset too.
I'm sorry to hear that.  How did you feel when she didn't respond?
What did you do?
Oh no. That is a terrible thing to do.
Oh wow! That's so cool! I would love to ride that!
Well, I think you'll be fine. I've ridden many a bike.
I'm so sorry. What happened to your dog?
That's terrible. I think it would be a death sentence. I hope it didn't happen to you.
I agree with you on that. What things are important to you?
I completely understand. It's a big responsibility.
That's good. What neighborhood were you living in?
Did you have a good time?
I do, but I don't watch anything else.
I like watching movies, especially action movies.
Oh no, did it turn out okay?
I know right! What kind of cake was it?
That sounds like a nice way to spend the evening.
Oh no. What happened?
It's always nice to look back and remember the good times.
What do you mean?
You have to believe that you will get through it!
I bet it will, what is the worst that could happen?
That's terrible.  Why did they have to do that?
That's terrible. I don't get why they can't just find another place to live.
That's not good. Did you see a doctor?
I bet.  Did you go to the doctor?
That's great! I love video games! What kind of games are you into?
I am a huge fan of the series. I haven't played it but I heard it's really good.
I've had that happen before. I always feel like I'm being ripped off.
I bet you do. I mean, you do have the best life.
I've had a pretty good year, but I have to admit that it's been a bit of a struggle to get through it.  I had a lot of health issues and had to work a lot of extra hours to pay for things.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it through the rest of the year.  But I'm hoping that things will start to get better.
Oh yeah, I remember that.
That's great! What was your day like?
That's great! Congrats!
Oh no! I hope you're okay!
That's not good. What happened?
I do! I played the old Atari 2600.
I think I will, I like nostalgia.
Oh I'm good, just going through the motions.
That is good news! What happened?
That is so rude of her, did you tell her it was not yours?
That was a bad decision.
That's no good. How long have you been together?
Oh no, I hope it was not too bad of a sandwich.
Oh no, I hate when that happens. What happened?
Oh no, I hope it was okay!
That's terrible. I'm so sorry. What happened?
Well that is understandable. It is hard to deal with that kind of stress.
That sounds kinda scary! Did you enjoy it?
That must have been scary.
Oh wow, what was the job?
Oh no! What did you do?
Oh no, I hate when someone takes something that doesn't belong to them.
I don't understand why you feel guilty.
That is so cool. Did you have a good time?
Oh wow. That's scary. What happened?
That is good! I think it is so easy to get caught up in our own problems and forget to think about others.
I agree.  You should start a school club to fight against bullies.
Oh yeah, it is a lot. I've played so many games in the past.
That's true, I've heard some games take that long to develop.
That's kind of you to say no.  What are you doing now?
What did you do?
That sounds fun! What happened?
That's a good thing. It's good to have those memories.
Oh that's great!  Are you going to keep it?
I agree. I don't like to sell things I like.
That must have been exciting! Did she seem to like it?
That is great!  What is her age?
I am sure he will return it.
That sounds like a good plan.
I've never done that.
I think that's the same fear of death.
Oh, that's a good one. Did you get any funny looks?
Oh wow! What happened?
Oh no! I hope you are safe.
That is a very smart move
That must be terrible. I hope you can do well.
I am sure she will be proud of you.
That's a long time, do you feel like you've grown a lot?
I'm glad to hear that.
I've always been fascinated by skydiving!
Well that's awful.  How long were you away?
Oh that's good to hear, I hope you had a good time!
What a great time, and a lot of food!
Oh wow! I bet you did! What time was it?
That is nice. It is always good to see old places
I am too. I love looking at old photos from my childhood.
Oh my god, that's terrible. I'm so sorry.
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.
I love that kind of thing, I'm sure it was a great time!
Oh, I'm sure you are. I mean, what are you doing that makes you so popular?
That is awesome. I wish I had found someone like that.
I think that is great. It's nice to have a second chance at love.
That is terrible.  Did you get a replacement?
That's good to hear. I hope you were able to get it back.
I bet that was a great experience
Oh cool. What kind of group was it?
That's great to hear! I'm so glad to hear that!
I'm sure you are. I've had some tough times myself.
I'm glad to hear that. What is it about?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What were you doing when it happened?
Oh no, are you in a hurry?
That is a bummer.  I bet it's not easy to get a good deal on the car you want.
That is pretty gross! Did you get hurt?
Oh no! What happened?
That is true. I hope you had fun.
What are you buying online?
Oh yeah, I know what you mean. I can't help myself either.
It's so sad. Dogs are so special.
Oh wow, what kind of dog was it?
That sounds like a great time, I hope you all have a good time!
I've never had one, but I've heard it's fun to have one.
Oh wow, what are you looking for?
I understand that.
That's understandable. What would you like to do more?
Oh wow, that's great, I bet you feel really accomplished about it.
I'm sure it was a lot of work. I'm sure it was worth it in the end.
What is it?
I wish I could see a specialist.
That's great. I'm sure you'll do well.
I can imagine, I'm sure you felt guilty.
Oh no! How much weight did you lose?
That sounds like a huge responsibility, are you feeling confident?
Oh wow that is awesome! I love studying! What subject are you studying?
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you are not too hurt.
Oh yeah? What happened?
That is great to hear.  I am glad you have a great family.
That is so sweet! I'm glad you feel that way about them.
Oh no, that is so sad. I am so sorry for you.
Oh no!  I'm sorry to hear that.  That must have been very hard.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. What made you not want to buy it?
That's good. I've had a lot of problems with my car, so I'm glad you're having good luck with it.
Why do you say that?
That is so sweet.  I love that you can say that.  It's the only way to make that statement that you love someone.
That is weird. Did you hit your head?
What was the prize?
That sounds exciting.  What are you planning to do?
I love the Smithsonian too! What is your favorite thing to see there?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of knife is it?
What do you mean?
That's sad.  Is there anything you can do to have children?
I really understand your point, it's easy to get caught up in the cycle of the "what if" and the "should have". But the truth is, it's all just a cycle of trying to find the perfect balance.
That's great. What was the job?
Oh, nice!  What was the question?  Was it a test?
That sounds pretty rough. Do you still live out of your car?
That is good. What kind of situation?
I've always wanted to try that!
Oh that's really interesting, what do you mean by that?
That's awesome. What are your favorite Robin Williams movies?
I love that! Where did you have the memories at?
Oh no! Did you end up getting a good laugh out of it?
I hope they didn't! I love pink and green together!
That's cool.  I've never been into dancing, but I have watched some videos.
I love dance battles. I bet you are going to crush it!
I bet you were mortified, but did you feel bad about it?
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Oh no! Did you get the job?
I would have done the same thing!  I think you made a great decision, I hope you found a better job!
Did you move to a new place?
I agree.  Do you have any new goals?
I am sure you will do great.
I bet you can, you have to practice a lot!
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that! I hope it doesn't affect you too much!
What do you do with that milk?
I know what you mean.  What did you do?
What kind of pump?
Why is that?
Oh no! Did the dog get hurt?
I am sorry.  I hope he can understand.
I don't think I would want to know what he was up to.
That's good you can make choices like that.
That's not cool.  Why did you eat too much?
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by that.
Oh wow, that must have been expensive. I guess you could say that was a bad idea.
That's not cool. I bet you were really looking forward to it.
Oh wow, that's amazing! I bet you're a little nervous about it.
I love that Arnold.  What kind of workout do you do?
I have seen it and I was scared!
I'm a little scared of you.
I'm glad you're quitting! I've been trying to quit for years, but it's hard!
Oh, that sounds amazing! What kind of things did you imagine?
That sounds like a lot of fun! What did you end up doing?
I would have been terrified. I would have been so scared!
It's great to have a sense of accomplishment.
I love crochet. I also like to crochet, I crochet a lot of things like blankets, hats, and scarves.
Why did you go to the gym?
Oh, that's awesome!  What kind of exercises did you do?
Oh my gosh!  I am so sorry.  Did you get to clean it up?
I bet you felt bad about it.
That is nice of him.
That is so scary!  I hope it was not too bad.  Did they operate on you?
I know how you feel.  I had a similar experience with my ex.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did you guys have any kids?
I know what you mean, I often cry when I'm watching a scary movie, but I know it's good for me.
I know what you mean. It's like something happened and it's hard to explain.
I hate that.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.
I know, I am the same way. I love eating, but sometimes I just can't stop.
That's a good point. You need to be careful to not overdo it.
I'm glad you liked it.  It's a great speech.  What do you think about it?
I agree. I am so curious to see what it will be.
Oh wow, that's a cute thing to see.  Did you get to meet them?
Oh my, what a wonderful event.  I am sure it was a joyful time for you.
That's a fun memory to have. Did you get any eggs?
I bet he would if you asked him
I've never eaten cloves of garlic.  Did you like them?
What was it?
Oh no!  Did you ever find it?
Why did it get ruined?
Oh no, that's terrible. You must have been so frustrated.
That is bad news.  What do you do if you do get bad karma?
I love dresses! I'm sure you looked very pretty in your dress!
I have never heard of a dress like that before.  Did she wear it to a party?
Oh no, that's terrible. I hope it was nothing serious.
That is terrible.  I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you are okay.
That's good! What kind of things do you use it for?
That's good. What kind of resource?
I agree, I have seen many animals sleep, especially dogs. They are so cute when they are sleeping.
What's going on?
Oh no! Did he survive?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened to him?
I remember my kids, they are so much fun to watch grow up!
Why those days?
That is awesome! It's always cool to look back on memories like that
Aww. What's that?
That's awesome. I am sure it was hard work but it sounds like you did well.
I'm glad you're done too, that is a big accomplishment.
Oh no, I am sure she was excited. Did you have a reason for letting her?
I am glad you are safe, I would be so scared.
I'm sure you will get back and hit it again!
I love that you're optimistic and have faith in yourself.
Oh no! Did you have to get up to look at it?
Did you pretend it was something else?
I bet you felt great!
What do you like to try your hardest at?
What did you meditate on?
I hope you have a good week.
oh no. that's a bad thing to do.
Well, you have to know he will do what he wants. It's hard to do anything with someone who is not committed.
Oh nice. You're probably getting better.
That's great to hear.  I am sure you are proud of yourself.
Did you confront them?
That's awesome! I'm sure it was a big surprise. I'm glad you're having a great time with your child!
I agree! I went to high school and now I'm a college student.
Ahh, sounds like a nice life. How long have you been able to do that?
That must have been scary. What kind of surgery was it?
I can imagine.  How did you do?
I feel the same way!  I love the feeling of lifting weights and pushing my body to its limits.
I have been a bit inconsistent lately, but I am trying to get back on track.
I'm sure it's not easy.  I hope you can have a good conversation.
I don't have any of those.
That's so sad. It's hard to lose a pet.
That's understandable. Do you have a new dog yet?
That must have been really hard to deal with. I'm sorry you went through that.
I hope they learn to treat others better too.
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. I had a cat and she died when I was 9 years old.
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope she was a great kitty.
Oh wow! I bet you were a little nervous too. I've never had a cat, but I know how that can happen.
That sounds like a pretty good day to me.
Oh wow, that's so unfortunate.  What happened?
That is a blessing indeed.
That's a great feeling!  How are you feeling about the end of summer?
What do you do for work?
That's so cool. I bet you guys had a lot of fun together.
That sounds like a lot of work!
That's great! I hope you feel confident in it.
Oh, what is it?
I bet that was a challenge!  I have been working out for a few months now and I am in decent shape now.  I am really proud of myself!
That is great! You have to keep going and you will get there!
That's good! What kind of job?
I am excited about it too. I have no idea what you're talking about.
I hope you did well on it
That's a good idea. Did you get an A on the final?
That's terrible. Did you get a new hammock?
I know that feeling. I have a hammock and I love reading in it.
That is nice.  What did they say?
Did you all meet up?
That sounds great! What are you planning on doing?
I would do that too. I have a lot of leftover meals from the past week.
That sounds so scary.  I can't imagine what it would be like to have a closet full of clothes and then having them all disappear.
Oh wow, that sounds really uncomfortable.  I have had some pretty weird dreams myself.  I used to be able to fall asleep without having any trouble, but I've been trying to sleep more and it's been hard.  Have you tried anything to help?
That's a pretty nice dream.  What kind of house?  Is it a new one or an old one?
That is terrible.  I can't imagine how stressful it would be to not be able to afford a house.
Did you get a good reason for that?
I can understand that. It's a great show.
That is nice, I like that.
What did you do?
What did they do during that time?
Oh no! Did they have a good day?
I am sorry to hear that, but it sounds like you are a strong person.
I'm glad you can. I know it's hard. But you will get through this.
That is so true. I hate when people are so selfish and they don't even care about the impact on others.
Oh my, that's really true. I'm trying to avoid them right now.
That's awful. What were you thinking when you checked your messages?
That's not good, you should block them too
I'm not really into climbing, but I'm sure it's a lot of fun.
Oh, that's a bit scary!  But you should be fine.  I've done some rock climbing too!
I have been there. I think the reason is that you are too tired.
I am sorry to hear that. Is this a new experience for you?
That is awesome! I can't believe how far you've come. What exercise were you doing?
I know the feeling. I am always trying to be more active, and it is hard to make time.
That's so awesome! I'm sure you're really proud of your baby.
That is a good thing to say. You are so brave for that.
That's awesome! I've always wanted to try out ice skating.
That's impressive.  What is your sport?
That's not good.  You should try to make new friends at school.
That's great! I am sure you will be able to make new friends.
What classes are you taking?
What is your baby's name?
That's great! Are you planning on taking her on a trip?
I am not sure yet. I am in a long-term relationship, but I don't want to get ahead of myself.
I hate spiders, I'm a total scaredy-cat!
Oh, I'm afraid of those! Do you have a bug spray?
I am glad to hear that. Being a single mother is really tough.
Oh that's great! I'm sure they will be proud of you. What is it that you are working towards?
That's awesome! I'm glad you have such good friends.
I've never been to Florida. I've heard it's a great place to visit, though.
I am so sorry. Did you get the insurance company's help?
That is so scary!  I hope you made it okay!
That's really nice of you to be doing that for her. I'm sure she appreciates it.
Did you have a good relationship before?
That is terrible! I have never had a pet rat before, I don't know what to do. I would have to get a different type of pet.
Oh, I bet she is quite the little sweetheart.
What a blast! I've never been to a theme park before.
Oh I love amusement parks, I just got back from one and I am so ready to go back!
That's terrible. I hope it's not anything serious.
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you are okay.
Oh no! Are you going to go out and try to find someone else?
I know it does. I have been there many times.
Oh no! I would have been so mad! Did you get a new set?
Oh no. Did you try to hide?
Oh man that's horrible. I bet you feel terrible about it.
I agree. I like to think that life is short and I want to enjoy every moment.
I love albums! I had to work on mine for 10 years.
The time is going by fast! Is there a reason why you are so excited?
That sounds like a great trip. What will you be doing?
Oh wow, that's awesome! Did you have a good time there?
I agree with you.  It is a shame we have to live in a world like this.
I agree. It is true, and I hope that my family will be a better example.
Oh no, I'm glad you made it out alive!
That's good. What happened?
That's disgusting! Did you call the police?
Oh no, what happened?
That's sad. What a great memory.
That's very kind of her.
That's so nice of you, I love Christmas!
That is good!  What are you planning to do?
That sounds fun, you must be excited!
That's so sad. What are you going to do?
That is so sad. What do you do to help her?
That's a great attitude to have.
I know what you mean, it's hard to drive when you're tired.
Wow that sounds really scary! I would have been so scared!
That's really nice of you.  What are you doing to help him?
That is very sad. I can only imagine how hard it must be for him.
I am sorry.  Why are you envious?
I'm sure you're not rich, but you're happy and that's all that matters
That is so rude. Did you say anything to him?
That is bad, I'm sorry.
That is awful. Did you feel bad?
That is so scary! I know how that is.
That's a fun idea. You're a funny guy.
That is so cool. I bet you guys are close.
I bet you felt bad about it. Why?
I know how you feel.  But you'll have your kids when the time comes.  It's a good thing.  I hope you can make it with your kids.
That's awesome!  What made you win it?
That is awesome. I have never traveled so far.
That sounds like a lot of fun. I'm sure you're going to have a good time.
That's awesome!  I hope she's going to make it to 40!  I'm happy for you.
Why are you excited about it?
That's not good. Did you tell her how you feel?
I am sorry about that. Are you okay?
Oh, that's terrible! I hope everything is okay!
Oh no, that sounds like a disaster. I hope you were able to fix it all.
I agree with you.  I do not eat meat.  I feel it is a form of exploitation.
That is a lot! Have you ever thought of going back to meat?
Oh, I am sure she wasnt trying to cause any trouble.
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that! How did she react?
I hope you do too.
That's good. Do you study together?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What do you see?
How sick?
Oh, that's great! What is your new pay?
I am sure that is very nice of him. What is he doing that is so generous?
Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. Have you talked to your partner about it?
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you find some comfort in time
That sucks. I feel you. How long have you been there?
I feel the same way.
What subject did you fail?
That's really annoying. Why did you not take the retake?
I think that's what the sound of a recording device is called
Wow, what is that?
I love those! I was a kid and got a pack of 4 colors.
I love those pens.  Did you use them?
That's good. What are you looking for in a new home?
Oh, I'm glad to hear that. What are you selling?
Well, that's a bummer.  I hope you can get her to come next time.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can see her soon.
Oh wow. What happened?
That is so gross. What was she eating?
That is awful. Did you get your car back?
That's terrible. What happened?
Oh, I know what you mean.  I have three kids and they go to school every day.  It brings back so many memories.
I can relate.  I had to start school in 1985 and I was so nervous.  I was the first in my family to go to college.  I was so scared that I wouldn't make it.
Oh my goodness! Did you get a stomachache?
That's terrible, I hope you find out who did it!
That's really tough. Is he in a better place?
That's good.  What happened?
Oh wow, that's pretty sweet of you. What did she say when you told her?
I love that.  What did you do?
That is unfortunate, but it will get better, I am sure.
I know what you mean, I've been there too.
Why did you lose it?
I'm sorry to hear that. What type of one is it?
That is very disappointing. Did you talk to them?
That's okay. It happens.
I agree! It's a beautiful thing to be able to just relax and enjoy life.
Well, I think it's about finding what you love. And it's good to have something to look forward to.
I have that problem too.  I just try to hold the suit up and put it back on
I am sorry to hear that. Did you get embarrassed?
That's a good point.  I bet he's jealous.
Wow, that's nice of him. What's his name?
That is nice of him. What kind of items?
Oh wow, I bet that is a lot of cool stuff.  Did you see any interesting items?
That is terrible! I bet he was happy to be able to let you borrow his car.
Oh, that's good to hear. What did you do to him?
Oh no!  What happened?
Oh no!  I hope you didn't actually pee in a chair!
Wow, that's very kind of you. I bet they love the food too.
What kind of help do you give?
Oh wow that is so cute! What kind of puppy is it?
What kind of breed is it?
That is terrible!  Did you ever see the man again?
That is good that you are doing well.
What kind of soda did you drink?
Oh no, that is terrible.  Did you have a good cup of coffee?
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
That is great that you are teaching her a lesson, but it is good you did it in a way she understands.
That is great.  I love old games.  It's like looking through old photos.
That is so cool. I love playing games.
That is no good. What was the reason?
That is unfortunate.  Did you have any other job opportunities?
I'm sorry to hear that, I'm sure it's a tough time.
I know what you mean, I've been through the same thing.
Oh wow! That's quite a boat!
That is pretty pricey.  I hope you are able to use it safely.
Oh that sounds like fun. I've never been fishing before, but I've always wanted to. Do you think you'll catch any fish?
That's good, what are you going to do?
I have had friends who have done that and it has ruined them.
Yeah, that's good, you must be a good friend.
That's awful. I hope you found him.
That's terrible. I hope he is okay.
I skateboard too! I love it, it's so fun!
Oh yeah? I can't imagine what that would be like.
Oh no, that's so sad! Is she going to go to a family gathering?
That's good.  I'm sure it was a good experience for her.  I don't know how old she is, but I'm sure it was a good experience for her.
That is very frustrating. What were you expecting from him?
I know the feeling, I have been there. I am hoping to get more pay but my company is so small that I have to work a lot.
I can relate, I did that last weekend.
That's really bad. I would be so mad!
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. I know it's not fun.
Why do you like them better?
That's awesome! Did you get it for him or did he get it?
I'm sure he was happy! Did you have fun?
I bet that was quite a shock, did you take any photos of the damage?
That sounds like a bad time.  I hope you can get your stuff back.
I am so sorry to hear that, but I am glad you were there to help her.  I am sure she was very grateful for you.  I hope she is doing well now.
That is sad.  I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you were able to find some comfort.
That is wonderful! I love kids!
That sounds pretty sweet!
That's really cool. I'm glad to hear you're all doing well.
That's a good attitude to have.
Oh that's so cool! I'm sure you must have been so happy for them.
That is awesome. I am glad you have kids.
Oh no, what happened?
Yeah I know what you mean.  I have a lot of friends that have been around for a long time.  I'm not sure if you're talking about that or just about the past.
That sounds delicious!  I love red beans and rice.  What was the other dish?
I love the wait.  Is it a meal you enjoy?
That is terrible. Are they being taken away from you?
That's unfortunate, I hope everything works out.
That's great! What was the exam about?
Oh, what happened?
I bet you have a lot of fun memories from that day.
I bet! You must be feeling pretty good about yourself right now!
Oh no, how long has she been bullied?
That's nice.  It sounds like you care a lot about her.
That's terrible! How did she react?
Oh no, what did you do?
That's really bad. What happened to your dog?
That's great to hear. I'm sorry to hear you had to go through that.
I hope he doesn't get lost or injured.
I have a cat too, I have two.
What did you play?
How long have you played the cello?
I would have felt the same way.  I once slipped on a banana peel and ended up getting a bruise on my face.
I bet. I can't imagine what that would feel like.
What did you do?
That sounds like a pretty poor management style.
That's nice. But, you shouldn't feel obligated to do anything you're not comfortable with.
That is so unfair. I am sure that is a big disappointment.
That's terrible! I'm so sorry. Did you have a good day?
That's really bad. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
That's nice of you. Did he do a good job?
That's great. I bet he had a good time.
I don't know what you're talking about. What is it?
That is disgusting.  Did you get sick?
That is so sad.  I hope that there are enough people who care about the water that they can help to keep it clean.
I'm sure you'll be fine!  I've been in a few leagues before too.
That is understandable.
That must have been frightening. Did you get the dog?
Yeah that sounds like a big dog, I'm sure he was a pain to deal with.
What game did he buy you?
Oh no! Did he actually lose 20 pounds?
That's good. Did you have a lot to do?
Oh, I'm sure you will. What is it that you promised to do?
Oh no! Did you get in trouble?
I hope you got out of there safely!
That's a tough one to make a decision on. It's nice that you have a special connection with it.
I can understand that. It's not like you can hold onto something like that.
Wow, that's a great accomplishment.  Did they buy a house with a spouse?
I know the feeling.  I have a child of my own that is 5 and he is a big boy now.  I had to learn to accept that he is growing up and that he will not be a baby anymore.  He is a big boy now and he is doing really well.
Oh no, what happened?
Did you find anything?
I know how that feels.  It is hard to let go of someone you loved.
That's a terrible feeling, I can only imagine how you feel.
That is so sweet. Did you guys do anything special?
I think I do too!
I've never been to a zoo. Do they have a good animal selection?
That's not true.  I think you might have misunderstood.  Animals are in enclosures for safety and to keep them healthy.
That is awesome! I bet you are very excited!
Oh yeah, that sounds like fun! Are you going to DC?
I'm sure you are. I have been to a lot of places and it's always exciting.
That's great! Where are you moving to?
That is so creepy. Did you ever say yes?
That sounds so weird. I would be mortified.
That is awesome. I hope you are able to find a new job soon.
I'm sure that's a great idea.
That's really cool.  I'm sure she's really happy.  How did you feel when you found out?
That's cool, I've never been.  How did you find out about the trip?
That is disgusting.
Oh yeah? What happened?
I bet you are nervous about it.
Oh, that's a good way to think about it. You're not going to be able to do anything if you're too rushed.
That is terrible. Did you get a police report?
I am so sorry, I hope you were not in a car.
That is so sweet. I bet you must have felt like a proud parent.
What happened?
I hope he doesn't spend it all!
I hope so! Do you have a good relationship with him?
Oh my god.  That is horrible.  Did you call the authorities?
Oh wow, you must have been very upset. What was the situation?
Oh no. What's the news?
I agree. I hate waiting too.
That's tough. What did you do?
Oh yeah? What is it?
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry! Was it your car?
I hate that, especially if you were in a hurry and saw it.
Oh, that's exciting! Where are you moving to?
That is nice, I am sure you will be fine
That's terrible! I hope you got it replaced.
I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
I love dogs! Did you find out what it was?
I'm sorry to hear that, but I don't know what you mean by that.
I hope you get a good job. What kind of job is it?
Oh wow, I hope you do well!
That's good, you should be ready.
I hope so too! I bet you're going to do great.
Did you get it back?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did he get arrested?
That's good.
That is pretty cool. What kind of campaigns do you do?
What did you do?
That's great! I hope you get the job!
That sounds like a good job. What kind of work do you do there?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that.
I agree. I've been working on my life for a long time.
That's a good choice. What is your favorite body wash?
I agree.  I used to do that all the time.
That's okay, it's a rainy day, why not?
You mean the weather?
That is so sad! Did you take him to the vet?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you will find another good companion.
That's good, I hope you don't need to use it.
That sounds like a great place to live.
That is nice. I would love a soup like that.
What is your best friend?
I hate when that happens!  I hate when I go to a restaurant and they don't have a gluten free option.
I've had that happen before. It's always frustrating.
Oh that is funny. Did you drink them all?
That is so cool.  I am so happy you were able to solve the problem.
That's so cute. I'm sure you made some pretty fun things out of them.
That's understandable. What are you going to do?
That's great. I like pancakes.
That sounds delicious!  What is your favorite breakfast food?
I agree.  What makes you say that?
I love that about my wife.  She does the best.
Oh that's a good idea. I'm sure he will keep it a secret.
That is good. I would be afraid to reveal any information about someone to their face.
That's so nice of you. I'm sure she will get through this.
That is a very good attitude to have!
That's too bad. You should start saving now!
Oh yeah! I've heard that about it. I have a Toyota Tacoma.
Oh, I bet that's a good one!
I love scratch offs! I used to buy them all the time!
Oh my goodness. I have never heard of that before. That is so gross!
What happened?
Did you get it?
Why is he going to have so much fun?
Oh that sounds like a lot of fun!  I bet you will enjoy it.  What cruise line are you going on?
That is great.  I would love to go on a cruise.  Have you booked it yet?
Oh no! That's terrible. Did he have a problem?
Oh my goodness, I hope he was okay.
I understand that feeling. I feel that way sometimes.
I am glad to hear that. I am also praying for you.
What is your favorite junk food?
That sounds delicious, what made you feel bad?
What did you do?
That's so sweet. What did he open?
That's awesome! I'm sure she will do great!
That is very good.  How old are your daughters?
That is terrible. I am sorry.
Oh my.  What happened?
I am sorry to hear that, hope she feels better soon!
That is terrible. I hope she is okay.
Oh, what kind of cat is that?
That is a good thing! Is she healthy?
That's good to hear. I hope you went well!
I bet you were.  What happened?
Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a good time?
That sounds great. Did you have a nice getaway?
That is not good.
I'm so sorry! That's awful. Did you clean it?
Oh wow! What kind of things did you do there?
What kind of ramp are you talking about?
That is very nice of him.  I am glad you have his support.
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you get the disability you deserve.
How did that go?
What kind of doctor do you have?
Well, that's a good thing then. I hope you are happy with the situation.
Oh, I love it when the house is quiet. I don't like it when it's loud.
That was a long drive. I wish I could go to visit my family more often.
That's a bummer. I wish you the best!
I hate that! What did you do?
Oh no! That is terrible. Did you ask her to restock?
That must have been very sad.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you okay?
Oh that sounds like a lot of fun!  What are some of the places they will be visiting?
I'm sure you would, have you booked your flight yet?
That's always great to see old friends. I have friends from college as well.
That's true. I remember when my first boyfriend lived in a small town where everyone knew each other.
Oh really?
Oh no, I bet you were furious. I bet she had to pay back a lot of money!
Oh no, that's a terrible situation to be in.
That is very disturbing. What did she do?
I can't imagine how stressful that must have been.
That is a horrible person to be.
That is too bad. Hopefully you will be able to have a nice visit with her soon.
Oh I am sorry to hear that.
That's great! How are they doing so far?
That's awesome, what did you buy?
That is so frustrating, I hope you got the results back soon!
I'm glad everything turned out ok! What happened?
That is terrible. Did you get to meet the grandkids?
What kind of arguments were they having?
I love playing volley ball! I bet it is so much fun.
I agree, I would miss it too. But you have a lot of great things to look forward to in the future.
That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of fish do you like to catch?
I have a catfish in my aquarium, I always wish I had a blue one!
That is a great way to spend the evening
Oh? What happened?
That's understandable.  How did they make you feel?
I know how you feel.
I hope you get it!
That's great. What kind of camera do you want?
That's terrible!  I would be too.  What a terrible dog.  Why did he do that?
What do you have to clean up?
That's great! I'm sure you'll have a great time.
Oh, that's great! I hope you have a good luck with it!
I have heard that before! I am so glad you are safe!
Oh no. I hope it wasn't a major issue.
That's good, it can be quite bad when you're trying to sleep!
Oh, I am sorry!  I am not too familiar with that.  Do you live in a pool area?
That's really disappointing.  Did you try it again?
Oh no, what did you eat?
I am sure you did great. I bet you looked sharp.
What was it about?
I love chocolate cookies too!  What is your favorite kind?
That's the best kind of cookies! I love the oatmeal ones too.
That's a great memory.  Did she do well in kindergarten?
Oh wow!  I love Hello Kitty!  I bet you were very happy for her!
I love playing video games!  What's the name of the game you're playing?
I'm sure it's very rewarding to see a child learn new things.
Did you buy something else instead?
I'm so jealous! I love that brand too.  I'm going to have to get some for my daughter.
That's great! I'm glad you were able to stick with it.
Oh, that's awesome!  That's a big change!  I'm sure you'll be very successful.
That's great! I hope it happens!
I know what you mean!  I had a big job interview and I was so nervous.  But I did my best and it went well!
That is good. I bet you have a lot of knowledge about medical supplies.
Wow, that's disgusting!  I hope the people arrested are being held accountable for their actions.
That is so sad. I hate animals as well.
It was such an exciting game.  Do you like football?
Oh I know that feeling, I'm from the UK and I've been a huge fan of football my whole life.
I know, it's like the kids are all home and not at school anymore.
I know that feeling! I miss having my kids around too!
That's true! Time flies quickly!
That sounds gross! I hate when that happens.
That must have been a pretty cool experience.
That is crazy! Did they get arrested for something else?
That's very sad. I hope they can get everything sorted out.
I agree.  We have a lot of animal shelters that are very good at finding homes for animals.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that, I hope they get help and a second chance.
Wow that is great! I bet he is excited
I am sure he will do well.  I am sure you will be happy when he makes it onto the team.
That's good news, have they been doing well?
I love ice cream too! What is your favorite flavor?
I am 14.
That sucks. It's always hard to feel left out.
That's true. I get bored too.
Oh no! That must have been scary.
Oh no! I'm so sorry. Did you get in trouble?
Wow, I am so sorry.
That is a terrible thing to go through. I am so sorry.
Oh wow that's amazing! That's pretty cool that she was able to learn so fast.
That's great.  What is she doing now?
That is horrible. How did you fix it?
That's a good habit to have. Do you have a lot of receipts?
I am sorry you went through that. It can be very tough.
That's nice.  Do you have a good relationship with your mom?
Oh no. That must have been really hard. Did you get your life back together?
That's good to hear. I'm used to all the noise.
That's a pretty funny story. Did you guys get in trouble?
That is quite a shock. I am sorry to hear that.
Oh no! I hope you enjoyed it anyway! What movie was it?
Oh yeah? What happened?
That's terrible.  I would be too.  What are you going to do about it?
I can't stand worms either.  What do you do with them?
I can understand that. I work from home and it can be hard to get work done because you're the only person in the house.
I know how that is.  I have two little ones and they are always trying to show me their new video games.
What's going on?
Yeah, I know how that feels.
Oh no! I hate worms. I would have been so grossed out too.
That is a little frustrating.  Why do you have to try to eat something that is already hard to eat?
That was scary, did you get a good look at her?
Oh wow, was it a friend?
I hope he is happy and healthy!
Oh my gosh, that is so adorable! I have two dogs myself. I love them so much. I am so jealous of you.
That's a little bad. You can't control what you eat.
I would be worried that something bad has happened.
Oh no! I hope you were okay! I would have been so scared!
oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that!
What happened that made you afraid?
That's great!  What did you do with it?
Did you have to work on a lot of a project?
That's so frustrating!
I am sorry.  I know how that feels.  I am sorry you are missing them.
That sounds like a lot of fun!  I love butterflies!
That's awesome! Did you get a picture of it?
Oh no!  That is disgusting!  I would be so angry!
Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you okay?
That is so annoying. Did you get mad at her?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried changing your pillow or changing your sleeping position?
That's great, I hope you get the job.
I know the feeling. I've never been to a large public event like that before.
Oh no! That's terrible. Did you get to sit near the front?
You must have been very scared.
Oh my, that's not good. I hope he didn't get in trouble.
I am happy for you, how are you?
That is really scary, did you call the police?
Oh no. Did he get caught?
That's sad.  How old was he?
That is really sad.  Did you have any plans to get him a new pet?
Oh wow!  That's pretty cool!  What did he sing?
I would have done the same thing.
That is good, did you get an A?
Oh wow. I bet you had a lot of stress. Did you have to go to work early or late?
I am sorry to hear that.  Is it a song you like?  I would never like to hear it.
That's a good thing to have to keep up with.
Really?
Oh, I'm just going to visit my family. I haven't seen them in a while.
I'm sorry, did you do it on purpose?
That is so bad. I hope she is okay.
That's a great friend! Did you find him when you came back?
That is a terrible idea. He should have his own car.
That can be a tough decision.  I'm sure you'll figure it out.  What do you think you might want to major in?
I have a friend who is a graphic designer. I think it is a pretty cool job.
Oh that is a good idea. Do you have any plans for Christmas?
I'm glad to hear that things are going well.  I hope he is happy with your efforts.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Did you end up finding something else to do?
I know the feeling! I'm glad it's almost over!
I am sure he will appreciate your concern.
What is the problem you are going through?
I bet.  Do you have to pay rent?
I am sure that you do that.  I do too.  It is always a good feeling.
That's really concerning.  Have you talked to your husband about it?
That is terrible, I hope he can get out of it.
Wow, I'm glad you have a good father in law. What are you going to do?
I hate when that happens.
I am sorry to hear that.
I love that! I have a friend like that. She always knows exactly what to say to make me feel better.
I'm sure it does. I know a lot of people that are still recovering from a lot of pain.
That's a tough thing to do. Do they need to fly to far away?
That's a lot of kids. What are they doing?
That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I hope you're okay.
Oh wow! That is awesome! I am happy for you!
I've never played Grim Dawn, what game is it?
I love devotion points! You must be really good at them!
That's nice! I bet she loved it!
Oh no.  That sounds pretty gross!
Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did you get help?
Oh, that is no fun at all. You should have a drink.
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I bet you felt terrible!
Oh no! How did it happen?
That is so exciting!  What is she studying?
I am sorry to hear that.
Oh no, that's terrible. What are you doing to cope with it?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What are you doing to manage it?
That is so sad.
That's sad. I'm sorry. What happened?
That is a good thing she can practice.
Oh great, hope she is
That's good! How much do you know about the subject?
Oh yea? What did you study?
Oh wow! I love that. I used to listen to a lot of oldies.
I am sure it was.
That is very sad. How did you take care of him?
That is pretty sad. I am sorry to hear that.
That is very nice of you, I hope she is okay
Oh no. That's terrible. How did she break it?
That sounds like a nice way to end the day.
Oh wow, that sounds amazing!
That can be tough. What did you do to prove yourself?
That's not cool. Are you a single person or a couple?
I'm sorry you're having to deal with that, but I'm sure you can quit if you try really hard.
That's too bad. I can't help but think about all the people I've hurt in my life.
Oh, I hope you get it!
What is the hold on you?
That's a bummer. Are they going to be able to play with them again?
I bet. What kind of toys?
I would have done the same thing!
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you get better and soon.
That must have been very upsetting.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Oh no, how was he?
I bet he had a good reason for doing that.
I have 2, I remember it like it was yesterday.  It's such a special time!
That's good. Did it happen recently?
I am sure she would be happy you remember it.
That is so nice of you! I am glad to hear that.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you play paintball?
I'm sure you'll have a great time.
That's a good thing you went!
I'm sure you're not crazy! I'm a little scared of heights myself, but I've always been told that you can't go over a certain height and get hurt.
That's too bad. I love dogs. What happened to the dog?
What happened?
Oh no!  Are you okay?
What did you do to hurt your pride?
Oh wow!  What did you think of it?  Was it still in good shape?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.  Do you have any close friends that you can talk to about it?
That's awesome! Congrats! What kind of award?
Did you get a reward for it?
That sounds like a lot of fun!
Yeah, I know what you mean.  I am a huge sports fan, but I am also a big gamer.  I play a lot of basketball, and I love playing video games like Madden.
Yeah I'm in the same boat. I'm looking forward to a weekend at the lake!
Oh no, I hope you don't feel too bad about it.  Did you have to hide it from her?
I think I can help you with that.
That is so sad.  I'm so sorry, you must have been so upset.  I would be too.
I'm so excited for you!  What are you looking for?
Oh, I would be terrified to ride my own skateboard!
Oh that's good.  I am sure she is a good car driver.
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope she is fine and that she is okay with the car not being hers.
Oh my goodness, that is terrible!
That's so sweet of her! I know that feeling can be really tough.
Oh that is good, I hope you're feeling better.
What happened?
That is so sad. Did you guys work it out?
That's pretty lame.
What did you do?
I bet that was great! I love going home to my parents.
Oh that is so sweet. I love animals.
That sounds like a lot of fun! Are you going to be riding a lot?
That's good. You must have been hurt pretty bad
That sounds like a good time to have with the dog!
That is really bad! Did you call a cleaning service?
Oh no! Is she okay now?
That sounds so cozy. I am so sorry you had to go through that.
Oh no!  What a wonderful occasion!  What's the type of wedding?
I'm happy for you. I'm going to my in-laws for the first time.
Oh wow, I bet that's a lot of work!
I am so sorry to hear that, I hope you will be able to adopt one soon!
That's a bummer. Did it happen?
I can understand that, I do have a lot of junk from my work.
What kind of programming did you do?
That is great, I hope he is in a good place
Oh wow, I hope you got it. I hope you get it.
That is good, did you ask for a raise?
Oh that's great!  I'm so proud of you!
Oh that's a great thing! I hope they do well and get lots of love!
That is nice of you. Where did you go?
I'm glad you all got to do it!
I'm sure you have a lot of fun!
That's cool, I live in Texas and I'm from Florida. I can only imagine how much you miss it.
Oh no! How did it go?
What was he doing?
That's good! You must be ready!
That is cool.  I love studying Japanese.  I would have taken it in college too.
What kind of job?
That's really good. That will help you be prepared for any questions that might come up.
That is always cool. What movie was it?
That's great, what memories?
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that.  Is there another place you could go to work at?
You should go to a gym! I love going to a gym!
Oh no, what happened?
That's nice. I had a dog that passed away too.
That's terrible. Are you sure that there's nothing wrong?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any tips on how to speed things up?
Oh wow! What kind of candies do they get?
I bet you would love it!
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope he is able to live a long and healthy life.
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's disappointing. Did you sell them?
Oh, you are very careful. I'm glad to hear that.
Oh no! That's terrible. What is it going to be?
Good, I hope he finds a good home.
Oh wow, I bet you are very proud of yourself.
I know that feeling.  What is it that you need to do?
That is amazing! That must have been so exciting.
I am sure it was worth it.
I love the beach! I haven't been in a while. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun!
That sounds like a great time!
I love umbrella drinks, I'm so ready for the sun!
Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did you get your stuff?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that!
I'm sure it was a great gift.  I love Apple watches.
Oh no. What happened?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it was a good conversation.
Oh, that sounds like a great time. I'm glad to hear that.
That's awesome!  What kind of job do you have?  Was it a promotion?
I know how that is.
That's terrible.  I hope you can find a solution.
How do you plan on getting to work?
I think we should be. I don't think I could take help from anyone.
That's so cool! I love looking at old childhood memories.
I love that you have those memories. I wish I had those memories with my siblings.
That's so bad, did you lose your laptop?
That is terrible!  I would be too, I would be so angry!  Is it safe?
Oh wow, that's pretty sweet! Did you enjoy the day off?
That's good, you must be happy.
What made you get up early?
That's great! What's your new job?
Oh wow. I bet you'll be pretty good. You have a good eye.
That's awesome! I bet he's really excited!
That is funny! I am sure he is just joking around.
That's great! I hope you get it!
Why did you get the job?
That sounds great, what are you going to do?
I'm sure it will. You've got a good head on your shoulders.
I am so sorry to hear that. Was he okay?
That's really nice of him. I bet you felt good about it.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Did you do well?
Yeah? Why is that?
I know right. I'm glad you are okay.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you talked to your doctor about that?
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you get better soon!
That is a great accomplishment.  What a great son you have!
I love opening day.
That's hilarious.  She's learning, I bet!  I would be so proud of her.
Oh, that is hilarious! I bet she was so happy.
I bet you are.  What is her name?
That was a good way to save up.
I can imagine how special that is.
That's okay. What's going on?
That's crazy! Did you eat a lot before bed?
I think you should see a therapist!
That's very nice of him. Did you try it?
Aww, that's nice of you.  I have an uncle like that.
Did the vet have to take your cat in and do some tests?
That is good to hear.  What did it turn out to be?
That sounds really scary! Did you end up getting a tow?
That sounds scary, did you feel safe?
I am sorry to hear that, I can't imagine being grounded.
That's pretty lame, but I guess you have to do it for the NASA job.
That's great!  I'm a little jealous.  What is it about being ready that you find so exciting?
That's a good way to look at it.
That's really scary. Did you see it?
That is a long time.  I am sure she is fine now.
Oh no! Are you going to make it up to her?
Oh wow. What happened?
Did you tell him why?
Oh no! Did they have a fight?
That's a great memory to have, what kind of toys did you find?
Oh? what happened?
Oh, how long was that trip?
That's awesome! I've always wanted to visit Chicago.
Did you go abroad?
I have always wanted to go to Europe.  Did you have a lot of fun?
I bet that was a nice surprise. I've never won anything like that before. What did you use the shed for?
That is disgusting. I don't know how you could have put up with her.
How about you?
I love Halloween Horror Nights!  I went last year and it was so much fun!  I can't wait to go again this year!
That's a great experience. Did you get a nice job out of it?
Did they just let you go?
I'm sorry to hear that. What did you lie about?
I am sure it was a good confession!
Did you find a new job?
I'm glad to hear that you're getting a job!
That sucks. Did you get insurance?
I am so sorry!  I bet you were so scared!
That's so nice! What did you get to do?
I bet you were! What kind of shoes did you get?
Oh, what kind of job was it?
You're lucky to have found someone like that!
That's terrible, what were you guys doing?
I hope no one was hurt.
That's awesome! I hope you win!
That's great.  How did you know this?
That is really nice of them.
That's really nice of you. Did they like the beer?
I bet you were hoping to win! Do you think you will next time?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?
I love Lord of the Rings.
I get that. What is it about the fantasy world that you miss?
That's terrible. What are they trying to do?
I understand your frustration.  It seems like the country is going down the drain.  I don't know what to do, but I agree that the government is not doing what it should.  I wish more people would care about the country.
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that.
I don't know what you're talking about. What happened?
That's unfortunate, were you able to get the job?
That is terrible. Did you get a chance to speak to the manager?
That's bad. Did you lose any important files?
Did you get a chance to save it later?
I hate when that happens.  It's like you're watching a movie and you can't believe what's happening.
Oh man, I hate that too.
That's not good, did you go to the doctor?
Oh, I hope it's nothing serious.
Oh wow! That sounds like a lot of fun! Did it work for you?
Oh that sounds fun! I bet you were surprised.
Oh yeah, I hope you do well.
That's good. You should do it.
That's awesome! Did you get the job?
That's great!  I'm glad you felt good!
Oh wow, that's so nice! I hope you appreciate it!
That's great. What is her name?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing okay!
That sucks. I'm so sorry.
Oh no. That is terrible.  I can't imagine that.
That is so nice of her.
I bet you felt like you needed a nap!
That's great. You must have a very good family.
Wow, that's a long way to go. What was the reason he was away?
I'm sorry to hear that. How long has he been working?
That was a good thing to have.  I'm sure it was a nice gesture.
That is so nice of them!
Wow, that's sad. What was she like?
I know the feeling, but sometimes you have to get over it.
That's so annoying!  Did you get your paper?
That's terrible.  Why did you have to demolish it?
That is awesome! I am sure she is very proud.
That's great! How long will it take?
Oh that's so nice of her! What did she do?
Wow, that sounds amazing! What is your favorite part about it?
That's great! I love cats!
That's great! I'm sure you're so happy.
Oh no! Did you find someone?
That's good to hear. It's always good to have people you can trust.
What a great idea! I hope it was a fun experience for your dog.
What kind of dogs are they?
Oh no! Did you go to the store to buy him a gift?
I would have been mad too.
Oh wow, that's so exciting!  What are you studying?
That's great, what is it that you are doing?
That's nice. What kind of jewelry did they give you?
That's good.  How old are they?
Oh that's great! I bet it was a lot of fun for you to have your car fixed so quickly.
I am sorry. What happened?
That is very tough.  What is your husband's mother like?
I feel you, my son is the same way.
I hope you have a great flight
I think they are great too!
That's terrible. Are you going to report them?
I understand. I had someone do that and it made me so angry.
How old are you now?
I'm glad I made it through that. It's hard to believe how fast it went by.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you know it was time to go?
What is she?
Oh no! Did you find them?
Well, I'm sure you'll get them back eventually.  I've lost my keys before too, and it's not fun!
Oh my god. What was he doing?
That's good. Do you think he's going to end up with this one?
That's a pretty weird situation. It's possible that she was just being suspicious.
Wow, that's awesome. I'm glad that you were able to keep it from them.
Well, there are some people out there who will take a huge risk for a small gain.
That is awesome.  I have a friend who is a photographer.  He makes a lot of money from his work.
That's awesome! What sport is it?
You must be very proud of yourself!
That's quite a surprise! Did you enjoy it?
That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I could do that.
Oh that's nice! I bet you are happy to see it!
I can see why you would miss that. The 90s were a great time.
Did she make you do it?
That must have been so embarrassing.
I would never want to roll into a car.  I hate that.
I know what you mean. I was so nervous the whole time that I was really sweating.
How often is he on the road?
I'm sure you will get there eventually.
I'm sure you will do great, I bet you will!
I understand, but try to relax and enjoy the experience.
I'm sure you'll be fine. You're moving to a new state, you've been to new places before.
I'm sure it will be a good trip.  What is he going to do?
That is terrible.  What happened to it?
That is so sad, I am sorry.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by first tattoo. Is it a tattoo of something?
That's good that you're able to handle it. I've never been able to do that.
That is nice. What is he doing?
That's nice of him.  What was the rough day?
That is awesome! What have you done?
I'm so happy for you! Congratulations!
I agree. I have a friend who is a musician. He played the piano for hours every day. He had a way of making you feel like you were in another world.
I have a similar feeling about my sister. She was a little girl and passed away 3 years ago.
Oh wow, that is a sweet memory.  I love stuffed animals.
Oh that's nice. What's his name?
Oh no! What happened?
That is so sad. What happened?
Oh my, I would have been so embarrassed!
That's not a good feeling. Did he ever get a chance to fix the problem?
Wow, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you can find some comfort in the memories you have of him.
That's really sad. I'm sorry.
That sounds like a lot of fun. What are some of your favorite shows?
That is a good show.
That's awful, I can't imagine having to do that.
That's a tough spot to be in. Maybe try to network and build some connections?
That is so embarrassing!
That's not good. Did anyone see?
oh no, i hope he gets better soon
What kind of chicken?
Oh wow! What happened?
I'm sorry you had to do that.
Oh nice! I hope you do great!
That sounds exciting. What is the product?
Did he get in trouble for it?
Did you have a good time?
I can understand that. I know my ex would do the same thing.
I think you just need to work on your communication skills.
That is great! You must feel very proud of yourself!
I'm sure you will!  What are you going to do?
Did you find her in a shelter?
Oh no! Did you get hurt?
That's nice. What do you like to do there?
What are they?
Well, that's nice. I'm a big fan of baking.
That's a great compliment.
I can understand that. I have a very close relationship with my mother. I am glad you have her.
That's so nice. What do you enjoy most about it?
Oh no! I hope he got accepted!
Yeah, it's always great to see people doing well. What's your role in his life?
That's so sad. I'm so sorry. I hope you are able to heal.
Oh no.  I'm sorry to hear that.  I know how that feels.  What happened?
I can imagine. I am sure you will be happy to see him when he comes home.
I bet you're very proud of him!
Oh wow! Where did you go?
Yeah, it's a nice break. I'm sure you will make the most of it.
That is great! I hope you both have a great time together!
Oh I love that!  That sounds like a great time.  I bet you'll have a great time.
That's great! I hope you have a good time!
I bet you do! It's so important to keep the romance alive, especially at an age when your kids are growing up and starting to get married.
That's so cool! I'm sure you're happy to see him off on his own.
I'm sure you will miss him.  He is growing up fast.
That's great! You must feel proud and confident in your abilities.
That's great. It sounds like you're a hard worker.
Oh no! How did you handle it?
That's crazy! I would have been mad too.
I bet. Did she do well?
Oh man that is terrible! I am sorry to hear that.
That is a bummer!  I bet you are very happy that you did not make the same mistakes.  Did you have a great time?
Oh no! That is terrible! I am sure you will be okay.
That is pretty rude, I would have been really upset.
Aww, that sounds very sad.  It's like you can't even trust anyone, you know?
I would be too. What did you do?
I hope that doesn't happen again.  Are you worried about it?
That's a great way to celebrate. How did you feel?
I agree! I am trying to do the same.
It happens to everyone.  It can be really hard to get over.  I hope you are able to get over it.
That's a common thing, it's not a bad thing to be, I hope you can find a way to use it to your advantage.
Oh no. I hate when that happens. Did you call the police?
Oh wow. I hope you were not scared.
I think that is one of the best things you can do.
Oh, I understand.  I was homeless for a little bit.  I didn't have a lot of money, so I had to sell things that I didn't really need.  I also had to do a lot of cleaning and laundry.
That is so nice. I bet you felt so happy
Wow that is very nice. I hope you continue to take care of them.
That's unfortunate. Was it a company that you worked for?
It's always sad to see people being treated unfairly based on their background.
That must have been a scary experience. I'm glad you made it.
I'm sure it will be fine. It's a Honda.
That is a great group. I hope you can stay on track.
I'm glad that they are there for you.
Oh, what did you study for?
Oh wow, that is so exciting! I have never done anything like that before! What is it?
I love Christmas cards.  It makes me feel so nostalgic.  What kind of cards did you find?
That's not silly at all. It's a good habit to get into.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he finds what he's looking for.
That's great! I hope you have a great time with them!
I bet you had a hard time getting through.
Oh no! I hope you're okay!
That's alright.  What is the secret?
I don't understand why you would want to do that to someone.
Why are you blue?
Oh, what a bummer! I'm sorry. Did you like the story that was told?
That's awesome. I hope she'll be a good driver.
That's so sweet. I bet you are very happy that she is doing okay.
That is a great idea.  How old is she?
What license?
That sounds stressful. Do you have everything cleaned up before they come over?
I think that would be a good idea.  I've had to do that before.
Oh that is a great brother, I bet he is a great person to have around.
Oh that's really nice. I'm sure he's a good brother.
Oh wow.  That's great.  What is it about you that made you two best friends?
I understand.  It's not like you can change your partner.  You've got to accept it.
I am so happy for your son! I am sure he is an amazing person!
I am so happy for you! I am glad to hear that you are so proud!
That is great, I hope you have fun and don't get lost.
I hope you're able to do that.
Oh no. That sounds terrible. Did you get to go to Scotland to see her?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for your loss.
Oh wow that is so cool!  I was born in 1975 and I have never been to the US, but I have always wanted to visit.  That is a great story!
Oh my, that's terrible!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Did she have a good family?
That's awesome! I love gaming consoles. What kind of games do you plan to play?
I have never played it, is it a good game?
That's great! I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It's always nice to have family close by.
I feel that way. She is my mother. I miss her so much. I'm sure you do too.
Oh wow, that's awesome! I hope you have a great time.
Oh man. I hate those things.
That's really cool!  How did you meet?
I love your voice! I'm a huge fan of the Batman movies!
That is so sad. Did you get the kitten?
That is really cool! I am sure you are very happy!
that is good, how did you help?
I bet you felt bad when you saw it was gone.
That can be a nerve wrecking experience, especially if you're not sure if you're going to make it.
How did you do?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm sure she's not expecting you to forget.
Oh man. I am sorry.  Do you have a reminder?
I am sorry to hear that.
That's a good idea. I've always been a boy.
I'm sure it was all a product of your imagination.
Oh god, that must have been terrifying!
I'm sorry, I know it's hard.
That is good. What happened?
That sounds like a really good experience.  What did you meditate on?
I've heard of that.  It's great that there are apps to help with mindfulness and meditation.
That sounds like a fun time!
I love Harry Potter. I have not been to the park.
That's exciting! I hope you get the job!
Oh, that's exciting! Did you get in to your second choice?
That sounds like fun, what kind of food do you enjoy cooking?
That's great. I'm a vegetarian too. I like to try new foods, but I don't like to eat anything that's not vegetarian.
What was it?
How did it land?
That's amazing!  How is he doing now?
I am glad to hear that!
That's good to hear! What does she do?
That's nice! I hope you can make it happen!
Oh no! What did you do?
That's great to hear. Did you do anything to prevent it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you in a leasehold situation?
Oh, that is so good to hear.  I bet he is very proud of himself!
Oh, that's good, I hope you were able to get it fixed quickly so you didn't have to go anywhere!
That's good to hear. Did you get it for good price or just for a lower price?
Oh I'm glad to hear that.  How did she drive you?
That's great! What is it?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get caught?
I love pokemon cards!
That's terrible. What happened?
That's great! You must be so relieved!
Oh, I know what you mean. When I was a kid, I loved life just like you do.
I hope you're not feeling down about that
Wow! That's so good of you! I'm sure they were missing her!
What did they do?
I am curious about that.
That is awesome! Congratulations!
Oh wow.  That sounds scary.  Did you have to get out of the pool and walk back to get your trunks?
What happened?
Did you feel bad after?
What did you end up doing?
I'm sorry to hear that.  How do you feel?
Did you have a fight?
I don't like working with managers either.  I would just tell them that they are trying too hard.
You mean about the game you're playing?
I'm not sure I'd say that, but I do have some trouble with them.
I hope you can.
What happens?
That is true. Sometimes we can't recall what happened in our dreams.
Oh no, that's terrible. What happened?
I love to try new things and push myself to be better.
What was it like?
That is awesome.  What did you do?
Oh that's great! What's going on?
That's awesome! What kind of music is it?
I'm glad to hear that! I have so many possibilities too!
Wow! I was never really interested in learning new things. I think I'd be embarrassed if I had to learn something new!
I don't meditate.  I don't know how to do it.
I love that! What do you like to do for fun?
I feel you, being alone can be a real challenge, but it is also a chance to do things you love without anyone else.
I've been there too, it's a great feeling to be honest.
That's a great mindset to have. It's hard to let go of that need to control things.
I agree.  I've been lucky so far.
Wow that's amazing. I wish I could be that strong.
Yeah, I know how that is. I'm almost 5 months into pregnancy and I am still feeling like I'm not doing enough to prepare. I think I need to get more active.
What are you packing?
I hope it does not get bad.  I don't like bad weather.
I am so sorry! I can imagine how you must feel. That must have been very disheartening
That's terrible, I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
Wow, that was close! Did you get it fixed?
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you're okay
That sounds like a scary situation.
I'm glad to hear that.
I agree, it's nice to have faith in the universe and to believe in something bigger than myself.
Oh no! That's terrible!
I feel you. I have anxiety and it's very hard to take a breath.
Well, sometimes you just need to take a break.
I'm sorry, but I didn't know you were that popular.
I know what you mean. Sometimes we just need to take a step back and let people know how we really feel.
Oh my, that sounds very scary!  What happened?
That's awful!  Why didn't you get out of there?
I am sure you will do great!
That is awesome, you are the best!
I agree. I try to be careful with the people I do business with.
I'm not sure I agree with that.  Do you mean they live to get richer?
That's so sweet of you.  What kind of dipping sauce did she need help with?
Oh no, did you get it on your clothes?
That's cool. What kind of music do you like?
I'm sure you will be able to convince them to listen to you.
Oh that's great!  What made it so freeing?
I agree, and they are so much safer than cars.
Oh no! What did you do?
That's terrible, what did you do to get charged?
I feel you! I used to love door to door sales, but now it's just a chore.
Oh really? What did you do?
That's really rude, why did he do that?
I'm sure she'll be fine in a few days.  How old is she?
I've heard of that before. It's pretty evil. I don't know how people can be so naive.
It's so hard to find people who believe in rational things anymore.
That's a good thing! You will be fine!
I wish you the best of luck!
Oh no! I am sure they will find it!
Oh I know what you mean.
Oh that's so exciting! Are you going to finish them all?
I can't wait for you to see your grades!
That's a bad roommate. Did you talk to him?
You probably didn't have to.
Oh no, what did you steal?
That's cool, what's it like?
That's amazing! Congratulations! How are you feeling?
I'm sure it will be fine.  You're a great mom!
I agree, it was. What was your favorite part about Christmas?
What do you mean?
Yeah that would be weird. Did he do anything?
Oh wow. What happened?
Oh no! That is terrible! Did you get a police report?
That is so frustrating. I just wish people would be more considerate of others.
I love candies. What kind is it?
That sounds like a sweet treat.  What's the name of it?
That's great! I am so happy for you!
Well that is a great attitude to have. I am sure you will get to see her again in the future.
I love playing games!
Oh, that's so cool. I bet it was really funny to watch.
Oh no, why did you have to cancel?
That sounds like a real pain in the neck.  How many hours are you talking about?
I agree, it's the simple things in life that are the best.
What do you mean?
Oh no! Did you try to squash it?
Oh yeah, that's a different story.  I live in New York and I have to be careful when I'm driving around at night.  I don't know how you people do it.  It's so hard to see them.
That's great! I bet you studied hard.
I am sure you will do great!  You will be so ready for the test.
