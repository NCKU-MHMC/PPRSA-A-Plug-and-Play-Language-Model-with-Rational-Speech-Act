questioning,Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.,Did you suffer any injuries?
questioning,No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.,Why did you feel guilty? People really shouldn't drive drunk.
agreeing,"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?",Yeah he was punished hes in jail still
questioning,"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world",sorry to hear! do you have any idea about the break up? did you think about it ?
sympathizing,"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!",sorry again! hope you'll get relief from this sadness. Please concentrate on your interests to divert your mind from this.
questioning,"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying",Which Concert?
acknowledging,yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors,"Wow, that's awesome! I have never been to an actual concert."
questioning,i was singing nursery songs :),"Ugh, those articles always get me too... :( What was wrong with her?"
sympathizing,If you happy and you know it :),Jeez! Its so unfortunate... very sad really.
questioning,thank you so much!,That is nice of you. What did you do?
questioning,he is an armed guard,Which one?
questioning,I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry,No problem. What kind of work does he do?
questioning,Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.,Thats not good. Do you own a gun?
questioning,"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!",3 years is a long time. How come?
acknowledging,"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed","Oh I see. They must miss you, too."
acknowledging,"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!",That isn't very nice.
acknowledging,i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms,Thats horrible.
agreeing,"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!",Yes I do not like walmart.
questioning,"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy",Thats horrible. Did you tell on him?
suggesting,Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.,"Oh, I'm sure you are lonely. Maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?"
suggesting,My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be,"That's a good idea! This way you can also meet friends for yourself, but also maybe meet new friend's for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!"
acknowledging,"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.","yes, i've heard some parents don't ever say no to their kids. makes no sense"
consoling,Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes,Did things end amicably? I hope everything is good now!
agreeing,"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!","I understand that, I hope things work out well for you both in the end!"
agreeing,Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him,"Yes, I couldn't agree more. It is remarkable how your feeling suddenly change."
acknowledging,"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?",I bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened.
agreeing,But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!,Oh I'm sure. I would not like to be in a situation like that. Good thing everything worked out for you.
questioning,"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!",Oh really? What happened with your family and friend then?
acknowledging,"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.","Oh wow, that's awful. Stuff like that really teaches you to appreciate what you've got and to not take it for granted."
agreeing,"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?","I agree, someimes we just know"
agreeing,"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?","exactly, i get that entirely!"
questioning,"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.",That's great! How did they surprise you?
encouraging,Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!,"That is so sweet of them, I hope you enjoyed it!"
consoling,"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!","Awww, That sucks man. Hopefully they don't say mean things to you about being lonely."
acknowledging,She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.,"Yeah that is always odd to me, before they can talk they are already unique!"
agreeing,Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!),"I understand that one,they are my favorite place to eat"
agreeing,"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.",That has happened to me too many times to count
acknowledging,"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!",That must have been and intense and emotional moment for you.
questioning,"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?",Where you not secure in your self?
questioning,I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.,"You can track her down to say sorry, or would that be creepy?"
suggesting,From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!,"Wow, so your going to take being a bad person to the grave. Maybe you'll see her in the next life?"
questioning,"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?",It's crazy how quickly kiddos grow! Even in a few weeks time! Do you see your friend and her baby often?
wishing,"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!","Wow, that is an amazing accomplishment!  Congratulations!  You gotta be feeling like you're on top of the world after that!"
acknowledging,I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.,"My first thought was ""California"" but then there's Venice [Italy] and then either way, that's an amazing destination!"
sympathizing,"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.",I'm sorry to hear that! How did you find out?
agreeing,"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.",I feel the same way.
questioning,"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!",Oh no that is terrible!  How did your daughter take it?
consoling,Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!,Oh poor thing.  I hope she is doing better now.  Losing a pet is extremely hard!
questioning,"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.",Which one are you going to California or Florida ?
questioning,"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!",Cool.  Somethings never change.  What did you reflect upon?
questioning,I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!,I'm trying to get into it. we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything. Do you have tips?
questioning,"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!",Isn't that what sisters are for?  What were you guys upset about?
suggesting,"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.","Maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again, you can try to approach the topic from another angle."
wishing,"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching",Congratulations! Where did you travel from and where did you end up?
agreeing,"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.","I know, that actually happens to me sometimes! Last year I didn't get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks I was underestimating myself a lot."
agreeing,"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))","Yea for sure, I definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way. When's the last time you have been really disappointed?"
agreeing,Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.,I totally understand why he was mad. Why did you tell her?
sympathizing,We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.,Oh my! I'm glad she apologized!
agreeing,"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second",I understand. I am think the same thing. What is your health issue?
suggesting,"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)","Yes, we should try to yourself heathy"
agreeing,That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!,"Oh, it sure is, I feel the same way. They grow up so fast!"
encouraging,"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.",I bet you were beautiful on that day. :) I hope that confidence has carried on since then!
acknowledging,Did they give you any feedback?,I bet it's tough. A regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better.
questioning,I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July,Oh ya? What happened?? I'm intrigued
questioning,"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting",Woah plot twist. She brought him along to meet you?
questioning,"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.",OH I love the beach!!  Which beach are you going to go to?
questioning,"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.",Why didn't you go?
suggesting,"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.",Is she always a flake? Maybe time for a new friend?
questioning,Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job,Did he do anything to you and your mom?
questioning,And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.,"No, you didn't tell me! What happened?"
questioning,She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.,"Oh no! Is she okay?! Don't beat yourself up too much, you couldn't have ever imagined that she had been in an accident."
questioning,I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.,What happened?
questioning,I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.,"No, what happened?"
questioning,"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!",Thats horrible. Will they reschedule?
questioning,"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed","Who, tell me!"
questioning,"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.","Wow, what happened?"
questioning,Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married,That is very nice gift. Did you bought anything for him for Father's day?
acknowledging,"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.",That is great.
questioning,True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.,Oh what job was the interview for?
wishing,I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path,I think you got it man! Congratz!
questioning,You could chat to them and complain!,oh my  are you really serious?
acknowledging,"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.",I am very glad it has a happy ending. Sounds a bit scary
questioning,I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.,"Oh no, what did you do?"
questioning,"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.",Did you ever tell your friend?
agreeing,"I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.","Oh no, I hate when that happens. I can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice! Its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer"
questioning,"Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.","Wao, you must fell weird about it! what you thinki to do about it?"
suggesting,How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.,"SUper tough situation, i think you should let her know, and let her decides next"
suggesting,Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.,"Oh, I'm sure you were embarrassed! But, maybe you can laugh about it now?"
acknowledging,Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?,"Well, I'm sure mom had a laugh lol! I can imagine how you felt at the time though!"
questioning,Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.,"Ah, that sounds fantastic! Which ocean will you be enjoying?"
questioning,They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.,Sounds awesome! Do you have a beachside beverage or traditions that you enjoy? (Mine would be tequila + lime...very Jimmy Buffett ;-))
acknowledging,"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)","Well, that's impressive! I can see why you are proud. Sounds like a hard working young lady!"
agreeing,"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.",Absolutely I agree I always try to not even bring cart unless I have too many too carry.
agreeing,It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.,Yes me too Now if everyone would just take our lead lol
questioning,We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!,oh wow. Do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet?
questioning,Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind.,First time parent?
questioning,That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.,What kind of work do you do?
acknowledging,"Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops.","Actually I'm not, but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations, I would imagine it's also exciting and new every day."
agreeing,Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles,"I agree, its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas"
agreeing,I ended up actually getting a 98%!,Yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business
acknowledging,Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff.,That is so funny! I don't think she'll want to be compared to an ant when she gets older. You'll have to remind her.
agreeing,"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..",I know
acknowledging,"No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.",That is exciting news!  I bet you were so surprised!
questioning,"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..",Ha!  What a neat day to announce it - did they do any special kind of announcement?  I see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement.
questioning,"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)",I do watch Netflix sometimes.  Do you watch?
questioning,It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(,I haven't heard of that one.  What genre does it fall in?
acknowledging,Thank you. I appreciate that.,Sounds interesting!
questioning,The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha,Did it go your way?

suggesting,"I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.",Is that a bad sign? Perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?
acknowledging,"I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.","Oh, I see. I am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over-saturated."

questioning,Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha,How long do you plan on staying in that house?

sympathizing,Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!,"Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts, so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like $5, $10) save it and be strict not to spend it."

sympathizing,"It was a test in Numeracy, so counting 1 - 100. I've always found that difficult, but god made it possible!",I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???
wishing,"had to hitch hike. made it on time for check in though. now the cars been in the shop 4 days, no progress. kinda getting worried about it","I think that's good! If you are meant to be together you'll feel it and it will work out I think, if you just keep your conviction and stick with it. Good luck with it!"

questioning,"Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.",You are so lucky. Mums are the best. What do you do for her?
acknowledging,she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t-shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other. Made me so mad,That is great that you have an awesome Mom!

suggesting,"Being a mom is great, too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks!",I understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing. Maybe you should stop watching as many though.

questioning,"Well, for many years I was an alcoholic, working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!","Yes, I think they offer a great bridge to the past. Do you?"
acknowledging,"It does. I worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests, and I couldn't believe when I passed with flying colors!",That's great. It sounds like a very good situation to be in.

acknowledging,I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted,Well I bet he appreciates that. We all want to be babied sometimes.
questioning,"We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!",Lol. Did you tell her? You can just buy another one.
questioning,"I could definitely use one! However, I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!",That's sucks. Does the culprit know?
questioning,Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water. It's amazing how much the little changes can impact.,That is unacceptable. What are you going to do?
acknowledging,"I am, thanks, but I wouldn't go there... Becky STILL managed to get the same dress as me! I am so mad!",That sounds so fun!
questioning,"It was a ghost! I ran into the kitchen to investigate, and I saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window.",So...what happened to her

questioning,Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!,"At least those things come in sets, so you can keep part of it?"
questioning,"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.",It is a work award or something?
wishing,It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again,Why Thank you!
questioning,"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special",I know what you mean. Did you get the job?
questioning,Yes. It's a boy,I have not. What is it?
questioning,I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.,"There are some bad parents out there, that's for sure. Is it hard to be a parent?"
acknowledging,In the club,"Lol, that is terrible. She should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck..."

questioning,I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.,"Oh goodness, what happened for the past 3 weeks?"
sympathizing,"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.",Sorry to hear this! I can understand your pain.
questioning,I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.,"I am sure it will be fine, do you have a preference"
suggesting,"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!",You should channel that envy into motivation!
agreeing,"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.","Exactly, be positive and you can buy one for yourself!"
acknowledging,Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?,That is a great attitude to have!  It is great to have an optimistic approach to life.
agreeing,Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.,I feel the same way.  We are a glass half full kind of people!
questioning,I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing,"oh poor thing, is she at least getting better?"
acknowledging,Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!,"haha that must be nice too though, you get your own alone time for the most part!"
acknowledging,Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.,"I see, you must have felt hopeful"

agreeing,sure ... thanks,oh yeah thats always going to be up and coming for sure
questioning,Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.,"That sounds like it's rough, did your father accept your apology?"
sympathizing,"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.","Well, I'm sure he understands, and you shouldn't feel too bad, as long as you apologized you're fine."
consoling,"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.",hey it was just one day! you got this... work extra hard for the next 5 days!
acknowledging,"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.",That's awesome
agreeing,I hope this feeling increases,I totally feel you on that. I swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window.
questioning,"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.",Did you retrace your steps
questioning,"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'",that's great! I bet they are equally excited if not more :) are you travelling alone?

acknowledging,"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?","I would be too, that is a long time!"
acknowledging,Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.,Wow that would make for a lonely timeframe
questioning,"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.",Wow did youcall someone about that?
questioning,Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!,"Oh my, did they notice you farted?"
agreeing,"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering","Must have rather awkward. Remember, farting is just natural and I am sure she understands that."
sympathizing,Thanks for your comprehension,"I am sorry, how have you been passing the time"
acknowledging,"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.","I love video games, you should buy a switch!"
suggesting,No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed,that is a very optimistic way to look at life . i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way
questioning,no it is an autoimmune disease,how long have you looked at life this way? is it sustainable ?
agreeing,one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel,this is completely true. it involves totally re conditioning the mind .

suggesting,I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!,"Maybe thats a good idea, to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on. Good idea!"
questioning,"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?",Do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?
questioning,Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.,Same here.  Try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime.
questioning,"Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience",*very excited.  (oops).  Where did she go?
questioning,"True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say",where are you going
questioning,"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!","that sounds like fun, where in the ozakrs?"
acknowledging,"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react",Sounds like you made the right decision.  What a bunch of A-holes

questioning,"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either",It was fine how about you?
suggesting,"Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed",Oh that sucks :( Maybe organize the socks better?
questioning,"I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong",That's great! When will you find out?

suggesting,I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?,You and your wife should go out to events and try to meet new people.
questioning,"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.","Ohh man, that is a long time to be alone.  What are you going to do while she is gone?"
sympathizing,"If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*",I'm sorry.  Where did she go?
questioning,I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*,What happened? Did someone bump on your car?
agreeing,"I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.","Be carefull , you don't know the cray people that is out there."
acknowledging,I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.,That must have been awkward.
questioning,"He kinda gave me the ""Mom, really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*",Don't worry about it. It happens to the best of us.
questioning,"I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].","Nostalgia can be wonderful, can't it?"
questioning,"No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.",What was going on!?
acknowledging,"Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*",sounds like a lot of drama ugh i hope you get some rest tonight
questioning,Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!,that's really good you feel pretty secure about it then?
acknowledging,I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.,oh wow then that is really good! For someone to say that! You should be very proud of yourself.
agreeing,"Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.",Thar was an embarasing moment for sure
suggesting,I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.,Maybe you are felling lonely these days?
questioning,"Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.",Did you have an enemy or someone as a suspect?
suggesting,"Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.",Weird reaction. I feel like he should just do his job and not key your car.
questioning,"Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.",What are you worrying about?
consoling,I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL,"Well, I hope it's alright, heart problems is not something you should take lightly."
questioning,"This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!",What is your favorite memory with your friends?
acknowledging,"15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?",That sounds like so much fun! I'm glad you got to go back to revisit.
wishing,"Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!",Just keep working hard and make them proud.
agreeing,"It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving.","I absolutely agree. As long as you aren't hurting anyone, do whatever you please!"
sympathizing,"I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it"".","Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that! It doesn't necessarily mean it went bad, though. Maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?"
questioning,5 months to find out !,"That would be sad, do you keep him in a cage?"
questioning,thanks. now onto bigger things,"That's nice, what does he enjoy watching?"
questioning,starting a clinic,Absolutely. Although the world isn't so black and white. Sometimes a person may have to steal to survive. Is it really wrong then?
agreeing,thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town,I agree. Stealing someone else's possession when it wasn't necessary for your survival is despicable! I hate a thief!
sympathizing,Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym,"That's so sad, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. How did it happen?"
acknowledging,Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.,"My goodness, that sounds like a tragedy. I'm sure she was a great dog friend of yours."

questioning,Last week. we're in temporary housing now,"Uh oh, have you ever delivered a baby before?"
questioning,I just want to work from home,What was the accomplishment again?
questioning,"You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap","Wow, that's amazing. What made her want to go back to school?"
questioning,I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back,What about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?
questioning,Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors,What's been bothering you at work? Are you not being fulfilled enough?

agreeing,"No but I hate going in objects that travel fast, I really did not want to go on it.","I know exactly how you feel, I've been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently. It was so much better when I had the money to pay for everything."
questioning,"She loved it.  She's 17, I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.","Wow, that's terrible. Was anything stolen or damaged?"

questioning,A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.,That's rough man. Got any back up interviews lined up?

questioning,"Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.","Oh no, that is terrible! What happened? What did you do!"
sympathizing,I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.,I am so sorry that happened to you!
acknowledging,Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young.,"Yuck, sounds like an unpleasant feeling. How do you even get hair up there!"
suggesting,"Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous, but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with.","Well, at least she loves you. Maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that."
questioning,I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.,Oh really?! Where you headed too?
questioning,"No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now.",Wow! Thats on the east side of Africa isn't it?

consoling,"No, but he did end up puking all over the parking lot afterwards.",I hope the owner knows better next time.
agreeing,I envy people who can dance really well,Oh man! I hear you. I rescue animals and it is VERY hard to potty train them!

acknowledging,"Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her.

encouraging,"We went, but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.",I hope he gets that taken care of!
agreeing,I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard,I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates.

acknowledging,He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.,I can understand that as I live in Florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies.
agreeing,Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first.,"Yes, you are correct. You can always ""hope"" for the best, but also ""plan"" for the worst. Being prepared is a comfortable feeling."

consoling,"It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile, she was in denial. But, it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile, as she was my only sibling and we were very close.",Well I hope they get there soon so you don't have to wait longer.
agreeing,"He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's focused on science, engineering, etc. He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer. It's great to see him go for his dreams!","I'm with you on this one.  What is up with people these days, I just don't understand how they could do that."

wishing,It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more,You are very lucky!
