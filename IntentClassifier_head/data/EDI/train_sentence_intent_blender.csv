questioning,"My child went out behind my back, and snuck out!",Why is that?
questioning,Yeah it is a old black and white Karate movie,That's good to hear. Where did you get it from?

questioning,it was such a blessing there was money inside,That's for sure. How long have you had your independence?
questioning,"just the thought of no longer being alive, and everything coming to an end.",Really? Why?

acknowledging,"I did, and I like the job a lot too",I probably would have done the same thing.
questioning,12,I am a teacher so I understand.  You must be working well with him!  Do teachers know what accommodations to make or how to differentiate for him to be successful in the classroom?
questioning,it is. i feel like he was just born and now look at him walking all by himself,That is awesome! What do you go to school for?
wishing,"That is true, it is thicker than water","Well if you are doing so well, I wouldn't quit! Good luck!"
questioning,Getting a good after some time of searching and interviewing around,How sweet. How is it now?

acknowledging,"Thank you, I appreciate that!",That isn't nice.
questioning,"4500, it was not worth the extra for me","That's rough. I've been around my siblings kids long enough to know how rough they can be, even though I don't have my own. How old are they, if you don't mind me asking?"

sympathizing,on her weight. I tried to help her stop eating junk food by getting healthy alternatives and cooking for us and I also registered us with a gym,That's sneaky... and hard to explain. I'm sorry you have to deal with that hard situation. What do you think you'll do about it?
questioning,Well he's very inconsiderate when I am the one that has to clean up the mess. He could have just put it in a sippy cup instead.,Wap you must be disgusted with the farting. were you mad? or are you used to this kind of situations?

questioning,Yeah I have experience a lot of that recently,That is so annoying. Do you check the bag before arriving home at least?

acknowledging,She is over 80. Oh she is lovely to us all for her whole life. Nicest most giving person. But I think she is getting a touch of something so she can get cranky a bit with my mom at times. Well we ALL can be grumpy at times lol,"Sounds like you wanted to be the same as your cousin and not set apart. It may seem trivial now, but I know it wasn't trivial to you at the time."

suggesting,Isn't it awful? People are horrible. We might just deal with a car payment every month now. As it's hard to buy from private sellers! So many are lying.,Maybe it will be just what you need though. Time to really concentrate and learn and grow within yourself as an individual :) Maybe you will have a nice romance too
acknowledging,"not that far but i had to go to a pantry to get food , it was generic foods",That is very kind of you. You should take it to the vet for a check up.

acknowledging,I think I'll get everyone to wait at a restaurant and I'll tell him we're going to dinner and all his friends will be there!,"Yeah, that bothers me to.  Don't sweat it too much though.  Just consider it their loss and move on."
agreeing,I have been pining for a promotion at my workplace and I finally got it this afternoon!,She likes you! If she asks/talks about you then you have a much better chance too.
questioning,I think it was my streak of not making any mistakes over the last few months if nothing else haha.,That is so great! Are you in the process of applying now? I'm sure you will get in eventually.
suggesting,ASUS. I've had a good luck streak with them that I hope will continue,Perhaps. Or you just need to keep trying. Don't give up on your dreams so easily!
questioning,I made reservations at a restaurant with a beautiful view of the city. Very romantic and fancy!,"That sounds interesting, is it hard to make?"
questioning,Thank you! It's nice to celebrate those milestones with your loved ones when you can.,Did you really just say that hahaha. You are crazy
acknowledging,"Old age. I've had her since I was a child, so it's hard to take",That sounds like fun. But I don't think Hillbilly is a very nice way to describe people.
questioning,My boss is just being mean because I have better qualifications than him. He often tells me it's not the qualification that counts but experience :(,"Funny, but true. Have you ever been to the races before?"
questioning,"Ok, thanks for your advise, I will definitely do that",Exciting! Did you get any neat gifts?
questioning,3 years! It took a lot of training for him to get to this point! I'm so proud!,It's always good to have friends that know your likes. What is in your collection?

wishing,"I think I would be too nervous to wear it, so I will store it away for now.","I feel super bad about that, i wish the best for you."
questioning,I bought a hotel stay for a weekend near the beach. I think that could help her.,For what? Are you a diver or something?

acknowledging,Yeah I don't have many days left to get $100.,"Lol, if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying. That would be hilarious."
suggesting,"Unfortunatly, yes. But that one had a lot of meaning to me as it was my father's. It hurts to not have it anymore","Haha. These dogs that I'm dog-sitting wouldn't let that happen. They wake me up at 6:30AM every morning to feed them. But hey, we make mistakes. Maybe you had a busy day today."
questioning,Exactly!  Was a wonderful surprise,What is a aardvark?
questioning,"Oh just stuff for my freezer and a lot of snacks.  Milk, eggs, etc.   A bunch of meat.   Some toiletries.  That stuff lasted me a few weeks!","I thought so. The name alone sounds so exotic, were you mad that you had to clean pooop?"
consoling,My stupid teammates all left the game. I was doing really well but couldn't win by myself.,"You usually don't get that much jail time for drunk driving if it is your first incident. It shouldn't be so bad, but hopefully it will make you more cautious in the future."
consoling,I was in a hurry and they did look similar. However it was obvious.,Oh wow. I really hope that you get the help you need. I can relate though...I used to be reckless like that a couple years back. Just have to be responsible and arrange an uber or some other form of transportation.
sympathizing,Thanks but I won't.,"Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. Did you get her something nice?"
questioning,maybe that's the reason,"That was very thoughtful, something to keep her entertained when she wasn't feeling well. Is she doing better?"
acknowledging,"Sure! It was uncalled for,and unprofessional",Thanks for that information.
questioning,"I thought that maybe I needed new eyeglasses, but it turns out that everything was fine and I can see well.",That's so nice! Did she like your craftsmanship?
acknowledging,"Yes, I felt good about my eye doctor's abilities to find anything that could be wrong.",It was still a nice gesture. I would love my children to build be a big ole gazebo.
questioning,Yeah I just don't know enough about cars.,Nice! Did you manage to snag the promotion?
questioning,yes it is :),It's good to work hard for that dough. What's your new billet entail?

questioning,"Yes, I think that is my logical next step to get it fixed. I hope they can fix it.",That is nice. What kind of computer did he get?
questioning,I wasn't expecting it but was glad to see it. I have quite the sweet tooth for chocolate cake.,How did that experience go?
agreeing,"I do! But, for now, I do miss them and it makes me feel sad that they aren't around in person. Social media does help, though","I'm very glad, and I understand how the memories are."
questioning,Yes! That's why I have to stay on top of the package tracking because you never know when something could go wrong.,I would too.  What had happened?
questioning,That's a smart idea! Hopefully I don't encounter issues like this again in the future.,Yes.  Did they admit fault?
questioning,Yes It is. I am super excited :),How old are your kids?
questioning,A small party with my family. You are also invited :),Are you worried they are going to be abducted or something?
questioning,Some jerk rear ended me and now I need body work done. The clown didn't even have insurance! Its insane what people get away with.,What can you lose?
suggesting,I watched a film the other night that reminded me of all the good times I had with my family when I was younger.,"You do. I mean it can only go one of two ways. And if it goes one way, you can try again with another girl."
questioning,The news of the demise of a bossom friend I mean,Do they have insomnia?
consoling,"Thanks for the offer! Yeah, she just unexpectedly told me that she had a work obligation to attend instead.",Well they will have insomnia and sore bottoms haha
agreeing,That's true. Thanks for reminding me about that.,"That happened to me too when I was in elementary school. I lost all my friends and had to make new ones, which sucks."
agreeing,Looking through my picture albums really makes me relive so many memories.,I agree.
acknowledging,I know right. It can go either way. One minute your laughing then crying then both.,I bet she felt really special!
acknowledging,It looked like a cloudy mist.  I was so terrified!,I can relate to that!
agreeing,I waited till i got a call,Me too. I miss payments sometimes because I forget about them and I'm lazy.
agreeing,"Thanks. I think it was a long time coming, so I am happy with the outcome.",That's my exact situation too.
agreeing,chicken breast and some fries,"Ah, so you're in the same boat as me? I can understand how that goes. Electricity is so necessary nowadays, too."
questioning,"No, I just felt very remorseful about it.",How many do you have?
questioning,I didn't need to! My girlfriend made me soup and took care of me all day. She's so sweet.,Can you get another job?
questioning,"Thanks, the pay and conditions were just right that's why I stayed",Can you take out a loan?
questioning,I drank a bit too much the other night and accidentally destroyed some things.,"Haha, he'd probably say the same thing to you. He's been a fan of them for about 20 years. What about you? How long have you followed them?"
questioning,I thought someone was breaking in my house! But it was only my cats being crazy.,"That sucks, how old were they?"
questioning,Because I have spent 40000USD so far on your tuition and living expenses,"Wow, how old are the kids?"
wishing,"Not just that ,but my important documents that's worth a fortune",Congratulations. We don't share the same sentiment.
questioning,It makes me feel confident that I can truly confide in them about anything without them judging me.,Have you asked him how he feels about that entire situation?
questioning,"Nothing serious, but I watched a horror film last night and it was very scary.","Really? That's one of the saddest things I've heard in a while. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened to your family, if you don't mind me asking?"
sympathizing,It is not hump day!  I was just going to tell you I hope you have a great weeked :)  You got any big plans?,I am terribly sorry to hear that. You've got to be really resilient to deal with that. Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen during Thanksgiving so you could have a chance to be around others?
questioning,Oh that's awesome!  Good luck!  I'm sure she'll say yes!,Did you do anything after she did it?
questioning,It was filled with only refried beans and guacamole.  It was the grossest thing I have seen.,"Why's that? Did you specifically have a bad experience with them, or just assume they're terrible no matter what?"
questioning,The presentation was about a new client that we just recently got. It was quite interesting.,Trapped in a cave? I couldn't handle that. I'm claustrophobic. I'd freak out in a second. How long were you trapped for?
suggesting,"Well yes, to the whole plane actually. There was trouble with one engine but fortunately we managed to land safely",You should have called the police. If they were just vandals they probably did it to someone else to.
questioning,"Yeah, there was a lot of relief going round I can tell you!","That's annoying. Kids these days are really attached to electronics, just how it goes. I know it's hard to cut them off, but have you tried managing his electronics time more closely?"
agreeing,I start today.. but I am just glad I have a way to help pay the bills .. I was worried I wouldn't find a good job.,"I would be, too. At that age, they don't understand why they can't have it. It's like talking to a brick wall. I hope it gets easier for you as he gets older."
questioning,For over 30 years! That is a long time.,Did you practice first in a parking lot?
questioning,"Yes, I really want to celebrate that milestone with them.",Did you use GPS?
agreeing,"Well, I don't own it :) But, it did remind me of when I was a kid and my friends and I would go to a candy shop every week",I totally agree with you
agreeing,"I was so scared, he demanded I give him my phone and wallet.",You and me both.
questioning,I am happy about my career,Why don't you move back?
questioning,I am going on a cruise to the Bahamas.  Ive been getting ready all day.,Can you make new friends where you are now?

questioning,"Yeah, it had a good plot but the graphics these days are getting so realistic!","I'm not too fond of winter, but what kind of coat did you buy?"
acknowledging,Yes! You really cannot tell sometimes what is real or CGI effects.,"Awesome, I bet it's comfy! How cold does it get where you live?"
questioning,"You'll be alright, make sure to talk to your coworkers or you'll feel lonely like me!",When does he start?
suggesting,"Well, I'd have to dip into savings to finance a new car...but that's rough right now when I'm moving apartments",You may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need
questioning,I thought about it but I'd really have no use for it now.,Where did they come from?
questioning,I couldn't move my body. I fainted because she had introduced the guy to me as her cousin,Where did they go?
questioning,Yes and I started getting really emotional because of it.,"I'm not particularly a fan of subways either, but why are you so scared of being robbed?"
agreeing,yep it really did get quite lonesome at times.,I think the overall chances of that are pretty low. Though I do understand your fear.
questioning,Thank you!  I do.  I am a teacher.  I can't wait!,So I take it you get along well with your boss?
acknowledging,"Yeah I did really well, though I knew I would do well once I studied a ton.","That's great to hear, often times we here of people who hate their bosses!"

sympathizing,"Yeah, we went to check it out even though we were hesitant and it turned out great though. A lot of fun.",I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think that is? Is it a painful or happy memory?
acknowledging,it was cool to see us both go off to college.,I can understand that. That does sound like a difficult thing to deal with. Hopefully you have a lot of nice memories you can look back on to remember her by.
agreeing,"Thank you. Yes, I am hoping so. I did better than I had expected going into it from the initial response. Here's hoping.",Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features
acknowledging,No we made eye contact. For some reason I started getting emotional and went home to cry.,"I bet that was a nice surprise! That's pretty cool. What was it for, if you don't mind me asking?"
acknowledging,"At the beach, I was really scared at first but it was actually exciting!","That's really cool... And also way above my head! But seriously, that sounds like smart, hard work. You should be proud. I'm glad you got that ""moment in the sun."""
questioning,Thank you very much! I'm really amazed at his work!,"Dang, that's rough. Like a double-dose of sadness. My girlfriend and I are long distance, so I know how that goes. Is there any way you can still keep in touch with them?"
suggesting,i feel very guilty i would have to confess to them,"Yeah, she and I don't use social media, but I can imagine that'd be really helpful in your case. Well, I'm glad you at least have that. And maybe it will open up the possibility for you to meet new people, too."
questioning,Well he was asleep at the time so I didn't want to disturb him.,Was it for school?
questioning,Most likely. I like the someone else's problem approach. I'm sure someone knows about his situation.,Did you get fired due to it?
questioning,"Yes, and I feel so bad about it. I cant look my wife in the eye anymore",That is a little daunting.  Have you considered joining some groups with like-minded individuals?

questioning,Well I don't get the results back until Friday. But I feel like I did great!,"Aw, that is fantastic! How did yall meet?"

encouraging,I hope so. He was really annoyed with me at the time.,Hopefully a happy birthday is going to be in order soon!
wishing,i had a sprain in my neck but my car was ruined. i was really mad.,Happy early birthday then.  Drink up!
questioning,"I agree, I was jumping up and down because I was so excited.",Oh really! Any ideas why?
suggesting,yea but still makes me feel bad for doing it.,Maybe they like you?
acknowledging,She promised to go and do that since she realizes how i feel,"Yes, they can be fun I guess."
acknowledging,I think she still loves me regardless that's why,Yes that could be very annoying.
consoling,Yeah sometimes they really are. A lot of my past experiences have been negative though.,"Oh, I hope it was ok. I understand you not being able to stop."
suggesting,I wish he was more understanding. But sometimes he seems to miss some obvious facts.,"Oh, that makes sense. I had no idea, since I've never used them. That sounds really inconvenient. Maybe they were waiting for the perfect moment to strike... What chumps."
wishing,"hopefully, i was so mad.","Oh wow, what luck! I bet you slowed down after that!"
acknowledging,Thanks that might be an option.,Well that's good that you use this as a reason to stop speeding. Some people never learn!

questioning,"No actually, I can't even look her in the eyes anymore. I feel so bad about it.","Oh man, that would make me angry! Is there anyone you can call and report them anonymously?"
suggesting,Well it was a few days ago. I'd still be late.,Maybe you can sneak over and steal them?
questioning,"someone I met at a religious gathering, so much for trusting!",oh no that would make me feel guilty!!! Is he okay?
questioning,"Most likely he will study finance. His grades are good but not the best, so we just don't know what to expect.",is he allergic to that type of food? If not you need to transition him slowly! But that's funny lol
questioning,Thank you! All he can do now is hope for the best!,Who did you leave him with?
questioning,"my car is not in the best of shape and if i take it to the repair shop I wont meet up, so what I did is I left home very early",Did he destroy the house?
questioning,I know it's really frustrating. I don't know what I should do at all.,That sounds great.  What do you get to visit for?

sympathizing,Who wouldn't? He just showed up like a ghost from the blues.. Lol!,That is hard.  I am so sorry
questioning,"Perhaps so, but I wish he would just be quiet and stop pestering me.",What kind of puppies?
questioning,"I feel like I let my roommate down by breaking some of our house rules, and I feel bad for it.",Why don't you buy one from your friend?
questioning,Thank you. I agree. She really is great most of the time.,oddly enough so am I. I just want to be comfortable. How do you feel about that?
questioning,It been 2 days now :(,"That's very good, do you feel content at the moment?"

acknowledging,we live on a big plot of wooded land,"Oh wow, bungee jumping is a huge step!"

agreeing,I so wish I could be a cat... ohhh how easy life would be!,"Oh yeah, totally. And then you don't end up buying too much or too little, and you don't waste time trying to remember things. There's also tons of little apps on your phone you can get that can make it really streamlined and convenient."

questioning,It was steak,"Oh my gosh, that's so annoying! How did you deal with it?"

acknowledging,"We will eventually. But I'm in school right now, and she has a good job, so neither of us are able to move, and haven't been able to for a few years. We'll get there eventually though.",Well that's awfully generous of them.
questioning,Everyone else was trying it so I did too. It was terrible but I can now say I did it,Wow are they a very close friend?
sympathizing,I don't. She is a young woman now and its too much for me lol,That's awful. I'm so sorry you had to experience that.

questioning,Drugs. That's why I was apprehensive,Will you explain it to them?
consoling,"They can be a handful. They're not the most socialized, so especially when we have other children over, they don't quite interact well, and they easily misunderstand situations. But I do appreciate the brotherly bond they have. It's something to be envious of.","That's understandable. Hopefully, you won't make the same mistake next time."

acknowledging,It was amazing!  I was there a whole week.  She got a bonus from work and wanted me to have it.  I have never had anyone do anything like that for me before!,Sounds like it's gonna be a lot of fun.
agreeing,"It was more than that, it was horrifying.  I have never seen anything more disturbing in my life.  The toilet was overflowing onto the floor.",I know where this is going lol
questioning,"Yeah, it was scary but good in the end",That should be fun.  Does he live pretty far away?
acknowledging,"Splash Mountain, of course :D I was maybe 9 or 10, and I've only been once",That has to be tough
questioning,It was in english,Oh no. Did you need it?
questioning,I wouldn't know where to turn if he hadn't offered to help. I hope I don't burden him for too long though.,What happened?
acknowledging,Yeah she caught me and yelled at me.,"Bright side, it would have been a great excuse to order pizza."
questioning,"Thank you. Yes, chronic illness can be really hard.  I try to stay positive because I know it makes a different on my health to stay optimistic.  But this flare came suddenly and its horrible to be back in bed.","So, are they trying to apply for jobs and stuff? How long do you think you'll let them stay for?"
wishing,She has been mean and making sure that everyone knows. That is the thing.,I'm actually doing one now. Need better pay. I wish us both the best of luck.
agreeing,"I guess, I got through it",That's a good idea. I know everyone is worried about that when it comes to George RR Martin and game of thrones.

encouraging,"I agree with you, but I can't help it. Maybe I should have just been honest with her.",That's nice of you. I hope he feels better soon.
acknowledging,"yes he will be busy , but his life will also be better , im just over all really happy for him",It's great that your kids are having such a great relationship with their grandparents.
questioning,"I'm going to North Carolina to start my first semester of college! So, that's a part of it, too, is I'm going to a completely new place, away from family, and doing it in a way I haven't done before that kind of wracks my nerves.",That is a long time.  What are you going to do?
acknowledging,no i was not i was able to go home and wait for the family the we went out to eat,That is  good.  Might be a good time to work on you
questioning,It could be! Sometimes what I imagine it to be is worse than what it is in reality.,That is a great thought! What makes you so sure?
agreeing,They said they knew the Kardashians and have a helicopter. I guess I need to be more skeptical.,I completely know the feeling. My kids are teenagers and I threaten them every day that I will move in with them when I am old and grey lol.
questioning,He gave me a $100 gift card!,Why is it so shocking?
questioning,"Well, after a few days of getting worse, took him to his primary dr.  He gave antibiotics for a sore throat.",Well she is married right? some people say sister in law before its official
questioning,"Nope.  Got worse, went to an ENT and finally got the correct antibiotics.  ER bill, Dr. bill and ENT bill for what started as a simple sore throat.",That sounds really good.  What kind do you like?
acknowledging,I think our current house is problematic enough that all the effort and anxious feelings will be worth it.,That sounds great

consoling,It bring back always good memories.It was nice. Nothing to worry about. Just playing.,I hope you're able to tough it out.
questioning,"No. His parents weren't there to hear it or witness it. I didn't feel like ratting him out or dealing with it, either. Kind of lazy on my part. Everyone just kind of shrugged it off and laughed awkwardly, but you could tell everyone was thinking, ""Really? Why?""","That is amazing, did it lower your insurance rates too?"
wishing,"Yeah. I didn't want to sit there and video tape and just be lost in my phone and behind a screen while he did it, especially because I wanted him to see my face clearly and all that.

I plan on getting a bum card from now on though with just a few bucks on it, because I don't like companies having my info especially if they are refusing a refund!","That sounds like a jolly good time, ole chap. What shows/movies are you planning on watching?"
questioning,"They are in the UK and had good reviews but NO phone number! Only email.

You guys are doing the right thing.  How is it doing today?
questioning,It was the first day at MIDNIGHT for a month of software though and I hadn't even touched it most of the free trial and I deleted my acct so I can't use it anyway. They don't have a PHONE number and the CS rep was SO nasty and said I couldn't be refunded on a software I am not even USING and I was JUSt charged! I couldn't believe how nasty the rep was! I wanted to smack her!,That is bad. Did you already made reservation and purchase airline tickets?

acknowledging,Well I looked up reviews..I didn't see anything bad in my FB groups about them either..and they decided to charge me early and didn't want to refund me!,That's pretty neat. I imagine is very nice working from home. I wish I could so that I can stop working at the Nike sweatshop.

questioning,Yup agreed 100%,That's really too bad. I know how that feels. Have you tried telling her how you feel about it?
consoling,"Just found out that my partner at work submitted our project, but most of his work was stolen.  I didn?Ât know that he did this, but I feel ashamed and embarrassed.",That must be really difficult and lonely for you. I hope you guys can get something figured out.
acknowledging,"It did! That's the first thing that came to mind right before pulling it; ""PLEASE let this one work!"".",Sounds like a good kid. What has he been working on.
questioning,"I think I will, but it'll be a while before I do!",That's great! How old is he?
questioning,Yes thank you.,That is nice of you.  Where has he been?
acknowledging,"Haha, I know the feel. Once in High School I was trying to find a seat at a football game, and I tripped and fell in front of a whole bunch of people. They all started laughing at me too.",that is really nice of you
questioning,it is really hard to always be broke,"Talk about an unwelcome guest! I would have immediately slammed my door shut! I never know how to respond in those situations, as in whether or not they're dangerous, etc. What did you do?"
agreeing,"I've got to say, for an old truck it rarely gives me trouble and runs great! It's a 1995 Chevy.",I know exactly what you mean. Someone returned my purse at the casino once. It still had my money in it!
acknowledging,"Yes, I just checked my account and realized I am broke :(","That must be incredibly annoying to have to deal with. To constantly have to battle for what you feel is justified support, and to always be worrying about it in the back of your head. You have to be really resilient to go through that."
sympathizing,No I will make her pay for what she did to me,"Wow.. That's almost noble. I hope you're able to still properly survive without it, especially since it's unfair that you're not getting it in the first place. I'm sorry you're being put in that position. One day I'm sure your children will recognize and appreciate you had to go through for them."
agreeing,I guess I can always buy another.,I'm in college I understand. Just have to keep pushing forward and you'll so great
agreeing,"Yeah but, it won't be quite the same.",Oh no.  I have experienced that before and its not pleasant.  Its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when you're near a snob.
agreeing,She just isn't allowed to be on it on school days.,I would too! Most officers dont show up for that.
acknowledging,"Thank you so much, I'm so glad he's worked as hard as he has.",Your mom is awesome
suggesting,"Not even once. I've never done anything intimate with anyone in my life, lol. My friends stress out about it, but I think I've come to just accept that we're not all made to find someone.",Maybe you should go on a trip together
questioning,I hope so. Its just hard not having someone you know from back home with you.,Oh yeah? That sounds awesome. That's how it should be! Can you tell me a little bit about them?
acknowledging,I feel terrible.,"Haha, that's incredible. A lot of parents wouldn't feel that way... After 18, they're done. That's pretty cool of you to feel that way, but I guess that speaks volumes about the kind of kids you have and how good they are. It sounds like you raised them right."
questioning,"Thanks, I will.",Why is that?
acknowledging,it was roadkill and it stunk to high heaven,I can understand that
agreeing,literally. haha it was really rank smelling,I hops so too! Work does come first or the bills can't be paid! :)
questioning,"Well, I just don't know if I'm physically fit enough for Basic Training. And it's hard imagining signing a contract for 4 years. But, I know it'll be better in the end, it'll set me up with a good job and good work experience.",What kind of birthday are you having?
questioning,"I guess like ten minutes. It's not that long, but you shouldn't have to wait! And then it's chained to a pole like they're really protective of it. Oh yeah, and the ink is almost always out by the time you get to it.",Wow! Enjoy it! What did you accomplish if I may ask?
wishing,I didn't but she got some big hugs for the gesture!,That is something that is a dream! Enjoy it so much! congrats
sympathizing,It was pretty great. Its strange how young we all looked.,I am so sorry to hear that.  When will you see them again?
consoling,Tell me about it.  We went from kids to married with kids.,That is so sad to hear.  I hope things go well with the therapy and you are reunited soon.
sympathizing,Yup! The first one came out when I was in like middle school. So it's crazy finally getting a character you wanted in the game over 10 years later.,"There's absolutely nothing I can say to make you feel better about that. I'm sorry for your great losses. Just from those few sentences alone, I can tell you were very passionate about them. What were their names, if you don't mind me asking?"
agreeing,"It's like a fighting game, but some people call it a ""party game"", but basically it's a fighting game with all kinds of Nintendo characters. You have stuff like Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Zelda, Pikachu, etc etc. So every time a new game comes out, people post online about who they want to see in it next. This new game is filled with characters and I think most people will be happy. The first game came out in 1999. Time sure flies.","Those are great names! And that does sound like a good idea, as long as you're comfortable with it. It's such a tenuous situation.. to want another pet to fill the void, but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they don't live up to their predecessors. My girlfriend will be in the same situation when her dog passes. She's already getting nervous since her dog is 10-years-old."
questioning,We are so excited. My parents are taking us and my sisters family is going also. It is going to be so much fun.,"Oh, how come?"
acknowledging,"No kids of my own but, I did find out that i'm going to be an uncle.   Except i'm not supposed to know that yet.",That is terrible
questioning,"Yea, for sure. Thanks for hearing me out, it can feel good to get things off your chest, and I really don't have anyone else to tell something like that too. None of our relatives know about the issues they had and I try to be a rock for my friends, so I don't usually have someone to tell my sob stories to. I hope you have a wonderful life!",When did you start living by yourself?
acknowledging,"I killed it, and burned it.",That is great! Being without a job can be very scary
questioning,Not yet. I am going to become certified to work in a daycare though. I love being around little kids,What kind of job is it?
questioning,Agreed! I wish I could hire a maid!,It's all behind you now.
consoling,But I have a hard time paying someone something I can do myself.,My neighbors are terrible so I hope you have a good relationship
questioning,We were at Old Navy. I think I set it on top of the car and drove away like and idiot,Have you been busy lately?
questioning,do you know? i thought so too,"Oh no, what happened?"
suggesting,i wish! here i am looking all over for a kitten under my car or in the wheel well or up in the engine. but nooooooo!,You should check if they raised your rates unexpectedly or maybe something you bought is eating up a lot of electricity.
questioning,a freaking bird squaking about that sounded like a baby kitten in distress.,"That's terrible, what did you do?"
consoling,I did. My daughter is almost my size. Reminded me that she is growing up on me...,I hope he learned his lesson.

questioning,kindergarten and 8,"Oh, I love cleaning, so tools to do it with that are new are always welcomed. What kind of brand?"
questioning,"Yeah. I don't really fish much anymore so it only kind of adds to the thought of fishing being a ""my grandpa"" thing. I miss him.","Well, that's understandable.  I've had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car.  Was she in shock when you guys were almost hit?"
agreeing,no. just the opposite. at least for me.,"I completely understand that.  Things are always scary when it is happening to your kids, but there is hope!  Have you ever heard of whole foods plant based diet?  Or doctor Fuhrman, or doctor Michael Greger?  I think it could heal your son!"
consoling,i'd be happy with one,"You will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office, but it can heal almost anything!  I hope your son is better before the end of summer.  Keep hope alive!"
questioning,I had to re-register and they were all full. I don't think I am going to do well now,What happened to it?
acknowledging,I got a few classes but I'm not excited at all,That sucks.
questioning,I know right!  I love it!,What are they doing?
acknowledging,Yep. Then there's graduation and prom in may.,"Oh lol, Well it"
sympathizing,So true! I wish my phone would just do it automatically,"Sorry! I meant that kids do that, enjoy it mom while they are little :)"
acknowledging,I visited a haunted house and there were a lot of jump scares!,That's nice of you to say about someone else. It's nice when someone can recognize someone else's hard work and dedication without feeling jealous or annoyed. I'm sure he knows how proud of him you are.
questioning,Just myself,"That's a good way to look at it, to use them as motivation and a goal to strive for. Are you in school yourself, or just working?"
questioning,So true. And I feel so much better now that I am not even looking,Oops.  That's doesn't have to be a bad thing.  No one can resist fries from McDonalds.  How did she react?
acknowledging,I know. IT will all fall into place when it is time,"Well, there you go.  She enjoyed it and if she didn't complain or scoff at you, then she sounds like a keeper!"
acknowledging,"Yeah its hard, and having no other adults around me for a while feels isolating",You must really miss him! So glad you'll finally be reunited with him.
questioning,it did.i felt like he was eating out of the palm of my hand,"Oh you have kids, too? They're going to be so happy!"
encouraging,Im so excited,I bet its fun. I cant swim though
questioning,I lost my job and I can still keep my head above water,IT? Haven't heard of it. What's it about?
questioning,Me too. I need the money,Are you thinking about telling her you don't want to see it?
questioning,I recently upgraded my car due to a raise I got. I am very happy,That's a great idea!  For what cause though?
acknowledging,I don't like scary show but I can't stop watching it. It is truly frightening,That is very thoughtful of you.
sympathizing,I just feel really bad but I've heard so many stories of people pretending to be homeless just to make a buck,Wow. Im sorry
acknowledging,Thanks,That's true. It's nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.
questioning,"Well, let me tell you from experience, they are not fun!  Be happy you have gotten one!","Oh man, Costco pizza is great, and so cheap, too. It may not be the best, but for the price and quantity, you can't really beat it. Do you like shopping at Costco often?"
questioning,You have no idea,That was so nice of you.  What did they need to use it for?  Were you able to live without it?
agreeing,"No, like I get paid to take a lunch break, still getting my hourly wage for the hour I eat",I hate that happened to you. I know the feeling too. Someone stole my car from the work parking lot once. I had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it.
suggesting,My cousins used to always scare me so I can't take it as an adult,Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you don't need to take a side and try to work for peace.
acknowledging,"I hope so, my problem is I do the math before, so I expect the numbers",That's pretty cool! I hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it. Your wife sounds really cool to do that for you.
consoling,Yes. I am going to do so well. I think I literally can't fail.,Did you call her? I hope she's ok!
acknowledging,He is not used to being around other kids. He might be too afraid,"Oh, that's kind of nice. It's nice to have those natural landmarks near where you live, so you can visit them and get a sense of relaxation and peace. I've lived near the ocean all my life, and while I do take it for granted from time to time, I try to remember how useful and beautiful it is."
acknowledging,We did that and he didn't want to let my leg go. We are going to have a rough start. I already know,"Sometimes it means increased work commute, or higher costs of living. But sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it. It's all a balance. I'm glad you seem to have found yours!"
acknowledging,That's sounds like a good plan,that is awesome!
acknowledging,"It was about the asian lady with long black hair, very scary",It will save you a lot of money too
questioning,Not yet. They have been moving in for weeks and only at night. Its horrible,Oh nice. What will you be binge watching?
encouraging,it is,Hope you find something you like.
agreeing,"I believe she is, I hope I am not proven wrong","Oh man... When you consider all that, then yeah, definitely cut ties. If they did that to me more than twice, then I would realize really quick that they weren't the type to depend on or waste time on. I feel sorry for you. People should have friends that recognize their worth and be able to respect that relationship. Go out and find you someone who will."
acknowledging,it took a few minutes to get situated so i could call him back where i would have reception,"Wow, that sounds exciting!"
encouraging,yeah. We have a lot,It must've been. I hope that never happens to you again.

suggesting,Mario Odyssey was really good as well!,"Well, absence always does make the heart grow fonder. It will make your relationship a little strained, but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more. Hopefully his college work doesn't stress him out too much for him to be able to enjoy hanging out."
acknowledging,Just because I have never done it. I am so nervous,"Your husband sounds awesome. That's interesting that you're the type of person that actually likes birthday parties. Most people I know would be too embarrassed or self-conscious to enjoy them, and they'd feel uncomfortable. Especially me. But for you, I'm glad you can get into them."
encouraging,That all I am hoping for,"Oh, I didn't mean anything about the age! Who cares about that. I'm just a doofus when it comes to social interaction, so I get nervous and avoid things that put attention on me. But I hope you have a lot of fun, especially since your husband went through so much effort. I bet he knows you and what you like well and it will be great."
questioning,I froze at first and then backed up slowly into the house.,Oh no!  My gut feels sick for you having to go through that.  It happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward.  How did the neighbors take it?

suggesting,I've already spoken directly to them about it because there should be room left for even another car in case someone comes over.  They did it for about 2 days and then went back to doing it badly again.  I have to talk to the landlord next.,I think that it's completely normal to feel that way for such a long distance trip. I assume you're going from America. I bet you would feel better by doing a bit of research!
questioning,Its a good habit to get into.,That would drive me crazy.  How are you handling it?
agreeing,I cry every first day and not they are at different schools so its three different times a year lol,Yes i agree.  I have 3 boys and they are in their twenties. I don't know where the years went.

questioning,"Yes, it was.  I am very thankful for the savings!",Oh no. Was there no sign posted or anything?
questioning,"LOL! Well that is a funny thing. Yelling at him? What happened! Yes, I will always help them.

suggesting,not having to wake up at 4am to go to work!,That's so mean! I think they should honor the original prices they set
questioning,They already leave every weekend to hang out,Oh no!  And that is hard to get out!  Do you have a waterproof cover on the bed by any chance?
sympathizing,Im sad though lol,"oh YUCK!  Well, I'd suggest a waterproof mattress cover just in case it happens again.  At least if it does happen again, it won't get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes.  I'm so sorry you discovered it that way!"
questioning,shop for the kids.. school starts monday,"Oh no! I think they're cute but I'd probably be freaked out if I saw one in my yard, too. What did you do?"

questioning,"they had a blown tire, and didnt have a spare. frightened them a bit.","Oh wow! That must've been really fun, I've never been there actually, what did you guys do?"
questioning,Me too! Except now she drives me a bit crazy as poor girl seems to not know anything about house living and I don't think she ever experienced puppy hood- she is a year old. So now she is being a handful!,"Cool cool, when do you think it would be best to visit Mississippi?"
questioning,clubbin,"Oh, I'm sorry. Have you tried joining any meet up groups to make some friends?"
consoling,Yep...because he was a foot from us it was hard to stop and we were wedged in! We had to SLAM on the brakes. I truly hate bad drivers,I'm sure it will make you feel a little better. And at least that way you can pick a group based on similar interest. I hope you get to feeling better.

questioning,Exactly. A waste of my hard earned cash,"Oh gross, what kind of animal was it?"

suggesting,It's white.  I am sure I can put it together.,I wonder why? Maybe his busy?
questioning,"I am not sure. I was so mad at first, but she doesn't usually do that, so I let it slide.",I see. Do you feel okay when he invites others or is it a bit uncomfortable?
encouraging,"Wouldn't that be a hoot?  No, we took them to Disney!","Oh, I hope so too! Those can be quite scary especially if you're like me and you go once every 10 years or so"
questioning,Oh yes but I am so ashamed.,"ohh, but why did it surprise you?"
consoling,"I kept telling myself that I was going to do it ""later"", but ""later"" never came. I can't blame her for being mad.",oh no. hopefully it was an innocent prank.

At least you can say you didn't chicken out. I'm glad you decided to go that way, because now you have a special memory tied to that vacation;"
questioning,It was about the different types of caffeine and their effects.,"Oh man, I feel for you.  Kids grow up so fast.  Do you feel prepared for it?"
agreeing,5 years! We lived together for four years.,I hear you.  I have a 8 year old daughter and it feels like she was born yesterday.

acknowledging,feels good man,"Yeah I can understand that! Well at least they have each other, and hopefully they will grow more social together"
suggesting,"I am good now, but it felt pretty sick at the time","That happens sometimes. Sometimes life just gets in the way. Heck, sometimes you just decide you can't physically do a night out, and that's okay, too. I'm sure they'd understand no matter what. Maybe you can make it up to them somehow."
suggesting,"Yes, I have tried so much! I don't absorb food well as vitamins, so I am getting Chlorella, Wheat Grass and also Bitter Apricot..I want to try some mushrooms as well that help with blood flow and healing digestion.","Maybe take a few days to think it over, and then when the weekend comes, think of a way to surprise them in order to make it up to them. Or if nothing else, just be as honest as possible and not try to cover anything up when you need to bail on them. They'll appreciate that the most."
sympathizing,Yes,"I am sorry, I guess some friends just argue like that"
questioning,"I live paycheck to paycheck, sometimes its not enough",I love visiting breweries! What's your favorite kind of beer?
questioning,"Yes it is hard to coordinate work, home, pets, errands etc everyday. So much to do!",Ohhh gotta hate that friend!   What do you drive?

questioning,"my car keys ,they had those fancy key fobs attached to it",I know how you feel.  I moved about 3 hours away from my hometown for school and stayed for 3 years and hated it.  I moved back to my hometown and am so happy now.  I'm sorry you're having a tough time.  Have you gotten out and tried to meet people?
consoling,I wasnt too sad. It was just really cool to see.,"I would go with your gut.  Sometimes things don't work out, but you might just need more time to meet people and might want to hang in there.  I hope you meet a best friend soon!"
acknowledging,I am thinking about it. They could not speak or read english well so they couldn't do it well..yet I was the one being attacked? They said I wasn't doing it right lol! And kept repeating questions for me to answer but wouldn't listen to the answers???? GRRRR!!,That is a great friend! I'm happy you were able to see your family.
acknowledging,"Yea, it felt like forever, but it was worth it.",She sounds like one of a king! Not many people are that generous.
acknowledging,No. He had to cancel at the last minute. I'm so disappointed.,Wow that's really frustrating.
agreeing,"I am just so sad and upset right now, but I appreciate your information.","I do, too.  We just need to take better care of the resources we have and plant more trees.  Do you do anything ""green""."
acknowledging,Running.  I trained for months for that race.,That's great. Health scares are very real and scary.

And the Haunted House. We used to spend summers in Tucson with my grandparents, and they would drive us to Disneyland every year ;-)"
wishing,im male yes,That's awesome! What a nice surprise. And congratulations on graduating. That's a big accomplishment. What did you graduate in?
acknowledging,Restaurant? I am trying new supplements. Chlorella and Wheat grass. Should help me heal a lot of my health issues,"Oh, very cool. I thought about majoring in English, too, but decided to go a different route. I hope your new degree helps you land the job you want! You're now in the exciting unknown part of your life."
consoling,"She did, but it was still really frustrating.",Just try and teach them to be more careful with them
acknowledging,"No. And he lives in another city, so I was totally shocked when he showed up.",That's so nice of him to do. No one wants to help anyone out these days but I'm glad for you.
suggesting,I am feeling confident I can get it to start. I am not paying anyone $20 to mow it..They never showup anyhow. It's a hassle...People don't like to work here,There's always Uber!
sympathizing,I just want a quick mow...Oh...they want a lot here to mow..Even the little druggie guys who steal stuff and are out pushing a mower down the street all day..But they aren't reliable..I have hired a few..They never show..So I am simply saving for a new mower.,I am so sorry to hear that! Cancer is such a horrible disease.
agreeing,just a honda pilot,"I've actually lost two family members last year, so I can relate. It's something that will stick with you until the day you die."
questioning,I'm just really sad. He's been with me since I was young. I miss him already.,That's unfortunate. Does she know that it happened?

wishing,She's in her late 40s.,Best of luck to you. The tension and nerves must be killing you!
sympathizing,YEP! So angry! I work hard for my stuff! Offerup and everything else here is expensive. I am in a poor county..so people charge ridiculous amounts for everything :/,I am sorry you have that. It must be rough
wishing,"I do what I am told, I was not expecting that.","Wow, congratulations on getting a new job!  I think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job.  What do you do?"
questioning,"They were just standing there watching, I wish people could control their kids better.",That sounds fun. Have you done something like it before or is the whole kind of job new to you?  Good luck and I know you'll do great!  Act confident even if you don't feel like it. Sometimes that can help.
suggesting,I just really took a blow. Its hard out here.,"Ah, that's rough. That was a very bold move on your part. But sometimes fortune favors the bold, as they say. I think you'll be happy later on not having to wonder ""what if."" Still though, she could have maybe been more discrete about things."
suggesting,"I am in Bali, I would like to stay here forever, I will shed some tears for sure.","Ah, I see. Well, it's a good thing you were rejected thing, maybe. At least now you know what kind of a bullet you dodged. Plus, this is just another step in your overall confidence and character building. The next time you ask someone else out, it will be easier."
acknowledging,"Mrs Doubfire, i watched it so many times when i was a kid",That is very nice of him.
acknowledging,"I actually plan to keep it, he has not noticed yet","Yes, a very cool thing."
suggesting,I blamed it on my coworker even though it was my fault,Maybe next weekend will be better for you!
questioning,I know right? I used to be. But for me it's a lot of free time and it makes me think about things that are going on that aren't good.,"you should not feel bad ,we all need alone time"
acknowledging,I am shocked as I always told him to be upfront and honest with me no matter what.,"Oh wow, that's great! Only bad thing is he will be very busy with two jobs."
acknowledging,"Me too, I cant wait to just relax all weekend.",That's great to hear!
questioning,I am so mad right now I want to get back at him,where are you going
acknowledging,1968 Chevrolet.,oh thats cool
questioning,"Thank you!  It was so nice, I had no idea it was happening.  They're not usually so good with secrets haha",I'm glad to hear something positive happened to you. Were you able to do something fun or productive with the time off? And what was the occasion?
acknowledging,Not at all!  I was completely shocked.,"Ah, pretty cool. It's nice that you decided to have family time instead of just alone time. I bet they were excited, too. Hopefully work rewards you more often like that."
acknowledging,why? I love halloween we are thinking about costumes already.,"That's great! It's hard to do that sometimes, especially on the weekends!"
questioning,i wanted to say something but it happened so quick and the dude was jacked so i let it go,Oh yeah? What kind of animal do you think it was?
questioning,I bought all of the battlefield games but couldnt get into it. The COD beta starts today I can't wait to get home,"Oh no, what did they say to convince you?"
suggesting,I know. That's the only thing I splurge on each year. The new call of duty.,Maybe I'm too gullible as well because that would convince me!
questioning,"He jumped off of a swing and landed wrong I was sick to my stomach when I witnessed it,",That is a relief. Did any coworker friends get laid off?
consoling,"Yes, he asked me to do a lot of lab tests.","I've been there. It's so sad, but it will get better."

acknowledging,Im going to South East Asia but I am getting nervous about going.,"Holy cow, that's terrible. I really feel for you. My dad had that happen to him and his dog when he was young, and he's told me about it as a warning to make sure I'm safe with ours. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I hope you get through the grieving process okay."
agreeing,"it just does not give me any incentive of watching the games anymore, it will be the same results each year","I would definitely take as long as you need, so you don't put unhealthy pressure or expectation on the animal to live up to a memory it can't live up to. But if you feel comfortable with the idea, then I would consider it when the time is right. You'll know when that is."
questioning,What happened with them?,"That's great, what did he give you?"
questioning,5,Do you know why he gave it to you?
encouraging,I am going to the beach. Its all I can think about before leaving. Im so ready to go.,Well I'm glad he got some antibiotics for it. I hope that helped enough!
agreeing,They're leaving too much work behind for me to do.,"Oh, I totally understand.  It's frustrating when you feel like you're putting in the same effort (or more!) and it works better for other people."
wishing,"Yeah I know that, but I just feel let down.","Well, it's good that at least you're making progress!  It would be crazy frustrating if you weren't.  Congrats on your hard work paying off."
questioning,"Freshman year, I am not sure what to expect, I am scared","Ah yes, does it bring back good memories? Nostalgia is a powerful thing."
questioning,Its my birthday too. I didnt think I would be able to go.,"That sure is embarrassing, did he get talked to about his behavior?"
agreeing,"spending time with my little ones, 1 and 4","I agree, at that age kids should definitely know better and think before doing something. Unbelievable."
suggesting,I am really and also in shock.,"Well, maybe it's an opportunity for introspection. For you to take time out of your day to think about what you need and want, and what are the best ways to achieve that. Maybe you need a better diet, or sleep schedule, or meditation, or an exercise routine. Sometimes you have to spend energy to feel energized. It's a slow process in the beginning, but it can be life-changing."
questioning,16 months,Any plans for Friday?
encouraging,My kids are too little for lots of extra cirriculars. I get lonely while they are in school,That's awesome! I bet these next few days will fly by
questioning,You're so right my oldest grew up when I blinked lol,I bet you were! What kind of laptop was it?
acknowledging,haha it's a Korean dish. Fermented napa cabbage.,Wowza! That's impressive. I wonder how long until he's called up.
suggesting,yeah. now I have to order in. I hate that,"I'm really sorry to hear that... That's the worst scenario too, because you're parked and probably not even there, so you were completely powerless in the situation, and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you. Maybe there's something that can be worked out, since you just purchased it."
consoling,I just want time to slow down. I will miss them so much when they are all grown up.,"There has to be something. It can't just be this weird vulnerable loophole. I really hope so, for your case, because that's just unfair. I'm sure your work will understand, but it's still a crummy situation that is probably affecting all areas of your life. Transportation gets taken for granted. Hope things get better soon."
acknowledging,"Going swimming Sunday, probably relaxing on Saturday.",I can see why its even harder on you when they leave.  That's wonderful that they are such a part of your life.  Take care and get out with friends soon to brighten your spirits!

questioning,Im going to the beach. Its going to be a lot of fun.,"Wow, how long has he been juggling for?"

wishing,My kids think those movies arent as good as the one from today,Congratulations on making a plan and sticking with it. What kind of diet are you doing?
questioning,Thats true especially in the south.,did it bite you!
acknowledging,Unfortunately this is the way we have to accept the world now,oh thats cool then
questioning,"I think it would be fun, but I just haven't been in school in so long. I'm afraid I'd be the oldest one there and not know anyone.",That would really anger me as well.  What did you do?  Did you find the person who did it?
wishing,Im really prepared and I think I am a great fit for the role. Should go well.,Thank you very much. Much success to you!
suggesting,We started at the same time and I have been getting really good feedback from my manager.,It's all good. Maybe you should try something simple like Hamburger Helper. Can't really  mess that up.
acknowledging,I hope so,That is friggin' awesome! I sure hope they can keep up the quality in the upcoming movies.
wishing,I'm planning on using it to pay off the remainder of my truck and I can't wait!,Congratulation.
agreeing,i want this week to pass so fast. She is coming in from London,You had a good idea. Each of us need to find the correct way to lose weight.
wishing,I did because they almost swerved into me and killed me! I was so mad!,"Wow, good luck.  I hope it all goes well. It sounds like you're confident that it will. Have you done one before?"

questioning,It was,did you get to keep them?
acknowledging,"Yes, about 25%.",thats awesome
questioning,I am. I have never gone away that long.,"That is awesome, did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected?"
acknowledging,I am not really close to them and I would not make a move to be emotional with them,That must mean you're a hard worker. You should keep at it then!
suggesting,cheer up. I'l be your friend,"Yeah, absolutely. That's what I meant earlier, too, about being high maintenance. I don't know, maybe earbuds? But I'm sure you've tried that. Who knows how they would respond if you asked them personally, and if they actually did improve, they'd probably just forget and revert back in a few days anyway."
acknowledging,That is the problem. He did not even mention it. I noticed it myself. People can't be trusted anymore,Wow!  That is impressive!  You must be really prod of yourself!
acknowledging,i have gotten a call back yet but there is no way I didn't get that job,Haha!  That's funny!  I work out to drink and eat bad food as well!  Awesome achievement with your running!  Keep at it!
acknowledging,"I was a finalist. It was so exciting. Even though I didn't win, it had a lot of advantages.",I feel ya.  The kids will be all grown up by then!

acknowledging,"Yeah, the diet is the hard part for me.  I like the exercise part.","I never did want to hold it, but I was curious enough to touch it! They're actually kind of cute."
consoling,"Yeah, I have been on the phone with them all day.  They said it was part of the contract!",Oh no! I hate when that happens... hopefully your computers holds on a little longer for it to go back down
wishing,I'm definitely planning to!,Well good luck! I know how frustrating that can be
agreeing,"Right! He's learning, I used to have to ask him 5 times and motivate him with money.  Now he just likes to help around the house!",I agree. It must be hard to get any sleep. I feel bad for any animals in the area too!
acknowledging,"That's what I'm trying to do, I might have to take out a payday loan which I don't want to do!",yea i hear that... it was much better back then
agreeing,Yes! I knew I could depend on them.,that i think you are right
questioning,Every single slice. I can't believe I ate that whole cake,"Wow, how exciting! Boy or girl?"
questioning,I was the best cake I ever had. I am glad I don't know how to bake,Yeah I'm sure! Is this your first?
wishing,"Yea, now he's excited and googling new words to learn.",Well congratulations! :D
acknowledging,"yea it really is, very saddening",wow that's such an awesome surprise!

suggesting,"Yeah, I wish I could, but I have to house watch my parents house this weekend! Bummer.",I hear you. At least it is only for a month. Maybe you can make some weekend trips to do fun things.
questioning,I love them but my ears need a break lol,That's hilarious!  Did you try to play it off like you meant to do that?
questioning,Pitch Black!,"Oh, man!  That is a nightmare!  Was your boss upset with you?"
consoling,"He beat me by a good distance, even though I thought I was faster. I need more practice.","Yeah, it happens to the best of us.  You just have to try and forget about it and move forward."
questioning,I was already five blocks away. I had to drink the gross coffee at the office. I usually dont buy coffee so I was trying to treat myself.,That is great! Do you have any fun plans?
acknowledging,Did you just start college?  It does feel like a long jouney!,Oh wow! That will be really fun!
questioning,"both. I will miss the nightlife, but I have to raise a family",whats wrong with your cat
sympathizing,me too! good luck with school,im sorry to hear that.. she will be in peace soon enough.
questioning,"Nothing really, I guess it's my fault for waiting too long.  I might see I can take them at a different college.",That would make me mad. Did you know who did it?
suggesting,"Yeah, especially since I live in Florida!  I learned my lesson from last years big hurricane!",That's too bad. Maybe they could check security cameras for you.

acknowledging,I am. she studied over the summer and got ahead for this year,I would have done the same! I don't like snakes
questioning,But we got along really well. He had to move away. Now I have no one to hang out with while I am at home.,That was very nice. Why couldn't you have a baby shower?
acknowledging,"Yeah, who knows. It's still hurting like crazy. Just a nice reminder of how dumb I was in not being on top of renewing my health insurance","Yes, that is nice. A baby shower, just without the people. Still great!"
questioning,They're about as useless as my printer. This stupid thing never acts right.,Oh no! Inquiring minds want to know... is there plans for a second date?

suggesting,"It is, those quiet snuggle naps. Makes me miss my kiddo being little.",Maybe you can get a pet to distract you. It could even help socialize like if you get a dog and go to a dog park
acknowledging,I only have one. She is 7.,That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time.
agreeing,"Yep, and I trust them a lot so no worries at all!",Yeah I know how it is. My kids drive me nuts now. They are 8 and 9.

suggesting,A $50  gift card and bragging rights.,You never know.
agreeing,About 15.,That's great! I know that is an amazing feeling to have.
acknowledging,I'll probably give it a try. They do little events like this a few times a year.,That's wonderful. A car is one of the most useful purchases one can make I think.
acknowledging,She ended up getting an arts degree!,"Ouch, I bet that must have hurt!"

questioning,I play a little bit but I could never be as good as Anthony Green.,That's too bad.  Have you given serious thought to trying to lose weight?

questioning,It was catered lunch. So on refunds.,Why you don't want to join the comic book club?
agreeing,"It was actually a stranger, and I was on public transportation. They didn't actually say anything to me, I could just tell the way they were giving me a look, and kind of shaking their head and then laughing to themselves, that it was pointed at me. Maybe I read too much into it. Either way, made me want to sink into the ground",I understand. You could find a book club outside school.

encouraging,"Thanks, we're gonna have a blast this weekend.","11 years is a long time, I hope you have a great time!"

questioning,Yeah.  I cooked her a catfish dinner!  It was delicious.,That's nice. Have you always done that?
questioning,"She really is, but she lives in basically a mansion - so that's hard sometimes - I get a bit embarrassed when she comes over to our house.","I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you?"
acknowledging,"Yeah, I've been told that I walk as fast a some people run.","Aw, I'm glad you have something like that to remember him by. That's a great connection to him to have."

I really don't mean to make fun of you. That's terrible! Was it because you didn't want to miss a part of the movie, so you tried to hold it in as long as possible?"

You sound like a hard worker, which is something to be proud of, even though it's kind of wearing you out maybe. Are you able to roll the days over to next year and save them, at least?"
consoling,Yes so many things to  do,"That's kind of a lame policy. I hope you get to use them at some point, because they should be worth something. If you're just physically unable to because of the job and its demands, and then they end up passing you by, that doesn't seem fair. I hope you get to relax during the holidays, then."

acknowledging,I won over 500 bucks.,Yeah I would be pumped too!  Is it coming with a raise as well?
suggesting,They are really good quality and never break.,"Do you feel negative about it, or positive? It's hard to tell from your sentence. Maybe you feel both ways. If I were in your shoes, I could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation. I was always the youngest child, so I never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time. If you're not happy about it, hopefully you can turn it into a positive so that your sister doesn't get any undue negativity."
suggesting,It was great! He scored 5 touchdowns!! I think he could be really good.,"I can understand why you'd start to feel that way. I think it's good that you want to look inward instead of just blatantly blaming other people. That means you can start to look for ways to make you feel better about yourself, that are solutions! But nothing has to be ""wrong with you."" For some, it just takes time. For others, they find it easier to accept someone to settle down with."
questioning,I am beyond proud. I'm going to bring a video camera for his next game!,"That seems like a short train ride compared to say, going across country or something! Are you going to be sleeping on it overnight?"

acknowledging,I was very sick with a mono.,That sounds like a lot of fun!
acknowledging,She was super awkward and that made me awkward too.,That is cool!  I bet you all had a really great time

questioning,"yea it was very painful, i hate when it happens",Did you clean the house yourself or hire someone to do it?

agreeing,I never have cool clothes.,"Myself as well friend, i love vacation."
acknowledging,yea i was surprised at his reflexes tho,That sounds fun to go to.
questioning,They are but they reopen when school returns.,"Oh, why did you cheat on her?"
questioning,It's just so shallow. They start talking to a better looking guy and instantly drop me no matter how close we get.,Hey that's good.  What was wrong with it?
acknowledging,kind of but im still worried,That's pretty awesome.  I don't guess it cost too much then.
questioning,Thanks!  And he is playing football too!  Love that kid,How fun. How big was your catch?
questioning,Yeah I hope he does great this year!  Can't wait to go see one of his games!,thats a big one. I bet it was scary. Did you eat it?
acknowledging,She does not like the girl I am going to marry.,"Oh my goodness, I bet that was embarrassing!!!"
questioning,They have a pumpkin patch and a haunted house.,That is terrible.  Did you get hurt badly?
questioning,"Yes, I just eat a decent diet.",Were there a lot of people around?
questioning,You have to start somewhere.,Must be nice!  Do you think he will let you ride it?
acknowledging,Well now I kinda wish I wasn't so nice since she left me for some random better looking guy.,"I would be too, those things are really nice."
acknowledging,I went this summer. They rocked out.,"Oh, that sounds like a hassle."
acknowledging,Different places and online.  Going on a trip soon.,"Oh that's not cool, get a different one."
consoling,We're going to Panama City Florida!  Going to the beach!!,Uh oh!!  I hope it wasn't a prank lol
questioning,yea i felt super bad afterwards,Florida is so nice. Are you going for work or pleasure?
questioning,I wish they would all die.,Oh no!  Happens to the best of us.  Are you feeling better now?
sympathizing,"next week, feeling like it should be easy","Oh no!  I would hope that people had compassion for your situation and if they didn't, well shame on them.  I once peed my pants at a wedding I was laughing so hard."
acknowledging,yea but it doesnt do much i was so mad,"Oh wow, that's a big snake!"
questioning,Yeah it sure did.  I miss some of my old friends.  And some that had passed away already.,"Oh wow, what was the award for?"
wishing,Yeah.  We're all in our late 30s now so it happens.  Just isnt fair :(,Oh congratulations! You are a true hero
questioning,Well of course we can. But spending time and doing stuff together is much better,That is so sweet.  How did he lose his leg?
sympathizing,He truly is my best friend.,I'm so sorry.  I have dealt with a lot of sleep problems and night panic attacks so I know how hard it can be dealing with things like that. I have a friend who does the same thing. Don't be humiliated.  You can't control it.
agreeing,yea it was horrible,"Don't feel any shame.  The medication is called Topomax.  It supposedly stops the receptors in the brain that trigger night sleep eating.  I also know that if you happen to take Ambien,a sleeping pill, go off of it because it actually can cause night sleep eating. Take care!"
questioning,I lied to him about taking his TV.,Ugh! They do that here too! Are you in a bad city too?
questioning,yea i had to,Did you find out who did it?
acknowledging,This happened three years ago.,That is quite interesting.
acknowledging,yea it was a huge blow but im doing better,That's great. You have to buy a new one every so often as the motors get weak in them.
questioning,Yeah!!  Me and my brother are taking my nephew to an MMA show close to where we live!,That sounds really dramatic! What's the matter? What's making you so unsure about it?
suggesting,haha yeah!  It should be dope!  It's going to be a bunch of local guys fighting!,"I can understand trying to abide by one's intuition... Are you going on your flight to somewhere where you have something important to do or someone to meet? Perhaps it may be unfair to them or that situation if you don't go through with it. If you want to do it, try your best to think of all the repercussions, and to weigh the pros and cons, and to not let your intuition cloud your judgment."
questioning,Yes and everyone loves him.,"Oh! I hear you, I love them but I get sick when I eat them. Did you do okay?"
questioning,My mom got another job and my brother left for college so the house was so empty.,That's unusual. Are you allergic to something they are fried in or just potatoes in general? I have digestive issues so I get tired too when I eat junk food
sympathizing,"Yes, I was short by 100,000 dollars.",That's terrible! Sorry to hear that.
questioning,Yeah he is.  He is also playing football this year!,Congrats to him!  What type of skating?
agreeing,Not sure yet.  Last year he played center.  He will no in a week or two.,"Oh, now I understand.  He is skateboarding."
questioning,"Yes, hopefully they will tour next year.",Oh no. Have you been stressed about anything?
acknowledging,"The Conjuring, and it was just so hard to for to watch because of that.",You sound nervous.
acknowledging,yea i was in a hurry so i really needed to,I don't blame you. It can be scary...the more people there are- the worse they drive. Be careful!
agreeing,"Yes, he had to birdie the last hole to win.",For sure! And always check for the wreckless drivers and the ones who cut you off- Thats really bad in bigger cities. Can never be too careful.
agreeing,no but i was so mad,"Definitely. The world is an extremely complex thing, and I don't know if we'll ever fully understand it."
questioning,I gues so,That's an interesting thing to know! Have you thought about doing it as a hobby?
agreeing,yea i was quite impressed by it,"If it makes you feel peace of happiness, definitely!"
questioning,"College, he has worked really hard.",Oh hey! A fellow bird feeder. Did you eventually get some?
questioning,Nothing really.  Celebrated my mom's birthday by cooking for her.  That's about it.  Just one of those weeks where nothing bad happened.,"That's good, have you been having trouble?"
questioning,"Not a lot, it made me feel so bad.","I'll say. You can appreciate it that much more. What made the difference, if I may ask?"
questioning,It was. I am so thankful that she is a part of my life.,"Oh man, the flu in summer?1"
questioning,"Yeah very, so that's what made it so lonely.",Oh geez! Was it a quick flu
acknowledging,I am going to miss her a lot,"Wow! Great wife, Cherish her! Stack up on good vitamin C and good Elderberry when you're well to keep the flu away :)\"
consoling,She will be mad at me.,Oh god...lol- I HATE being sick...When I get sick..it's BAD- So let's hope lol

questioning,"Thanks, I feel very proud",That sounds relaxing! How was the weather?

questioning,Yeah but I wasn't over the moon since I wanted an A but I was pretty happy.,Thats exciting! where are you going??
questioning,Yes. I knew that I would. I was so sure of myself.,Is that a country? i know the name but not the geography.
consoling,"I tried to repend him, but he continued eating it",Oh no!!  That is awful.  I hope you are okay :(
encouraging,At least it is clean now,"I bet.  Nothing is worse than losing a friend suddenly like that.   Keep your head up, friend."
acknowledging,Taking my neice and nephew to six flags.  I've never ridden a coaster before,That sounds like fun!
acknowledging,That's what everyone says but they're scary.  Maybe if I try one I will like them!,Oh that is so cool! You must be a great relative.
agreeing,We'll see LOL.  I bet the kids will call me a sissy.,That is awful. I would definitely not pay and never go back again.
questioning,"Yeah it sucks, I just want a girl that is good but isn't shallow as hell too.","Glad you made it, what happened to almost be short?"

It sounds like you've given a lot of thought though, and the way you lay it out, you sound very mature about it. You've developed a good perspective on it, one that I should learn to appreciate myself. With your temperament, I'm sure you won't suffer from loneliness very long. People will want to be around you, as long as you want them around you."
acknowledging,I was impressed with the meal.,"You sound like you've dealt with more hardship than the average person.

encouraging,Yeah! and it's been a while to just kick back and not worry about work!,"I love them!!! So jealous, hope you have a blast!"
sympathizing,"It does, but I guess I'm also kinda used to it.  But I'm sitting there, just minding my own business, and this guy decides he's more important than anyone else.  And he flies up the emergency lane beside me, completely blocking any emergency vehicles that may need to use it.","Aww, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a new hobby for the weekends."

questioning,terrified i suppose!,"I bet, I would be too. Did you stop and talk to the police?"

questioning,"If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch the first two episodes.",Oh wow!  I remember the commercials too!  He looked like the coolest toy out there!  Did your daughter like it?

questioning,I don't have a dog and I just moved in the house yesterday. It was listed at 50% off and came with appliances. Maybe there was a reason for it.,Oh no that is terrible. How did you find out it had lobster in it?
questioning,"No, but I was.  I couldn't stay and help out, I had to leave.  It was very gross and it smelled horribly!","That's awesome, animals are the best! What kind, and is it a boy or girl?"
wishing,They are! I trust them completely,"Aw, that's a great friend right there. Congrats on your new puppy!"
questioning,I think next week we will have to put her down.,thats a bummer! do you not have a case on it?
agreeing,I think maybe their lifestyle make them not to have space for others,"thats good, make sure to get a case too!"
questioning,It was great. I took a picture and showed my friend. He laughed so hard.,"How do you mean? I guess it depends on the lady, does it not?"

sympathizing,"Oh, sorry! Didn't mean to gloat, hang in there buddy.",I am very sorry! That is very frustrating! Can you speak with a supervisor about the situation?
consoling,"I was okay, just shook up.  I could see the other car coming at me before the impact.","I don't blame you, I would talk to him. Even if he is uninvolved, it is not fair for you to bear the full weight of the tasks at hand. I sure hope he has a solution and the work load eases!"
acknowledging,"Oh yeah, we talked for quite a while about all the fun memories!","Oh, I bet that did irritate you! It's bad enough moving, but you don't need your furniture falling apart on you."
questioning,I did get it on camera. I can't wait to show him when he is older.,were you scared?
acknowledging,He's been getting speech therapy since he was 1.,I would be scared too.  It is cool that you were brave enough to try though.
consoling,"Thank you, so do I! He's about to start kindergarten.","Oh no, that's always really stressful. Just do your best to prepare, and try not to worry about it. Whatever happens, happens, and if you're less stressed you'll probably do better."
wishing,It was pretty scary. The GPS on my phone stopped working and I felt panicked.,"No problem, and I'll send good vibes your way that you pass! Good luck, you've got this."
questioning,I stopped at a gas station and asked for directions. Thankfully someone friendly was willing to help!,"ohh, gosh. What happened?"

questioning,It actually both. I would moved to another city and get a raise. I dont know if  I should though,"Sorry to hear about that. Is it still working alright, or under warranty?"
consoling,Yes and I wouldnt know anyone,"That stinks. Phones are so important these days. People always give others crap about staring at them all day, but it's because they afford us the ability to do so many things. I hope you're able to get another one soon."
questioning,"Oh hey, we on the same time clock.",Do you feel better now?
acknowledging,I mean nice? Just normal boxers.   It could have been worse,That's good It's sucks when you have to take care of yourself when you don't feel well.

acknowledging,"I hope so too, the sky is so gloomy and it's hard to see traffic. Dangerous to drive right now.",I hear you! Have you tried spraying lemon etc on yourself or eating them? Helps me a lot!
encouraging,"You're right about that. If he wouldn't have added the ""good"" part, I'd be a nervous wreck!",i hope it turns out well for you

questioning,"I know!  Both of my kids are completely out of it when they wake up in the middle of the night, so I went to help him and he peed on me.","I think so. Having integrity and good character would stop you from doing that, would you want to be cheated on? You should be honest with your partner..or work on and water your relationship if you don't like it the way it is. Cheating after 10 years would truly make you a terrible person to waste someone elses life for 10 years only to go through such a betrayal."
questioning,"Hockey team, I did my best and it wasn't enough.",what happened?
questioning,"It's okay, I did my best, maybe next time.",on purpose?

questioning,"I certainly do, which makes it easier for sure.",What do you put on your nachos?
acknowledging,"Well the area behind my fence is a big grassy area with a pond and its really mostly closed off by other peoples fences that come together in the back, so yeah I was able to get her with a couple pieces of bacon. Lol","Wow, that's really extreme. You should feel bad about it."

questioning,I think I'll go swimming.,"I can understand that! I actually attempted a diet about a month ago, and it was miserable. What made you give it up?"
acknowledging,The best I can do is incorporate humor into my speeches so that I feel like it's taking some weight off of me. But then there will be times where no one laughs at my jokes..,That seems like the best option. It is hard to stick to a diet for a set amount of time. The weight always seems to return.

sympathizing,"Nah, wasn't a surprise. We've been long distance for like six years. But she does have a lot of logic on her side.. She has a good job. But I feel like I'm closer with my family, and that the east coast is nicer to live near. I just don't really want to move, is all",I am sorry
questioning,Memories are always nice to have,was he hurt?
acknowledging,"Yeah, I'll do my best. Just don't want my anxiety to get in the way of being able to focus. Plus I'm just not wild about the idea of having to be on edge the entire 8 hours I'm driving. Hopefully the weather changes at some point during the drive",oh thats good
questioning,Yeah. It makes me surprised.,Oh no! Did you end up finding out who did it?
questioning,"I have been but it's feeling quite nervous about it, it's a huge test.",How come?
questioning,"Just stress from work and financial struggles, but I should of dealt with it in a different way.",Oh no! Your friends didn't offer to buy you a drink or something? I would if I wanted my friend to come

questioning,Amen!,What was her name?
sympathizing,Yes he works hard at his job and he lives in socks and shoes- so both are important.,"I am sorry, that is terrible"
sympathizing,Oh well that's just spoiling it for herself haha.,sorry to hear that. what age group
acknowledging,Lol- cats are picky- Here I have a bunch of animals so someone will always like it. She won't leave her cage though and stays curled around her puppy all day and the blankets I have weren't cutting it so she seems more comfortable now- She is in a cage because she feels safer- she was trying to bite other animals.,hah.. thats cool
questioning,My dogs are just not picky. And they never leave you alone lol! I do have one dog that chews any dog bed or blanket though :( Sigh- Lab mix! He is a handful and a half.,"That would be great.  They don't tell you in advance, you just have to find out when you get the check?"
acknowledging,i don't think so. My wife brought it from another country when she was travelling for work. i'll try to search for it online,That's good and bad I guess.  It would probably be nice to be able to plan on it.
acknowledging,"Right? I was late and I'm down 200 dollars, but at least I still have my job.","That is nice, the ones I use play the same songs over and over!"
agreeing,it is so much fun!,"I agree, and most of the music is older music, too."
questioning,"Yeah it was, He is turning out to be really athletic.  Must have gotten that from my wife's side, haha.","Oh no, that's so awful. Were you able to recover?"
encouraging,I am trying so,Yea. That would make me cautious as well. I hope nothing like that happens again to you.
questioning,"I did have that, and I was right",I'd be mad too! Do you have any idea who could have stolen it?
questioning,I hope so.,Don't go check! lol
questioning,I hung up lol it's a scam. IRS never calls they send mail. these people tried to threaten me :),Why?
agreeing,I don't know. I don't want to make problems for nothing. He is a very weird guy.,That is definitely a no- no
questioning,Partner is working hard at therapy most days but he isn't even close to being okay yet. I just don't know if I could ever trust him again.,oh wow! what did they get?
acknowledging,"A long time. Moldable plastic with no dangerous chemicals. It's quite interesting. It's not expensive to get a big bag of it. It is insanely expensive to get one tooth put in, so this should help her until then.",I would hate that
agreeing,$800 bucks a tooth...From a car accident- Car insurance...FULL coverage does not cover that...it's insane.,I would too
questioning,Thanks I sure did. It's about time!,oh thats sweet. is he paying for insurance too? :)
acknowledging,"I have it on my other screen, I'm ready! It should be really fun!",oh well.. at least you got some wheels.. beats taking the bus or walking
questioning,"Yeah, 4 years!",Why do you do that
acknowledging,I dont know. Never met the person. Its going to be hard to find another job like that one.,That is not too bad
agreeing,I am going all over Europe. The thought of being in a foreign countries for so long is kind of scary. Not sure if I should go.,I know that feeling
questioning,"I've been Horde all my life, but I might try Alliance this time.",awesome! What are you studying?

sympathizing,No it was a pickup game but the one who it the shot is playing college basketball. Hopefully he can get me some tickets,"I am so sorry to hear about your dog, did you rescue her?"
consoling,Oh absolutely! Weight lifting has amazing health benefits. Studies show that even starting at the age of 80 will improve overall well being by a lot!,jesus lord...I hope you kicked her out or left!
sympathizing,It's a huge confident booster too. The positives creep into all aspects of life.,She is a (fill in the blank) she cheated and betrayed you and your marriage...she would never win in court after cheating. I am so very sorry. There is nothing like being betrayed by someone you love

questioning,"Oh, I would never! I am just so beyond full with the same type! lol- And cats don't like to be packed in. I have seperate areas for my nice cats and mean cats and it's still a touchy balance! If I had a bigger house, I would help even more. They are so innocent! Our local AC doesn't do cats and I wouldn't want him pts anyway but I will always feed animals in need",Did you give him some food?
questioning,Me either- don't ever move to california..So many little dogs pts daily..I would become a total hoarder lol. It's just insanity! I am already there with lots of rescues in my little house. I want to do a farm rescue too- I feel fulfilled when I help innocent animals.,OH no! Did every one hear?
acknowledging,"Yeah, I hate messy places, I'm OCD and it drives me nuts",That's so bad lol

questioning,"I try my best, I really do love her.",oh thats good.. did you get to keep some pictures?

sympathizing,Its a Financial analyst position with a really great company.,"Oh I am sorry to hear that, but I am sure there might be an even better one out there for you."

I'm expecting a phone call while I'm relaxing in my lounge chair that my kids are begging me to pick them up!",Oh man doesn't that just make you want to take a car and run right..... Just kidding.. but yeah that would make my blood boil

questioning,Thanks. Im blown away. I never expected to hear from them again.,Well that's awful. Did you ask him why he didn't pick you?

questioning,"Well, he's 20 almost 21 now and I thought that as he grew older it would become automatic.  I don't want his potential wife to be frustrated by what should be automatic.",yes! are you going to a fancy restaurant ??
acknowledging,"i saw a shadow and was feeling uneasy, then i saw ears..turns out it was a cat. the old tenant would feed a stray, so he would come by at nights and thats how he alerted that he wanted food.i was relieved",that is not a good thing to wake up to hahah
questioning,"Exactly. Even though I was just a little younger, I didn't get to go, too.",Yes! was he a bad boss?
acknowledging,"Yes, but it was several years later.",Thats great

I'm a single mother, can't exactly physically intervene in this situation with the best of results. Don't have any family I can call to have them come around either. Can't exactly have the police on-call for something that hasn't happened yet. Don't know what t do!",oh man that's actually hilarious I hope he was a baby...?
acknowledging,"I agree, it really took me back.",yeah that's pretty scary and gross!

Sounds familiar to what has happened between me and a few...I was there for them but had enough and I have had to cuit them out too-"
questioning,"It's just a garnish, so it smells nice","That's always a weird situation. You're excited about the offer, and you're worried that if you turn it down that you might not be able to find anything else, or as good. But you also don't want to be tied down to a bad place. What were some of the red flags, if you don't mind me asking?"
suggesting,"Thanks! Yes, I think I did my best anyway.",That is tough. I would just make sure everything is nice and clean around the house so she can just unwind. Maybe make a nice dinner and do the dishes after.

questioning,"I forgot about it. Then I had to pay for not bringing it back on time. So I never brought it back. Now, I feel bad about it.",Can you have it repaired?
agreeing,"Yea, so do I. You'd think I'd get a lot done, but it's just so quiet.","Yes, I'm sure you'll be very nice to her."

Well, at least its a big deal to you because that means you're taking things seriously and concerned about your work."
questioning,true! it was just a little gross haha!,"Oh no, did people make you feel bad for the accident?"

So annoying!  Did they give you a reason?
questioning,"I am! I don't know how that thing ran away, but the mischievous little scamp always manages to do it.",Oh dang! That's always the worst isn't it
acknowledging,"I was indeed! He never does that and he is a straight A student. Needless to say, I've grounded him until he graduates in 4 years.","That's so exciting! It's almost over! But I can understand why it'd make you anxious, too."
questioning,I'm kind of afraid too!  I think its the aliens coming for me.,"Uh oh, did you try to play it off or did you have to ask your husband?"

questioning,"Yeah, be fully committed, communicate about everything & let petty things roll right off.",Oh no! What happened?

consoling,i got married,Hopefully it is just a sprain. Might not need to receive medical attention.
sympathizing,My dog is 10 years old. He has been pretty miserable with the ear infections and allergies. He just wants to sleep all the time.,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you called IT?

It's an odd memory to pop up. maybe because i've just seen a bunch of pet posts from my friends on fb.",That must be nice. You can focus more on enjoying yourself while away.

questioning,"Just with my career, relationships and family. I was a little lost there for awhile.","It did, what were we talking about again?"
acknowledging,He had helped his grandpa make me a planter box and had filled it with soil and seeds for different herbs.,I can understand that. I lost my dog a few years ago. What's worse is I wasn't around when it happened--I was out of the state. I hope you at least got to say goodbye.
suggesting,a big one. lol,"Who knows. They could have been like my mom, and maybe they were different and were too ashamed to say anything. Might not have noticed, either. Or they were just bad people. Hopefully you can focus on your pet and how much you loved them instead of those things you can't get answers to."

consoling,I don't know. I never answered it but it was a man and not in anykind of work uniform.,Well it seems that you have to deal with him for at least another year. With that in mind I hope you have more than one bathroom. I suggest you let him keep his poop in one without cleaning it up until it starts to bother him!
agreeing,job interview,"Dang, that sounds too good to be true. If you're 100% sure that it's not a scam, and then 100% sure again that it's definitely not a scam (please really really check in every way possible), then I'm happy for you!"
acknowledging,"Yeah, it wouldn't really phase me now but at the time it was a crisis haha","Whaaat! That was cool of them. If it were me, it'd be torture trying to figure out what to do. Put it into stocks? Savings? Pay off debt? Go on a vacation? I hate making decisions cause I feel like I messed up no matter what I choose. But maybe you deserve a vacation, eh"
