agreeing,"I may have let out a scream that will have him question my manhood for the rest of our lives, lol.",I would probably scream also.
acknowledging,Traveling to South Africa then to Ghana. Also my first time visiting Africa,Wow! That sounds amazing. Where are you going?
wishing,"yeah, he had just drank a bottle, and I was moving him around like an airplane. In retrospect. I deserved it.",You are going to love it I am sure. Safe Travels!

acknowledging,"That is so exciting, congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family, so having a great group of friends is really important to us.","Oh wow, I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon."
questioning,"Get involved in something. Church, a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups, for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people.

questioning,I called them and did not hold back.,Where is she?
agreeing,I was going to go down and go nuts but my wife stopped me.,Just give her space.
acknowledging,I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.,Thats great.
questioning,"Thanks, I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can, she's my world.",Did you teach her?
questioning,"Yes, until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there, and you start feeling old",Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!
acknowledging,"I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath, and realize its just things, and it was just me being reluctant to change.",That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat.
acknowledging,She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.,"Wow, 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends."

encouraging,I used diamond earrings.,"Haha thats crazy, I hope they became best friends, I love cats."
suggesting,I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!,Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.
questioning,"Nope, I've got a family now to support so I surf less and work more. But I've still got killer moves.",Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?
acknowledging,It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.,Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.
questioning,Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.,"Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So, how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?"
acknowledging,"I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon, it was inspirational!","Yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen."
wishing,"I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is, I don't even believe in the supernatural, so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it, I think.",Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.
questioning,"Nope. I am just scared that in case there is the supernatural. It makes sense in my head;however, when I am saying it out loud, it doesnt, lol","It sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?"
questioning,I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..,"That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at, or still looking?"
sympathizing,Thank you!  I really enjoy this position a lot so I am happy it turned out well.,I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.
wishing,Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.,She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!
acknowledging,That is a good idea! I'll have to sneak his work schedule and give it a try.,"I am very nostalgic too, that must be a fun time!"
acknowledging,I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.,"Yes, sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!"
suggesting,I recently went back to Michigan and got visit my old town and even the High school I had such great times back then.,Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!
questioning,"Well my dad too but my mum was so much more, even when I was naughty she was still there.","Is he a stay at home father, or does he just not want to work?"
suggesting,"I am, everytime I see a dog, I begin to run the other direction instantly",I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.
acknowledging,"No, it's not sad. I really like to be alone, as i'm an introvert. I need my space.","Must of been pretty surprised, Also great to have friends like that."
acknowledging,"Well in that case, I have a few friends. Outside of family, I don't.",That must of just made everything even better!
acknowledging,That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.,That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.

acknowledging,"I was so awkward and quiet in school, how about yourself?",Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.
questioning,"So you were outgoing and popular, huh?","Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations, which of course only makes it worse!"
questioning,"Thanks I'm stressed, excited and hopeful for the future. Do you have kids?","What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know, like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead, playing ""your"" song?"
questioning,Thank you. We have been trying for a year.,You should not be so insecure like that.
questioning,I couldn't believe it. Just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks.,What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?
questioning,"I made it out ok, just so irritating",Why. Did you started dating recently or something
agreeing,"It was great, felt refreshing to be around them",The most important thing is what you want.
questioning,"Yeah, it can get annoying at times. I just stir clear of him when he is around.",Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?

questioning,"It was very scary, i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?",I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?
acknowledging,yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it.,That's great for her.
questioning,"I think I'm average. I'm 5'11"" 190. It could be worse. I still exercise a lot. Perhaps I need to enjoy the ice cream more and try to feel less guilty.",hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?
questioning,Wow that's great you must enjoy helping others!,OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?
questioning,yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again.,That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?

acknowledging,"Yes, he was my hero and still is I guess.",Sounds like a good idea.
wishing,Being bothered by uninvited guests,That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.

questioning,"I didn't know her when she was young, so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable.",What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?
acknowledging,I wouldn't be surprised.,That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.
acknowledging,"yea, I had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them. I'm so sad!",My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.
questioning,"Yes, I was angry and sad.",That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?

agreeing,They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.,"Yes I do actually, I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once."

agreeing,"Yea, until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either.",wow yes it is
questioning,"Well congratulations for taking your time, look at it that way.",I hate it when that happens! were you ok?

acknowledging,"Yeah, he was fine, but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't, but I did.",Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.

wishing,About seven months. Too long.,"Congratulations! Studying can be hard, but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?"
sympathizing,"Yes, about a 17 hour drive.",Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!
acknowledging,I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.,Oh that sounds so scary!
wishing,yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/. My husband helped me out of the jam once I came clean about aht I did.,"Yes, it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!"
questioning,"Yes, I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.","Holy smokes! Let me guess, better for the environment?"

questioning,"Yes, my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.","Wow, did they notice?"
consoling,"Well, I most def want to be insightful and intelligent, so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about, but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing ""Along Came Polly"" sceneros in your head.",They will forget about it soon.
sympathizing,I think it is bad,I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?

encouraging,"Oh, it was a movie about a woman who lost her memory, and her husband had to get her to fall back in love with him. At the time, I was like I want that; however, now that I am in a relationship, I am like I don't know about this. I wish she would get amnesia as well",WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.

acknowledging,He read a tract to me. He explained God's love for me with pictures in a way I could understand.,I bet you drove fast.
acknowledging,That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors?,"Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it, I don't think."
questioning,"How fortunate, my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories.",Have you ever done anything else so frightening?
wishing,That's true. You can live in peace.,"I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me, I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!"

questioning,"Yeah, i close friend of mine likes doing that. she has to stop.",Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.
questioning,I am excited I bought a lottery ticket today and the jackpot is over 20 million,"Oh, I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?"
suggesting,"Yes, you never know I was talking to a co-worker today and she won $2500 last year at this time",I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.

acknowledging,why is that so?,"Oh well, it was nice to have someone to help you."
acknowledging,Yes it is but I always have a hard time getting off the couch to go to bed sometimes I just fall asleep on the couch.,Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.

suggesting,yea she finally decided to settle down so i think I can type good now.,Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.

questioning,"No, there weren't any bugs. But there was mold.",Why is that

questioning,"It has gotten a little better with time, but still a pretty sore spot for me.",That's exciting! I'm guessing you're a Lakers fan?
questioning,"Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company, no less. So everything worked out!",What team was he on before?

wishing,I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone,That is very true. I sincerely wish you both to have a wonderful time!
questioning,This is true! I also put an app on her phone to block things she's not old enough to use,I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have things of hers that remind you of her often?
acknowledging,Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.,That is beautiful that you have those things of hers. Mothers are very special people.
wishing,This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared,You seem to have a great taste in spending your free time. I wish you get to have a splendid time in there!

acknowledging,That's not a bad idea!,I bet! It seems like fun

agreeing,It's the most beautiful place you can move just no one here. Me and the animals.,Thats great. I know he appreciates it
encouraging,"Sales, so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.",That's great. I hope you do well!

questioning,A new school that's why I was kind of nervous and scared but she loved it.,That's nice. Are you going to hang it up?

questioning,Lol don't be let's just hope I can still say this in 3 months.,What did you mess up?
questioning,Nothing! My dog was just walking passed him!,I'm sure you'll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?

acknowledging,"Yes, a lot of people don't have basements, and that would be really bad. It's hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark, scary place, especially when the power is all out.","That is great! Adopt, don't shop! Always a great motto!"
acknowledging,yeah! The only thing that was hurt was my pride! I've never tried to check out so quickly!,"That is great, I commend you!"
questioning,"It is! I'm really excited for it! It's tonight, so it was also a big surprise!",Have you prepared enough for it?

questioning,She is in 5th grade.,Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!
suggesting,"We have been homeschooling. I'm having to go back to work now, so she's not too happy about it. I think she will be just fine that. She's well socialized",Maybe you should try and have a party?

wishing,I couldn't believe that no one let the cat out of the bag. It must have been hard to plan.,"You should have a great time, congrats on the new age!"
questioning,"No, I called the police but it's almost impossible to track. I had to chained to a steel post, but they cut the chain with bolt cutters I guess. I sure hate thieves.",I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?
consoling,I called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but I was so sicken and upset I said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite.,"If your depressed, speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change, that comes in time."

agreeing,"Ha, that's not a bad idea. I do need to have a word with him about it though at least.",I would be reporting that to the police for sure.
agreeing,I might give that a try. But whoever did it had probably better hope that I don't find out who they are!,Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane.
sympathizing,"Well nothing too serious, but I'd definitely have a word or two with them!",Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.
sympathizing,I get so worried about something happening to me.,I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.
questioning,More of a human with intent to harm type fear.,That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?
questioning,A little bit of both!  I didn't know he had these skills but it was really neat to watch!,"Aw man, that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?"
acknowledging,Not really... I'm the one that turned him in. And I'm scared that he might know about that.,That is amazingly lucky! good for you!
acknowledging,I think I will. It's been 7 years since my last treatment. I still get nervous when I have my checkups though.,That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!
consoling,"Nope, I've been waiting for a few days, and I could really use that money now.",Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he?
sympathizing,Yeah.... the smell was so bad. It took forever to get that off of my shoe.,Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :(

sympathizing,Oh yeah.  As soon as I heard the knock I flung the door open and snatched it in a hurry.,I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?
acknowledging,"He said he was busy with work, so I suppose so",That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.
acknowledging,"A few minutes after leaving, I was able to get it back",Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself.
acknowledging,"BMW, it was a model I had been looking to get myself",Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?
agreeing,"Yeah, it's a nice little souvenir to remind me of good times.  It was a great concert and experience for all of us.","Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?"
questioning,Yeah! Well I was in a parking garage so I went walking to try and find someone to borrow a pen from,Did it feel good to get it out?
questioning,"I did, this really nice woman just gave me a very fancy one. She told me to keep it!","Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?"

questioning,I sure do I have it on video and made a report with the police already.,"Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?"
encouraging,"I have tried everything, but they keep doing it even after paying huge fines.",I hope you all have some fun.
agreeing,"Thank you, The kids and I miss him terribly.","Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!"
acknowledging,"A nice man stopped, help me push my car to the shoulder and even had a can of gas he let me use in his trunk. Talk about a nice guy.","Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!"

questioning,"Not sure, but I really need this job to support my kids.",Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?

agreeing,"Yes, I swear there were 5 people sitting all around me that won several games.  It's just not fair.",I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!
questioning,An interview for a job.,Have you been a long time runner before that?
agreeing,"well i came back from work kind of sad because i thought nobody remembered my birthday and as soon as i went inside they screamed happy birthday , not gonna lie i got really happy.","I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!"
questioning,I realized I could walk very fast if I want to.,"Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?"
questioning,"I agree, although I don't really know if you can train yourself to be like that.","That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?"
acknowledging,"Yes, today it's just all about money and getting physical.","Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large."
questioning,"it did, so much nostalgia!",Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?

questioning,"He is only three, so it is pretty scary for him each time. I hate to see him that way.",You only get to do it once?
encouraging,"I have, but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely. Something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me.",Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.

questioning,Yes and I will it was great and her voice and the singers really moved me because even in person it was lovely.,Ohh wow! Are you excited?

questioning,She had it for 2 years. But I feel I must be honest with her.,"That's very creepy, did he say anything to you?"
agreeing,I am still shocked he planned a cruise for 7 days.,"Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all."
consoling,I have to look into that one never heard of it thanks.,Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!
questioning,Yes they are you can't be lonely with them they are just so warmhearted and loving always.,"I've never understood that, it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?"

agreeing,I wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the 15 mph minimum a child could have got hurt.,"Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat."
encouraging,I know it is I lost $100 and was actually on the way to pay my car insurance with that can't believe I was careless.,Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!
encouraging,"I'm not sure, it was just on the list.  I had a really hard time finding them.",Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it.
questioning,"I think it went well, apart from a few mistakes, hopefully I got the job.","What! First of all, are you alright?"
questioning,"Yeah, kids are super annoying to deal with, I've learned a lesson, ha!",That's great. Do they know?
encouraging,An awesome one! All my best friends were there and I got some pretty sweet gifts!,Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either

wishing,"I won them by sharing and liking a facebook page! Unfortunately, none of my friends could go and so I ended up staying home instead.",Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?
questioning,"They were tied to my name, so I couldn't even sell them. Oh well!","Oh geeze, I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?"
questioning,He went on disability.  He actually was my old roommate so I know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired.  It definitely doesnt look good for him though.,Have you tried to talk to your teacher?
questioning,"Agreed. I was anxious and scared to share, but I'm glad I did; they were really supportive and it's helped me a lot.",What school is this you are talking about?

This is also the reason why I think you should confide in a professional, it can really turn your life around and you deserve the best!",That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.
acknowledging,"That's a good idea, I just haven't found a nice looking one yet. It's really frustrating but I think I'll just get whatever I can at this point.","Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you, I have over $40,000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!"
acknowledging,"Thanks for the suggestions, I'm going to give them a shot!",I can understand that.
acknowledging,"I did. Not the best pictures because I was using my phone but still, it was really surprising.","You must love him very much, that's good."
acknowledging,Almost a year.  We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.,"that is really nice of you to do, not a lot of people help others like that anymore"

sympathizing,"Haha, the boxes are still being unpacked and probably will be for the next couple weeks.  I'm hoping we dont have to again for a while!","Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more, or who has better connections, and not actual merit. If you're good, I'm sure you will get recognized at some point."
encouraging,"Otakuthon 2018. It was so amazing, I ended up doing really great!","Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough."

agreeing,"Yes, it is great to see something you designed be put into a working model.",I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.
questioning,"yeah, but i wish it wasn't like this","sounds like you ate a delicious dessert, what did you eat?"
acknowledging,I think thats the plan.  After those were just slowly going to go from room to room until everything is done.  Not a huge rush and were both super happy...well I am.  I'm assuming she is too!,that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert
questioning,"yes, i just realised i have everything i ever wanted in my life",O? That's a brave and noble decision.

questioning,yup,Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?
acknowledging,"i know i should, but it's been very rough recently with work and all",Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem

agreeing,"i punched him, i was so mad and furious",I would not put up with it either

questioning,"Not too fast, it was still irritating though",What have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?

encouraging,"Thankfully he is. He's doing much better, but the thought still shakes me scared to this day.",Good for you! I bet you will do amazing. Best of luck!
agreeing,"It was, but it got scary at some point. Apparently people were trying to wake me up by shaking me and I would not get up.",i get that. i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday.
agreeing,"A couple people. Fewer as the years go by, unfortunately.",Me too! I'm stuck inside at work and hearing about how great it is out there.
encouraging,He quit the diet a while ago as recommended by his doctor. I was a little scared but I knew it was just side effects of a bad diet.,"Haha, same! Just one more hour for me. Hope you can enjoy it soon!"
consoling,"Yeah! I had a moment of realizing how lucky I am to be in the position I find myself in, and felt really thankful for my life and the people a part of it.","That is never a good thing, I hope they land on their feet"
questioning,Really lonesome. I missed her so much.,How did they do that?
acknowledging,"Just talking to more people in general. For example, at a convention I was volunteering at.","Oh, well that is a nice surprise though!"
questioning,"It's called Otakuthon. It celebrates Japanese culture, anime and videogames. I was with MSI and I was just so surprised with my improvement.","That is nasty, how do they get away with that?"
questioning,November of 2017. Almost a year ago.,How so?

suggesting,"Yes, they called my parents and I was sent home. I got spanked",I think lyft is better
acknowledging,"Yes, I was able to go visit my stepdaughter on the other side of the country. The sitter sent pictures occasionally, so I didn't spend my trip worrying.",I would hate that
questioning,"He got a remote control excavator, and had a lot of fun at his party.  It's crazy how fast he's growing up, though.",Where to?
sympathizing,"Yeah, there's a lot going on.  I ended up heading to work anyway.","oh, I am sorry to hear that, why did they move away?"
acknowledging,"No, I don't have to.  But there's plenty of work to do on our house!",They sounds very complicated
acknowledging,I don't have the motivation. I know the workouts I should be doing but also struggle with proper form a bit.,That is nice to have
acknowledging,Thanks for the advice!,having friends over is always nice!
encouraging,on bad days it is about a 6,i bet. hope you all have a fantastic time!
questioning,Yeah it was awesome! I was a little scared at first but within a few hours of arriving there it turned into a total blast!,How do you feel about that?
questioning,Yeah. Carbs like pasta and bread get me every time.,Are you guys in good relations?
questioning,"Yup. Even though I don't need to lose any weight, I want to be healthy and cheating on this diet makes me feel bad.",did it bring back a lot of old mermories?
questioning,"Yes, I got caught and had to walk back in shame!",That must of been weird. Who was it?
questioning,"Well I will find out tomorrow. I know better than that is what she told me, especially on Fridays, when we are the busiest.",Was it suppose to scare you?
acknowledging,I agree. I feel so bad and embarrassed about it. Even the doctor scolded me.,thats awesome

agreeing,I get to visit about once a year. I always wish that I knew who lived there now so I could see the inside of the house.,"Yes, don't let that stop you. Also pay attention to what you eat as well. It's even more important than the exercise portion."
agreeing,"I just got back my grade for my final for my class and I failed it. I studied real hard, but unfortunately it didn't seem to matter.",That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.
questioning,I'm going to have to at least try. Maybe they'll be understanding and let me attempt again.,What was it I wonder?

questioning,It really did but I would never do something to jeopardize my relationship.,"I like that philosophy. Here lately, has it been easier or harder to stay positive?"

acknowledging,"Yup, I was worried during the test too, but I am glad everything turned out okay",Wow! I bet you two are very excited!

agreeing,Yes you are right about that.  I dealt with it for a long time and then I just couldn't anymore.  Over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it.  He became violent at time to his sister and me and I couldn't put them at risk.,I know what you mean. Just believe in yourself
questioning,"she was joking about it, but she was so happy afterwards and we ate together, it was such a nice day",Is he being too noisy?

questioning,"yes! i am so glad you get it, it's beautiful but also sad at the same time",What subject are you trying to pass?
wishing,I left as fast as possible!,"I love math, good luck with your exams than."
questioning,"Nope, just you!",why were you acting like that?
questioning,no i was the one who was upset with him,Did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way?
agreeing,PROGRAMMING!,"I understand how that can make you feel a certain way. Unfortunately, there are those types of people around every corner."

sympathizing,I agree! We have alot of things to catch up on.,"I am so sorry, I hope your brother ended up being okay."
questioning,"Yes, it's true we all know this inside out, but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives, the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting, if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life, not one which just gives the impression of freedom, that's all there is now, faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings","Dang, that's not good. What did you end up doing??"
consoling,I don't remember the name. I was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart.,Oh wow. Did the police get called? I hope you didn't get in trouble.
questioning,what makes you so sure? anything can happen i mean just look at murphy's law,Yeah? What is changing?
questioning,She is getting much better. My family and I did everything we could to take care of her.,Brilliant. here are you going?
acknowledging,"no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it's hard for me to see her, but i will be able to see her after 6 months apart",That's so generous of you. The world could use more people like you.
questioning,"I actually gave more effort this semester, so I will continue to do goo and hope to get into nursing school next year.","Oh my, how did she react?"
questioning,I agree. Im planning and hopping things go well.,Ha! Do you feel bad about it?
questioning,Yea. I like to have things ready and done prior to make sure everything goes well.,It certainly can. What type of job are you looking for?
suggesting,Thanks! I think we are doing well so i wont be disappointed or sidetracked by a no from her.,Maybe they had lots of other candidates to see
agreeing,"no, i don't believe that, whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage, just like birth death is a process",I know that feeling. Something will come through though
questioning,"Not necessarily,  while it's true you have your traditional christian or Muslim that preach the afterlife as some miracle and hell, scaring people into not being themselves, but death isn't a scary phase, and i don't care about whether i am going to die, as that is just the ego trying to cling on and survive, i've passed that point, but after looking clearly you'll see there is more than just this dimension and that is just a simple fact, science tells us this too, it's not about feeling good or feeling comfortable with death, it's about growing",Yes! I feel like the day escaped me. Have you done that recently?
acknowledging,"RIGHT?! but now is just so bad, i wish i could go back","It is Friday, that would be a nice way to start the weekend!"

questioning,I'm super ready for it! I spent so much time studying over the last week.,Good job! Do you feel proud of yourself?
wishing,"there isn't any solution it's a century award i am working on, it's the problem of non-polynomial descent",Hard work always pays off! Keep it up.
questioning,I've just been getting things done. Nothing has been going amazing but nothing really sucks either.,What did you do?
acknowledging,It does. I put so much time in that game before. I might have to pick it up again.,Man! That's pretty bad.

questioning,I was!,oh wow. that is some scary stuff!! what happend?
questioning,"it really was its just so scary but I had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did.  I really admire anyone in that career, its not just a job but a vocation.",did they catch the person?

Up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time, i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  However after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out, it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!",Oh no! Did you scold him?
wishing,Yeah and its the last one before I graduate! I can be more thankful for his generosity.,Congrats to you!  What kind of nurse are you looking to be?
questioning,"Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those, especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.","That is awesome, what is his secret?"
sympathizing,I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol,Im sorry to hear that. Does she have a job now?

agreeing,"true but in time I finally did see that its not the end of the world, its just a car that can be replaced but that initial overwhelming feeling was awful.",She will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too.  I still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years.
sympathizing,Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks.,Im sorry about that. How did you find out?
questioning,"Me too, so i wouldn't have to deal with wasted time!",That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?
questioning,Yes it was. I cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!,Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?
acknowledging,Yes the things we remember and ponder about are the greatest!,That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.
agreeing,"I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him, even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward, I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!","I understand! As we get older, it's hard to do it all everyday!"
agreeing,Just as he does to us.,"It happens, but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you"
questioning,Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink,"Oh no, are you able to afford the repair for it?"

agreeing,Yes just a pity I had to learn the hard way.,"That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that, I'm cutting them up."
acknowledging,Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone.,That would have really scared me.
questioning,I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.,All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?

wishing,yeah but only i should get everything! no one else,congrats! you must be proud!

I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well, professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?"
agreeing,i've been with her for 10 years and she's wonderful mother and wife and always puts her family first,"I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building, communication, and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail."

questioning,He's better already but he got a real bad fever during that week,Oh no. What did you do?

questioning,Yes it is quite hard. But it has been my choice to move away. I guess one day I will return but not sure when.,It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.

questioning,One of the bully kids noticed the sweater around my waste on the warm day and knew something was up. He really tried to embarrass me.,Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?
questioning,"I can but they take forever to come and clean it up. I just talked to the guy who did it and he said he won't do it again. Spent  an hour cleaning it all up with a lot of clorox, alcohol, and soap.","Oh wow, so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too"

consoling,It's easier to maintain than people realize!,I hope you are okay.
acknowledging,"Yeah im alright, i was far enough to steer clear of the chaos. The guy that flipped had to get carried by ambulance, but he didn't look very injured. and the other guy was ok.",That is so messed up!
consoling,My heart is broken and I can't stop crying. I feel so helpless that I could not save her.,I hope this doesn't happen again.
questioning,"No, she forgot.  Which, unfortunately, is typical!","Oh my, what did you do, may I ask?"

encouraging,It's a beautiful 2018 yellow jeep! The car of my dreams! So stoked!,I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.
consoling,I think it is a love bird. She thinks I am the mother and it is so cool when she walks all over me and comes when I call her. I have never had a pet bird before.,That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more.
agreeing,"Ok, I will make one for you. :)","I agree, just remember her for all the good memories."
questioning,Yes I think so. That probably could have killed me. But I guess it was not my time. I angels saved me.,Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?
encouraging,Actually I have no food and I am starving. Maybe I should order a pizza. But then the delivery guy will have the same problem.,What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety.
questioning,i was on the verge of something more serious and probably would have regret it,That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?
agreeing,Yes but I think I could have avoided it. I am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats. I hope it doesn't happen again.,I understand. The best thing is to move.
acknowledging,I did end up taking him in. Luckily it wasnt too serious and he was fine a couple days later.  He looked so sad with his big lip!,You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be
questioning,that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with,whats preventing you?

questioning,"Yeah, it is so much fun to live with animals. :)",That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?

acknowledging,"Not today. I just feel insecure about it, like everyone is looking at me. It is probably just all in my head.",How exciting! She must be thrilled too
encouraging,"Oh, yes! Fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat.",I hope you guys have the best time!
questioning,"i know that what makes it harder not having her around, no companionship",That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?
questioning,"Haha, I hope not...my current girlfriend would probably be a little upset! She's a nice person (the one from high school) but I dont think I could ever marry her","Haha, nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is."
acknowledging,"Yes, I have so many ideas! How cool it would be to not have to buy any more expensive clothes and make my own!",Sounds like the best course to me :)
acknowledging,Thank you! I have so many fun games planned and lots of great food.,That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good.

questioning,I did!  It is by far the coolest thing I have ever bought!,Did it taste good?
questioning,"yeah, I have it plugged into my computer.  I cant tell you, or even begin to explain, how real everything feels when you use it.",Did it taste good?
questioning,"It was $400, having a computer that can run it is the expensive piece",Were you suprised that they did this for you?
acknowledging,Yeah.  He kept up with me pretty well.,Wow! How happy you must be. I be that day brought you lost of excitement.
questioning,"Yeah, I also remember having my strawberry shortcake themed birthday party. There were strawberries everywhere! I bet you could guess what flavor the cake and ice cream were, lol.","oh so sad , what happened to it"
acknowledging,"that is the problem, he does nothing, except give me his little mustache smile, one of these days i'll wipe that smile off his face",it must must a very much hard time for you and your family
questioning,"Luckily, my wife was willing to keep them busy.  Even after she had a crazy day!",Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.
acknowledging,"It was for a while, but it was too quiet for me!  I've gotten used to the noise.",Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.
sympathizing,"No, they ended up giving it to someone with less experience.","Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family."
suggesting,"Nope, I'm a little careful when I go out there.  It would have been nice to join in on the winning though!",You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family.
questioning,Probably next week sometime. I'm really excited!,That's disgusting. What did you do about it?
questioning,yeah! I pretty much knew all the steps that I needed to do before everything started and there werent any surprise issues which was awesome.,Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!
acknowledging,"i knew she could and would get the promotion, i feel like i am going to burst",That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.
encouraging,It definitely does!  I have one older puppy that I got through potty training.  This one is just taking a little extra time.,Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.
wishing,It really was! The toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!,Wow good job! SO close
suggesting,I made a deal that if he went to bed he would get tablet time the next day and if he didnt then he wouldnt get any time,maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group
agreeing,"Sorry about that! Yeah, it was a terrible thing to wake up to!",i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump
wishing,Well when he was during the potty training stage he would often poop on the floor.   HOwever he would then eat it!!!!!   I could smell it but not find it anywhere.   He would come running into the living room wanting to lick you on the face with poop breath!,that should be fun. good luck!
questioning,"i always wanted to visit Miami, i can't wait to visit the beach and take in all  the fun",Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?
questioning,"In 2 weeks.  It'll come up fast, I think thats why I'm starting to get a little more nervous.  Its not even her, its just the move that will not be fun",Did he take care of it for you?
acknowledging,It is!  The guy at the city could care less if he helps us out.,That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud.
questioning,It was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me.  I dont know if you've ever tried VR but everything feels SO real.  It was pretty scary,"That's awesome, what does your hubster do?"
agreeing,"Well, he's got another interview on Thursday. I just know he will get that one!","Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature, it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated"
questioning,"She was trying to cross the road and accidentally had her phone fall, the officer thought she was insane","Oh no, do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?"

questioning,"It was a short enough walk, I just stayed aware of my surroundings and got home safe.",Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?
acknowledging,I think I had a good childhood. I love that I have many photos that I ca look back on.,"Man, you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!"
sympathizing,"I sure did. I am just embarrassed that I did that, I am not usually that way. It was out of character for me.",So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity
agreeing,Yes - this is m child's first year and it was pretty difficult for me to let someone take care of him instead of me. You know how it is! Parent life.,"oh man... It happened to me before, i know how embarrassing it is."
questioning,Yes!  I'm already enjoying it!  How are you doing?,That's great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?
acknowledging,"Well, I was parked pretty close and a guy came up to ask me for gas money!  There was a gas station a small walk away though!",Well at least he passed - that's great!
acknowledging,I didn't have any cash on me.  He got out of a vehicle that had two other guys in it...staring at me!,That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.
sympathizing,Oh it did.  I learned my lesson.,I'm really sorry to hear that.
encouraging,"I eventually made friends through work, and it is really nice when my old friends come to visit too",that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?
wishing,A pair of shoe,You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig

questioning,Oh he did!  I think the one about candy cane and the truck driver was my favorite. I can't remember the name.,Oh no! Did he say anything about it?
agreeing,Yes!  They are so sweet. I don't even like kids and I really felt my heart warm up to them.,"I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly, don't you!"
questioning,"It didn't happen to me directly, but my husband passed GAS while we were shopping. Everyone was staring.",Awesome! What are you planning on buying?
suggesting,"She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean, I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!",Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!

questioning,Yes. I have all my binders ready with paper and a calendar to keep track of stuff.  I'm nervous but ready!,i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?
agreeing,I hope so!  It's very different from undergraduate,agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.
questioning,Me too.,How exciting for you! Have fun!
questioning,It didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and I was home alone with a killer outside the house.  It all just feels so real in VR too.,You have a test coming up?
wishing,"i hope so, i was doing so well on my diet but I feel like I failed",Well I hope you do well! Good luck.
questioning,It is pretty awesome!  I'm impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority.,That's interesting. What was she doing?
acknowledging,"Thanks, we are.  He did finally go #2 in the toilet by himself last night, though!",That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business.
acknowledging,"Haha, I dont think I could do that to my girlfriend.  I like her too much for a random chick.",Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.
consoling,i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others,I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it
suggesting,Thank you for your great advice my friend!,That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.
questioning,I know right?  I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing.,Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?

questioning,Totally agree! But I will be there to fan my sister for her at least. Haha,Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?
questioning,I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.,Where are you located ?
questioning,It's strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this.  I know I really shouldn't but it feels like a piece of me is gone.,Who did what?

questioning,I write up feedback for development. It just gets frustrating when they start to demand that I fix it.  I might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly.,Oh no! Why not?!
questioning,It wasn't bad.  It wasn't earth shattering good either.  Everything just weirdly seemed okay.  It was a bit strange.,Never know who was?
acknowledging,"That must be nice . . . I'm in person.  However, I actually had a productive meeting this morning.  How novel that was!",Wow that is aweful!
questioning,I had to bolt out of the store!  I have never been so embarrassed.  Lucky for me I had a napkin in my purse so I didn't get it everywhere.,"Oh wow, what happened?"

questioning,"He won like $40,000. He is a good man to give it all away to a good cause.","Great, when will you know your scores?"

questioning,I know it is not healthy for the body to get so stressed out but I just can't help it. Maybe I need a therapist.,Who doesn't?
agreeing,"Yeah, I feel really bad though. It is such a terrible feeling to be rejected like that.",What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!
questioning,It turned out fine in the end. I knew the doctor would do what he thought was best - and my son did get better!,That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?
acknowledging,We are driving to Florida to visit family. It will be a long drive but that's a part of the fun.,Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.
consoling,"You bet I am! I told him I was driving my car whenever we go out because I don't want to see it,lol.","Oh no, how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!)."
questioning,"I do too, I just wish I had her life at times.","Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?"
acknowledging,I wasn't too sure about it but all the lovely compliments really made me feel good!,Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.
questioning,"I will be at work, maybe next time",Do they run them all day long - or at night?
questioning,she is 9,"Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is."
questioning,yes definitely!,What happened?
consoling,"No, I hate giving chemical medicine to my animals. I just kept her on a heating blanket and gave her lots of fresh veggies. She is alright now!","oh that sucks, i hope it has healed since then"
acknowledging,It took about a month. I think it was quicker but I was just too nervous to bring him around others dogs to find out.,"ouch, that sounds awful"

questioning,"Yeah, I wish someone told me at least. They all probably just laughed. Haha",Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?
acknowledging,I took mine last summer I was nervous also. My heat was racing the whole time. I was so anxious!,"thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them"

acknowledging,Thank you! I have worked so hard for so many years and finally it shows that someone paid attention. :),That's always a great start to a day.
questioning,I am but I still think about how things could've been so much different right now if I hadn't swerved just at the right moment.,How are you celebrating it?
questioning,as a supervisor. I feel that all of my hard work and skill has given me the inside track for this position,Oh wow. What's the exam on?
questioning,"Yes, she didn't even get mad. I still felt so guilty about it though.","Oh no, what happened?"
consoling,Honestly that is such a wonderful idea!,Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.
wishing,Oh yes. He is there within all of us and he is the greatest friend we will ever have! He will never let us down. Even when we think He has we should only think it is something that I need to learn and He is so caring that He wants to teach me.,Congratulations! Retail really does suck.
agreeing,"Yeah, so you remember all those wonderful old Christmas movies and all those commercials they played in between. I still have some videos of recordings from the 80's.",Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.
questioning,"It was as big as a small bird, I was super surprised. It was furry and white all over. I caught it with a cup and let it outside so it can live on!","Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?"
questioning,Yes! I just went to the local nursery and they had so many plants to choose from. I made sure to only choose the ones that had some kind of fragrant smell. I am dreaming of all the flower arrangements I will make next year.,That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?

encouraging,"Exactly, especially since we were only dating for a few months! I felt so awkward but she just laughed it off.",I hope he doesn't let you down.
questioning,Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything.,Something good happen to him recently?
wishing,"No better I just put some screen on my windows, lol.",That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.
encouraging,That's so funny! I was so surprised too but really happy. I might even pay for the services when my free year is up.,Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.
questioning,The vet says that this can be normal but to make sure that I give them their worm pills regularly.,That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?
acknowledging,Yeah! I learned my lesson from experience. We get pretty crazy storms out here.,I bet. I would've hid under the table.
questioning,"I am not nervous yet but I for sure will be when it's time to jump out of that plane! Oh, what am I getting myself into, lol.",That's nice. Why do you say that?
acknowledging,"Yes, they demanded to know where we got the money to buy all that candy. We lied and said it was from a birthday party at school. Haha",That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.

questioning,I felt super prepared and I ended up getting the job just last Thursday!,I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?

agreeing,Thank you for appreciating teachers!,"Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there."

questioning,"No, it was some person driving recklessly!","Oh man! I have been there, I hope you didn't have anything special down there??"

questioning,"i had an assignment to submit but i didn't submit it on time, i am so disappointed in myself",oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?
acknowledging,because  i am a very faithful person and i trust in my god!,yea you never like to see stuff like that.
questioning,"i hope i won't get lost but i'm so bad with that, i always get lost.",did you try to find its owner?
acknowledging,"no, i just came up with this philosophy while facing an existential dilemma",well that was nice of someone
questioning,"No, i study it in my free time","That's annoying, are you going to talk to them about it?"

questioning,"it was actually, and because of the traffic i couldn't make it",What is the appointment for?
acknowledging,"for me it's when you get more than just nostalgia, when you get sad, happy and sentimental",You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.

acknowledging,yup i am !  so so confident and i think this is a good trait to have,"that is so lucky, they must be so happy they bought that ticket"
acknowledging,"no, i am angry! imagine every morning you wake and someone in your family takes your shoes because they want to make you angry",i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha
questioning,"like i said to  make me angry, they are selfish and jealous",What kind of test is it
encouraging,"yup, many memories from the past, the good, the bad",Oh I hope you do well then
questioning,"maybe, but i also need a plan because if i continue like this, i won't get anywhere for reals",yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say
questioning,"no, i don't like people, they make me lose more hope in the plane","that is really nice of him, how much time will you have to wait?"
encouraging,"god knows what was in that pizza, but i helped clean and the mess was still showing, but he said it wasn't a problem",well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction
acknowledging,"it seperates the ascii values of each character and adds them up to give a number, then it divides  them by their length and then it does something else which i will keep a secret :P",I bet that was a wonderful day
questioning,family should always come first.,"that is not good, have you expressed your feelings to your boss?"
consoling,"i am really hoping i can make some good friends, and just learn about everything i don't know a lot about you know?","well i hope everything goes well for you, you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry"
questioning,i'm angry because my mom and my sister had a fight and they aren't talking together. that made me very mad.,"It's a whole new world when that happens, I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?"
suggesting,Exactly!  I always feel there's less chance of embarrassment if you're the best in the room.,It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.
questioning,"well, we are going to turkey! i've heard some good things about that country i'm very excited","Oh no, that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?"
acknowledging,"isn't it? i don't see negative things in life, i try to always look at the bright side.",May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.
questioning,he couldn't keep his promise with me. he said he was going to get me pepsi max but he didn't and that made me sad.,what is that?
acknowledging,"i didn't, but no one was home and i had to clean that up :(",oh that explains it!
acknowledging,i am going to see my fiance who lives in adifferent country,"That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way, after all."
acknowledging,candaa,Oh god. That's kinda gross.
wishing,the website says yes! but my friends say they don't know if that's accurate so i think i need to double check once i am there,Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.
questioning,"well , i consider him my brother, i don't know if he thinks the same, we grew up together.",Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?
sympathizing,it sure is! i used genetic algorithm as well as k-means and neural netwroking,That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!

acknowledging,and seeing her reaching her goals and growing so much makes me so happy.,That would have been awesome if you got it.
acknowledging,I live in Colorado with the mountains and fresh air with so many wonderful outdoor activities available.,That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.
suggesting,It is great any time of the year. There are so many cool things to do even in the snowy winters.,"Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help."
questioning,That is for sure! I just wish other countries were the same. There are so many people suffering all over the world.,What did they do to you?
suggesting,From my house and from a few local stores. I am not ready to make it any bigger than that.,It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.
agreeing,"No, I think somebody wants something... I am just waiting to hear it, lol.",I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once!
questioning,"Yes, when I am in nature. :) But when I come to the big cities I feel like it is the devils playgrounds",Do you hike very often?
acknowledging,I just seem to forget until I get home. Oh well I will just have to give her some money again instead. Oh she is going to be angry.,"Oh, such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!"
sympathizing,"i did not find out untill i got home, the store is kind of far and I think I'm going to keep it, but it's eating on my conscious because of that",So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.
wishing,That is a good idea. It is such good deal and I think it would not need much money to fix it up. But a ghost in the house is definitely a deal breaker!,May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.
agreeing,"Yeah, I know. But in the moment it is hard. I guess I am just a very emotional person. Maybe I need theraoy, lol.",That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.

questioning,Incredibly so. It brought back so many great memories from the times we played on the Xbox 360.,Do you exercise often?

acknowledging,"Thanks! For the first time in a long time, the future isn't looking so dark.","I've never been, but it looks like so much fun."
acknowledging,Just my pride. My boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying.,It would be so much fun to go there as a family.
agreeing,"I have to pass twice a day too. Oh well, I should just be grateful for what I have now. I just can't help that feeling from creeping in though. Maybe I will buy a lottery ticket, lol.","Oh yeah I am right there with you, I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2"
questioning,Nah we were having a barbecue outdoors.,what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread
suggesting,"That sounds awful, all schools need a budget for activities for the students. Anyways I had no replacement shirt and I had to rinse it out and wear it for the rest of the day; I felt sick.",or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks

encouraging,"Yup. The poster files are free, you just have to get them printed somewhere. They have a few different themes. I got Europa, Trappist-1e, Mars Explorers Wanted and ""We Need You""","Oh wow, she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you, but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her."
acknowledging,Sweet! I hope you like them as much as I do!,"Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!"
acknowledging,"It ran off somewhere and I couldn't find it, even though I moved most of my furniture. I'm a little scared.",That is a good feeling!
questioning,"It barely did at night, but for the few days we went camping it was nice weather! I'm so thankful that it didn't, because we made a lot of nice memories during our trip.",Nice! No kids at home?
questioning,"i know, i am trying to cope but the emptiness is unbearable",Are you afraid of the dentist?
sympathizing,"I like to think so, thanks! Unfortunately, the cat wanted barely anything to do with me and I felt so isolated.","I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine."
acknowledging,"I have, she said I'm okay because I still have a healthy weight. I've been a skinny boy all my life, and I still am but this extra chub has me feeling down.",Oh nice! That's super brave of you.
acknowledging,"In a way yes, but not really. As soon as anyone ENTERS the house, he turns into a huge lovable pup and wants them to pet him. He's such a nuisance but I love him.",That's a great skill to have!
acknowledging,A Brittany Spaniel.,That must have been a nice feeling.
questioning,"I will, but just the thought of it makes me blue","Haha, sounds like my pupper, is she still young?"
questioning,It's an online teaching position and I feel so good about myself.,"Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff."
questioning,"No, but I felt like a jerk when I gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened.",Why he is working late?
questioning,"Hmm maybe Robo Recall, a game about fighting robots. Otherwise I have to find out what games are available!",I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?
acknowledging,"Yep, exactly. I also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike, I was totally terrified of wiping out. So I took it slow.",Aww man that sucks for you
encouraging,"Absolutely! And now that I know it better, I won't be so scared. I'm heading back out there Tuesday, can't wait!",Hopefully! It is your dream car after all
questioning,"Otakuthon 2018. It's about anime, Japanese culture and videogames. I was volunteering for the MSI booth (a PC-Gaming company).",That should be fun. Any big planes?
acknowledging,"That's a shame. Anyways, I haven't made any friends in well over a year because I'm awful in social situations.",That will be nice to catch up.
questioning,"Pretty good. The hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall, but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other.",That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!
acknowledging,She's very trustworthy and I knew she wouldn't steal from me. It was also something she needed and didn't have the money to get it yet.,"I wonder what could have changed? Either way, I'd be pretty pissed off."
acknowledging,Thanks for the compliment! But she's also a great younger sibling!,Oh no! That is terrible!
agreeing,"It really is. I felt so bad about my actions, but it hasn't stopped me from doing it at least one other time.",I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!
questioning,My parents never saw the importance I guess.,How do you feel these days?
questioning,"They did, but I was always too scared and not confident enough in myself. I thought I would fall and really hurt myself.","It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?"
questioning,I almost did. It was hard holding the tears back.,Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?
