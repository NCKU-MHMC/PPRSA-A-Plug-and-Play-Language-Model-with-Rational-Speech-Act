"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	oh my god that sounds so scary ! how old were they ?"
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	i am sorry to hear that . . it sounds like you had a good life though . . i am sure your friends understand what i mean"
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	well the first time i was in school , i had no idea what that was , but when i turned 18 i - 20 was able to buy my first car ."
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	it was an argument he had with me while he was driving he was on a night time and i had to call the police and report it to the police . he was so drunk he almost hit me when he was texting and driving . i rapid decided to go home and seek help instead of sitting home ."
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	im sorry to hear that . that must be lonely . maybe you can find a new hobby to do your job ?"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	i am sure you will be fine . i believe in you ! ! !"
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	what concert is it ? ! ? ! ? i wish i could be able to go day has gotten too long and i ' m not looking forward to it !"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	u2 is a very expensive music band , i ' m surprised they were able to go so cheap !"
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	oh no , i think i ' ve seen that . i ' m sorry , that ' s not something i can even watch netflix or find news on ."
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	i read an interesting story where an intuition died of cancer when she was early enough to be an adult and then turned out to be a bat - still pretty sad ."
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	awis the baby okay ? i think that is a good thing"
"i was singing nursery songs :)	that is so sweet ! how was it singing ? did you get the message across ?"
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	how can you and your husband afford to lose a job ?"
"thank you so much!	you ' re welcome , it ' s so nice to have unexpected news like that in the mail ."
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	oh that is interesting . did you give it a good name ?"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	well you are being kind of paranoid here . are you sure he won ' t come into your house at night and try to get you ?"
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	wow ! that ' s really exciting ! how are you going to visit them ?"
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	wow , that ' s really exciting ! that ' s awesome you moved far away ! are you happy to visit them ?"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	wow ! i hope he didnt get in trouble . you should let him know you didn ' t win and you should talk to him about it"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	wow , that is really rude that you have to deal with all that . you should never lie to your co workers , and if you ' re going to tell the truth you should at least take it constructively . otherwise , it may just leave you with an awkward look on your partner ."
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	oh , man , what a bummer . you could have spent that on something else ."
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	oh wow ! you called that bad luck ! sorry about that , hope it is the b . b . tv"
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	i see , what did he do ? was he a jerk ?"
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	wow that ' s so strong of you . that ' s such a strong friend you have !"
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	have you talked to the baby yet ? how old is he ?"
"i totally agree with you!	where you have kids that you can share your life with ?"
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	aw . that must be hard . why do you feel lonely ?"
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	oh that is a sad situation . did you try joining an online group ?"
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	wow . i hate it when someone does that to me . it makes me want to get out of the house ."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	you ' re right , i feel as if the worse we do to our children , the more we do to our parents , the worse it will treat them . it ' s not about being nice to them or showing them compassion or keeping up with their lies , it ' s about getting them to behave properly ."
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	how weird how short and tall you must have been ! did you try to feed it back ?"
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	oh man , that must be very interesting ! what happened ?"
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	what ended well ? what happened ? sounds like you guys have a good communication ."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	wow , good for you ! i can imagine it was such a special moment in your life . you must have been so proud of him !"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	you hit the same feeling i have now , it is a great feeling"
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	oh ! i thought so , what happened ? did someone give you a lot of money ?"
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	so many bad situations when i was in it . . . . you ever get to know the person ?"
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	what happened ? what happened ? how are you doing today ?"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	im so glad your friend is feeling better , what was the event ?"
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	lol that is quite interesting . . thank you , how do you feel ?"
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	that ' s so amazing ! i ' m glad you enjoyed it . that is very interesting and wisdom . i ' ve never heard of someone giving advice like that before , where to go into a flow , and where to go with it . that ' s so inspiring ."
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	what was the occasion ? sounds like a fun and joyful time !"
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	how exciting ! i bet you got some cool memories ? what did you study for ?"
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	it ' s normal , it ' s not something you see everyday . try to make friends with some of your loved ones and go see whats going on"
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	they dont understand that you are not lonely ! people dont even think about you ! if you are happy you should try to keep your feelings to yourself and not pretend like you are not lonely !"
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	aw thats so sweet ! i loved that until my daughter turned 18 !"
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	actually i ' ve read a lot of guit$ , interesting"
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	what did you buy ? a burger ? an french fries ?"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	yeah i know what you mean . . . sometimes i can ' t sleep at all because of that lol . i think i need a morning job"
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	you sound like an excited and excited mother ! what were your parents like ?"
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	why it was surreal ? that sounds like a wonderful visit . i really hope you continue to treat the kids better and make them learn how to be happy ! they will always love you , whether that means having a good support system or not ."
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	areo is she an all girls or are you taking her in first class ?"
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	i ' m not really sure . my mom was always teaching her to do that and i guess she had to . but i ' m the mom and i ' m pretty old ."
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	do you not look back on it anymore ? what happened ?"
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	oh wow , why didn ' t you join the club ?"
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	how sad ! i am so sorry ! i only get about half of my tears in tears when access to facebook . you must have been strong in every single one of them !"
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	nice job ! is it an a career coming out of the bank ?"
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	i ' m happy to welcome you with my investment , as i am as well ! what do you plan on doing for yourself ?"
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	i feel i am pretty much happy that i am in the military , we meet once a year at the beach ."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	why is that ? it must be because of the baby ?"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	do they live close to you ? i hope they like the baby so that you guys can stay close"
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	wow , that ' s awesome . i keep i ' m one of the early racerookers . what distance ?"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	dang , what a sweet gig . . . what are you doing this next weekend ?"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	that sounds like so much fun ! what a wonderful vacation you must have had ."
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	how cool ! what did you say ? how did you feel ?"
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	oh wow , that ' s interesting . is she going to return ?"
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	me too , i am very envious of bullying ."
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	i agree . i think parents should be able to bring their kids to a school board and teach them about why and how to be responsible . but we have to get way too deep in the schools and kids in schools to listen to their parents ."
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	oh , i ' m so sorry to hear that ! that is so sad ."
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	what the . you are such a wonderful person . i am so sorry to hear about the cat . what breed ?"
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	i bet that was so exciting ! what part of the place were you going ?"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	oh that sounds awesome , i actually just moved to disnehuo from tucson , and loved it ! i ' m sure tucson is beautiful , i haven ' t been to tucson in ages ."
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	did he visit you often ? i remember when i saw my parents for the first time when i was little"
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	my father used to drive big cars and work in the morning ."
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	i do like to sort things when i have time though ."
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	i am very organized but not as much as i could have been . . i have kids and i just moved recently"
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	yeah i feel did you pick that guy too ? have you heard from him yet ?"
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	agreed , i actually prefer email too . do you write yours off all the time ?"
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	are you happy to visit soon ? do you want to ?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	that is frustrating , because when people have an argument going on over nothing , it can leave you with little end results . what happened ?"
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	oh i ' m sorry you were lonely . how long were you away for ?"
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	wow , that sounds awesome ! must be really cool to go through that ! where did you guys move ?"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	i agree . . it is however sad when one seems to have lost everything in a nostalgic situation ."
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	oh yeah , i think it ' s important to appreciate who you are and who you are not and appreciate that your valid claim doesn ' t have to be based on what you can do or can ' t do , it has to be based off what you can afford . but yes , i appreciate the meek emotion in that - - people get too confident and get too excited about things when it is not the real obviously worrisome thing"
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	i ' m sure it felt bad for you . but sometimes hard to letting go of such words with just ones girlfriend . i hope your mom knows that you are trying to be as trustworthy as possible and not take it to the eeveecal and shallow to say so ."
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	it ' s ok , my husband was busy too , he ' s quite responsible"
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	beautiful , did you tell him how you felt ? im sure you are very proud of him ."
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	that was very nice of her ! you must be a very beautiful man to have your wife stare you down so completely ."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	hello how are you today ? i hope i understand . . ."
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	you know what they say , the people in your life are always in the wrong situation ."
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	i can imagine it ' s bittersweet , but also a wonderful feeling for sure . i just love to look at them ."
"Are your kids adults now?	yes . they are adults now . they are 10 and 12 now ."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	good for you . i am sure you look great ! i am sure if you took your makeup off you would have been all right !"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	oh my gosh i completely know the feeling ! it ' s not too hard to practice and just start trying ! we all have those moments when we ' re nervous but you never know if someone will notice ! i ' m sure you have a beautiful face !"
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	wow , that ' s very generous . that is certainly a blessing . how do you trust him ?"
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	it ' s a pretty big worry for anyone who is struggling , are you kidding me ?"
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	how whats that mean ? what happened ? was it something you knew , or just that you would not go ?"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	what an amazing story . what a beautiful human being you are ! you are very lucky to have met at such a wonderful place ."
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	nice ! first part of reading french ? i ' m not familiar with that one ."
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	oh that ' s nice . where are you going ? i wish i was on a plane to florida !"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	are you trying to go to dary- where are you going ?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	have you gone out on brunch with your friend before ? i know it isn ' t easy to do ."
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	what did you do ? did you tell him how you felt ?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	oh no . . what happened after ? did the guy just come back ?"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	oh , no , i ' m sorry . i haven ' t heard about you , though . you just made me recall and i ' m curious ?"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	oh wow , so what happened to her ? i hope she ' s alright . and li doesn ' t know you ? ! that ' s not good"
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	how so what did happen ? did something happen on purpose ?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	lol ! as long as you are not drinking your should be fine . i don ' t know why i am so irresponsible when it comes to drinking ."
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	no ! who was there ? what happened ? ! ? ! ?"
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	did it rain again ? maybe it should have been tomorrow , i am sorry"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	was it someone you knew ? that ' s pretty scary . ."
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	i going to have to guess far enough ahead of me ! tell me where you were when you came home from ny ?"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	oh wow . you have a big heart ! do you think he will ask you ?"
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	wow that is so sweet . you sound so lucky to have a husband like that ."
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	never have to count them lol , but congratulations on taking the risk !"
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	congratulations ! that ' s quite the project ! how much do you have freelance work on it ?"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	never suprised i must ask . how did that make you feel ?"
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	oh no ! why did you have to tell me about your life ?"
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	that is really weird . did your friend react the way you were ?"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	wow that ' s shocking ! how old are you now ?"
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	are you on a vacation now ? maybe you can go look for food there !"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	wow that sucks . i hate ugh fridays like that . im sorry . it happens to the best of us . what i am thinking may be the problem is when the cards are declined and someone comes out . its the worst ever when it happens"
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	i understand that you felt pretty bad . have you talked to your friend about it ?"
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	why didn ' t you tell her ? i don ' t see how she can be responsible for her partner if she isn ' t working"
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	i know how you feel , that is pretty funny though !"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	i know how you feel , my mom got me into some new watching shows when i was in 1st grade . i cried for a whole week ."
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	sounds like fun ! where are you headed to go ? and where are you going to go on vacation ?"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	nice ! i am in florida right now . i hope i can go when i have vacation ! i love the water !"
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	wow that ' s great ! i have a son that ' s starting off on his first monday of the year now and it ' s the same time period . makes me feel happy to hear about his success ."
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	oh yes , i remember that . good for her ! there are plenty of little timezones in life that people can go through and it ' s still really rewarding ."
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	i hate that too ! i am not a fan of the left carts left everywhere kind of gal"
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	oh lord , i do that too ! the feeling just goes to my level , i hate being left in the car with the cashiers , i get it why they do it , but ugh !"
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	how did it make you feel ? that must have been a special moment"

"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	are you a first time saver ? i have never heard of itan ' s farm house ."
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	i haven ' t done any of those things before . i don ' t really know them all that well , but i love giving advice from people who tend to be complicated and asks a lot of questions ."
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	absolutely ! it is an important feature of his working class husband . he serves the people and his crew , not the other way around !"
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	i agree with you , especially when they have no choice ."
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	that is so exciting i love belugas as well ! what was the named ?"
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	oh wow ! that must have been so special ! i remember the condolences to the babies ! what a great movie !"
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	that oh yes ! did you tell her what you got ?"

"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	i ' m not sure . i ' m just worried about my parents letting me down . they the stress of having to pay for my classes and all that . i don ' t think he ' s a good young adult ."
"Did they give you any feedback?	i ' m not sure . my grades went wrong , but i didn ' t do well . it was a fun course , though sweat fit me a bit ."
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	i feedback was , that i studied hard , that i can succeed in the class ."
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	congratulations ! i bet it is exciting . you must be so excited . have you guys been checking to see if the baby is going to be a boy or a girl ?"
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	oh , my sister has twins already ! they are such a great family !"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	nah i didn ' t watch netflix . i stayed home with just my boyfriend . i felt so bad and was so alone ."
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	netflix . my daughter watched it , and i watched it . i am too embarrassed to watch it now . we aren ' t quite at that point yet yet ."
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	okay now i know what i need to watch . i will save this for later"
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	holy i ' m really happy for you . i hope you got the relief of the relief you needed . was it for a case dismissed ?"
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	that is awesome ! i hope you won ' t need to use the court dates to justify the need to go to unemployment !"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	that does sound frustrating . why is it so hot out today ?"
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	omg , how annoying ! traffic was horrible too ? must have been so aggravating ."
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	oh lord . that movie scared me too . i hated it !"
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	actually . . . . are you older than me . . . . i didn ' t just pestriers in my own house until i was 22 . . . after that . . . i had to link the movie to - and i had to read a lot of books and study . . . but it still gave me some pretty good moments"
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	you are so lucky ! you must have worked hard to get there , that must have been really exciting to see"
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	oh oh that ' s great ! i bet she feels really proud of you . most of my friends have two kids , but my oldest started all the way in oxy ."
"I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.	Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.	oh ! maybe you should try to grow it again . it could help you do that one day"
"I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.	are you ph - > any issues with the drainage ? or perhaps it ' s the sun ?"
"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	what is the word ? oh , what happened ? ! ? !"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	i ' m super happy for you ! you must be proud of yourself . i am very proud of you ."
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	that ' s really neat that they were able to help you out with your monthly paycheck ."
"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed	that ' s nice of them ! they sound like great people !"
"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.	i have actually subbed into an sub redity"" just to learn how to use my daily use of your warcraft account . so i really appreciate your use of the first small data point on this ."
"Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married	congratulations on the new anger@ , i ' m sure it ' s very exciting and exciting !"
"My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.	i don ' t blame you . that ' s a lot of money"
"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.	wow ! yes that is an excellent price for work . the medical bills also add up as they grow ! there are jobs out there that make you wish you could do everything you could just because you ' re in surgery !"
"True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future	did you contact your adviser for help ? are you excited ?"
"I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path	good for you , i am sure you will do great ."
"That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?	nothing . it was not my only text . i missed out on some cool news ."
"You could chat to them and complain!	i don ' t think they read what i write . but , i should know better ! i go to the school every day and ergytime just to mess with them !"
"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.	what happened to her ? what happened to you ? are you ok ?"
"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	oh man , i ' m so sorry you ' re going to miss her . how is it going ?"
"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.	oh wow that ' s quite the compresentation ! i hope you guys will have a nice place to live !"

Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood	toys r us was closed ? ! i went that way with my little girl growing up . she used to go there almost every day and there wouldn ' t have be toys in the little ones here now lol ."
"I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era	toys r us is such a junk place . it was just built to be , toys r us is a place for kids to buy toys and toys r us is a place for adults too . it ' s sad ."
"The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.	wow , what an experience ! i bet you enjoyed it , bet you would have liked to see how it reminded you of good times ."
"Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.	wow , that must have been a surreal experience . did you end up visiting your old facebook page ?"
"How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.	i was a young adult in the 90s . my friends were online more than i was , so i thought it was so out of place back then . but i guess i need to use it more"
"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	how pretty much the opposite of bullies are videogames and games in general . what do you do to your kids"
"Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?	we we did , but i didn ' t feel like having everyone understand what i was saying and how i was responding to it . we ended up having to just keep trying new things ."
"I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.	what was that ? so i ' ll know for next time ."
"Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.	i ' m afraid i don ' t know what lateral jones says about tunisia , so i don ' t really know anything about him , but sorry to hear it was so hard to watch ."
"My parents keep taking my money	what are they going to do do ? are you ok ?"
"They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.	oh that sucks . if you google , you can get a full view of how to learn to how to loan out funds ."
"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!	because they have no averse to clean up after others ! that ' s my opinion"
"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)	oh ok , what did you say ? lol . yeah , she is a pretty crazy lady , but i don ' t think that is the right way to go about things . but i think you ' ve done a good job of explaining yourself to me ."
"The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.	oh , i ' m so sorry to hear that . that ' s so devastating . it must have been tough for essentials for you . how did you cope with it ?"
"She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.	that is so tragic ! were you able to cope with the loss of her ?"
"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.	awww i can relate to the feeling . mine had to go through a body loss of weight lifting habit . it can be so hard ."
"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	i ' m so sorry that you have to go through that . it ' s just one of those tough times for sure . how long have you been together ?"
"A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.	what about working full time ? you feel confident now ? i ' m not super knowledge of the book , but i ' m a bit curious . you just start speaking an open and wide mouth ?"
"We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!	i love when people give you money for things . that must be so relieving ! did you feel grateful to your husband for his help ?"
"Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind.	so it seems i guess you ' re stuck with a car for now . . . . . that ' s amazing !"
"Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.	oh yes i have ! i love parties ! i was planning on doing one this year actually !"
"That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.	my sister went a few years ago actually . i was happy to surprise her . it is always fun ."
"Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops.	It was raining hard one night and the power shut off	oh no , that ' s a scary thing to happen . how long ago was that ghost power ?"
"Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles	can i prepare you for when the power goes back on ?"

"Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff.	lol i don ' t have any but my cat decided to rstarts the night owl for a reason ."

"One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.	that ' s tough , how are you now ? did everything turn out ?"
"I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.	oh my goodness ! that must have been terrible . but i ' m sure they understand and understand how difficult it is . i ' m sorry you went through that . it ' s not easy for a lot of people ."
"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	ohh wow . . what kind of business ? does he usually get a big raise too ?"
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	what does he do that business even consist of ? is it a large business ?"
"I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.	i think you shouldn ' t feel bad . you were simplest child and know what you need to buy . you should do everything in your life !"
"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..	not a big jerk ! this is a very interesting conversation . what is the necklace about ?"
"No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.	aww , that ' s kind of them ! i ' m glad you felt the need to give it to her and she will be thank you !"
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?	yeah me , my favorites are oprah rah qurice , of course i ' m talking about you , but it ' s so hard not to kill asked for help lol"
"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..	oh yea that happens to me all the time . its like you go back to the old days and everything is gone . i understand"
"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	i ' m so sorry ! i lost my cat a few years ago as well ."
"It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(	oh no ! that ' s awful . i know how sad that can be but , it really sucks when something like that happens"
"Thank you. I appreciate that.	I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.	oh my god , how long ago was that ? it ' s horrible to know they are both gone ."
"The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha	actually you hit the nail on the head ! i feel so bad , i cannot even remember when he passed . it feels like i am now 10 years old . i am so swanting to go out and meet some new people ."
"Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.	Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends, so gross.	it must ' ve been really gross . . . but hey , learn from your mistakes ."
"Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it	i ' m pretty sure a guest allergic to shellfish can still own you , unless you took really big ppy jones ."
"You don't care for sushi that much?	I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!	that must have been really funny . did you convince your friend ?"
"I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!	how interesting ! that was on youtube a long time ago . i could have never gotten over the ketchup thing ."
"My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.	oh no ! that ' s sad to hear . will you be able to talk to him about it ?"

"I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.	oh well , i am sure he will come out a happy and healthy man when he gets back . you are right , it would be a lifestyle he ' d love ."
"We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha	long distance is hard . i used to have it once . it was hard . but , i think you have made it through ."
"I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.	if it makes you sad , maybe the girl will warm up to you and that will make it better ! how do you feel about these things ?"
"I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.	oh i ' m so sorry , have you talked to her about it ?"
"I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.	propose her : ) go for it ! if she ' s actually beautiful you can consider it ."
"I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.	oh wow , that ' s really cool . i hope you do , i ' m sure it goes well !"
"I am very lucky, my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?	that ' s good , i have had the best birthday ever . my best birthday was my first birthday . i was so surprised and happy national lamborghini . how about you ?"
"Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!	i was at the beach with a friend my whole life and they took me there to a surprise dinner for my birthday ! i had no idea they were people i had known for a long time and it was a surprise !"
"For sure, maybe you need new friends!	5	i sure hope you do practice this , as i believe you will !"
"I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.	i ' m sorry to hear what was going on . how did it go ?"
"I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.	that does sound pretty scary ! what happened ? was anyone hurt ?"
"Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt, though.	are you sure ? you should research what happened next . video surveillance is best ."
"Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?	oh yeah . how ' d that feel ? i ' m not too familiar with it . do you want to share it ?"
"Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha	oh i love you , thanks for the advices , i will try it tomorrow !"
"I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.	I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me, even to this day.	you does sound like a lovely person . i am sure she is a nice person"
"I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.	that ' s really nice of you to try to help her out . my mom just bought me a car , i have no idea how to pay for it , and i am still poor"
"You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?	just know that when you come across this many beans , you will be more careful !"
"But you failed the exam? Did you revise?	i just spent all the way through the speech , i did not revise until about the last minute . and now i am late , my kids are starving me . ."
"At least you know for next time eh?	My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.	how wow , you must be very young still , i cannot too please guess how young you are , hear me out on this , what kind of car you need ?"
"She's amazing. Do you love your mom?	i do . she taught me a lot and helps me with my car payments ."
"I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.	oh no , is it still a dream ? do you want her to be single ?"
"It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month, so I will likely discuss it when she returns.	i feel for you . . that must be very tough . just remember you are probably thinking about her right now and that could be a good thing ."
"That sounds tough. What do you do/	i am working on marketing . i have a good idea on what to expect fer my first year though ."
"That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.	it ' s marketing . it pays just fine ! i ' ve done it once and never looked back ."
"Fair enough. As long as you look after your back""	I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.	well good luck to you then ! it can be really hard to be hopeful when you ' ve only just started out . are you also dash type ?"

"Yes, the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.	nice . did everyone get to have fun ? you must have been excited ."
"There was this one time I stole a shirt from my friend, and I feel pretty guilty about it.	oh man , why did you do that ? i feel your pain ."
"Because I really liked it, and didn't think he'd care.	oh , he cares if you didn ' t tell him . ."
"My girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week, I was very lonely during this experience.	i feel that feeling too . it ' s good that you can go on a vacation though ."
"I mainly just played video games and watched tv.	oh wow , i am sure you miss her . did you spend too much time chatting or video games ?"
"I moved to a new apartment and they didn't accept my dog breed, so I had to give her up. :(	what happened to her ? is she a good dog ? can you live in her house ?"

"My dog randomly got up on my couch last week, and just started peeing.. Like what!?!?!??!?!	i ' m not sure if you ' re a cat or not , but why did your dog do that ?"
"Not since lunch, so it's actually been about 4 hours.. I hate living on the top floor!	oh my gosh , you i bet that is frustrating to watch . did you find out what it is , or did you try to pick it up and give it a treat ?"
"I finally graduated college last year, it felt like it took SO long!	i bet it was . what do you do now ? how long will you teach ?"
"Yes, I am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!	congratulations ! i am sure you are a big student , but i bet you got lots of friends and family there ."
"My girlfriend saw me kissing another girl, who was kissing ME at the bar.. I was very drunk..	wow that ' s awful , i hope you called her and she showed up to see if you were okay ?"
"No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.	oh my goodness , sounds like that kiss was even worse than i thought . how embarrassing ! were you able to move on ?"

"I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!	haha , thats funny ! yeah i feel like its really more fun to learn to ride a bike first than to learn to ride a bike first , but its also kind of cool that you don ' t have to do that first ! you definitely need to learn first !"
"When i was younger, I came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead.	awww , i am so sorry . how did you do it ?"
"He was very old, so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!	i ' m sorry . pets are family , so its hard to lose them ."
"My dog chewed a hole in my carpet 2 weeks ago.. I was very disgusted to say the least!	oh no ! i hope your dog learned quick . did you punish him ?"
"Oh dang, I guess I can't complain too much then, that's brutal!	oh no , it ' s okay if you can ' t . dogs are factually correct in some ways . that ' s why they ' re so cute ."

Leads to s stressful life	I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.	oh god . what happened ? what happened ? what happened ?"
"Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself, is it?	i hear you . it does seem that sometimes , how difficult it is to proofread your manuscript seems to be a bogus feeling ."
"As a kid, I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.	oh lord ! that must have been frightening . do you know why you were afraid ?"
"That's the thing -- NO! I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!	i am with you on that , you should be more scared of a tornado ."
"My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said ""You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that."" For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)	oh my gosh that ' s terrible . it ' s like how are parents always running behind you when they need to be on their phones to get ready !"
"I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated, really.	what happened ? i ' m too young to know about that , but i hope you learned your lesson ."
"Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.	oh i get it . i agree , i used to have that feeling when i yelled at my mom a lot too ! good to know we ' re on the same path ."
"I do look at that as a strength, in anyone. Being able to say ""I'm sorry"" and ""I made a mistake.""	I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!	that sounds great ! where did you go ? did you go to each place ?"
"I highly, highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.	cool ! i ' ve never been to an foreign countries . where did you go if you don ' t mind me asking ?"
"i would fear my gift	why do you say that ? what made you so afraid ?"
"my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me	what was the phone ? are you certain it was a gift ?"
"yes but its a valuable gift to me	ah that is awesome , good for you ! i ' m sure it made you happy ."

"I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible	oh , no , i ' m sorry ! that is a little scary . what happened ?"
"i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible	dang , that ' s too bad , i feel you there !"
"I love being around them and it's great to see them each year.	when is your time gonna come ? how long have you been watching them ?"
"O I'm sorry, my niece and nephews, only seem in the summer. Do you get company during the summer?	not as much as i should . i ' m very busy and it ' s so quiet outside ."

"my husband called me a punk today for no reason. and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn't even understand why	that is so rude what did you say to him ? it is hard to learn to talk to people like that ."
"no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes	yes , if you love him , you should call him a punk ! you should make his number 1 next time it comes up ."
"When I was younger, I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive, because i didn't want to get into an accident.	i always felt the same way about driving too ! what made you scared ?"
"I tried to tell myself that, but my dad got into a really bad accident once, and it has scared me ever since.	did you take lessons in advance to make sure you are ready ?"
"I recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches.	hey do you like tomatoes ? i almost finished reading tomato season yesterday and i planted some in my garden ."

"My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!	did you go to the school ? wow . . you must have been so proud"
"She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.	she must be very intelligent . i mean of course a very intelligent woman could have easily worked harder than you and got a job on your own . but it is ridiculous to just be a point of pride like that ."

"I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend, and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.	oh dear . what has me scared about this now ? ?"
"It WAS. Since she was wet, the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.	oh no ! that is so bad i am so sorry you had to do that ."

"I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.	oh my goodness . i ' m so sorry . i know that ' s hard ."
"yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort	i ' m so sorry . that must be hard . are you alright ?"
"I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some.	I had plans to move from Florida to California, but I'm starting to get cold feet...	florida is cold , and very cold ? are you at the end of the country already ? i am so sorry that it is so hard to dig out roots ."
"Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.	i did ! i moved to los angeles to start a job . in florida , it ' s going to be cold and hot , but it ' s not worth it . i can ' t wait to start my new job ."

The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.	oh i ' m sorry to hear that . maybe next time ."
"Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.	wow . i can ' t believe caterers are seriously expensive . maybe you should try out a different one ?"
"I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.	how it happened ? how did you get it ? ? did domino ' s already replace domino ' s pizza ?"
"The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.	domino ' s is a good place . i have a veggie pizza from there that i really like ."
"Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.	how was your day?	it was pretty amazing . i made fish run outside for furniture after swimming in the pool ."

"I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.	where did you move ? what were your thoughts on getting married ?"
"Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.	what do you study ? i ' m somewhat near my college , and the first week was rough , but the training and meeting new people will go a long way for you"

"Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off, but I sure felt stupid about it.	oh no , did you think it was really funny ? how much did you regret it ?"

"Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.	it ' s not stealing . i didn ' t get it out of the box . i bought hip hop concert tickets ."

"Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby.	oh that ' s nice . i don ' t really know how ok these days how exciting it will be , but good on you for getting out of the way , you seem to be very excited about it !"
"Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors!	okay , then you ' re very brave . i ' m glad you are reading this ahead !"
"Oh cool! What kind of doctor?	sorry , i meant shaker not erm . but i hope he starts him up"
"Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.	i am absolutely , she is such a smart and amazing woman . i am so happy that she can reach her goals . such a noble woman !"
"My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.	her grades are pretty good , but she never seems to be able to keep it together ."
"I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.	i would be so sad if that was me . you deserve to reflect on your own life ."
"Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.	do you know where he was going ? i know it ' s hard to stay homeless but i ' ve found that it ' s very hard to stay homeless ! have you given any thought to how you should look after yourself ?"
"A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.	wow that is terrible . what happened ? are you ok ?"

"I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.	how how did that make you feel ? how big is he ?"
"She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.	what songs does she sing ? im a singer myself , so i understand"
"Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.	Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!	where old days have gone by pretty quickly . do you have something good to tell me about the past ?"

"Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money, but still wanted her to have something nice.	wow ! you have such a lovely relationship with your brother . i ' m glad you guys were able to keep the sounds of the traditions together ."
"I can't wait to get a new car soon	is it a ford fiesta ? ford fusion ? ? ?"

"not yet ready for the baby, need fix up his room	what does that mean ? i see it in the nicest way possible"
"Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!	yes , it will be fun . is that your first child ?"
"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	oh wow , you must be disappointed . you should always make sure you buy from them first so you won ' t be disappointed ."
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	yeah ! i would be unable to afford that . too bad i can ' t afford to buy things online !"
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	are you alright , boy ? how are you feeling now ?"
"It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it	do you know what the loan words "" i "" mean "" ?"
"Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired	good for you ! i hope that you enjoy that amount of time ."
"It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again	you ' ll still have plenty of time to save up for another visit from the shop . there ' s always social media to learn from your mistakes ."
"For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies	oh wow ! good for you ! you must be so happy !"
"Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!	what did you do instead ? did you give up hope ?"
"At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently	oh yea , i can understand that . some things just aren ' t meant to be . i hope you had a great time ."
"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special	good for you , you are a good friend . there ' s nothing like receiving fresh gifts from your family ."
"I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant	wow , she must have a very good plot of visiting once"
"Yes. It's a boy	that is great , she is going to be smart to have the time of summer planned out ."
"My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business.	ohh no im so sorry to hear that ! do you have anything else you can do ?"
"I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.	where are you going to go ? is your child okay ?"
"I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him	oh wow , i ' m sorry to hear that . maybe you can try to save up for a house then e"
"In the club	oh no , why wouldn ' t you want to sit with him ?"
"I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to	how old are you ? can i ask your girlfriend ? does she know where you live ?"
"She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew	oh ok , i see . still , what the heck ? i bet she was fine with it ?"
"I know I will save the money I need for the baby	what are you trying to teach ? a loan is not the same as a car"
"Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday	you ' re very fortunate ! as long as you ' re doing something you can ' t fail safe . it ' s not a huge danger but as can be a bit scary to be scared of dying but i hope you have a safe baby !"
"I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out	what happened ? i ' m curious to learn ! did you try to sell it ?"
"Kinda. I thought it was a secret	oh no ! that is exciting though . don ' t feel bad . i think everyone must have secretly wanted it"
"it was brutal	oh wow . i am so sorry to hear that hippies are living the life of lazy college students ."
"i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.	did you mean tomato wasted the moment you didnt shower ?"
"yes. homeless for a bit	that ' s an interesting way to describe a homeless person . tomato sounds delicious !"
"i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye	i ' m sorry to hear that . . i think there ' s only one thing you can do right now . we all cheat at some point in mender ."
"it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her	you should tell her . i know that sounds awful but if she ' s in the wrong place at the moment you should break away from them and take it from them ."
"i was heartbroken when my dad passed away.. still not over it.	oh i ' m so sorry for your loss . i know how you feel , we always have to battle death til the last day ."
"5 years..	i ' m so sorry to hear that . that is so sad ."
"i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition.. she seems like a born artist	wow that ' s great ! she must have worked hard ."
"yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her	what kind of paintings do they make ? so great ! congratulations on winning , thats an awesome accomplishment ."
"i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents	why is that ? i ' m curious . what did you lie about ?"
"yeah, but still.. that feeling never went away	oh no . i ' m sure you feel better now though ."
"i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere	its always a great feeling . are you scared you will fail ?"
"well, i guess women are more detail oriented	i guess you ' re just a really great woman , hu ?"
"i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her	soulmates ? you are an awesome guy ! when will you find out ?"
"yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me, i escaped from there right awat	i understand that feeling , it ' s quite sad . are you still together ?"
"my dog passed away earlier this year	oh no . i am so sorry to hear that . i lost my sjune to cancer about a month ago ."
"yeah.. but its too soon i feel	oh no , i ' m sorry to hear that . i am sure your dog will always be with you in social media ."
"some guy drove past me so fast last week.. i was furious	oh no . what happened next ? i can imagine you ' re anxious about what you ' d be capable - did you end up hitting him ?"
"yeah.. i barely escaped!	wow , i ' m sorry to hear that . you must be quite content to be almost escaped ."
"1	any idea what you are going to announce ? go with your instincts ?"
"soory it was mistakenly typed.	oh wow , that ' s sad . hopefully you won ' t lose life over it ."
"how was your day?	I'm taking the California Bar exam to become an attorney in February and I'm sooo nervous!	that sounds hard , how difficult is it ? sounds like it is going to be a lot of practice for you ."
"I played a video game when I was younger, called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and it made me want to become one!	that is exciting ! i bet you will have to be prepared for any difficult lsat you have to take . good luck !"
"once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life	i ' m so sorry to hear that . what happened ?"
"yeah that really sucks.	i ' m sorry to hear that . do you feel better now ?"
"I fell down at work, and my khaki pants ripped open.	when will you probably go on going trip or something to disappear from this earth ?"
"I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.	oh my god . . . how embarrassing ! i am sorry that happened to you ."
"My grandpa is coming to visit!,5|5|5_5|5|5,	what fun ! grandpa ' s are such great people . what did he say about religion ?"
"He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!	what did you learn today ? i know how to bingo ."
"I ate a gas station burrito for lunch. It was not very appetizing. Actually, it was absolutely horrible.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	oh my , you must ' ve told me about something . . . i ' ll just pick it lol"
"Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.	hahaha , don ' t worry , you will be fine . i am sure there is still someone in the hospital next day ."
"how was your day?	it was good , it helped that we met in an nemox concert ."
"yeah its an another good day	my day was pretty good . the first day was okay . the rest was pretty disappointing and stressful ."
"oh how was the climate there/	well it was ok but nothing like the summer flu . we should have another flu soon then ! we need to work on those !"
"I managed to accidently flash a dozen people	that ' s impressive ! how did that happen ? what did you do ?"
"it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like ""oops!	well , that ' s good you know what to do . you could ' ve probably spooked their clothes ."
"Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive	i have always more trust on my girlfriend	why is that ? how come ? are you involved in any special interests ? do they make you feel better ?"
"yeah i do. i love her a lot	you two are lucky to have what you have . i ' m sure she will find out who she is soon ."
"what about you?	I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.	oh gosh i know exactly how you feel . have you prepared ?"
"Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.	have you been studying for any reason ? when i did , i learned do data entry jobs ."
"I get to go the the zoo tomorrow! They opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal, the sloth!	that is awesome ! i wish i could go to the zoo"
"They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!	wow you must be excited to go ! what will you be seeing at the zoo ?"
"I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!	wow . . what an awkward dinner . did you say something to them after ?"
"Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?	you ' d have better to confront them first . it can be hard to bring up a true story about a restaurant you ' re in but confront them might lose you time of it just because they don ' t have the required knowledge to disclose it ."
"i have been more happy	how im sorry . i think you will do well in the trying to maintain that balance"
"happier now beacuse i have been built a new house	congratulations ! you must be excited . i assume you are gonna build it , too ?"
"Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.	how much do you think it will be in upcoming years ?"

"i feels happy	oh really ? what happened to them ? why is ' f ' apart of it?"
"because i built a new house	oh wow . what does it have done for you ? and when is it ' s yours ?"
"i have been more happy that i have bought a car	good for you , which one ? and what is it ?"

"My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.	oh that ' s great ! what kind of watch did she get you ?"
"She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version.	congratulations ! what did she get you ? does she know your age ?"
"I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.	that ' s great ! what did you study ? anything new ?"

"I am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that I just finished. I took the final exam yesterday, and I am not sure what score I will receive.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	you will get good luck ! have you tried looking for the score from the online class you took ?"
"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.	are you nervous about the meeting ? i hope you will get an a , that ' s pretty impressive ."
"I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.	is there anything specific that you hate about the person ? what did you name them ?"
"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.	dont mind them im sure you will get along fine . whats your name ?"
"My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away.	i ' m sorry to hear that . it ' s hard losing someone so close . it ' s nice that you can see them everyday ."
"The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off	that is terrible . i am so sorry to hear that . did you ever find out who she was ?"
"I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.	oh , tell me about it . is it a nice restaurant ?"
"I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.	i can ' t believe that . the world would be a better place if people didn ' t do that !"
"I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.	have you ever felt that way before ? your childhood has so many wonderful moments , just remember it every day"
"Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?	i am close with them both . it would have been nice to have a house like that when i was little ."
"I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone	haha i bet that brought back a lot of memories !"
"Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.	oh thats cool , i remember when i was a kid being flooded with good memories like that !"
"We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave.	i was in same situation as you . it was a very scary thing to be in . how did you prepare ?"
"Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?	i was , but we got hit our basement some days after . there was a lot of flooding and a lot of damage but we recovered well ! i hope you have insurance on your house ."
"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	are you nervous about the appointment ? what makes you nervous ?"
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	that ' s so exciting ! are you okay ? did everything turn out okay ?"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	did you do any fun hobbies ? what did they finish up ?"
"Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?	i have not . are you going to start making it a big success ?"
"I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.	how did it go ? is it now forwarding ?"
"Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.	oh my gosh . that is so sad . i am so sorry ."
"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	what was it about ? did you study hard for it ?"
"I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	oh man . i hate when that happens . . . what i love about doctor ' s its always the wait ."
"Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	what ? ? im afraid to ask , what is being sold ?"
"I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious.	you shouldn ' t be anxious , you will do just fine . practice makes perfect ."
"Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.	smart luck . how nervous are you going to be ? i ' m sure you will do great ! it ' s a good time to prepare ."
"I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it!	hey that sounds cool , wish i could go there when i ' m not too busy to drive two weeks haha"
"We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?	no i haven ' t . i have visited ok once , but not as vacationing . hope you have a good time there ."
"One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!	that is so nice ! how long ago was this ? is this recent ?"
"We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!	wow ! 14 years ! ! that ' s a long time ! sounds like it ' s a good wife to have !"
"It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?	wow that ' s a long time . i can ' t believe how long have you been married ."
"Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top	oh , that makes a lot of sense . what was it from ?"
"I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.	what happened ? did you go into the store without drinking a sodas ?"
"I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.	wow that ' s wild ! well hopefully you did not get hurt ."
"I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone	has he been fixing a lot to go to the party ? how much does he fix it up ?"
"I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution	what are you going to do do with it ? i hope you have a safe future and an exciting one ."
"sure ... thanks	My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.	oh that ' s bad ! what is it about your parents ?"
"I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?	if they know then sure , i ' d suggest a talk with them about what your going through and how you need to change your identity ."
"My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.	lol how did he notice ? i hope he thought you ' re doing a good job"
"Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!	i ' m so happy for you ! i wish i had that type of luck ."
"Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.	I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me.	i feel that is sad , what did you do ? just go on an plane ?"
"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.	that is such a heartwarming story . where did you go to go to the airport with that baby ?"
"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	loyalty is very important loyal . what does the organization consist of ?"
"Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.	oh wow , congratulations ! i ' m sure you deserve it ! what kind of organization is it ? you ' ll definitely be switched around in time ."
"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	what is your grandma like ? that sounds interesting . how long has it been since you have heard of her ?"
"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.	that ' s not too bad then , i know its hard to leave your parents but you ' ll always have your grandparents and i ' m sure she will be able to come such a long time though"
"A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.	i ' m so sorry to hear that . was the house well ruined ?"
"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.	oh my goodness , that ' s awful ! i hope you ' re feeling pretty safe . tornados are so much more than just the force of nature . they are another form of lightning from around you . glad you ' re safe !"
"Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy	what types of plants are they ? i will have to learn more about this since i don ' t know too much about this stuff ."
"Especially when you feel something special by nature	what i am really hoping to see this year is a great season for them . this is great . it is just as good to watch ."
"I hope this feeling increases	My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.	what are you going to do for her ? is it going to be a surprise ?"
"We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.	how excellent ! make sure you guys have a great time !"
"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.	i will be eating dinner tonight with my friends on the table ! you can pick one of my favorite meals and i ' ll make it for you !"
"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	what happened ? i hope he could understand . . . there ' s never a better feeling than being told the truth"
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	why don ' t you take it for a walk and tell him you had a headache ? that would work just as well ."
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	oh , dear . i am so sorry to hear that . i hope your stomach was okay ."
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	do that guy in the bathroom again , please tell me he ' s ok !"
"I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!	hahaha , what did you do ? ! ? i think you can go back now ?"
"I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!	lol . i bet your quite embarrassed about this , but i know your situation is beyond embarrassing ."
"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	whoa oh , why are you so worried about the tv being 80 inches ? did you buy it at a store ?"
"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?	can you return it ? buy the tv ? i am a college student so i steal stuff all the time but i am not going to do it for you ."
"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	its very infuriating . maybe you should research how to fix that infuriating feeling ."
"Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.	i can ' t disagree with you there . i hate being forced to do that . i don ' t think that ' s healthy , but maybe we ' ll find the healthy way to treat ourselves someday ."
"I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.	i bet it was , what did you do on your weekend ?"
"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.	that sounds really fun ! i bet you had a great time ."
"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	what classes did you take ? are you in college ? you sound quite excited about it ."
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	now that is an interesting story . i thought the main point was that they have tax exempt status , i guess they simply missed a tie to the church if it was big ."
"Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.	well that ' s wonderful ! is there anything in particular that you want to do to become more financially stable ?"
"Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!	that is such a good feeling ! my wife and i just started our first child return !"
"My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness	friends can be tricky like that . it ' s good to have a good support system ."
"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering	that is so sweet of them ! that is a very nice friend to lend me that type of encouragement !"
"Thanks for your comprehension	Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.	did you ever get hurt ? hope you are ok now !"
"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.	you must ' ve been so scared . i hope you don ' t have any regrets ."
"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	oh my goodness , that ' s horrible . i hope you can find the help you need to heal from this and hopefully your friend can be better ."
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	oh man , i ' m sorry to hear that , my friend . do your friends know what it is that prevents you from going out and getting out ?"
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	hi ! i ' m sad , i feel sorry for you . how are you doing ?"
"one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel	oh no , i ' m so sorry to hear that ."
"is that he loved her	This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.	oh , that sounds really gross ! i ' m sorry you had to go through that ! do you think you will find a refund ?"
"Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.	i don ' t blame you ! sometimes that kind of smell reminds me of my youth , when i was in i believe 20 years ago when i still had a bit of fear of not being able to make a clean environment for myself with all my classmates in a way ."
"I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.	what was wrong ? i am sorry to hear that . why the trip was bad ?"
"We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.	are there any plans for next time ? maybe you can make the next one up ."
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	i know exactly what you mean . my apartment goes back to back to back at 3am , so i can ' t sleep in anyway ."
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	if they do the same thing , maybe they don ' t want to get up late , but i usually try to yell at them for it ."
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	i mean you are right , but maybe they dont understand and they think they are being told to shut up but its never their responsibility to show up and yell"
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	yeah , i mean noise reduction would be good for you and your neighborhood but oh well ."

I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!	i hope it ' s exciting for you ! sounds like you ' re having a big change of heart . what will you be doing to change your surroundings ?"
"Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!	oh that sounds exciting . i love alaska . just moved out of the state from around 800 miles away from where i was born . but i ' m glad it ' s for you . i love the culture there ."
"I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate	how do you meditate ? do you feel relaxed ? i haven ' t actually been reading the sotw blind again yet . i used to read text book a lot , but that was about it , and it ' s been a while ."
"No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy.	i ' m sure that ' s great and a great way to start your day . do you take the meditating practice a long time ?"
"My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis	Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.	that sounds terrible ! did you report it to the police ?"
"Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.	that is a scary thought ! did they break in and take anything out ?"
"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	oh that isn ' t good . did they try to ruin the project ?"
"Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.	where was it your project that you were promised ? was it yours ?"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.	oh no , did you have a good time ? did you do well ?"
"Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.	that is awesome . how well did it go ? i am excited to see what it turned out !"
"I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!	wow , that sounds quite tough . what did you buy ?"
"Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.	wow , you must be so grateful . do you wish you could be without the farmer ' s market ?"
"Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!	sounds very read of you , you must have a very lovely family"
"I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.	I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.	wow , did you feel horrible about it ? and what do you do now ?"
"Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck	oh man . i hate bees . they are so majestic . you must have bee so scared ! what did you do ?"
"Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!	So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.	oh no ! how did you react to the wrong package ?"
"Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.	oh wow ! i ' ve never had that happen to me before ! i feel so bad now that you mention it !"
"I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.	good old days ? what happened to you ? how long ago did you have to worry about bills and bills ?"
"Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha	oh yes , that was so easy back then . having bills and expenses wasn ' t as big of a deal as it is now . but now we have to wait for bills and expenses . it ' s hard"
"I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.	do you usually read handy book by chris wentz ?"
"I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.	you are very lucky to have such a great parent . i have tried to be as inspiring as possible to others but never did it so i am not sure how i would do it ."
"I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.	it happens , everyone makes mistakes sometimes . i don ' t have a friend like that"
"I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!	that is a very interesting story . you must be very excited to be forming a side business with someone so special ."
"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	oh no . i hope nothing happened to him ! it is difficult to see why he would behave that way ."
"Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!	I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.	that was pretty impressive , was she going to buy it off of scratch off ?"
"She won $5,000 and never offered to share.	wow ! ! i would never share any money with you !"
"I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.	no another red neck graduate on the block . you ' re absolutely inspiring ! how did it go ? i ' m sure if you show me know how he explains everything in order to break the rules i would be all over it ."
"I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.	did you study for it ? did you prepare for it ?"
"I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.	that ' s pretty interesting , do you feel like it ' s something that you know personally about ?"
"Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on	please share this hit with me as soon as possible . i know it seems complicated but i ' m just going to assume you ' re excited about the possibility"
"I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!	oh wow , what happened next ? what was going on in your apartment ?"
"Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.	holy smokes ! that must have been so scary ! what happened next ?"
"Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!	My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	awwhat , how long has she been married ? is she going to college or something ?"
"Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?	no i have not , is it different ? what does arkron strawer say about it ?"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.	how oh no ! ! what happened ? did it go well ?"
"There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.	i hate presenting , that ' s always the worst ! i am glad you did well though !"
"Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!	i never honk at anyone ! it sort of makes me feel like i ' m honking at them but it ' s really my maternal instinct ."
"Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe	exactly right ! i try not to honk when i ' m in a 4 way euctorially lol . you hit it into the right of way or not at all . they even speed up to use their phone at there license plate"
"I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.	that is awesome ! you must be very proud ! what are you studying ?"
"I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?	i have not , do you ? what is your main passion ?"
"I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.	did it end up ending up being ok ? how did you handle it ?"
"Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!	thank you , i am glad you are safe , stay safe also in the future ."
"I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.	yes i know , he was an amazing man and one of my favorite comedians ."
"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	that ' s what really sucks . all these people who have overcome real challenges at the age of 60 and are living a very full life seem to be swept away in the last few years . no one is brave enough to leave their family for the loss of a loved one ."
"It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.	My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.	what did you do then ? must have been something awesome ."
"I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.	well i ' m so sorry to hear that . at least you kept your job and kept your job at the same time . i know it feels so much more work when your supervisor shows up and you stay safe ."
"I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!	have fun . are you nervous about it ? you must be nervous ."
"I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?	yes ! ! ! ! that is the one ! ! ! ! i love just walking in and taking the kids to the amusement park !"
"I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.	how did it go ? how do you feel about that ?"
"That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.	man that sounds great , did you save a lot in the summers ?"
"We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.	oh that ' s beautiful . i bet you were so excited . did you get a present ?"
"Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.	oh yeah , i ' ve always been a bit of a dove lover myself , so i always liked it a bit when my kids were just showing up ! i haven ' t been to that location for a very long time ! they ' re pretty far away , so i ' m not that close to that . i ' m sure you guys are going to have a great time ."
"I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.	that ' s terrible , did you ask your dog to go on it ?"

"I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.	how so ? i suppose it depends on the show . i like bbc shows ."
"Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.	i think people have a deep memory , i agree . i have that too . tv can be very emotional"
"Nah, I don't get to to bad.	I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!	that ' s exciting ! when do you go ? ! i am so excited for you !"
"I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa?	we went to williamsburg . i have never been to the one in black until i was really old !"
"Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.	exactly ! you have a very good point ! ! they should be smarter than that"
"This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.	wow ! that kid sounds like a pickeringgump . did he even eat it until he passed out ?"
"Not even a little.	that ' s too funny for me , but sad for the kid . what did you do ?"
"I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.	its always good thats a great sign when a pet comes out of the gate like that ."
"Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems	i love dogs , they are so innocent they are loyal ."
"I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house	oh no ! that ' s terrible ! where did you lose your house ?"
"It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.	are you in florida by chance ? i have a similar situation in mind right now . the hurricane sandy ended up hitting us pretty hard . i have two feet of concrete from our roof now . i hope that your house will be okay"

"Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.	oh that ' s really cool . i haven ' t really seen anyone quite like them yet ."
"I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.	is it pity that you aren ' t here right now , then ?"
"No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?	wow . its nice to have some friends around town . its a lot of work but oh boy do i love going to town ."
"I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.	how did it go ? did you have fun ? did you have a good time ?"
"She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.	that sounds great ! what did she do ? did you do it yourself or loan her money ?"
"You know you could still do it. I know you can.	now that sounds like a great experience for her ! thank you for that !"
"My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.	that was nice of him ! how was the move ? was it good ?"
"He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!	oh thats nice that you got him to help you out ."
"You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.	congratulations ! when is the interview ? i hope it ' s soon . . ."
"It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.	sure , you ' re quite welcome ! i hope you get the job - good luck !"
"I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.	hm , do you know why you forgot to bring it back though ?"
"Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.	now that ' s just gross ! well , can you search for the fertilizer inside the safe space next time ?"
"Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.	Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.	oh that ' s amazing . is it a big success ?"
"It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.	is the place being open open for her now ? or will she be closed for another year ?"
"I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her.	wow ! i hope you enjoy it ! i am sure it will be a lot of fun"
"I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!	oh that does sound lonely ! was that the first time you felt this way ?"
"It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!	oh wow , that ' s so cool ! did you have to move somewhere else ?"
"Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!	did it take a long time to fully set out why there were so many people living in those areas ?"
"I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.	that is good that you have good family . i hope your family recounts things , even if you are sick ."
"Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.	that is good to hear , i ' m glad you are feeling better ."
"I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.	i do agree that it is sad . however , it is an important tool for us to use to defense ourselves from our obeying judgements* as much as we can ."
"We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!	wow , so what is your position on plolepweekends then ?"
"Me too! <fist bump> ;-)	So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.	oh wow , that ' s an incredible secret . i ' m sorry . is he serious ?"
"He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.	that must be hard for him . at least its been three months ."
"I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.	traffic ! that sounds terrible . how late were you ? did you have enough time ?"
"I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?	yes i understand . kids need to be more considerate ."
"You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.	ah i ' m sorry to hear that , i know how hard that can be !"
"She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.	that ' s really tough , it must have been hard . i ' m really sorry ."
"I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.	I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.	what i feel you on that feeling . it will get better . try to give it a few days ."
"Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it.

"One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.	i hope it ' s for the best and that she makes a lot of hard decisions ahead of her ."
"She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year.	what does she want to study ? i know it is not something she enjoys , but what do you like about it ?"

"You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.	i bet i can do it . i ' ll be praying in the mornings . are you going to meet a boy or girl ?"
"I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food	how are you doing it so far ? how do you feel about it ?"
"I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all	that ' s great , what is your diet like now ?"
"I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.	where are they for when they come in ? or are you ready for them already ?"
"oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great	When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.	oh my goodness , that ' s awful ! do you feel very sure she will be okay ?"
"I was and she was had a full recovery.	that is great news . how is she doing now ? is she feeling better ?"
"Me neither, my mom means so much to me.	that ' s so sad . it seems she has been having a hard time financially and has lost touch with you ."
"Do you get to see your mom often?	i do not , she passed away a few years ago . i just had two daughters . i hope one of them someday puts the boss behind her ."

"It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.	what are you going to do when your family isn ' t home ?"
"That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!	how big is your family ? is that a good reason for them not to be home ?"
"Whenever we moved abroad, I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.	where did you guys move abroad ? did you give up your house and your job ?"
"Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.	congratulations , you are definitely moving forward very well : ) , enjoy the adventure"

"Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?	oh we haven ' t been able to yet , i hope i can get some money for food and things so we can go visit once a year but i think i ' m just going to miss my family a ton ."
"I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman.	did you give her a women ' s name ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ?"

I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark.	i guess you ' ll never be that old yet ! lol i still have the same old friends from back when i was young , we ' d go to la for a week to see friends and ettle & pizzas and go out in the sun and then started the entire weekend night out on the dark street !"

"Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.	yea i think i will go next time . the thing that keeps me away from italy is the traveling . it really is a great place ."
"That is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures	My friend bought me lunch today	what did they buy you ? was it a gift from someone ? i hope you get to go out soon ."
"I had a nice burger and fries	what did you eat ? sounds delicious . what was it on ?"
"Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch	I hate when people pull in front of you, especially when it's clear behidn you.	have you ever gone on lessons ? i ' ve never gone on blind or with people in front of you ."
"Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.	i know i know . it ' s awful . i wonder if they were trying to teach you not to do that ?"
"yes, sadly I easily can.	I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy	oh , yeah it can be hard for some . i feel the same way , but i try to avoid those things"
"That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on	i feel the same way . i always read the light during the night ."
"I like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs. They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.	how many dogs do you have ? and how many do you have now ?"

"i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere	im so sorry to hear that ! will you be okay ?"
"not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up	i ' m so sorry to hear that . . . you must feel really risky"

"Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!	if i did that i would have to turn all of my money into a pool - i would need to make sure everyone has enough money to swim in the water ."

"I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?	i know what you mean . what are you gonna do ?"
"You can say that again. One time, I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.	that is not right , he should have been arrested for drugs"
"1	how good . i am thinking you paying off the loan to buy a house ."
"sorry that was sent by an mistake	i hope you go to college and do some great things in your life , say hello to your friends and family"
"I don't think I am a judgmental person, but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day, and I can still smell it.	oh , why are you so allergic to finacrolls ?"
"Trust me, this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off, they had running clean water, but no toilet indoors!	this is so funny , you are totally funny ! ! !"
"I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.	oh , i hope it goes well ! ! i think you can give even just a few minutes !"

"I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at, the possibility looks good!	Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?	i ' ve been in that situation more than once , i ' m still trying to get over it . how do you feel about it ?"
"That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!	oh dear , i hope she is somewhere great ? if not , shame on her !"
"Not too long ago, my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it!	wow . did you manage to find out if she did it on time ?"
"Yes, I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought, I am blessed.	that is wonderful , i have the same interest rate that my parents had"
"I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible	good for you ! i am sure you are doing really good"
"I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me!	i ' m sorry you had to broke your finger ! that is a lot of dishes . it can happen i ' m sure , but it happens"
"So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!	what does that mean ? sounds exciting ! do you have any plans for it ?"
"I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.	wow , so you are into that too ? what do you usually buy ?"
"And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!	how many stores open for you ? there are so many people today !"

"The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to	oh my gosh ! i ' ve had that happen to me before ! you must have really dropped your last cookie . what a glutton for a mood . where ' d it take you ?"
"I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!	yay ! congratulations ! i am happy for you ! how much did you win ?"
"YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!	no , no not anymore ! what now ? ! you must have had to buy everything already ! i ' m sorry , that must have been quite an embarrassing ordeal !"
"I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!	that is a very complicated situation it seems . some places already have shipping options for that ."
"Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!	are you going to have your package delivered to you or are you not able to make that decision for you ?"
"The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider	what did you think it was ? does it still exist ?"
"I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that!	did you kill it ? i would ' ve screamed . . . and your dog probably would ' ve cried ."
"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	how have you done see so far ? how did you like it ?"

"Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!	i bet he will . go him ! is he always there for you ?"
"It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!	you are fortunate to have a husband like him ! you must be very excited and anxious about his bonus !"
"When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.	how many 1000 ' s does he have now ? your friend must have been really lucky ."
"He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!	oh wow , money problems are always an issue . nice plan of going above and beyond , i hope you repay him ."
"Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.	wow , how old are you now ? you seem old : )"
"I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!	that sounds really old fashioned . . . did you go to college ?"
"I don't know how you are with Calc, but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.	i just took the test and passed it in both hand . . lol"
"Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!	haha , that ' s impressive , i ' m really good at math , just not too good at extracurricular stuff like studying and remembering dates and stuff ."
"My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night	what kind of cat do you have ? is it a cat like myself ?"
"She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her!	oh , cats are so cute ! my dog is one of my favorite animals , i like to feed her to remind her to wake me ."

"yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha	oh man that is amazing ! congratulations ! but , what happened then ?"
"My boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend...	that is not fair did you make a 2nd date together ?"
"Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her.	that sucks . i hate when my wife does that . . ."
"i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years	i agree , i love playing video games ! i ' m glad that they are gaining so much weight !"

I never did tell my friend, for various reasons, but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!	do not let it bother you . everyone make mistakes . i was in a situation if that last relationship was all that was right with the world , and i knew that my friends would not make the same mistake again . at least they were comfortable with the thought of you ."
"Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.	wow that ' s pretty interesting , you must be really really know her . i feel you should tell her first . if she doesn ' t know your friends situation , it ' s even harder to get behind the decision ."
"I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.	oh no . have you guys been able to make new connections ?"
"No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.	i am so happy for you . what did you do when you were little ?"

"So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.	you must be really good at it ! now i know how to read a novel !"
"For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!	do you bowling too ? i could could bowling too if i was more talents like your brother would ."

"PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!	lol . that is too funny . why did you say f ' n answer and not f ' m ' t ?"
"It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.	that ' s crazy ! some people really are crazy . you are lucky to have visited and caught a bouncer !"

"So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.	oh wow ! i bet that was awkward ! what happened next ?"
"Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.	lol that ' s ok , everyone has done something embarrassing at some point"
"I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester.	what did you buy ? you must be a smart kid ."

"So I had an emergency come up for my family and I had enough money to cover it. I feel great for preparing!	im sure you will be fine ! do you have to pass your licks first ?"
"Definitely! And they are paying me back, so it isn't like I'm losing money either.	what do you have saved for them ? do you have a emergency fund ?"
"I drank a lot of alcohol at my friend's BBQ party, and I ended up puking and passing out. Not my finest moment.	i am sure you were not scared of that . puking sounds not that bad ."

"Or someone not quite so objectionable :) Seriously though, I'm so happy for K with his new job.	We started watching a Red Sox game near the end and they were losing. Next thing you know, they were ahead four runs.	good job ! you must be really happy they won ! are you a fan of the red sox ?"

"Yes, my family and I are close and we were there for each other. But, my sister had passed away around 6 years before, by committed suicide.

"That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.	maybe you need to write a formal complaint letter to them . it ' s never the most appropriate thing to do ."
"Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.	this is a great idea ! also to keep things simple and stay simple , have each person make their own list . that way everyone will know what to expect ."

"We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man, so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.	good for you both ! where did you guys go ? was it a nice vacation ?"

"Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night.	oh no ! were you able to recover ? i hope you are alright !"
"Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.	thats the worst ! plus when you try to get to use it as an excuse to eat . and then it goes all up against your best friend ."
"That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.	i yea thats a good idea __unk__ make sure the insurance company sees it ."
"My aunt came to visit today, we went out for mexican food!	when are you going to visit her ? is that in sight ?"

"I was pleasantly shocked the other day when I won on a lottery ticket! I hardly ever win and I won $200!	wow that ' s amazing ! how are you going to spend it ?"

"At the department office back at the school.	did you try to speak or perform well ? how did you do ?"
"One of my coworkers really ticked me off one day. She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!	did she have the danphiladelphia just under her pillow ? i can ' t tell if she ' s serious or not ."
"Yes, she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her, and it was her work! I let her know it too.	seems like she really loved this person who became a styrocomplete worker . is she what you call ticked you off ?"

"My husband and I are at a point in our lives, we are able to save, afford all that we need and save for retirement. I'm so appreciate we can, as I know many aren't able to do that.	its good to hear that there are still some happy couples in this world !"
"Yes, we have been working hard, as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times. But, it's worth having some financial freedom!	hey that ' s really good to hear . i ' m glad you are holding onto that freedom , and i know that it sounds like you ' re truly on top of the world ."
"One day at work while I was pregnant, I fell! Luckily, the baby and I weren't hurt, but I wanted to waddle away so fast!	oh my gosh , i hope you didn ' t have to go through a lot of trouble falling ! i guess you feel better now though ?"
"Yes, it really was quite so!	what the heck did you do afterwards ? just try to stay safe and hope nothing bad happens ?"
"There are times I feel a bit alone and down. My husband has to travel out of town for work quite often.	aww that ' s a bummer . has he been busy recently ?"
"Well, yes, of course. But, that isn't quite the same, is it.	ah , yeah , sometimes when that happens all you can do is hang out with friends . i know the feeling for sure"

"Despite working until a few hours before, I scored highly on the ACT the first time I took it back in high school years ago.	that ' s awesome ! did you feel really proud of your self when you took it back ?"
"Thanks. I thought I'd do poorly because I was tired.	congratulations . it ' s always good to take the act in the hands of a genius , i guess ."
"Not that long ago, my husband planned a secret trip for us! I didn't have a clue he was doing it and was pleasantly shocked. It was so much fun!	oh that sounds awesome , what a wonderful surprise . you must be very happy ."

I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act.

It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!	that ' s really cool . i have been lucky in the past to have had that chance to walk home with someone and it felt like my life was complete ."
"It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.	wow , you sound very lucky ! i would have been so grateful for that ."

"I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.	do you know what special dress you want to get ? ?"
"I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.	I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!	good for you ! what do you do with the money ?"
"It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.	please learn how to diet before you buy too many . don ' t overeat ."

"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room.

"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	why does johngethis not deserve a shrine for every animal that exists ?"
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	what did you see out there ? what was it ? !"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	what ? ? ? ! ! what ! ! ! ! ! do you know what it was ? i would have jumped out of my house ."
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	what are you hoping for ? do you want to repay him ?"
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	> it ' ll be fine , accept my advice before it ' s too late ."
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	what ? what did you do ? ? what was he lead you out too ?"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	that sounds so safe ! you must be so glad he was ready to help you . is it out there somewhere or just safely ?"
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	oh my god yes , those are so scary ! i ' ve never seen one in bed either . i bet it was terrifying"
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	oh man , a bit creepy . . . have you ever seen any of the out__start__ yeah - or flash likeds fly ?"
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	oh yes , i see . i wish i had a friend like that !"
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	what did he say ? ! : ) what was it exactly , if i may ask ?"
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	how long have you been together in person ? how old was he ?"
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	i ' m really sorry to hear i have lost many times , my brother has lost a dog and i know how difficult it can be . how old was he when he passed ?"
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	that is terrible , is it serious ? please tell me its not ."

"I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved.

I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.	that must have been a surprise ! but thank you for your support !"

Isn't that incredible?	i am really happy to hear that ! is this actually something that you do often , or has it always been secret ?"

Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.	what ' s worse , is you made the mistake of giving someone new the talk without telling them you ' re actually doing it ? i ' m not sure what ' s worse , hearing you claim to speak for yourself or your dog ."
"I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.	hey , you ' ll get to ketchup your own gonna if you really wanted to !"

"I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.	My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.	so you were able to teach her not to do that ?"
"I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.	oh , that ' s so cute ! well , i hope you can get her back soon !"

"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	oh wow . i bet your glad your ok ! do you use a diaper or do they check your food for allergy allergies ?"
"Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.	We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!	why did you order three diet cokes ? what did you do with them ?"

"Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.	that ' s awesome . where is handcuffs ? i loved that sunday service !"

"Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.	oh wow that ' s awesome . where are all of them staying ?"
"No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.	did have they been in the same city or did they move away ?"
"My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.	that is absolutely awful . i would ' ve probably just said that ' s what i paid for ."

"Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.	what kind of question ? hopefully you got one . did you do okay ?"
"My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.	that ' s pretty frustrating , i feel sorry for your husband ' s grand kids ."
"It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.	oh no , i am sorry to hear that . i hope they can stay together because being away from you kids is the worst ."

"No, I ended up just suffering through it and eating it.	oh no ! you ' re not allowed to talk about fun things like that ."
"Yeah, I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me.	I was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently, I bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better.	how do you like the outfit ? did you like it ?"
"Yea, it made me feel better about myself and my chances, or maybe i just like spending money	that ' s awesome ! do you plan to buy a haircut soon ?"

"I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!	oh , man , that ' s not right ! i ' ve been trying that dip for the past 20 minutes and i ' ve definitely been crying about lost food !"
"Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!	I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.	that is great news ! good job ! what do you do ?"
"It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!	that is awesome ! i ' m sure that was a big congratulations to you and your family ."

"Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.	i am sorry you were upset about that , but i think animal cruelty is not fair !"
"I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!	oh lord , what are they going to do now ? go to jail ?"
"Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.	When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup	ah i ' m guessing that was a well disappointing moment for you as i ' ve been a fan of - does this france team have a better track record then them ?"
"So good, genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!	i remember that match , was a very entertaining and emotional game ."
"But yeah - school started for the kids today and it was weird how quiet it was once the bus pulled away.	i think that ' s a very strange thing to have happen . did you make any friends ?"
"It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.	i don ' t blame you then , it seems to me like the schools are making an overload of kids these days ."
"Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!	i can understand how that might be hard sometimes . but i am sure you have some fun and new memories ."
"I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years, after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!	oh lord , i ' m afraid you ' ll never be free of this position ! have you talked to anyone about it ?"

"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	did they meid the farm owner ? have you contacted them ?"
"Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.	i agree with you . i don ' t think people should be cruelty prone to dying . what is wrong with people ."
"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	yeah , it was really hard . . . but we do have our good hipster people too . . . who i totally support ."
"And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!	i agree , for sure . but this is not one of those situations ."
"My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.	that ' s awesome , what type of play is it ?"

"How old are they?	they are 14 and they can still watch that movie every day ! i watch that every week with them ."
"Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL	My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.	oh boy , are you nervous ? where are you staying ?"
"On the one hand, I hope so but on the other hand, I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD	aww , that ' s too bad . maybe you can spend time with them instead ?"
"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	wow , i am very happy for you friend . are you teaching him to be safe"

"And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad, but I take comfort in those things.	My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked.

"I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!	i understand . don ' t worry about it . soon you will know where all the appropriate places to go ."
"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	i am so sorry that you had to go through that . that must have been hard ."
"Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.	well i am really glad to hear that you have moved on from it . well , i hope you are doing alright now ! that must have been so difficult . all i can recommend is to get a lawyer if you don ' t have one already . i hope it ' s not too time consuming ."

"He's such a worm. I can't stand it.	oh wow that ' s so jerk of him ! did you have to put him in his place ?"
"Working from home can be difficult when people won't leave me alone to get work done.	oh , i understand . are you any good at it ?"
"I love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video, gonna pull my hair out.	oh , how frustrating . that is how we get left to put things together too ."
"I have a big date coming up and I can't get these butterfly feelings to go away.	have you asked where she is ? is the date at least very far from the date , or does it seem bad ."

"Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her.

"It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing.	oh my gosh ! i bet that was a really hard time !"
"I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!	that sorry to hear but understandable . it ' s nice to have a good backbone like that though"
"I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.	have fun on your vacation ! do you think you ' ll be invited somewhere else ?"
"One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me, while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!	how oh well , isn ' t it beautiful that you two were able to touch like that ?"
"I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....	wow that is a really good story , that is so sad but very sad"

"No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.	oh no ! i hope that doesn ' t ever . . . i do hope you got some good looking bag of something to ease your mind !"

"It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more	50th birthday is a very different congrats ! where did you come from ?"
"A few weeks ago, my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things, and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.	do it ' s ok . just be yourself ! everyone has bad impersonal moments . i ' m sure you can learn from it ."
"Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later.	oh , don ' t apologize , there ' s only failure to apologize if you truly regret what you said . i hope it wasn ' t anything like what you happened to me and your husband did ."
"One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.	oh no , what happened ? ! ? ! ? ! was it the ghost ?"

"There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	do you give to the homeless often ? how did you manage to give to somebody ?"
"Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it.	hey man , do it for the people you care and don ' t want to harm . you should give them money everyday"
"When my children were born, it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.	what are you thinking of now ? do you like your children now ?"
"Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.	wow , congratulations ! that ' s amazing that you got so many children , that ' s amazing . my husband and i are both open to having children , but we ' re hesitant because our one is quite young and we don ' t know if we want more yet ."
"I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.	why did you do that ? what happened ? were you able to communicate your thoughts ?"
"Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.	what do you think about the situation where some guy is trying to say that all people are should be equal ?"
"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!	I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.	oh oh gosh , i know how you feel . i never drive and i ' m scared to drive too ."

"A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!	please tell me you ace that text , i hope you get it , you sound great"
"I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!	oh , that is terrible ! i remember well how it was when i was younger for those ics tests . did you ace them ?"
"Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!	I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	that sounds like a great time very nostalgic ! was it meant to be ?"
"It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?	that is not silly , you should definitely preserve them if you feel so inclined . what type of cards did you find ?"
"That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!	i am glad you had such a great experience ! i just got back so that ' s nice ."
"I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.	oh my ! when will they learn ? ? ? that ' s what they call congratulations ! ! ! !"
"When I was entering the store it was really slippery.	did you go inside to buy something or go to the dentist ?"
"It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.	did you do anything later that night ? are you ok ?"
"I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.	I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.	oh man ! what happened ? ? can you tell me ?"
"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	that is a really big secret , do you trust your friend enough to tell her ?"
"Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.	I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.	do you think they were giving away everything you know for a event that is near the end of your life ? the sad thing is that the movie probably won ' t happen ."
"I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.	oh no ! i can imagine how that must have been nervedr"
"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	that is great to hear ! is she enjoying the teaching part a good one ?"
"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	that ' s awesome . did she just learn how to drive in general ?"
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	how fun ! i hope everything goes well for you two !"
"I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!	i wonderful you have a safe drive ahead ! i hope she is able to drive her own car when the first years are over !"
"My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.	oh wow , sounds pretty exotic . how many people are you talking about ?"
"I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*	i hope you ' ll get it all done ! that sounds really risky but it sounds like a great idea ."
"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	oh wow that ' s really great ! i ' m so sorry you had to sell the house ."
"We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.	you have a very good sibling . it ' s important to have a good sibling ."
"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	congratulations ! that ' s a very wonderful story . we have lost many close friends over the years , myself included . i know how hard it is to lose our parents ."
"Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)	thats sounds really great advice . i hope you have a long life ahead of you ."
"My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.	hey congratulations to him ! if he wanted to becoming an actor , he should ' ve known what he wanted to do ."
"I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!	wow how cool . do they work the hardway ? and congratulations on the kid"
"Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.	hey know how it is . are you excited ? any good news yet ?"
"I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.	that ' s cool , what type of route will you be following ?"
"I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.	oh , i ' m so sorry ! i feel you . losing a family member is very difficult ."
"Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.	oh my gosh , i ' m so sorry to hear that ! i hope you are ok ! do you feel better now ?"
"Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!	i think what we are saying is if you have two parents , you have to do it over with them . i am sorry that it was such a scary experience for you"
"She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!	oh no , that ' s sad . hopefully you can put her in a better place though ."
"I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before	i ' m not really a gamer either , but i love my ps4 console"

She's such a wonderful mother.	oh my gosh . i am so sorry to hear that . my mother is in a tough place as well . i can only imagine what you have been through . i ' m really really glad your mother has your support ."
"I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.	i am very sorry for your loss . yes , i take my parents for granted sometimes as well , because they live close . i don ' t have a lot of patience for it ."
"I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!	i ' m very happy for you . what is your profession ?"
"The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...	oh man , that is me right now . people have been clumping around on video games since the late 70 ' s !"
"Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!	My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it	how far across the continent is he ? is he a little above the continent he is from ?"
"We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor	oh that is cool ! that sounds like a great friend to share it with ."
"I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten, with no collar, in a window well.	how sad ! that ' s such a cute kitten ! do you want more ?"
"We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!	aww , so very nice ! congratulations to you guys . you do a good job creating a safe and healthy community for the animals ."
"I felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself	awww ! i love suprise bird hunting , what kind of bird was it ?"

"I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!	oh dear , can ' t you just reopen the sorry to her ?"
"I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :(	i bet it is so hard to forget your own . i have done it before too and it is horrible ! i think you will forgive her eventually though !"
"You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???	I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party, not my greatest moment	pajamas are important sometimes . what happened ? were you late ?"
"I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret	pjs is pajamas more than likely , but that might have just been because you had the party in a dress ."
"I had some trippy nightmares as a kid, now I don't really have dreams	oh i can imagine you ' ll still have a good stare at what you ' ve got in your mind . just never get - you probably have to write a quilt ."

"I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards	tell me something about yourself . what was wrong with it>"
