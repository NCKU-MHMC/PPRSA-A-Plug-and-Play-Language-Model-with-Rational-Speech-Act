"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	That's really scary. Were you in a vehicle?"
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	That's good. I hope you got the sense to say sorry, but also don't feel bad about yourself."
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	Well, I am not sure. I do not know you"
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	I'm glad I'm okay. That's just the worst!"
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	That sucks, I am sorry to hear that."
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	That sounds great. It's always good to have someone to talk to."
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	Oh, that's awesome. What kind of music did you like?"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	That is awesome! I bet you were so excited!"
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	Oh no, that is terrible.  How did she die?"
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	That is so sad.  How is she doing now?"
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	That's good, how did it happen?"
"i was singing nursery songs :)	What were you singing?"
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	That's great news! I hope it's not a long time before you both have a steady income again."
"thank you so much!	What was it?"
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	That is so sad. Were you able to get the police?"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	I know how you feel."
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	That is awesome! What are you going to do?"
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	That's too bad.  How long have you been here?"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	That's a terrible thing to do. I would have been furious!"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	That's so rude. Do you know who got caught?"
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	That's crazy. I'm sure you were disappointed."
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	I know, it's so frustrating."
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	That is very nice of you! I have been in a situation like that."
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	That is very kind of you, but you should have told her."
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	Oh that's awesome. I am jealous!"
"i totally agree with you!	I'm glad we agree on something!"
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	I understand, I live in a different country as well, it can be hard sometimes."
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	That sounds like fun! What did you end up doing?"
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	I am so sorry that happened to you.  That is so not what I would expect from a parent."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	That is so true! It's like, they are so young and they just don't understand the world yet!"
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	I am with you. I hate bugs."
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	That's great. What was the conversation like?"
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	That's good to hear.  I bet she's doing well.  You must miss her."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	I bet you felt so happy!"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	That is very true, I am sure that feeling is very special."
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	I have, and I just got my taxes done.  It was a bit stressful, but it was worth it."
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	I've been there. I was in the military and I was in a bad place. I was in a bad place. But then I got out and I was able to get my life back on track."
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	that must have been tough"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	I am sorry to hear that.  I hope she recovers from it."
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	That is a good way to live"
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	That sounds so peaceful.  Is that something you can experience in your life?"
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	I am sure you were happy"
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	Oh wow, that is so cool! I'm glad you had a good time!"
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	That's really sad. I can't imagine having to live with all those girls."
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	I bet.  Are you going to your sister or mom?"
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	I agree, and it is a nice feeling when you have a child that you can be proud of."
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	I had a baby boy and a baby girl. I always loved having them co-sleep."
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	I love that place. Did you go there?"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	Wow, I am impressed.  What was you doing on Sunday?"
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	I have been in a similar situation once, it was so heartbreaking. I am glad you are thankful for your family."
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	I love this type of thing.  It's a great way to connect with kids."
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	I hope so!  I can only imagine how tough it must be for them."
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	I'm sure she was very understanding. I'm sure she was very patient."
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	I am so sorry to hear that. It's not cool to treat someone that way."
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	That is so sad. What happened to her?"
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	I am so sorry to hear that.  Did you have a close relationship?"
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	That's awesome! I've been working for a company that has a very different culture."
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	I am inspired by the fact that there is someone who actually cares. It's a great feeling."
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	I don't have the same issues as some people, but I'm sure it's very hard for others."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	I bet she's getting to be a big girl."
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	That's not too bad. What do you do when you do go out?"
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	I bet!  What was your time?"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	That was a great choice!  Did you have fun?"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	That sounds like a pretty cool experience!"
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that."
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	Wow, she sounds like a bad person."
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	I agree. It's a horrible thing to witness."
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	I am sorry to hear that.  Is it a physical reaction?"
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	I am sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is never easy."
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	Oh, I see. That is very nice of you."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	That sounds like so much fun! Did you get to go on any of the rides?"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	That sounds so fun.  I live in the East and I've never been to Disneyland."
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	I am sure it was nice to reconnect with him."
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	I love cars. What kind?"
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	I do, but I don't have a house."
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	I love labels and bins. I have a whole section in my kitchen dedicated to cleaning supplies and snacks."
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	I know what you mean. I have been doing that for years."
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	I think it would be great to have a universal way of communicating."
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	That's terrible. Why did it happen?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	That's scary.  I'm glad you were able to resolve the issue."
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	That's a lot of change. But it's a great opportunity to make new friends."
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	I am so jealous! I love travel!"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	That's a common thing I see.  What do you mean?"
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	You're right. Sometimes it's hard to see, but in the end, it's a good thing. You can't really regret the good things, though."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope he has forgiven you."
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	That's a good thing you did."
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	Oh man. That's horrible. I would be so mad. Did you tell your mom about it?"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	That is a very nice thing to do, it's always nice to have someone's apology, it shows you care about them and not just a person."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	I'm glad you are trying to take care of your health. I'm trying to do the same."
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	That's very true. I see a lot of people who do have one and they're very sad."
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	I can relate! My kids are grown now and I look at old photos and it makes me think about how far they've come."
"Are your kids adults now?	I'm not sure, but I'm not sure I want to be a parent again."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	I bet that was a fun experience for you.  Did you do it yourself or was it done by another person?"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	I feel you.  I've never been able to replicate a day that I was happy with."
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	I can understand that. Do you feel like you are in a good financial situation?"
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	What is your part time job?"
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	What happened?"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	Oh no, did you like him?"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	That sounds wonderful! I am jealous!"
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	That sounds so beautiful. I've never been there. How many days do you plan to stay there?"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	Oh no! Was anything else going on?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	Oh my god. That is so rude. I am so mad!"
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	Wow, what happened?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	That sounds really scary! Did you ever see him again?"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	Oh no what happened?"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	Wow, that's a pretty lame excuse! I would be very angry too."
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	Oh no! What happened?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	I am sorry to hear that.  Did you end up getting in trouble?"
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	Oh no, what happened?"
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	That's a bummer. I'm sorry you didn't get to see it."
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	I bet it was a friend of yours?"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.  Did he survive?"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	Oh wow! That is amazing! I love that he would surprise you like that!"
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	That is so sweet of you! I bet he was glad you were so kind to him."
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	I am glad to hear that! You must feel pretty good about it."
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	Oh I think so, I'm not sure."
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	How did that happen?"
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	That is crazy, I bet you were scared."
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	That is so rude! I would be so angry!"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	Oh, that is awful. I am so sorry. I bet you are still hurt."
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	That sounds awful! Did you call a repairman?"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	Yeah, I know what you mean. I was so frustrated and left my house!"
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	That is not good.  What did you do?"
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	That's not very nice of you.  I hope she finds someone who is a better fit for her."
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	I would be so shocked!"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	That is the worst! I bet she was shocked"
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	That sounds great! What are you going to do while you are there?"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	Oh, I love the Gulf. I have always wanted to visit there."
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	That's awesome! How old is she?"
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	Oh yeah, I remember that. I was so happy to be able to buy the things I wanted and not have to save up for them."
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	Oh wow. That's a pet peeve of mine too. I don't know why people don't clean up after themselves."
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	That's great, are you a regular at the store?"
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	That is awesome!  Did you have any kids?"
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	That is awesome! What are you waiting for?"
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	That sounds really nice."
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	I have no idea what that is.  I'm not sure I understand it."
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	That is a good point, I think that is one of the things that I like about a leader that you can trust to know how to surround themselves with good people."
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	I completely agree with you.  It's so hard to find someone who will actually take risks and be honest with you.  It's like they want to get away with it!"
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	I love baby belugas!"
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	What a great movie. I have seen it several times."
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	That's great! What did you get?"
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	That's great! You must be a very thoughtful person."
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	I think it was the guy who was supposed to pick up my car. He forgot."
"Did they give you any feedback?	Yeah, they did, they said I was too aggressive. I'm so upset!"
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	I agree, we should learn from our mistakes."
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	I'm sure they will.  Is she pregnant with a boy or girl?"
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	That is so sweet! I would have been so surprised if I had found out!"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	yea i was watching the show ""black-ish"""
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	I have heard of that series. I didn't watch it."
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	You're kidding, right?"
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	Well, I'm glad you were prepared! It's good that you were confident in your case."
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	oh wow thats amazing, what were you doing?"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	I know, it's so annoying when it's bad.  I always hate when it's bad."
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	I am sorry to hear that."
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	I am sorry to hear that, but it is nothing to be scared of, there are people who can help you."
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	Oh yeah. I hate when that happens. I know it's not fair, but you can't help but feel like you have to see them."
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	That's awesome!  I've been struggling to get into college, but I feel like my best friend is really on track.  I'm sure she's got a good teacher."
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	That is so cool. I am glad you have a good friend."
"I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.	Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.	I have never seen that happen before."
"I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.	I'm sure it's not the problem.  You'll figure it out."
"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	Oh really? What kind of puppy?"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	That is awesome!  What did you make?"
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	That's very nice of them!  I'm sure it was a big help to you."
"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed	Well, I'm sure that's true.  I wish you all the best."
"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.	That's great, I'm always looking for ways to be more independent."
"Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married	I'm sure you will be. Marriage is a great thing."
"My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.	I'm sorry, that sounds very stressful"
"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.	That's very smart of him."
"True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future."
"I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path	That's good.  What kind of doctor are you going to be?"
"That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?	I know right.  That would make me so sick."
"You could chat to them and complain!	What did you complain about?"
"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.	That was very kind of her."
"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	Oh wow, that's great! What city?"
"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.	That is quite a lot of animals"
"I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.	Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood	That was such a sad time.  It was a time of great change."
"I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era	What era are you talking about?"
"The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.	That's awesome. I can't believe it's been so long since my kids were born."
"Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.	I understand, I think I will try to go back to Facebook as well, I don't have any friends there anymore"
"How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.	I am 30.  I was a kid in the 80s.  I had a pretty cool ride in my childhood.  A 1969 Camarosa."
"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	I know right? I've had my share of bullies in school."
"Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?	I did, but it wasn't easy. I got in trouble for being mean to my friend's kids."
"I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.	I'm happy for you. How did it turn out?"
"Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.	I know, it's a terrible movie."
"My parents keep taking my money	What do you do?"
"They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.	That's true. I'm always running around saving money for something, and sometimes I forget to save it."
"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!	That's a good question.  It's like they think they're going to have to clean up after their children one day."
"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)	I'm a peanut butter and jelly kind of guy.  I like my life simple and quiet."
"The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.	That's awful. What happened?"
"She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.	Oh no, that is terrible. Did she hurt?"
"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.	Oh my, that is very sweet."
"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	I'm sorry to hear that. How did you heal?"
"A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.	That's really tough. What did you do?"
"We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!	What a wonderful person!  I'm glad you were able to get a ride.  Was it a new car or was it just a car that someone was willing to give you?"
"Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind.	I'm glad people are kind, but sometimes people are not."
"Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.	I have.  I think I did it for my 30th birthday.  It was a really nice surprise."
"That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.	That's awesome! What a good year to do it."
"Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops.	It was raining hard one night and the power shut off	I hate when that happens. I hope it was just for a short time."
"Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles	That's nice. I don't have any lighters."
"One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam. It was hard and I studied all night.	I bet you did well"
"I ended up actually getting a 98%!	Wow! That is a great score. What did you get it on?"
"Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.	Do you have any pets?	Yes, I have a dog. I've always wanted a cat."
"Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff.	I have a cat too. I hate when they get out of their cage."
"My son graduated.	That is so awesome. I am sure he will do great things."
"Highschool.	Oh wow. What's that?"
"One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.	That's so sad. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Did you stay in touch with your daughter?"
"I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.	Oh no, that's so sad. Did you see them?"
"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	That's really cool. What kind of business?"
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	That's really cool, it's like you have to have a passion and a work ethic to do something like that."
"I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.	That's terrible. I would be very upset with you."
"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..	That's pretty sweet, I'm sure she didn't think you were a jerk. I've got a cousin who is like that."
"No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.	That's nice, I love that kind of gift, especially if you had to go to a good price"
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?	Well, I don't think I do, I don't know how people listen to radio anymore."
"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..	Yeah I know how you feel, I had a very close friend die of cancer last year and it was very hard to deal with."
"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I lost my cat about 4 years ago and it was so hard."
"It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(	That is terrible. I hope he is ok."
"Thank you. I appreciate that.	I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.	It's always hard when we lose our pets."
"The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha	Yeah, it sucks. I've been sick for weeks."
"Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.	Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends, so gross.	I would have been so grossed out.  Do you have any idea what caused it?"
"Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it	I am not a fan of shellfish either. I have had sushi with them before, but I have never had shellfish before."
"You don't care for sushi that much?	I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!	Oh wow! That's crazy! I bet it was a funny one!"
"I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!	That is great. What happened?"
"My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.	I'm sorry to hear that. It's not easy breaking up with someone, especially if you've been together for a long time."
"I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.	That is a tough decision. Do you have any experience in the military?"
"I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.	I can understand that. It's a scary thought, but it's a good one to think about."
"We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha	I'm not a fan of chameleons."
"I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.	I'm sorry to hear that.  How did you find out?"
"I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.	What are you hoping for?"
"I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.	That's great. What's your name?"
"I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.	I hope you get to see her soon."
"I am very lucky, my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?	I'm not sure, but I do have a great one this year."
"Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!	Oh wow!  That's a nice surprise!  What did you do with the tequila?"
"For sure, maybe you need new friends!	5	I'm not sure what you're asking."
"I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.	That sounds terrible. I hope you guys can get over it soon."
"I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.	That is really scary. Did you go outside to see what it was?"
"Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt, though.	Oh no! I hope they are okay! I am so sorry to hear that."
"Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?	Oh yes! I do! I love it!"
"Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha	I've never tried it before but I've heard it's good for you. What is it?"
"I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.	I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me, even to this day.	That's really nice of her, she sounds like a really good person."
"I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.	I wish I had someone to love."
"You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?	I am not sure, I am just feeling down."
"But you failed the exam? Did you revise?	I did not fail but I did not study much. I am going to study for my next exam."
"At least you know for next time eh?	My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.	That is amazing, I am sure she is very proud of you!"
"She's amazing. Do you love your mom?	I do. I love my mom. She's the best."
"I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.	I'm sorry to hear that.  I've been there.  It's always tough."
"It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month, so I will likely discuss it when she returns.	I'm sorry to hear that. How long will she be away?"
"That sounds tough. What do you do/	I am trying to help my family with their financial troubles. It is hard to do but it is necessary."
"That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.	I am very much paid well."
"Fair enough. As long as you look after your back""	I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.	That's great. What are your plans after graduation?"
"Environmental engineering! I enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.	I'm not sure I understand what you mean by passion in life. I'm not sure I want to be passionate about something"
"I watch so many scary movies that I haven't been able to sleep alone in years due to fear.	I know the feeling. I used to be scared of the dark too but now I just love it."
"I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.	That is a good thing. I am glad you have that."
"I've been telling myself that for years, I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?	I'm a huge fan of the Hunger Games series."
"What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?	I love the movie ""The Conjuring"""
"Donald Trump is now the president. It makes me feel bad about life.	I don't have any issues with that. I have no problem with him being president."
"I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him, too.	I am so tired of the liberal politicians and their policies.  I am glad they are not in charge."
"I am now going to be a master's student. I will got to he University of Florida	Wow, that's exciting. You must be very proud."
"Environmental Engineering is my major. I enjoy it.	That is cool. What field of engineering is it?"
"I have been feeling very faithful these days. My lover treats me so well.	That is so great! I wish I could be that happy."
"He is really nice and provides for me well. He is also very sweet and very respectful.	That's very sweet of him. What is his name?"
"Do you like to go through old family pictures?	I do, I love looking at old pictures of my family."
"Absolutely. I love to hear my mÃ¡mÃ¡ tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.	What a lovely story. I like to hear about my own mousters when they tell me stories."
"I also love to look through the old scrapbooks my mom made when I was a baby and young child. I find it's so funny to see what you looked like as a child.	I recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another. I am incredibly jealous of him.	That is awful.  Did you tell him about it?"
"I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?"
"How long?	I think you meant ""How long?"""
"About what exactly?	It was about a conversation I had with a friend."
"Now that is an interesting perspective!	My mother recently went to the bank for me. I love her so much.	That's very kind of her. I bet it was very expensive to get her to do that."
"Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!	I agree.  I don't know what I would do without good people in my life."
"My father almost died. His recent health problems have been devastating.	That's terrible. Did he survive?"
"It is tough, but I think I will make it.	How did you make it through this tough time?"
"My friend bought a new car. This makes me so jealous!	That's really bad, you should be happy for him."
"It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it doesn't affect your self-esteem too much."
"I recently met a new person that I am very fond of. I want to give her my love and care.	I love that!  Are you going to take her out on a date?"
"I am very happy, too. Do you have someone special in your life?	I do!  I have a sweetie and I love her so much.  I'm so happy!"

"I one time lost my trunks in the pool! People saw me in a way I didn't want!	What happened?  Did you get a scolding?"

"The pizza was from my favourite pizza shop as well! Quite the sad moment.	Oh no, did they cancel your order?"
"I was getting keys out of my pocket, and then WHAM, right on the floor. The pineapple slices were the first to fall on the floor.	Why does McDonalds always get my order wrong! I said no lettuce!	I don't get why. They're supposed to be on top of their game."
"Sometimes I think the management don't even care!	I agree.  Have you called them?"

"She made me pay twice what they would have sold for at the bake sale. The cookies were for charity, you see.	That is so unfair.  I would have been mad too.  I would have given them a lot of money."

"My son worked for many years to be a footballer, he finally signed a pro contract!	That is amazing, I hope he has a good career!"
"He's just joined Juventus. Can't be more happy for the lad.	I think he's going to do great things!"
"4 months later he will be here. It has taken me around 3 months to save up enough money to be ready for him when he's born	I am glad you are ready for the baby."
"yes it is. I am very happy	Oh really? What's making you happy?"
"only child for now. name is RAIDEN (god of thunder) :D	On my way home from work, a massive bat chased me!	Oh no! Did you run away?"
"I know! This one was absolutely huge, almost human sized. Chased me for a whole hour. The more I think about it, it might have been the batman! I shouldn't have stolen those diamonds!	I love Batman.  What were the diamonds for?"
"Every day I thank God for my blessings. I'd be in hole right now if it weren't for HIM	I really believe that He is always with us and we should be grateful for what we have"
"especially since he takes care of us even though don't deserve it	Did he do something for you?"
"Once during an important school sporting event, my entire sports team was counting on me but mid-way through my event, my shorts fell down and I tripped	Oh man that would be embarrassing."
"yea! it was! I thought everyone would be annoyed at me but the next day when I went back to school, everyone just made it a joke so its alright. This was about 5-6 years ago now haha	That is good to hear. I am glad that you are able to laugh about it."
"I love youtube. been listening to all my classic tracks. Tupac forever	I love YouTube too! I can watch the videos of all the music videos and listen to them."
"I started out with one hit wonders but ended up at Pac. I miss my youth lol	What is Pac?"
"When I was younger, my dog died. He was getting up there in age, but he was still on the young side. Later, we heard the pet food we had been feeding him had been recalled because of similiar fatalities.	Oh no, that's terrible.  I'm sorry to hear that."
"No, they just had a recall. Apparently they didn't clean out their machines properly when making the food, so it got contaminated.	Oh no, I hope they were able to clean it up and get it back on the market."
"Seeing people who have less than me just makes me so grateful for the blessings I have been given	I agree, it's hard to appreciate what you have when others have so much less."
"absolutely! Always give to people who have less than myself :)	That's good to hear."
"hiding for almost 2 years but I'm still not over my paranoia that one day I will have to pay for what I did. Don't ask what it was	I am sorry to hear that. Are you sure you did not do something wrong?"
"no way. I just pray she can forgive me. I could never admit to this sin. Jesus save me	That is a very hard thing to admit to. I'm glad you are praying for forgiveness."
"When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So, when he had his back turned, I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.	Wow! What did he do after that?"
"Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.	Oh wow, I bet you were scared."
"after she got her 1st job and new car, she started doing girls night out. Out until 3am one morning. I checked her chat history and sure enough she had kissed another guy >:(	Oh no! Did you confront her about it?"
"jealous isn't the one I felt. I wanted to rip her apart lol	I am happy for you."
"My dad always worked his ass off at a job he didn't like in order to support us, doing a lot of back breaking work as a caretaker. He even had a second job at Wal-mart for a while. I have no idea how he managed to do that sort of thing.	That's amazing. I bet he is very proud of himself."
"Yeah, especially because we were single income. My mom homeschooled my brother and I. I think he took only a handful of sick days his entire time working, had something like 600 days saved up when he retired.	That's really smart of her."
"I think he got 3 weeks a year, only used like 5 days.	That's not a lot of time for work"
"my instincts are never wrong. I found out her lies when I checked her facebook chat history.	That's really interesting! Do you think she was lying to you or not?"
"she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t-shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other. Made me so mad	Oh wow, that's so terrible! Did she have the nerve to tell him?"
"I never thought she would tell anyone and make it seem like I did something wrong. I didn't force her	I would have been furious."
"ye and so I had to leave the country because of her	I'm sorry to hear that. Is everything okay now?"
"Public school really sucks sometimes. Making boys shower all together. I didn't want to but had to or else fail PE	I'm glad you didn't want to. That's not a good situation."
"yes. Well it was a long time ago but I haven't forgotten	What happened?"
"My mom homeschooled me when I was little. I was in public school till first grade, but after that I was homeschooled. Did take a semester in grade 11 though to make sure I was up to current standards.	I am glad you had that option. I would have been so anxious about not having anyone there."
"Really? I didn't even know that was an option. Then again I'm 25 so it may not have been available then.	I know right. I was thinking of getting a tattoo but then I read about it and I'm so not sure."
"I still haven't got over it. Brandon Lee RIP. I was 17 when I found out he died during filming. I visited the area he took his last steps a couple years ago	That is so sad.  I have heard that he was a nice guy."
"Now the remake is well on its way. Maybe it can lift this depression I feel if they stay true to the story. Jason Mamoa isn't bad looking	I think the original was a lot better. I'm happy to hear that they're making one."
"I had to adapt to life. I had to change to survive. Now I feel better	Oh, that's so true, I had to adapt to life too."
"I am reminded every day that I can survive anything. A friend gave me a special bracelet (paracord)	What does it do?"
"I recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years.	That's terrible. What are you going to do?"
"Very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way. It makes me think less of her as a person.	Oh yeah, it's no fun to be around people who do that."
"I was sucker punched when I was 17. The guy broke his hand and fled the scene. I saw him one time after this riding a bicycle but didn't do anything.	That's awful, I am so sorry. What did you do?"
"I wasn't confident. Now I regret not punishing him.	You must have been very afraid of him."
"I recently completed my masters degree in education at almost 40 years old. I feel really pleased with myself.	That's awesome!  What subject did you study?"
"Thanks! It was a huge challenge, and I'm SO glad to have it behind me!	That's great! How long did it take you to finish?"
"Being a mom is great, too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks!	I can't wait to go back to school!"
"I feel happy about the new house I have and that I can work from home. Thanks be to God	I'm glad you have a home.  I've been struggling to find a place to call my own."
"It took me 9 months of determination and sacrifice. But worth it.	You did well! 9 months is a long time to go through a tough time."
"I blamed myself for her fall because I wasn't close enough to prevent it. I took care of her for months afterwards.	That's very thoughtful of you.  I bet she appreciated it."
"I was distracted by the sound of running water.	That sounds interesting, what was happening?"
"I can't get enough of music today. Especially all my songs/bands from when I was in my twenties.	I am a fan of music too. I have my own music collection."
"Its true though, they can't make good music these days. Not in ANY genre.	Oh, I know what you mean. I think you're right."
"I get paid today and I'm getting this new game I've been waiting on to be released!	That's awesome! I bet you can't wait to play it!"
"I'm thinking about getting FarCry 5. I pre-order for the early release! I'm really excited about it.	It's a really good game, but it's not new this year. I'm not sure it's worth it."
"Hi, I joined a firm 6 months ago and then I got a promotion for Junior Manager	Oh wow, congratulations! What position is it?"
"yes, They thought that I have some extraordinary talent and that is the reason I got that position	That's great!  What position is it?"
"Maybe yes, Haha, Now I am looking for a Manager post and then become a senior manager	Oh wow, that is quite a move.  I wish you the best of luck in your search."
"Hi, I have applied for a driving license thrice and I have failed in all the thee	Wow, that is so disappointing.  How long have you been trying to get your license?"
"Yes, I am a little uncomfortable driving backwards. I just can't do that.	I am sure you will be fine, it's just a little thing."
"every time I try not to hit that cone but those are so close.	I know right?"
"I still can't believe my life is where it's at, especially if you look at the past few years. I would never believe you if you told me I would be here.	I'm glad you're happy. I'm sure the rest of your life is good as well."
"Well, for many years I was an alcoholic, working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!	That's great news! What kind of University did you go to?"
"It does. I worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests, and I couldn't believe when I passed with flying colors!	That's great.  You must be proud!"
"Yesterday, I was standing in a lift and a man next to me whispered in my ears that your zip is open.	I think you're right. What did you do?"
"It was just very creepy situation	I'm sorry, what happened?"
"lol thats funny	My hubby lost his job a couple of months ago but he has an interview this friday so i pray he will get that job	That is good news.  I hope he does get it and you get the job too."
"armed security	I am so scared of them. I have been carrying a gun for years."
"I stayed alone at night in a office due to excessive work and was much scared.	That sounds really scary.  Was there someone there with you?"
"no, I was on a 10th floor and security was down. I was scared even with a single noise.	Oh no! I'm glad you made it out."
"I have been awarded with a degree in marketing.	That's great! Congratulations!"
"it took 4 years but at last got it	I'm so happy for you! What did you get?"
"Yeah,  I have  a job that I was looking for and now I am really enjoying my life.	Hey, have you ever been in a car wreck?	No, I haven't. I don't think I would be very brave enough."
"I was in one about 2 years ago. No one was hurt, but it totaled both of our cars.	Oh wow, that must have been very upsetting. Did you find out why?"
"Have you everr been in a fist fight with anyone?	I haven't but I have been in a few."
"I got in a fist fight with my step father once. It wasn't a fun experience as you can imagine.	That's a terrible thing to do. Did you end up getting in trouble?"
"Have you ever played and old video game called Everquest?	I haven't. Is it good?"
"It came out in 1999. I used to play it when i was a teen. I installed it the other day and had a good time playing.	That's cool.  What kind of game is it?"
"Have you ever eaten at Hardee's?	I have. I love it."
"I like it too, but I'm not a big fan of their new sliders. They're so tiny, and just one of them cost almost 2 dollars!	Well, that's too bad! I don't get it, but I love their burgers."
"Have you ever had a sleep paralysis dream?	I have. They are so scary!"
"Yeah, in mine I saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me. I've never been more scared in my life.	That sounds terrifying!"
"Have you ever rode on a roller coaster?	oh yeah! i love roller coasters!"
"I hate riding them, but i used to machine components for their drive chain when I was a machinist.	That sounds very interesting. I'm always looking for new projects."
"A while back my friend's boyfriend tried to get me to have an intimate relationship with him. He knew I had been married a very long time, as well as he was in a relationship with my friend. I turned him down flat, as I love my husband very much.	I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you were able to have a good conversation with him."
"Yes, I let him know that was wrong and disgusting. I couldn't believe he did it!	I'm so sorry to hear that.  I can't imagine doing something like that."
"Yes, as I am honest with him. But, I didn't want trouble.	I'm going overseas and I think I packed everything i need!	That's awesome! Where are you going?"
"Going to Kazakhstan. That's where i was born. My parents still live there and i miss them so much	I've never been, but I've heard it's a beautiful country. I wish you a wonderful trip."
"Hi, My girlfriend was recently let go of her job, but she put so much work in to finding a new job and got one with better pay!	That is great news!  That is a good thing to see.  You must be really happy for her!"
"Yes I agree, she was so happy when she found out the job was hers	That's great! What job?"
"She wasn't really fired, her position was no more. Schools don't have much room left for Home Ec teachers. Sad	That is a shame. I am sorry."
"Yeah she has a passion for teaching. These kids will be great to work with.	So about a year ago now, my girlfriend decided to surprise me with a puppy!	I'm glad she did! I'm sure it was very fun to have a puppy in the house!"
"Yes, so nice!! It was the best thing that could've happened! It's a German Shepherd!	That's awesome. I love dogs."
"There was this one time I was fairly drunk at a bar and this attractive girl was trying to make moves on me, but I did my best to ignore it all.. Having a girlfriend and all.	That is very nice of you. I hope you won her heart."
"I was very proud definitely when I woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!	Wow, that's good to hear! What happened?"
"There was this one time my girlfriend and I had plans to meet a Longhorn steakhouse for a date.. She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.	I bet you were. Did she apologize?"
"Yes, she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!	You must be very happy!"
"I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!	Did you do anything fun this week?"
"i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long... but i'm a mom so i don't sleep in. ever	That's a tough life. I'm sure you're very good at it though."
"I had to cancel a trip to see my brother after it started snowing heavily.	Oh no, did you have to find another way to go?"
"Yes, when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous, and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.	I can imagine, it's a pretty scary situation."
"It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.	That would have been a good idea."
"When my parents got divorced when I was a kid, it was one of the hardest things for me.	Oh my goodness, that must have been very traumatic."
"It does definitely get easier over time I suppose.. Now that I see my life I guess it was for the best.	That is a good point. I have been thinking the same thing."
"Just the other day my girlfriend and I were getting ready for the beach, but right before we left it started to pour rain.	Oh no! Did you get wet?"
"Well, when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!	I bet that was exciting!  Did you go somewhere fun?"
"There was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family.	That's sweet! I would have loved to be there."
"Yes, the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.	That is nice."
"There was this one time I stole a shirt from my friend, and I feel pretty guilty about it.	That's not a good thing to do.  How did it work out?"
"Because I really liked it, and didn't think he'd care.	Why didn't he care?"
"My girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week, I was very lonely during this experience.	I'm sure you missed her, but it's good you have some other activities to keep yourself occupied."
"I mainly just played video games and watched tv.	That sounds like a pretty lazy way to spend your time."
"I moved to a new apartment and they didn't accept my dog breed, so I had to give her up. :(	I am sorry to hear that, I know how that feels."
"Because here in my area in Florida, there isn't too many options for me.	I am sorry to hear that. Is it a problem with the area?"
"My mom doesn't have a ton of money, but last christmas she made sure to get me some awesome things!	That is awesome.  What did she get you?"
"She got me a brand new laptop I had been wanting for gaming!	What kind of laptop is it?"
"I went on this ride at the beach called the Slingshot.. It shoots you super high up in the air.. It was so teriffying, I had so much faith in the ride I wouldn't die!	I've never been on a Slingshot. What did you do on it?"
"It was seriously so scary, I almost pooped myself!	What happened?"
"There was this time I went to the bar with my girlfriend and once I came out of the restroom, I saw her talking to some guy!	That is terrible.  How did you react?"
"Well I get super jealous and angry of course.. But in the end it was just a work friend.. Oops!	That is unfortunate. I'm sorry to hear that."
"My dog randomly got up on my couch last week, and just started peeing.. Like what!?!?!??!?!	I would be mad. Did you scold him?"
"Not since lunch, so it's actually been about 4 hours.. I hate living on the top floor!	That must be so frustrating. Are you in a new apartment?"
"I finally graduated college last year, it felt like it took SO long!	I am so happy for you! What are you doing now?"
"Yes, I am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!	That's great! What did you accomplish?"
"My girlfriend saw me kissing another girl, who was kissing ME at the bar.. I was very drunk..	Oh wow, I bet that was a wild night.  Did you try to make it up to her?"
"No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.	Oh wow, I am sorry to hear that."
"There was this one time I was driving down the road, and this guy on a sports bike popped a wheelie.. It was so sick!	Oh wow.  What did you do?"
"I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!	Oh man, I think you need to get a helmet and a bike before you try to ride one!"
"When i was younger, I came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead.	That's terrible. I hope you are doing okay."
"He was very old, so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!	That's great. I'm glad he lived a good life."
"My dog chewed a hole in my carpet 2 weeks ago.. I was very disgusted to say the least!	That is no fun at all! I hope your dog didn't chew up anything important."
"Oh dang, I guess I can't complain too much then, that's brutal!	What happened?"
"I have to go to confession at the church... i was a little mean to my mom, sometimes its difficult to be always nice	I'm sure she'll forgive you!  What did you do?"
"Well yes when i shouted and i inmeaditelly apologize but i feel really bad	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"We walked, we ate ice cream, we rode a bike, we laughed a lot, we enjoyed the outdoors, we were exhausted	Oh that sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a good time?"
"I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul	I know what you mean. I feel the same way about my wife."
"Sometimes one gives priority to work	The world is very beautiful	It is, but I love my home."
"Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice	I know right? I have been in nature so much lately. I am getting a little crazy from it."
"People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life	I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.	What was their name?"
"Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself, is it?	That is a good point.  I was really impressed by the way the first lady handled the situation."
"As a kid, I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.	That's too bad. I don't get why people are afraid of tornadoes."
"That's the thing -- NO! I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!	Oh, I understand, I grew up in a basement.  That's the worst."
"My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said ""You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that."" For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)	What did she mean by that?"
"I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated, really.	That is a common thing to do, I am sure you have done it before."
"Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.	I have to agree, it's about people, not things."
"I do look at that as a strength, in anyone. Being able to say ""I'm sorry"" and ""I made a mistake.""	I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!	That sounds like a very exciting time! I have never made an overseas move."
"I highly, highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.	What did you like about it?"
"i would fear my gift	I hope you like it."
"my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me	That is great!  I would be happy to get an iPhone.  What kind did you get?"
"yes but its a valuable gift to me	That's nice. What is it?"
"yeah but this gift is definitely different for me	I have such an amazing husband! He works so hard so i could stay home with our baby	That's so sweet. I'm sure you appreciate him."
"he is an armed guard	That's good, how old is he?"
"I have a pretty bad vision so i'm so scared to drive at night	I understand, I also have bad vision."
"yes, i even have glasses but because of astigmatism i don't see good at night even when i have glasses on	i have astigmatism too.  i see good in the day but not at night."
"It seems like today everyone in the grocery store was in such a rush. Hurrying around!	I know. I was in there and it was like everyone was in a panic."
"Yes! They cut in front, and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it	That's terrible. I would be so angry."
"I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible	I know, I'm sleep deprived too.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope you get some rest soon."
"i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible	I know, it's awful."
"I love being around them and it's great to see them each year.	That's a great way to spend time with family."
"O I'm sorry, my niece and nephews, only seem in the summer. Do you get company during the summer?	I do, but I don't get to see them as often as I would like.  I have a few close friends who are also parents of kids and they all get to have summers off."
"My kids are going into 7th and 8th grade in a couple weeks. They really are growing up well	That's great. How are they doing?"
"My oldest daughter has some learning disabilities so I'm really proud of how she is doing. They're both growing up so fast	Oh that is so sad. I am so sorry to hear that."
"i paid all my bills today, i feel so relived and good	That's great, how did you pay them?"
"rent and electricity. we've been struggling financially so it's such a relieve to pay bills	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you."
"I studied so hard for my bar exam so that I could become a lawyer. I prepared for almost 3 months straight!	That is impressive! Did you pass the bar?"
"I did pass! It was a rough 3 months, but once I got there, I felt like I was ready.	Oh that is great to hear!  I hope it was a great experience for you."
"I was about to book a flight for my baby and i and i was so surprised to find out i didn't need to pay for my baby'sticket	Oh wow, I've never had that happen before. Did you have to pay for your baby's ticket?"
"i know! now i can spend the rest of the money on something cool	Oh man! You're going to have a blast!"
"my husband called me a punk today for no reason. and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn't even understand why	That is awful.  What did you do?"
"no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes	I bet! Are you guys in a long distance relationship?"
"When I was younger, I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive, because i didn't want to get into an accident.	I know how you feel. I was scared too."
"I tried to tell myself that, but my dad got into a really bad accident once, and it has scared me ever since.	Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you are not too traumatized by it."
"I recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches.	Oh cool. I've never done that before. I've always just left them to grow wild."
"Yea, i put them in a glass of water for a week or two and they grow their own roots, wasn't expecting much.	Did they grow any mushrooms?"
"I do yes! and since the method i used is working, i have tons of tomatoes!	That's great! I hope you enjoy them!"
"Around town it seems like traffic has been horrible lately. Driving around town is just crazy.	I hear you.  I'm a bit tired of driving on the highway because there are so many cars."
"Yes, exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!	I hate that. I always get frustrated when people do that."
"A few years ago, I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other, so we met up in person!	Oh, that's cool. I'm not very good at video games, so I don't really play."
"I'd say it's going pretty well, we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?	I met my friend through our families."
"OKay. I care for everyone	I bet you do. I'm glad to hear that."
"Thanks, I hope I am. You sound like one too	What do you mean?"
"because you gave me a compliment, which I feel is a genuine one	I recently had a one night stand with a woman from my past. It caught both of us off guard	I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a good experience?"
"Yes, it was a very interesting time. I wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations	That's a good thing. How long have you been apart?"
"My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!	That is amazing! I bet you are so happy!"
"She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.	That is true, I used to be like that."
"I walked my dog outside, and she still pooped in the house! Ugh.	That is so awful."
"Yeah...Even though I take her outside, 10 minutes later, she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?	Oh, that is terrible!  Why does she do that?  Is she not trained?"
"I think being with my husband makes me a better person	I agree. He must be a great partner."
"Definetly, he's my best friend forever.	Oh? Who is that?"
"I really don't like when things happen when noone is home.	You mean like when someone breaks into your house?"
"Like stuff falling off shelfes because a dog runs into them! Hah, crazy I know.	That is hilarious. What kind of dog?"
"I really love my life right now.	That is great! What is the best part?"
"Nothing really! I just love that I can work at home and have time to clean or cook whenever I want.	That's so nice! I love that too, but I have to go to work too."
"Right? And no having to interact with others unless we choose too.	That is true. Some people just don't want to interact with others."
"So i just got home and all of my friends were there for a birthday party i have no clue! can you imagine my reaction?	I would be shocked! Did they invite you?"
"Well the party was for me, hahaha they really got me on that one!	Did you have fun?"
"Its not fun being reminded of things you've forgotten.	Why is that?"
"Owed money to my mother in law for something, $15, she reminded me in a less then nice way.	Oh no!  That's awful.  What did she say?"
"Exactly, especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.	I went to San Antonio the other day, was great to see that city.	Oh that is a great place to visit. I have never been there."
"O really? What's your favorite thing there?	I have a lot, but if I had to pick one I would say my favorite thing is my dog."
"I just got back from my graduation! can you imagine after 5 years i graduated with the highest score of my college in the past 20 years!	Oh wow. Congrats! What college did you graduate from?"
"Yes! i studied so hard, can you imagine how i feel? i cannot believe it!	I bet you feel really good about it."
"I hate the sight of someone throwing up. My nephew did that the other and day and man.	I don't like the smell either.  How did he get so bad?"
"Yea, he had eaten to much sugar and well, it didn't end well	What happened?"
"I came home from work and step barefoot on one of my sons legos, i was so pissed!	oh no!  did you scold him?"
"Yes, i was so mad i always tell them to pick the toys up.	What toys are you talking about?"
"My mother in law got to eat Qdoba today, one of my favorite places I haven't had in awhile	Wow, did she get a large order?"
"No way. queso all the way! They don't have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did.	That sounds like a great time!  I love queso!"
"Yesterday i watch on tv a kid who could speak 4 different languages at age 3, i was in shook!	oh wow thats amazing!"
"Well they are called wonder kids! i was in wonder, i also read about one who just graduated from college at age 11	That's awesome! What school did they go to?"
"My husband is quite impressive to me.	What is it that makes him impressive?"
"Yea, he's become the best manager in his market in just 3 years.	Wow. What a guy! I wish I had the talent to manage."
"This afternoon i went to my sons soccer game and he scored three goals! happiest dad ever!	Oh that's so great! I bet you were so happy!"
"Yes! i love him so dad, but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play, he dedicated the three goals to me!	Oh, that's really nice of him."
"I was doing a presentation for work, and tried to tell a story about something kind of related to break the ice.  No one laughed or even really cracked a smile, so it put me off for the rest of the presentation.	That is unfortunate, did you try to tell a funny story?"
"Yeah, and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking, but at least should have gotten a chuckle.	Did you read it yourself?"
"My wife went to Germany to attend a language course at the end of June.  I've been mostly spending time with my dogs while she's been gone since we recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	I know the feeling!  I've been in a similar situation.  I hope you have fun in Germany and don't miss her too much."
"That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me, I should look into that.	I love to go to the dog park and play with my dogs."
"Something I did not expect from a neighbor, this morning he gave me some beautiful flowers	I love it! What kind of flowers?"
"It was a nice gesture on his part. But I do not know	You mean the one you are referring to?"
"But beyond that. Small gestures make others' lives happier	My neighbor has a really annoying little dog that she always brings outside when she's smoking.  It barks constantly at everything and she doesn't try to keep it quiet.	That's terrible. Are you at least able to communicate with her about it?"
"A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically, but this one is just terrible.	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a pet?"
"This morning my husband received a call, he got nervous, I think it was a woman ... difficult	Oh no, did he get upset?"
"I think so ... I'm a little worried, because of the situation	I'm sorry to hear that. What's happening?"
"Thank you for your solidarity	I have a great picture from my wedding where my friends and I are in a circle having a shot, makes me want to go hang out with them again.	Oh, that's so cute. I love that kind of pictures."
"Yeah, we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to Graduate school.	That's so cool. I'm glad that you are able to live far away from each other."
"Yesterday, a difficult day, the anniversary of the death of my mother	Oh my goodness, I am so sorry to hear that.  It must have been a tough day."
"Thank you for your solidarity	I am happy to be a part of your life."
"seven years .... I miss her	I went for an interview for a job I really wanted and ended up waiting a long time before I heard anything.  I managed to keep my spirits up for a good long while.	That is the way to go. It is hard to lose faith, but it is worth it in the end."
"I did actually!  It's a good job, especially since the market where I am isn't great for my field.	That's great! I'm glad you found a job that you like."
"My daughter is angry with me, she says she does not need me, because I scolded her	I would be angry too.  What did you say?"
"She is 9 years old but she is a very focused girl	I bet she is, I think my 9 year old is the same."
"that's right ... but I think I've surpassed	Hello, tomorrow I have the cooking test and I feel safe. I am sure that I will approve with an excellent rating	That's great! You must be confident in your cooking skills."
"have my own restaurant	oh thats awesome, how long have you been working at it?"
"with work, effort and clarity in the goal ... I will surely arrive	I'm so happy i made enough money yesterday to pay my bills!	That is great!  Did you have to work hard to get it?"
"yes, such a relieve!	Oh yes, did you have a great time?"
"Sometimes we have angels, called friends, I'm happy because God sent me mine	I'm so glad you have friends. I am very lucky to have a few."
"We are 12 years old, but we have had difficult moments, but we have overcome it	That's awesome!  I'm glad you guys have been able to do that."
"That's right ... I'm happy	my son behaved badly with his friend, I treat him badly, I had to punish him	I'm sure your son felt bad about it. Did you give him a good talking to?"
"He is 12 years old, but he must understand that friendship is something sacred	That's so true!"
"he hit him and said a bad word	When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. It was so fucking annoying	I can understand that. I feel the same way. I had to work hard to get where I am now."
"I do my best but sometimes that's super hard. I guess that's just one of those things everyone got to deal with.	I feel you.  I know a lot of people in my community have to deal with that.  It can be so frustrating."
"You too, thank you!	I went to a job interview a few days ago, and I feel like I totally rocked it!	That's awesome, good for you."
"Thanks a bunch! It pays much better than my current job, so I really hope I do, but I think I got it in the bag.	Well that is good news! I hope you get the job you want!"
"I went through some of my old stuff yesterday, and I found my security blanket that I used when I was a kid!	That sounds like a fun memory. I hope you have some of those back."
"It really did. It kinda made me sad, because it was all tattered and dirty. I ended up washing it.	That is good. I hope it was your parents."
"You know, I see all the back to school shopping and I think parents have their priorities mixed up.	That's a fair point. I think I see the same thing."
"Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor.	I know what you mean.  I used to be that way but now I see the point.  I love my clothes, but I also love learning."
"I found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road, and I nursed him back to full health. Poor thing.	I can imagine. Did you give him a name?"
"I did! His name is Alphy.	Well, that's a good name. I'm glad he is happy with you."
"It's hard as a parent, when your kids are teenagers and have to handle their own problems	Yeah, it's hard.  They're all at different stages of their lives and the stress is just crazy!"
"I know, they mommy in me wants to just jump in and fix it all like I used to	That's great that you have that inside of you."
"My wife called me this morning and told me she scored a new job with Microsoft!	Did she have to go through a lot of interviews?"
"She is so excited. She's even making more than I am.	Oh wow! You must be very happy about that!"
"I felt bad my dogs ears have been bothering him. We had to finally take him to the vet yesterday.	Oh that's terrible.  I hope he's okay."
"Yeah, it was ear mites and he got medicine for it. You can tell he isn't feeling good from side effects so I've been babying him.	That's good. Do you think you'll be able to get him back on track?"
"I bought a chocolate bar for my wife at the store, and I was going to give it to her, but I ended up eating it...I feel bad.	That is a terrible thing to do. You should have asked her first."
"lol I didn't tell her...Should i?	Oh yeah, what happened?"
"Don't you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn't do? My boss got mad at me for someone else's mistake.	I don't like when that happens."
"Yeah, that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.	Oh no, that's terrible. What did they do?"
"I'm taking a vacation and going on a cruise to Alaska next week!	That's awesome! What do you want to do on the cruise?"
"I've never been, so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.	That's the worst! I get seasick too!"
"Hello, I think I will not forget the beauty of her hair, the sweetness of her lips and the clarity of her eyes	That is so nice of you to say.  Do you have a crush on her?"
"she died ... my mother	That is terrible.  I am so sorry."
"It is true...	Hello, I never imagined the violence that can unleash a dog attacking a bird ... I was impressed	That was quite a surprise. What happened next?"
"in a big dog ... in the park	That sounds fun, I bet you had a good time."
"I did not have the strength to control it	My poor neighboor is suffeing a lot without her husband	I am sorry to hear that.  Is she okay?"
"He passed away from cancer.	How old was he?"
"I enjoyed my day the other day, found out something good! Newphew may come to live with us for ayear.	That's awesome!  How long has your nephew been living with you?"
"11, he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.	Wow. What do you do with him?"
"I lost something of my mother in laws the other day, I feel so bad.	I'm sorry to hear that. Is it something important?"
"I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear, it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!	That's a pretty pricey thing, how much is it?"
"I may do that!	I was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award	What award was it for?"
"Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for	That is great! I bet you feel very proud of yourself!"
"I appreciate that. Thank you	Wow! Congrats on your new job! I can understand why you are apprehensive, but it sounds like a good opportunity.	I'm going to be able to pay more and have more time to pursue my hobbies. I'm excited for it!"
"No problem! Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.	Yeah, I don't know how you're going to get there but I hope it works out for you."
"I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!	I totally agree. I was nervous too!"
"I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?	I have, but I don't think it's as common as it used to be. I am excited about the interview you had!"
"It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!	I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.	That can be very frustrating, I hate it when parents are not good parents."
"It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.	That is disgusting! I am so sorry you had to deal with that."
"I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.	I know the feeling. I've been there a few times."
"Well, for the most part it's my family. My husband, kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!	That's nice!"
"My daughter is a teenager now so we don't spend as much time together as we used to.	That's sad, but I know you will always be there for her."
"Yeah, luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.	That sounds like fun! I love shopping."
"I'm really looking forward to this trip I have planned next week.	Oh great! What are you going to do?"
"I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.	That is a great plan.  I am sure you will have a great time."
"I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend, and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.	Oh my goodness! I hate when that happens. How long did you have to find her?"
"It WAS. Since she was wet, the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.	That is awful. Did you have to use some kind of soap to try and get her clean?"
"Been having a good day, relaxing on my couch watching Netflix. I got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap.	Well that's nice. Sometimes you just need a little bit of relaxation."
"Yeah, it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.	What do you mean?"
"I had a job interview yesterday. I was really nervous before it started.	That's terrible. I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room, then we took a lab tour afterwards.	Oh nice! What kind of lab?"
"i am very faithful	That's great! What are you doing to show your faithfulness?"
"yes my behavior refereed to people	I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you're alright."
"thank you	That's good to hear. What happened?"
"nothing	Wow, that's a very interesting statement."
"thank you	What for?"
"nothing	That is a pretty good thing to say."
"i am going to garden	I hope you have a great time."
"thank you	I'm glad you are happy."
"It was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake	What did they do wrong?"
"placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it, so they gave me something else without telling me	Oh no, that's a bummer. Did you get a good deal on the other one?"
"Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen	I hope they do too. What kind of complaint did you file?"
"I really was distraught	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok	That's nice. You have to go through it sometimes."
"it made me proud he was my rep	How did that happen?"
"the president represented us at this association	i am sure he did."
"International Ceramic trading	It has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation. No one to talk to.	You're right, she's gone for a couple of weeks."
"I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.	That's true, it's hard to have real company when you are so busy."
"I can't wait to travel south to get my favorite take out. Can't find it here.	What is your favorite take out?"
"About an hour. But it'll be worth it.	Why is that?"
"I'm quite happy with where I live. I have 3 swimming pools to use anytime I want and also a gym.	That sounds amazing. I love living in a place where I can spend all my free time doing what I want."
"Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.	That's a pretty good thing.  How many people do you live with?"
"I have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing.	Oh that is amazing.  I would be shocked too!"
"It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up, go to work, etc. but I was wrong about that!	What happened?"
"Yes, last week. Thank you!	It was a long 3 weeks but I'm so happy it's over and she's back now	Oh wow, that's a great time to be happy!"
"She went to visit her family	Oh wow, that's cool!"
"It was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother	What happened to your mom?"
"Thank you for your solidarity	I'm happy to be able to help."
"thanks	We knew she was pregnant, but didn't know the gender yet. Imagine my shock when I saw the ultrasound for the gender!	That's so exciting! I bet you were happy."
"Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met	That's good. Do you have a girl in your life?"
"Even though there are plenty of flirts around, I remain loyal to my wife.	That's a good attitude to have, how long you've been married?"
"It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one, which was 5 years ago now.	That is a long time to wait for someone to fall in love with you."
"My friend got a new truck, I'm really envious of him.	That's great. I'm sure it's a pretty cool truck."
"I agree, if I work hard I could buy that truck.	I agree, I need to work harder to buy my truck."
"I should, I just need the drive to get out there and do it. I need to stop wasting money.	Hello, I feel that today is going to be a wonderful day .... I will enjoy it	That's great! What are you doing today?"
"If I really like to be positive, despite the difficulties	What are you referring to?"
"so it is ... a big hug	I have been looking after my wife this week. She has the flu	That's great that you're taking care of her."
"It seems so. Sleeping all day today lol	That is a nice feeling. Did you have a good rest?"
"This morning and I saw a tree, I never detailed it, but this time I saw it beautiful ... I realized God exists	What are you going to do about that?"
"I gave thanks in spite of the difficulties	Did you have to give thanks for something that you didn't have to?"
"thank you for your comments	Today I realized that my daughter sings wonderful, I enjoy it a lot ... I was impressed	Wow! What a wonderful daughter you have. I am sure she is a talented singer!"
"she is 9 years old ... she is a nice girl	What kind of girl is she?"
"that's right ... thanks for your comment	Hi, I feel bad because I've realized that I do not love my husband, but I do not have the courage to tell him	That is a tough spot to be in.  Have you thought about talking to a counselor about it?"
"You're right	What's that?"
"thanks	I'm looking for a new job, and I'm feeling pretty good about my options.	I'm sure you will find a good one."
"There's a lot of openings for tech jobs lately, especially technical support.	That is a good time to be in that field."
"My wife just went out of town for school for 2 months.  I don't really know anyone here, so I don't know what I'm going to do while she's gone.	That is a sad situation. You can try to make friends here."
"I'm sure it is great for her, but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.	I bet. What are you feeling unsure of?"
"Hello, I made a serious mistake. I made a comment without bad intentions of the elders. I related them to the dinosaurs, and my father heard it ... he looked me in the eyes ... and he told me that you too could be one of them ... I felt bad	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you didn't feel too bad."
"yes, but I feel like a cockroach	I'm sorry to hear that.  Did it happen recently?"
"thanks	I'm supposed to be on a diet, but I couldn't help myself and I ate three chocolate bars.	That's bad. Did you feel bad afterwards?"
"But I'm supposed to be on a diet! I can't lose weight if I have no self control :(	That's so frustrating. Do you think you can lose weight?"
"my husband lost his job a couple of months ago and yesterday he finally got a new job!!	That is great! I am so happy for him!"
"He is such a hard working man! He works so much so i could stay home with our baby	Oh, that's great. I'm sure he's very proud of you too!"
"I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.	Oh no! I hate it when they bark at you! Did you try to yell at her?"
"Ugh, that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.	I understand.  I have to deal with car noises too.  We are on the second floor too."
"I lost my favorite hoodie somewhere. I'm so upset. Like how could i lose a hoodie? it's so big, did i just leave it somewhere?	Oh, that's bad! I'd be really upset too. I would have to ask my mom if she has seen it."
"I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it	That is hard, I am sure you did well though."
"I'm going to see my parents in 3 weeks!! I didn't see them since 2014! I'm so excited	oh wow that's awesome! I bet you are so excited to see them!"
"no, with my little baby. they've never met my son, they can't wait	Oh that's so sweet! I bet you're excited!"
"My wife had been out of the country for 2 months for school.  I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.	That is nice of you.  Did you get her back before you left?"
"Yeah, it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	That is a tough spot.  Have you thought about joining a club or group to meet new people?"
"I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.	I know the feeling. I hate waking up to noise."
"No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.	Oh no. That's terrible. Do you have a smoke detector?"
"Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!	my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing	Oh no! I'm so sorry, did you feel really bad?"
"she did, she didn't say anything but i know she heard it	That's the best part, it's all about the suspense!"
"My girlfriend went on a week trip with her friends, and left me alone to fend for myself.	That is awful.  Do you feel like she has no idea what you are going through?"
"Mostly been playing video games, but it's so boring without her.	I feel you.  I have a daughter and she is 12.  We play games together when she is home."
"Hello ... I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not, the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth	I agree with that.  I try to keep things in perspective and not get too caught up in the bad things"
"For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it	I can relate. I had to learn to walk."
"for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible	i agree. you have to take responsibility"
"condition the mind and spirit	I've been in that place recently."
"I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.	That is so sad.  It is so hard to lose someone you love."
"yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort	I know what you mean.  It's hard to be in a situation like that and not know how to react.  I feel for you.  It's hard to know what to do."
"I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some.	I had plans to move from Florida to California, but I'm starting to get cold feet...	Oh no! What's going on?"
"Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.	That is a tough decision. I would have to say that I would take the move."
"today I think today is a day to learn, to hug, to smile, to make someone happy	That's a good attitude to have. I'm sure you'll have a good day!"
"that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that, to my children I kiss them, my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something	Oh wow, that's really nice. I bet they appreciate it"
"It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile	I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends, no husband, no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life	I feel you. I'm lonely too. I've been married for 5 years now, and I'm still just as lonely as the day I got married."
"not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward	I'm not sure if I can relate to that. I am more of a introvert."
"My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.  I can't wait to go pick her up at the airport!	That's great. You must be happy to see her."
"I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.	Yeah, I know what you mean.  She was always on time too, so I'm glad she's coming back.  She's been gone for a while."
"Germany for a language immersion course.	I am so thrilled to be able to go on a short but long overdue vacation	What are you going to do on vacation?"
"A short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water.	That sounds like a lot of fun! Are you an avid floater?"
"Down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks. It is around the current river	I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.	That's really rude. Did you find a better caterer?"
"Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.	That's an interesting thing. Did you have a problem with the catering service?"
"I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.	What happened?"
"The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.	That is so rude of her.  I would be angry.  I would tell her I am not a good customer.  I would also tell my husband about it."
"Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.	how was your day?	oh, i was good, i did not have any problems."
"yeah good. whats your name?	Me? I'm not sure. I'm a robot."
"oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend	hello how was your day?	yea it was good"
"yeah fine great day	I am glad!  What did you do today?"
"yeah nice to talk to you.	I wore wrong pair of socks to the college. But, no was there to spot it. But, when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes. At, that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes. They made a fun of me. That was very awkward situation.	I know, I would be embarrassed too."
"My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.	I am sorry to hear that.  Did you ask them to clean up?"
"ohh	I went for a job interview, and it seemed to go pretty well.	That's good to hear. Did you get the job?"
"It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.	Did they start on time?"
"I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.	I know what you mean. I'm from a big city and I moved to the country to be closer to family. I'm missing my friends a lot."
"Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.	I understand, I'm not very good at meeting people either."
"I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.	That is good that you were thinking of her. Did you say anything to her about it?"
"Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.  We just moved recently and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I wish you the best of luck!"
"Germany for a language course.	I almost got in a fight in a drive-thru lineup.	Oh no, what happened?"
"No, the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.	That's not good."
"Yes, afterwards I regretted the confrontation.  I thought I could have easily been shot.	I got on a stranger's boat by accident at the marina.	That's not good. What did you do?"
"Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off, but I sure felt stupid about it.	I'm sure the owner didn't see you either.  Did you feel embarrassed?"
"Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.	I was looking at old pictures from my first ""adult"" apartment, and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates.	Wow, what was your first apartment?"
"It can, but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore, but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.	I feel you. I was in college and we went on a road trip."
"Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to. I was in a house full of people screaming and yelling.	That is so scary.  I hope you were able to get to a place where you could relax."
"My friend and her mom were fighting about money, and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.	That sounds terrible. I hope your friend is able to resolve it."
"I hope so too. I plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this.	I had a job interview today and i think it really well.	That's good. What did you do to prepare?"
"The interviewer told me that I was his favorite interview so far. And I think my qualifications are a really good match for the company.	That is great.  Do you think you will be offered the job?"
"I saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so I called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog, but it turned out I was wrong.  Whoops.	That is so funny! I love seeing how people can pretend to be something they're not."
"Yeah, I don't like calling people out in general, don't know what made me think to do it this time.	I don't know what you're talking about."
"I'm surprised the police are going to let they get away with it.	That is bad.  What happened?"
"I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.	Oh no, have you tried ordering lighter items?"
"My test results come back today. I do hope everythings ok.	That's good. Did you study hard?"
"I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.	That is a great test. I am glad to hear that it is alright."
"Absolutely! I'm just over-worrying because I've always been so healthy. Just a little stressed out.	I went back to my home where I grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me. I had so many fun times with my best friends when I was a child.	Did you have a lot of fun?"
"Playing outside in the summer time. Many fun summer times. Swimming holes, icecream, catching fireflies.	Oh that sounds like fun!"
"Me too!	My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.	That's really cool. I wish my parents could do that."
"Thanks, now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.	That's good to hear."
"The more problems I have to deal with, the more faith, and faithful I become. I am stronger in my faith when bad things happen in my life and around me.	That's great. I like to think that I'm stronger when things are tough and easier."
"I was told once by a dear departed friend that ""what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt.	That's a great way to look at it.  I like that."
"yeh to that	I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well, but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.	Oh no, how do you feel?"
"I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.	Oh no!  I'm sorry to hear that.  How long have you been job hunting?"
"I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.	That's true. I am jealous of my coworker."
"You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.	That is understandable. But, I don't think he deserves it."
"Okay, I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.	I just got a puppy, but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.	That's not good.  How old is he?"
"Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.	That's a good idea. It's hard to keep kids entertained."
"Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.	That is so true. I would never steal."
"If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.	I agree.  What do you think you would do if you were in a similar situation?"
"My dog disappeared while I was away at college.	Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did you ever find him?"
"My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.	That is terrible. I hope you were able to find out what happened to her."
"Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.	I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!	Oh wow! I bet you're going to have a lot of fun!"
"Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby.	I can imagine.  Do you have kids?"
"Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors!	Oh no! What happened?"
"Oh cool! What kind of doctor?	I'm a nurse.  I've been doing this for 20 years."
"Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.	I'm proud of her. She has been working very hard and it's paying off."
"My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.	That is amazing! I bet you are very proud of her."
"I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.	That's good to think about, especially when you're not as fortunate as others."
"Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.	Oh no! Did he give you some advice?"
"A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.	Oh no! Did anyone get hurt?"
"No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.	Wow!  That's so kind of them!  I bet you felt a little bad for having to dispose of it."
"I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.	Well, that's great. I'm sure you're very proud of him."
"She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.	That's an interesting personality you have. Do you have a favorite singer?"
"Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.	Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!	I know how you feel. I'm a little young to be thinking about the past, but I can only imagine how great it must have been."
"Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!	I love the old days."
"That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.	Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time, but now I worry that they will come back.	That is terrible. Are you scared?"
"Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.	That's terrible! Did you report it to the police?"
"I woke up this morning, and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.	That's terrible.  Did you report it?"
"I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.	Did you get any new information?"
"I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well, but I guess not.	I would have been sad too. I've been there before."
"Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.	That's good! I hope you get a good job soon."
"Last week, my pants fell down in gym class. The elastic strap holding them up broke.	I'm sorry to hear that."
"I ran out of the gym crying, and the whole class pointed and laughed.	Oh no! I would have been so embarrassed!"
"I love my cat, but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.	I would have to get a snip of her hair to clean it out."
"She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles.	That sounds so cute. I can't help but smile when that happens."
"I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!	That's great! Where are you going?"
"We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to, and we will be seeing the ocean as well!	Oh wow.  Are you guys going to be able to get to Somalia?"
"I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.	Wow, that is a terrible thing to do. I hope they didn't get upset."
"Yes, it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.	That's a tough one.  I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  I hope you find some relief."
"I won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy, proud	What was the prize?"
"It was for a chess competition.	Did you win?"
"They gave a cash money of 200$. Isn't that cool? Have you won any?	I have a coworker that will not stop talking. He mostly talks about himself	I'm sorry you have to put up with him."
"Yes, it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people, but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.	I agree, people often don't ask how you are doing."
"I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.	Oh wow! I hope it was a good package."
"Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be, so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting, I guess.	That's a bummer.  Do you still want to wait?"
"I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around, and people laughed at me.	That is awful.  Did you get mad at them?"
"That is good advice. I feel better about this.	Oh, really? Why?"
"I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.	Oh that's great. Have you seen them a lot since?"
"It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week, not 20 years ago.	That's kind of like what happened with me and my ex."
"I just saw the craziest thing! A baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!	Oh my goodness that is crazy! Did the dog not have a leash?"
"She couldn't have been older than one!	Oh, that's too young!"
"I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly, it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do, even though I put my best work and most effort into it.	That sucks, you should be proud of yourself though, you did a good job."
"It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.	That's great!  I hope you do well!"
"That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!	I'm worried that if my Aunt doesn't answer her phone, I won't be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend.	Oh no! I would be worried too! Do you have a good relationship with her?"
"Yes, I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.	That's good that you have a nephew. I hope everything goes well for him."
"I am always suffering due to lack of money and I wish I could be rich someday	I can understand that.  I've been there myself."
"That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks	I know right? It's like it always works out for us."
"ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair	I am sorry. I hope things get better for you."
"That is so true. But to lead a happy life, money is necessary to some extent.	I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.	Oh no. What happened?"
"Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere.	I am sorry to hear that. I would not want to live in that area either."
"I feel sorry for me too!	I know the feeling! I'm sure you'll be fine though!"
"They are very helpful and I always will be faithful to them	That is good to hear.  I hope they are good people."
"Yes, what about you? Do you feel likewise?	I feel like I have a lot of potential"
"Do you follow any particular denomination?	I'm so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend. I was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up	That's so sweet. What did she do?"
"yes, and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money	That is very nice of her."
"I saw this kid on a skateboard the other day.  I thought he was gonna wipe out hard, but he pulled off some kind of multi-flip jump thing that really shocked me.	That is awesome, what a cool kid!"
"I know, right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid, made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line, never managed to do anything else.	Oh man! That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!	Oh wow, that's interesting. I have never heard of that."
"I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them	That is a good point.  We all have bad days.  We just have to be kind to each other."
"I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(	That's very sweet of you.  What are you doing to help him?"
"I know he will, i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky	Oh I see. That's okay. Maybe you can try to have a friendly conversation with him."
"I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.	That is terrible!  I bet you were so mad at that guy."
"Yeah, I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one, but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.	That's good to hear.  That was a good dog, I bet the smaller one is safe now."
"I just recently finished potty training my dog, that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.	That sounds like a lot of work! I bet he was very happy when he was finally done."
"I can imagine a rescue, generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get, can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!	I've been through that, it's hard, but you'll get through it!"
"My dog started looking really sick and in pain, but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet, so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.	That is a terrible thing to do to your dog. Did you end up going to the vet?"
"Yeah, he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing, but he got medicine and rest and is good now.	That's good to hear.  I hope he's feeling better now."
"I was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life. It was great . You ever have any of those moments?	I do, but they are rare.  It is nice to have those moments when you are feeling good about yourself and the world."
"I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?	I was in the middle of a project and I was so grateful for that."
"Oh I can agree with that completely!	I interviewed for a job a while back that I was waiting on hearing about.  I felt like it went well.	What kind of job was it?"
"A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!	That is so exciting! I hope you get the job!"
"Have you ever had to file for disability?	I have.  I had to do that once and it was a real pain."
"I've had to recently. Its been really tough.	What happened?"
"Do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?	Yeah, all the time!  I just love how cute they are."
"My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first, but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.	I see! What a fun little hobby!"
"I've had to help take care of others before as well.	Oh really? I'm sure you did a good job!"
"Yeah, I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.	What a nice thing to do."
"I failed my driving test twice, but I was really encouraged and did better the next time.	That's great!  It's not easy to pass twice.  What are you going to do about it?"
"I agree, I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.	That's good that you were able to pass.  Do you feel more confident now?"
"I once went a restaurant, and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen!	That sounds terrifying!"
"I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out, how can a place like that operate!?	I would be shocked too! Did you report it to the authorities?"
"Do any of your kids play any sports?	I don't have any kids.  I'm a retired nurse, so I don't have to worry about them."
"My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.	That is so awesome! I bet she was so stoked!"
"I was so late for work one day, I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!	That is horrible. I can only imagine how embarrassing that must have been."
"I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on, I was so in shock, even the neighbors saw. It was bad.	That's terrible. How did it affect you?"
"I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.	Wow, that is annoying. Did you try to wait for another cashier?"
"The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.	I know what you mean. I was at the store the other day and the cashier was having a bad day."
"I was so excited when I got my new puppy, it was awesome!	That is so nice! Did you name her?"
"I agree with you, the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions, positive ones of course!	That is true! I feel the same way."
"Those were simpler times, I wish I could go back and relive those days!	I agree.  The world has changed so much since then."
"Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.	I agree. I had to worry about school and bills, now I can enjoy life."
"It was great, so much time running around outside without a care in the world.	I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child.	That's awesome! I love science fairs."
"My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest, was the one that released the most gas.	Oh, wow! I am not sure if I could figure that out."
"I'm sleep training my toddler, he never slept in his crib before. He is crying and it makes me feel so bad	That is so sad!  Have you tried any tricks or things to make it easier?"
"how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry	I was co sleeping. I think he was crying because he was hungry."
"I just got back from my vacation. We stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there, it was so much fun! We really had a blast!	That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you have any fun activities?"
"It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years, due to personal reasons, so you can imagine how we felt when we went!	Oh wow, that's great! I bet you had a lot of fun!"
"As I look at my 21 year old son, I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!	I have a 16 year old son, he is small but he is growing up fast."
"Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.	Yeah, I can imagine that. I know how that feels."
"I want to go on a vacation next month but now I cant.	Oh no, what happened?"
"Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.	Oh no! I'm sorry. I hope they get it together soon!"
"My son is in his last year of college! We are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!	I bet!  Is he going to college in the states?"
"He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.	That is great! What are you going to do?"
"We took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!	What is wrong with him?"
"I hope so. Do you have any kids?	I do, but they are grown now.  I had a girl and a boy.  I miss them."
"I went to the flea market last weekend!	Oh wow! That sounds fun! What did you find?"
"Well, kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies, haha.	Oh, I hate those things. They're so annoying. I used to have a bunch of them, but they're not as fun as they used to be."
"I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s.	I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.	That's great! What a great daughter!"
"haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol	Yeah that's a tough spot to be in."
"My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!	Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get her out and get her to the vet?"
"It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.	What happened?"
"She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!	My mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital. I was so concerned, but she became better after a few days. Such a huge relief!	That's great!  I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"Thanks, she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it, so it could have been much, much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!	That is great to hear. I hope you have a good relationship with her."
"I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.	That was nice of you. Did it like you?"
"The cat appeared very relaxed, but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.	That's interesting. What kind of cat is it?"
"One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.	That's not fun, did you get lost for a long time?"
"If that wasn't frightening enough, I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!	Oh no, that's horrible. Did you get them?"
"I didn't force her into anything. She seemed to know what she was doing anyway	Did she ever say no?"
"I wish it never happened now.	I know the feeling."
"she was 8	How old is she?"
"A little while ago, my friend went on another beach vacation. It was her 3rd one for the year. My family and I hadn't been on vacation for several years, due to issues beyond our control, so I begrudged her trip a bit.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I bet you were happy she was able to get away."
"Yes, true, I know they tend to let bills go for things like that, which I don't do.	That's a bad habit to have. You should pay them off as soon as you can."
"I am so happy it's a boy	Oh yeah? Why is that?"
"He'll be here in about 3 months	That's a long time to wait. What's going on?"
"Hey, I just started the keto diet!	Oh wow! I love keto. I've been doing it for 2 years now. I think it's really good for you."
"It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first, but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.	That's a good way to start."
"Thank you, I wanted to be completely ready, so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.	Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy	Oh, congratulations! How are you feeling?"
"I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha	Oh wow. That must have been scary."
"I just had my Sweet 16 party...	Oh that is so exciting. What did you do?"
"Well, about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...	Oh no! What happened?"
"A BLUE one! I'm so devastated. I don't know what to do.	I recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out 6 years ago.	That's great! Did you study hard to get back in?"
"I was scared about it at first, but so far I have all A's. I must say, I'm proud of myself!	What did you study?"
"Over the past year I've been on a weight loss journey of over 100 pounds.	I bet you must feel great!"
"As well as exercise and diet, by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.	I agree. It's hard to stay motivated, but once you have it, it's easy."
"I never liked milk growing up, because my family drank skim.	I hate skim too, I just love regular milk."
"Well, first I tried whole milk, and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk, and I like it!	Oh yeah, I hate whole milk, it's so sickening. 2% is a good start though, I hope you enjoy it!"
"I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.	That's great!  What did you enjoy?"
"No, but I am satisfied with my choice.	Why are you satisfied?"
"I just got back from our vacation, but the drive there was so nerve wracking. There was heavy rain and traffic, and some nighttime driving. Had me on edge	I bet, I hate driving in the rain."
"Yes, well, it was just one of those things I know, but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you're talking about."
"Recently, I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.	Oh no. Are you okay?"
"It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.	That is very discouraging. I have been there too."
"On my recent vacation to Florida, there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving! It was such a hassle!	Wow that's a long time, why did you have to drive so long?"
"I wanted to pull my hair out lol. But, knew once we were past it, there was the beautiful ocean on the other side...finally!	Oh wow! I am glad that you got to see the beautiful ocean!"
"Robby got me flowers today.	That's nice. What did he get you?"
"Yes, how could you forget? It was a nice surprise, but then he said.. ""happy anniversary.""	That's nice. I'm sure he was happy."
"Thanks, but I'm so embarrassed that I forgot!! D;	dad caught me kissing my half aunt	Oh no! Did you get in trouble?"
"I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her	Oh wow, that's a pretty awkward situation. Was she okay?"
"Me found cave.	What was in the cave?"
"Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.	I am happy for you! That is an amazing experience!"
"Me miss BC. Me miss wife.	One of the scariest, yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that I was going to have a baby.	I'm so happy for you! I hope you have a wonderful baby."
"Oh, we were totally unprepared. In fact, my partner and I were working out of state in a compromising environment. We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!	That's a lot of stress. Did you guys get everything set up before you left?"
"When I was pregnant, I felt ill until it was over. The doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby.	Wow, I'm glad it was just something else."
"Usually the sickness stops within the first few months, so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all, I had a healthy, bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.	That is amazing! Congratulations on your baby boy!"
"When my dog passed away, I felt so helpless. She was old and suffering and I felt angry that there was nothing I could do other than put her down.	I'm so sorry to hear that.  Do you still have her?"
"She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough, I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.	That is so sweet. I wish I had a pet."
"I had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him	Oh no. Was it a romantic date?"
"I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted	Oh no.  That's a bummer.  You should have told her."
"My son is in college and about to return for his Junior year. We have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs.	That's great. I hope he has a good time and gets where he wants to go."
"We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!	That's a good point! I think it's a good point to help, but I also know that parents can't do that all the time."
"After a long few months of being a hermit, I went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!	Oh that sounds like a lot of fun!  How many did you play with?"
"It was definitely exciting for me! I haven't been able to play with a dog since my own passed away.	That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog did you have?"
"I've been feeling a bit blue and overwhelmed lately.	Did you have a good reason for that?"
"I could definitely use one! However, I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!	I can understand that, you can't take one with you on a trip!"
"These days my skin has never looked better. My diet is good, my family life is good, I've got good grades. Life is good!	That's awesome. It sounds like you are very happy with life right now."
"Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water. It's amazing how much the little changes can impact.	Oh I agree! I have been doing some research on it and I believe it is a matter of the digestive system."
"I flew all the way to New York City to buy a designer dress for the prom.	I am sure you were very happy to have the dress."
"I am, thanks, but I wouldn't go there... Becky STILL managed to get the same dress as me! I am so mad!	Oh no! Are you going to tell her?"
"I just love playing retro games. Takes me back	I love retro games too!"
"Oh yeah? Cool. I like the old Sega Mega Drive games. The music is just classic on those games	I agree. I used to play that all the time when I was a kid."
"One night, I was home alone, when suddenly, I heard a loud BANG!	Why did you hear it?"
"It was a ghost! I ran into the kitchen to investigate, and I saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window.	Oh wow! What were you doing?"
"Recently my daughter was voted 'Most Artistic' by her peers! She is so talented and we feel lucky to be her parents.	That is wonderful!  I bet she is thrilled.  What is she artistic about?"
"Yes, she has a natural talent, but really puts much practice and time into it.	That's good.  Do you think you can learn from her?"
"what does that mean?	what does that mean?"
"this has obviously gone all wrong somewhere	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"5	A year ago, I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! You must have been so scared for the kitten's life."
"I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat, Muffin.	I'm glad you cared for it yourself. I bet she's a wonderful cat!"
"I'm proud that she traveled across the world all by herself. 2 big suitcases and all	That's impressive!  I bet she got to see a lot of new things."
"Wife. And she was 6 months pregnant to boot!	That's awesome! I am so happy for you!"
"There was a storm the other day, close to our home. There was a tornado warning near it, so I was afraid and nervous!	Oh no! I hate storms like that. Did it hit your area?"
"Yes, it luckily passed our home, but you just never know!	I am glad it passed, that is a good thing."
"My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend, I'm really happy for him. :)	That's great! I'm happy for him as well!"
"Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money, but still wanted her to have something nice.	Wow! That's so nice!"
"I can't wait to get a new car soon	Oh that's awesome! What kind are you looking for?"
"I want a compact SUV, like maybe something like a Toyota RAV4	I think Toyota is a great brand."
"not yet ready for the baby, need fix up his room	What kind of fix up?"
"Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!	That's a lot of time. Are you going to be okay?"
"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	That's a bummer.  Why don't they ship to Canada?"
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	Oh yeah, I've had that happen before. It's like they don't care about the customer."
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	Oh no! That is crazy! What did she do to get you to do that?"
"It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it	I am so sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired	Wow that's a long time. How did you keep yourself occupied?"
"It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again	Oh no. That's terrible. How much did you have to save up?"
"For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies	Oh no, did you end up moving?"
"Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!	That is a little rude, but I can see why she might be moving in."
"At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently	Oh no, that's terrible. What did she do?"
"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special	I'm glad you had that experience."
"I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant	You must be so proud of her."
"Yes. It's a boy	That's good! Are you excited about the baby?"
"My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business.	That sucks. Are you still going to go out of town?"
"I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.	That's unfortunate. I hope you were able to get a day off."
"I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him	That is a very sad situation."
"In the club	Oh no! What happened?"
"I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to	Oh, what did she want to do?"
"She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew	Did she have a job?"
"I know I will save the money I need for the baby	That is a great feeling, I wish you all the best!"
"Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday	Yeah, that's a great attitude to have. What do you do?"
"I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you do it to impress someone or something else?"
"Kinda. I thought it was a secret	Oh that's bad, what happened?"
"it was brutal	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.	That's a little embarrassing.  Did you find a way to get cleaned up before the meeting?"
"yes. homeless for a bit	That is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you."
"i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye	That is so sad. You should have told her about it."
"it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her	I understand. What happened?"
"i was heartbroken when my dad passed away.. still not over it.	I am so sorry.  I know how you feel.  I lost my mom a few years ago."
"5 years..	You must be happy."
"i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition.. she seems like a born artist	I am happy for you!"
"yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her	That's great. I hope you are both doing well."
"i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents	That is understandable. I would feel the same way."
"yeah, but still.. that feeling never went away	That must be a terrible feeling to have."
"i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere	That is a good thing."
"well, i guess women are more detail oriented	I don't know if I agree with that.  I think men are more detail oriented."
"i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her	I bet you're happy about that"
"yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me, i escaped from there right awat	That's a pretty bad decision. What did she do?"
"my dog passed away earlier this year	I'm so sorry to hear that.  How are you doing?"
"yeah.. but its too soon i feel	I understand. What do you mean?"
"some guy drove past me so fast last week.. i was furious	That is no good.  Did you get him in trouble?"
"yeah.. i barely escaped!	What happened?"
"1	I'm sorry, I don't understand."
"soory it was mistakenly typed.	What was it?"
"how was your day?	I'm taking the California Bar exam to become an attorney in February and I'm sooo nervous!	I can't imagine the pressure you must feel."
"I played a video game when I was younger, called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and it made me want to become one!	I have not played that game, but it sounds interesting!"
"once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life	I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?"
"yeah that really sucks.	oh yeah what happened?"
"I fell down at work, and my khaki pants ripped open.	Oh no!  I would have been so embarrassed."
"I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.	Oh that sounds like a pretty embarrassing thing to wear! I bet you felt like a total nerd."
"My grandpa is coming to visit!,5|5|5_5|5|5,	That's awesome! I love visiting with my grandpa!"
"He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!	Oh, that sounds fun! I bet you will have a great time!"
"I ate a gas station burrito for lunch. It was not very appetizing. Actually, it was absolutely horrible.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	I can't stand gas station food.  I'm always looking for something better to eat."
"Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.	That's not good, you should just leave the bathroom alone."
"how was your day?	I had a good day, I went to the gym and ate a healthy meal."
"yeah its an another good day	That's good to hear. What happened?"
"oh how was the climate there/	Oh, I think I know what you might be asking about. I live in Colorado and I don't know much about climate."
"I managed to accidently flash a dozen people	Oh no! What were you doing?"
"it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like ""oops!	What were you wearing?"
"Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive	i have always more trust on my girlfriend	I can understand that. I am glad to hear that."
"yeah i do. i love her a lot	That's good. Is she your girlfriend?"
"what about you?	I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.	I'm sure you'll do well!"
"Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.	That's unfortunate, is it something you will be able to take again?"
"I get to go the the zoo tomorrow! They opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal, the sloth!	I have never been to a zoo. What kind of sloths?"
"They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!	They have zoos?"
"I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!	I would be so angry!"
"Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?	I'm not sure, but I think you should try to figure out who is behind it."
"i have been more happy	What happened?"
"happier now beacuse i have been built a new house	That is awesome! Where are you building it?"
"Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.	I can understand that."
"I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal	That's great! Kids can be expensive to be on."
"i have watched races in tv	What kind of races do you watch?"
"nope iam a street racer	Oh that's cool! I bet you love the rush of adrenaline you get from racing"
"i feels happy	I know what you mean, I am glad for myself too"
"because i built a new house	That's great!  I am sure it was a lot of hard work.  How did you feel about it?"
"i have been more happy that i have bought a car	What kind of car?"
"audi q7	Nice.  Did you like it?"
"My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.	That's awesome!  What kind of watch is it?"
"She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version.	I have been wanting a new g-shock watch!"
"I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.	That is great. How long did you take to get there?"
"I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.	That is great! I am sure you will find something soon."
"I am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that I just finished. I took the final exam yesterday, and I am not sure what score I will receive.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	That is so exciting, I hope you get a great grade."
"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.	That's a little annoying. Did you ask him for an extension?"
"I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.	That is terrible.  You should have a talk with them and let them know how you feel."
"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.	Oh, what did they do?"
"My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away.	That's really sad. I'm so sorry."
"The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off	Oh no, that's terrible.  Are you able to go back to work now?"
"I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.	I hate when that happens. What kind of food was it?"
"I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.	What made you not want to eat anymore?"
"I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.	I bet.  What did you do while you were there?"
"Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?	I am close to my grandparents"
"I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone	Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. How old are they now?"
"Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.	That's awesome. I'm sure you had a great time."
"We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave.	That's not good. Did you lose anything?"
"Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?	I was fine, thanks for asking. I was just really worried."
"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	I am sure it was not that bad."
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	Oh no, that's too bad.  How are you feeling about it?"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	That's awesome!  I've never seen anything like that before.  Did they do it for free?"
"Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?	I did once when I was 10, but I never did anything like that again."
"I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.	I am sorry to hear that.  Did you have a favorite person?"
"Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.	Why was it so bad?"
"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	Oh no, that must have been very frustrating."
"I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	I think that is one thing. It is when he spends a lot of time with you and it feels like he is trying to control you"
"Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	That's so frustrating!"
"I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious.	I am sure you will do great! What is the test about?"
"Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.	How did you do?"
"I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it!	I love the beach. Have you been to the Gulf Shores?"
"We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?	I have not but I want to!"
"One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!	Oh wow, that is so sweet! I love surprises like that."
"We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!	Oh wow! I bet that was a nice surprise. Did you have a good time?"
"It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?	I think I do. I know what you mean. I have had it happen to me before."
"Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top	I have never heard of that before."
"I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.	Oh no. Did you have a good time though?"
"I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.	Oh no. That is terrible. I am sorry."
"I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone	That's interesting. What are you going to do?"
"I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution	Why? What are you going to do?"
"sure ... thanks	My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.	That can be a very frustrating situation.  I would have a talk with your parents."
"I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?	I don't think you should tell them how you feel."
"My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.	That is great news!  What have you been doing?"
"Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!	I wish you all the best!"
"Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.	I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me.	That's horrible. I'm sorry that happened to you."
"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.	I know what you mean.  I can get frustrated when I feel like I am being treated unfairly."
"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	That's a good decision, loyalty is important."
"Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.	That is really nice of them."
"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	That is so sweet of her! How old is she?"
"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.	Oh, that's really sad. I'm sure she has other family members who care about her, though."
"A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.	Oh no!  That must have been scary.  I hope you and your family are okay."
"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.	I am glad you are safe.  I feel the same.  We had a tornado in our area last week."
"Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy	Oh, that's nice.  I have a few plants in my garden and I do have to do a lot to keep them happy.  It's a big responsibility."
"Especially when you feel something special by nature	Oh, what is it?"
"I hope this feeling increases	My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.	Wow, that's great, what is her birthday?"
"We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.	That sounds like a lot of fun!  I'm sure it will be a great time!"
"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.	That is good."
"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	That is no good. I hope he didn't think you were a flake."
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	I would have said the truth and been honest with him."
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	Oh no!  Did you have a doctor check out anything?"
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	Did you get sick?"
"I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!	That's awful! Did you call the police?"
"I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!	Oh my goodness! I know how that feels, I have the same thing."
"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	I can see why you would feel guilty.  Was it a really expensive TV?"
"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?	I would say you can keep it.  You should be happy with your purchase and enjoy it."
"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	That is pretty frustrating.  What does she want to eat?"
"Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.	I love going to the local diner. It's a tradition for us."
"I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.	That sounds really nice. I've never had one like that before."
"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.	That is nice.  I have been doing the same.  Do you have any plans for the future?"
"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	That's great! You must be relieved."
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	I can imagine how that would be perceived by the people."
"Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.	That is amazing, I am happy for you."
"Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!	Yeah, I am glad to hear that."
"My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness	I'm glad you have good friends.  Is there something specific that you're looking for in a friend?"
"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering	I know what you mean.  It's hard to watch someone else go through the same things you are going through."
"Thanks for your comprehension	Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.	I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds like a nightmare."
"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.	That's crazy! Did you end up leaving?"
"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  Is there anything you can do to help manage it?"
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	I know. I'm so scared."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	How long have you been separated for?"
"one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel	I can relate to that. What's making you feel that way?"
"is that he loved her	This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.	Oh no! What kind of smell?"
"Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.	Oh no! That's terrible. Did you try to clean it up?"
"I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.	Oh no! What happened?"
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	I can understand the frustration."
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	I think it's just normal to want to be heard, even if you don't mean to. It's hard to talk to someone in a noisy environment."
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	Yeah they can get a bit loud."
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	That's understandable.  What's the problem?"
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	I bet.  I would be so nervous about it.  I hope you get the best possible outcome."
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	That's terrible. You're so lucky to have such a good surgeon."
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	I was in an accident 5 years ago. I had a spinal cord injury.  I lost a leg. I had surgery 2 times and had to have a lot of surgeries on the other leg. I have chronic pain.  I was in a lot of pain.  I lost my job and I was in a lot of debt. I was lucky to have a good insurance company cover some of the surgeries.  I'm still in pain.  I'm just lucky I've been able to get some of the surgeries covered."
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope he is found guilty.  I'm not sure how that happened, but I'm sure it was a mistake."
"The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.	I've never heard that. Do you think it will be a hot summer?"
"I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.	That's awesome! I'm always busy, so it's good you are making the most of your time!"
"Writing speeches makes me nervous	I know how you feel. I've never been good at it."
"Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience	You'll get there, I'm sure it'll take some time"
"True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say	I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days, but they always bring back fond memories	That's cool. I don't watch them either."
"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!	Oh wow, you must be a fan!"
"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	I'm a movie buff, I think it's always a good idea to consider how adults will react to the content."
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	I know, I'm 33 and I'm still trying to understand it."
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	Oh yeah? What kind of job is it?"
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	That's sad. Did you miss their food?"
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	That's great! I love working in a place where you know your coworkers."
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	I would have been a little worried, but I think I would have been okay"
"Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day	I agree. People are so good."
"Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!	Did they catch the person doing it?"
"Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing	Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking	That sounds like a wild ride.  What type of vehicle were you in?"
"I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill	Oh no! Did you get hurt?"
"Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed	When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks	Oh no! That must have been uncomfortable."
"Yeah, I'm not good with confrontations	I am sure you are."
"I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong	I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!	That's awesome.  You should be proud.  What company is it?"
"Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!	That is not good. Are you sure that is not a bad thing?"
"How long have you been there?	I am in the Navy, and I have been there for 5 years."
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	I'm afraid I would be nervous talking to someone and I would probably make a mistake."
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	That is awesome! I bet you were happy about that!"
"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.	What happened?  I don't see how you can have a laptop that needs a new hard drive."
"If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*	I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!	I bet that was exciting news."
"I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*	That's a nice gift.  It's always good to have a gift card to help with the bill."
"I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.	Oh, I know what you mean. I'm pretty much the same way."
"I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.	So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.	Oh no, I hope he was able to get some!"
"He kinda gave me the ""Mom, really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*	That's funny.  I love how some people still do that."
"I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].	That is so sweet!  How old is he now?"
"It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD	I have that problem too. I always forget to put the list down."
"I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.	That sucks, did he have to go without?"
"No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.	That is so nice of you. I bet you are glad he didn't want to go with you."
"Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*	That sounds like a good time. What's your favorite?"
"Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!	My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.	That's really nice of her.  Did you have a good reason?"
"I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.	That's a good thing that she is cool about it."
"Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.	I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!	That's great! I hope you got the outcome you wanted."
"I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.	That must have been so embarrassing."
"Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.	I broke up with my boyfriend last week.	That's sad. What happened?"
"Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.	Oh, I'm sorry.  Do you have any plans for the weekend?"
"Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.	I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!	That is great! I'm sure you are very happy about it!"
"I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL	I'm sure you're not bored."
"This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!	I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!	It is always a great feeling to have a baby."
"15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?	I can imagine. I have a daughter and I never had a son, so I know how that is."
"Ah, make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)	Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is, it	I am sorry, what happened?"
"Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!	Oh no! Did you turn it off?"
"The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!	Oh that is a bit of a bummer. I hope you have a good time getting them ready for school."
"It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks.	That's great! What do you mean by that?"
"The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.	Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?"
"It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving.	That's so funny! Did you get in trouble?"
"really didnt want to anything for days	Oh no, what happened?"
"I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it"".	That is terrible.  Did you get a good grade?"
"it is indeed. wont happen again though	I was attending a conference and heard the minister speak. he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district"".	It is always good to hear a positive message from someone in a position of power."
"it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now	I know what you mean. It's always hard to figure out how people are able to get the positions they do."
"I feel uneasy because I don't know if I will be able to save enough money in time	I would be worried too. Do you have a plan for how you will save money?"
"Baby is due in less than 3 months	I'm so excited, how old is the baby?"
"I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me	Oh no, that's bad.  Are you sure you'll get good grades?"
"5 months to find out !	Ahh! How are you feeling?"
"I tried so hard for that exam, when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!	That is amazing!  Congratulations!"
"thanks. now onto bigger things	I'm glad to hear that. What are you going to do next?"
"starting a clinic	it was the grand opening for our restaurant. The whole town was there. almost double the number of people we were expecting	That sounds like fun!"
"thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town	I am sure it is. You must be very proud."
"I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this	That is a harsh truth.  What was the reason behind?"
"Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym	Oh no. I'm sorry. What did you do?"
"I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change	That's great. I'm glad you have a routine that works for you."
"Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.	I love breakfast! I eat pancakes."
"I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline	It's a good goal to have. I want to get in shape."
"I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing	I do the same.  I can't believe people don't listen to their body."
"the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls	That's awful. Did you have flood insurance?"
"Last week. we're in temporary housing now	Oh no, that's terrible!"
"I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!	Oh no! I bet he was scared! Did you help him get home?"
"I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.	I'm sorry, what happened?"
"I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.	Did you get to see her?"
"Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.	That's so sweet.  What was the book?"
"I can't find another way to earn money	I am sorry to hear that. What are you looking for?"
"I just want to work from home	I think you should. It's very convenient."
"I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now	I'm so happy for you! I have a new baby boy on the way!"
"You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap	What do you need the buggy for?"
"I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials	I feel you, I have a baby too."
"I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back	Wow, that's a lot of money saved up. I bet you feel lucky."
"She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.	That is pretty weird.  How did she feel about it?"
"Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors	Oh, you're a tough parent, huh?"
"I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding	I am sure you were very upset, but you are right to be understanding."
"I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again	Oh, I'm sorry, that's not a good thing to do."
"I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.	That's exciting! Was it expensive?"
"She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.	I would be too. Did she get hurt?"
"I did so much practice running in preparation for my 50 metre sprint race at my school!	What kind of practice did you do?"
"I do! I am so motivated to win and I believe I am one of the fastest at my school.	That is awesome! What sport do you play?"
"I feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro	That's great! What games did you play?"
"Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation	I remember those games, they were so good."
"I was so scared of going onto the train!	What was so scary about it?"
"No but I hate going in objects that travel fast, I really did not want to go on it.	I know the feeling.  I hate going on roller coasters."
"I am going to get us a new car!	Oh wow! That's exciting! What kind of car are you thinking of getting?"
"I'm not sure yet. Maybe a Toyota	What is it?"
"I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.	Oh wow, I am sure it was a bit of a shock."
"She loved it.  She's 17, I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.	That's awesome!  I love movies like that.  It's great that you have a good memory of it."
"I can't seem to feel happy but I'm not depressed	That's good, you should be happy, life is good"
"I just feel kinda stuck in life	Oh no, why is that?"
"I had pizza at a restaurant a couple days ago and found a hair on my pizza!	Oh my, I hope you were not too disgusted!"
"I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.	Oh no! That is terrible! Why did you demand a refund?"
"I finally got a new bike! I've been wanting one for so long!	That's awesome! What kind of bike is it?"
"I hope so, my new bike has so many gears. Such an upgrade from my last one! I can't wait to take it out.	That is awesome!  I love bikes.  I have one too.  I am so jealous of you.  I bet it's a lot of fun!"
"Pretty soon I'll be taking over my parents mortgage.  Homeownership is on the horizon.	Oh that's awesome! I'm glad to hear that you're on the path to that. What are you planning on doing with the money?"
"A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.	That's great! I've been thinking of buying a house for a while now. How big is your house?"
"I'm the only one who cares about paying bills. It's very frustrating	I feel you. I'm the only one that pays bills."
"Unfortunately no. It's very hard on me because I have to be disciplined with spending. Makes life very boring	I understand.  Do you have any fun plans?"
"I have a beautiful gray cat named Stormy.  Unfortunately she's contracted feline AIDS.	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better soon!"
"Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.	I'm sorry to hear that.  Is she healthy?"
"I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid.	Oh no, I hope you can get paid."
"I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think there was a mistake?"
"I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.	That's awesome! I bet that was a fun trip."
"Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young.	That is so sweet."
"I got a letter from my parents this past Friday with a wonderul surprise in it.	Oh wow, what was the surprise?"
"Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous, but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with.	I think that sounds like a great plan."
"Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town, I was a bit scared.	That's terrible. What did you do?"
"I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.	I see you are a very wise person."
"When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything.	That is terrible.  I would have been very upset if I had been in his shoes.  How did it turn out?"
"No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now.	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That's really awful."
"I was one percent off from passing my math test, I was devastated.	That is so bad."
"I agree, I should of studied harder too. Practice makes perfect!	I agree. I always study hard to get good grades."
"Last night I was minding my own business walking down a street in a not so good area of town when someone started to chase me!	That is really scary.  Were you able to run?"
"I managed to get away after a few smart quick turns, but I was shaking and in fear at the end of the chase. It was wild.	That sounds like a wild ride!"
"I was looking through old stuff in my basement and found my old baseball cards! Finding those was like being a kid all over again!	That's awesome. I love baseball cards."
"I used to collect so many when I was younger, it was such an awesome feeling to see them again!	I bet it was a lot of fun."
"I was feeling so optimistic about getting a new job at Houston a while back	I bet you were! What kind of job were you looking for?"
"Yeah actually, i am still working on it. So much fun!	I love to do that. What kind of work are you doing?"
"I was so much in awe when i saw Hamilton!	That is awesome!  I have never seen it before.  Have you been to a performance?"
"Neither, i am talking about the broadway show :D	I'm not familiar with it. What is it about?"
"I went to the beach other day.. such an awesome feeling standing there	I love going to the beach.  What was it like?"
"I most certainly did.. There is something about looking at the calm and glory of the ocean.	I love the ocean. I'm glad you have a great appreciation for it."
"I felt so bad about cheating on my science exam, it was terrible	I bet.  How did you cheat?"
"I know, I am disgusted at myself for doing it. I just wanted to pass.	That's not good."
"I'm taking my wife out this coming weekend to dance.	That's a nice gesture. What kind of dance?"
"We haven't been able to go out in quite a long time.  Family and life stuff just gets in the way sometimes.	It is hard to find time to do things.  I hope you can do something soon."
"My dog passed away couple months back.. i was heartbroken	That is so sad.  I am sorry to hear that."
"She got run by a truck.. I felt guilty and blue	I am sorry to hear that.  How did you feel?"
"I always get sad thinking about my dad.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yeah.. he did. He had cancer.	I'm sorry to hear that."
"I went to the beach other day	That sounds like fun. What did you do?"
"I sure did! the ocean and the breeze gives me such a sense of joy and calm	I love the ocean, it's so peaceful."
"I was so happy that i got to see Hamilton the other day	I loved the movie!  What made you so happy?"
"Yeah, the same. Lin Manuel is a genius to say the least!	That's great.  He's a great writer.  I've been wanting to see his show on Broadway."
"I went to visit my family the other day	Oh really? Was it a nice visit?"
"It was such a joyful experience. They always warm my heart	What happened?"
"A dog chased me through a street the other day	Oh no! That sounds scary. Was it a big one?"
"No i somehow managed to escape.. it was so scary	I am glad you were able to escape."
"I feel so caring of my little sister	That's great! What's your relationship like?"
"Yeah.. I always look out for her no matter what the problem is	I am glad you care about her"
"I was really nervous when i went to meet my girl's parents	What happened?"
"It turned out well actually, we had a nice time	What happened?"
"A dog chased me through our street last night	That sounds scary. Did you run to the neighbor's house?"
"I think so.. it looked like that. I was shivering when i finally managed to escape	I am sure you were."
"I really envy people who can sing	That's interesting. I don't know how they do it, but I can't do that."
"Yeah.. i did. i never got the chance to pursue that	Oh no! That is really sad. What happened?"
"I had to leave the house for a bit, before I left I gave my kids instructions on what I wanted them to do around the house.	Oh wow. I love the feeling of having a clean house."
"I figured they would just goof off.  However; when I returned all chores were comples.  I was pretty impressed.	Oh wow, I bet that was a good surprise."
"i found a bunch of dead mice the other day	Wow, that is quite gross. I would be grossed out too."
"it was! i felt sick seeing that	I am sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"how sweet. bless you!	I agree,  it is nice to have people that care about you."
"5	What's 5?"
"5	My Mother came into town unannounced.  She hardly ever does that.	That's nice, did you have a good time together?"
"No.  Thankfully it was just a visit.  She took us all to dinner, it was nice.	That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?"
"i was so furious when i found out that my best friend and girl friend had made out	That's terrible. Why did they do that?"
"I have not confronted them. I am still thinking over it.	Oh no, what happened?"
"A big brown roach crawled across the floor in my direction last night.	Oh no! That must have been so gross. What did you do?"
"Yes, but this one didn't fly.  He just decided to go under the chair I was sitting in.	That's a bummer. Were you scared?"
"My bills and mortgage payment is coming up soon.  I not sure if I can cover them all.	Oh no, are you in a financial bind?"
"I am working hard to make sure I can cover them.  Hope fully this month of work is better than last month.	That is great, I hope you do well too"
"I made sure everything was set and proper before i went abroad	Oh great, what country are you going to?"
"5	When I got my first car I thought I'd finally be able to have a cool social life.  But I was dissapointed quickly.	What kind of car did you get?"
"I spent my first night out at a Whataburger, eating alone.	Oh wow, thats a first! I bet it was pretty fun!"
"i felt so guilty after lying to my girlfriend	I would have felt the same way. What did you do?"
"I kissed a mutual friend of ours. I lied when she checked up on me. It was a one time thing, i did not wanted to hurt her.	I'm sorry to hear that. You should tell her the truth."
"I once lied about kissing the most popular girl at my school. and my friend found out about it	I would have been very upset. Why did you do it?"
"I was, so very much! I avoided my friends for a whole week thenafter	Why did you avoid your friends?"
"My four year old daughter came up and told me she thought I needed a big hug and kiss.	Oh, what a sweet thing to say!"
"She jumped in my lap and peppered my cheek with kisses.  It was pretty cute.	Did you feel that way?"
"I felt so very nervous after i agreed to meet my girlfriend's parents	That must have been stressful."
"Well, i lost a few pounds on the weeks leading upto it. But the actual meeting went well	That's good to hear. What was the meeting about?"
"I have always wanted to join a college faculty.  I went to school to study philosophy for that reason.	That is a very interesting field."
"Unfortunately not.  In the end I ran out of money and had to leave that dream behind.	That is terrible.  I am so sorry to hear that.  What did you do?"
"I feel so sad this time of the year. My dad passed away this time last year	I'm so sorry. I hope you can find some comfort."
"I'm sorry? Are you still talking about the cops?	I am, I want to know what they did"
"I feel heartbroken whenever i see a picture of my dog	That's so sad, do you still have your dog?"
"It is ok.. She passed away few months ago	My son and I went to the track yesterday to run.	I bet you were excited to run!"
"No, but he did end up puking all over the parking lot afterwards.	Oh no!  I bet he was mortified"
"That is really cool. i bet it felt nice watching those	I am sure it did. I have never seen such a thing."
"I envy people who can dance really well	I can dance, but not as well as some people I've seen."
"I was stunned with fear to find a rattlesnake right where i was about to step into last week	That is a scary thing to find. What did you do?"
"I stood there speechless for a moment, turned back and ran for my life!	Oh no, did you run away?"
"Needing some extra money, I used the spare change in my car to buy a scratch off ticket.	That is a good plan."
"It was Blackjack.  I didn't win anything though.	Oh wow, that's sad.  What did you do?"
"I once ate a piece of cake, it was old.  After the first bite I noticed spots of mold on it.	Did you have to throw it away?"
"No I spit it out and listerined my mouth.	That sounds really bad. I hope you're okay!"
"I was heartbroken when my mom told me that my childhood dog had died	I'm sorry.  I hope you were able to get through it."
"I'm coping with it. So many memories with her	Why do you say that?"
"my brother passed away 2 years ago and i'm still so heartbroken. it still hurts so much	That is terrible. I am so sorry."
"thank you. I'm sure it will get easier with time. It was just so tragic, he was so young	That's so sad. It's great you are not feeling overwhelmed."
"I am so angry to see so much fake news floating around in the media	I am so sorry. I am glad you are aware of the fake news."
"Very true! Why does news have to be so hyped up?	I agree! I don't get why it's so sensationalized."
"My little girl loves to wake up at night and ask for chocolate milk.	How old is she?"
"I have an 18 year old doing the same.  What my 4 year old doesn't know is I giver her the sugar free version.	That's so sweet of you!  I bet your kids love the treats!  What are you giving her?"
"I lost a good job a few years back	Oh no! How did that happen?"
"The company got bought by someone else and we all got laid off.  Lost my family home and all.  But things are slowly improving.	That is so sad.  I bet that is really hard to go through.  But I'm sure you'll get through it."
"So i used to shop in walmart and i thought it was the cheapest place to shop at but yesterday i went grocery shopping at aldi's and i was so surprised to see how much cheaper it is to shop there	I've never been to aldi's, but I have heard they are pretty cheap."
"you should give it a try! They have their own brands which are super cheap and the quality is great	That sounds great.  I am a fan of buying my own things and not having to pay for shipping."
"I am really looking forward to the new season of the Lakers	I'm sure they will do great this year!"
"Hell yeah! i am sure we are going to perform really well this season	That's good to hear. What sport are you playing?"
"I always feel sad when i think about my dad, he passed away few years back	I am sorry to hear that."
"He had lung cancer..	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"My friends are saying my girlfriend is cheating behind my back, but i trust her	That's good to hear.  I'm sure it's not true."
"May be. But i have known her all my life, she would die before going behind my back	That's a pretty strong feeling. Did you have a close relationship?"
"I have a lot of stuff coming up due this month.  I also have a lot of purchasing goals as well.  I am confident I will be able to meet all of them.	Oh wow, that's great! What are you looking to buy?"
"That's the plan, I've signed up for a bunch of double shifts.  Fingers crossed.	I am happy for you. I always seem to have trouble taking on double shifts."
"I was so thrilled to get to see Hamilton, i was really looking forward to it	I am a big fan of Hamilton! I have seen it on Broadway!"
"It is the broadway show, by Lin manuel miranda	That sounds amazing, have you seen it?"
"My dog started walking again after an accident she had	Wow! That's amazing! Did you have to get her a harness?"
"She fell down from the first floor..	I am sorry to hear that.  Did she break her ankle?"
"I used to be a member of a very cool dance crew. I miss those days	That's a good thing to have those memories of the past."
"mostly hip hop. We were travelling and battling with other teams. It was really fun	Well that's awesome! Did you win?"
"i wan to participate in a bodybuilding contest! I'm sure i will win it!	That's great! What are you training for?"
"That's not true! I'm actually vegan and I don't make steroids and I looks pretty amazing. I don't need to use none to participate or win	I'm sorry to hear that.  I've been a vegan for years, and I think it's really healthy for you.  I've never used steroids, and I have never felt better."
"I felt so proud when my son got good grades in school last month	That's good! How old is he?"
"Oh alright then, feel good	i feel alone whenever i think about my dad, he passed away last year	That is so sad.  I am sorry.  What did he do?"
"yeah.. i know.. memories still haunt though..	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you can get over them?"
"I was really nervous when my girl asked me to meet her parents	I bet you were!  Did you meet them well?"
"I was really close to running away, but i somehow managed to pull it off	That's awesome, how did you do it?"
"my friend bought a big house and i'm happy for her but at the same time i'm a little bit jealous	That's great! What made you jealous?"
"true, but there is so much space for her kid to run and play at and I live in a tiny apartment with my son	That is very exciting. I have a big house with lots of room for the kids to run and play."
"I was so mad when i found out my cousin asked out my girlfriend once	Wow, did you have to talk to them about it?"
"Sort of, yes. He did it anyways. I yelled at him.	Oh no!  Did he do anything wrong?"
"I feel happy when I am outside in nature	I love nature too. I feel happy when I am outside in nature too."
"I love to garden. Organic gardening, I plant peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and a bunch of other goodies.	I like to garden too, but I'm not as good at it as you are."
"Just get outside and started playing / digging  in the dirt, You will soon catch on to what works for you.	i was so in awe when i saw hamilton	Did you see it live?"
"It was really awesome dude, the full show covers it all up	Oh, what was it?"
"I took my daughter out to the skate park today.	That sounds like fun! Are you a good skater?"
"Awesome! She went down the big ramp today for the first time. It was so cool.	What did you do?"
"It really bothers me when people come into where we live at night and ride their dirt bikes	I bet it does.  What a nasty thing to do."
"There is many paths leading to faith	I'm not sure what you mean."
"It takes a path to find ones faith	Are you a parent.	I am. Yes, I have two kids."
"When you become one, you will never forget the day it happens. You'll weep of happiness.	I've never been one of those people.  What are you talking about?"
"I think i have anxiety attacks! I didn't even know that anxiety causes some physical pain. like the other day i felt like somebody was chocking me	I've had anxiety for years too. I feel like I've gotten used to it, but I still have episodes from time to time."
"yes! And i felt like that for 3 days on and off!	Oh my goodness! I'm so glad you are feeling better!"
"We planned our honeymoon and booked a flight but I was so nervous about flying.	I know how you feel! I have had a few flights before."
"I found that out, after many sleepless nights. Now we fly all the time and I love it. I feel kind of silly.	What did you find out?"
"My sister recently paid off her house. I felt so envious of her as I've been trying to pay mine down.	That's nice, you must feel a little envious."
"I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal, and I genuinely am pleased she did it!	That is great to hear.  What is your goal?"
"I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating.	Wow, how did that work out?"
"Yes, but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly, it was more about my own insecurities than about him, you know? As I grew more into myself, the jealousy loosened its hold.	I am glad you grew out of it."
"My daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us.	What happened?"
"I prepared for weeks. I could not wait for them to get here. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen them and they have a new baby.	That sounds so exciting! What's the baby's name?"
"I cosigned a loan with my son, expecting he would make the payments and he has let me down by being late every month.	That's awful. I would be upset too."
"I've helped me create a repayment plan where I have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me. I just really feel frustrated because he has the money, but he wastes it.	That sounds like a great plan, and I'm sure he will do it once he gets it in his head."
"I was anticipating a great weight loss after my first week on my diet!	I bet you were, you must have been feeling great about yourself."
"I lost 7 pounds! I am SO thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long.	That is great! You must have put in a lot of work."
"I have felt some of the best moments of pure happiness seeing someone I love getting something they've worked hard for -- like my daughter's acceptance into her college and major of choice!	That is so awesome!  What college is she attending?"
"Absolutely! Of course, now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah, so happy for her!	That's great.  I'm glad you are happy for her."
"I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were.	That's horrible. Did they do something to you?"
"Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own ""vision"" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know?	That is good to hear.  I am glad you are willing to take responsibility for your actions."
"I've definitely worked through that! Happily, it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)	I recently met up with a friend I had not seen in a while. I want to see him again soon and I think I will!	That is great.  I hope you have a good time!"
"I agree. We went to high school and middle school together.	That's nice."
"In college I studied very hard for an upcoming exam that I was very interested in getting a very high score. I was confident that I did so.	Oh wow. That's great. Did you get the score you were looking for?"
"I was very excited with my result. I am very competitive. Sometimes I wish I were not so competitive.	That's good. I am also competitive, but I am not as focused as you."
"You are completely right. It is very important to not lose sight of what is important in life.	A have a friend that is going to be visiting me this week! I cannot wait!	Oh, that's awesome! What are you going to do?"
"She was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south.	That's sad.  I hope she does okay."
"I am currently dealing with epilepsy unfortunately, and the doctors have not found a treatment yet.	That is terrible. Have you tried anything so far?"
"Thanks. I have to go to a Monitoring Unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location. Not going to be fun.	Oh wow. What is the purpose of that?"
"Thanks again. I have lots of support so I am fortunate	I've felt so incredibly sad whenever we've had to say goodbye to any of our dogs.	I know, I have lost so many. It's really hard."
"I know -- I needed to just come out and say ""when we had to put them down"". Always age or illness related -- but man, SO tough.	Oh man, I'm so sorry.  That must be so difficult.  What kind of animals were they?"
"My friend has been on the couch for a few weeks. He is getting under my skin now.	I'm sorry to hear that."
"No, he is a friend that recently got fired and needs some help.	That is a very good friend, I hope he gets back on his feet soon."
"I have been trying to lose weight in a group and while i made it to 4 lbs, my friends made it to 15. :(	That's a lot of weight loss. I hope you can get back on track."
"i guess they worked harder but	What happened?"
"I went on a road trip with some friends. We had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping, too!	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"Yes, sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more.	That's a good thing to be able to do."
"We paid 600$ for a cruise, but they canceled it with not refunds one week before. so mad	I would be very upset.  Did you try to get a refund?"
"we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company, so they dont know what they're in for	oh no, are you guys doing anything to prevent them from getting away with it?"
"I had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago. I wonder if I will see her again any time soon.	Oh that is great. What did you do?"
"We went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends.	That sounds like a great time. Where was the beach?"
"I live alone. Sometimes it can be hard with nobody around.	I know what you mean! Sometimes it can be lonely, but I'm sure you're not alone."
"I think that's a great idea. I will try to go out this weekend.	That is very exciting."
"I saw a huge spider in my car yesterday. I scared me so!	I would be terrified!  What was its name?"
"I stopped the car and got out and ushered it out of the car.	That is a good thing to do."
"I hope that this summer I can go to Florida with my family	I hope you have a good time!"
"Summer is not over until Labor Day! We still have the whole month of August!!	I know, I hate the summer. I am so ready for it to be over."
"Summer can be over in July for teachers sometimes. Are you a teacher?	My roommate eats my food sometimes. This makes me so angry!	Oh no!  I bet that's annoying.  Maybe you can talk to him about it?"
"I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.	That sounds like a good idea!"
"I recently lost my sister to breast cancer. She was very young and has left three little girls. I have been devastated.	That's terrible. I'm so sorry."
"My parents health has deteriorated rapidly, and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.	That is terrible. I hope they get help soon."
"It's why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own.	I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can't always get what you want.	I agree.  There are a lot of people out there who don't appreciate the people in their lives."
"Life is not fair, but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with	That's true. I think we're all lucky in the sense that we get to live in this amazing world."
"I'm a little anxious about an upcoming move. It's to a *very* different state with a *very* different climate and way of life!	Oh wow!  I can imagine.  That must be very scary.  I hope everything goes well and you enjoy the new place!"
"We've been great with change, including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot, and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man, those looooong winters!	Wow, I love Alaska, but I understand that the winters can be so cold and dark!"
"Ha! Not likely in the city....but hey...who knows! I WILL use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski.	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"The economy has been doing well. The future looks bright.	Yeah, it's been a great time to be living in America."
"Hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations.	I agree, prosperity is a great thing."
"My sister unfortunately will not seek help for her alcohol problems, and she will not even admit to them. I am extremely sad apprehensive about what might happen to her.	That is very sad, is she in a relationship with someone?"
"I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention, but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.	I'm sorry to hear that. What is she doing that you think she needs help with?"
"It was still so unexpected when my husband and I -- who were open to getting pregnant -- found out that we actually were!	That's so exciting!  I'm so glad you are both happy and healthy!"
"Oh, that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day, Halloween, visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.	That sounds like a lot of fun.  I bet you have some great memories."
"The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful, in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!	Oh wow, that's a unique memory. What did you do with it?"
"The horror film I saw last night can cause nightmares. It was so scary!	I love horror movies. I'm sure it was scary."
"I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.	Did you have a good time?"
"My daughter was accepted into Harvard. She starts in the fall.	That's awesome!  I'm so happy for her!"
"She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!	I bet it is.  Are you going to support her?"
"My friend purchased a new car. The ride is sweet!	That sounds so nice, are you happy for him?"
"They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.	Did they have to pay for it?"
"I graduated college recently. I'm so glad!	I'm glad for you! What did you major in?"
"I majored in environmental engineering!	Oh, that's cool! Do you work with the environment?"
"I cheated on my girlfriend recently. I feel horrible about myself right now.	That is terrible, you should really be ashamed."
"I plan on coming clean at some point, but I'm not sure how to break the news.	You will have to be brave."
"I can not wait until some of my family come in to town. They will be coming in to town in two weeks.	What are you guys doing for the first time?"
"I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.	That's great, are they going to be together?"
"I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.	That's nice. Do you still keep in touch with them?"
"Yes, I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.	I'm sorry to hear that."
"I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!	That's awesome! I love watching horror movies."
"A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.	That's cool. What kind of video?"
"I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary	That is nice.  I always thought that was a nice thing for the man to do."
"Yes, it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.	That sounds like a fun place to stay. I bet it is very cozy and warm."
"I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.	That's terrible. I'm sorry. I have a dog too."
"Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much	That's really nice. How did you meet her?"
"I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.	I agree. I was shocked when he won."
"We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.	I agree with you. I am concerned about the direction of our country."
"Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!	I'm sorry to hear that! Did you get it fixed?"
"Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.	That is very frustrating, I hope you get the healing you need."
"Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions	I'm glad you got to visit. Did you enjoy it?"
"No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance	I've been to Alabama, it's a beautiful place. What was your trip for?"
"I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight.	That is terrible.  I hope you guys can work it out.  What was the project?"
"Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad!	I'm so with you.  I've been there a few times."
"I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.	I'm sorry to hear that.  They can be pretty nasty."
"I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.	I can understand that. It can be hard when you don't have a lot of control over things."
"Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing.	That's a good idea.  It's always better to be prepared."
"It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!	Oh, I hope you are not too scared!"
"Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.	I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times	That sounds fun!  Did you get to ride the horses?"
"A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse	Oh wow! I don't even know what to say."
"Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work.	The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.	That is awesome! I am glad you were able to do that."
"I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're okay."
"One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.	That sounds scary. Did you do it?"
"Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.	Oh, I would have been very scared!"
"My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!	I bet you are excited, I love going to the beach."
"I am, but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here, bored stupid! I know, I'm being selfish.	That's fair, you have to do what you have to do!"
"I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.	I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!	That's exciting, what are you moving to?"
"Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!	That's a pretty interesting place. What are some things you like about it?"
"I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate	I'm sorry you feel that way. I don't know how that is possible."
"No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy.	I'm happy for you!  It's been a tough year for me."
"My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis	Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.	I am sure it was an intruder!"
"Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.	That is not good at all. I hope you are okay now."
"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	That is a bummer. Did you talk to them about it?"
"Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.	That is a pretty harsh way to put it.  What are you talking about?"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.	That is awful. What happened?"
"Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.	That's good! You're still a good presenter."
"I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!	That is so nice. What did you buy?"
"Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.	That is a great community to live in.  What city are you in?"
"Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!	I like hot, steamy summers! I think you should pack light and wear sunscreen."
"I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.	I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.	That is scary! What did you do to stop the wasp?"
"Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck	What is it going to be?"
"Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!	So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.	Oh no, that must have been frustrating for you to deal with."
"Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.	That's so nice of them. I bet you felt bad."
"I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.	I can relate. I have a lot of fond memories of my childhood."
"Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha	I know what you mean!"
"I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.	That's awesome, I hope that you continue to do what you love."
"I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.	That's great, you must be very happy to work for them."
"I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.	That is awful! I would be very upset."
"I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!	That sounds like a lot of fun. I hope you find a good girlfriend soon."
"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	What did he do?"
"Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!	I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.	That's crazy! I bet you're really happy for her!"
"She won $5,000 and never offered to share.	That's a good one.  She's lucky to have a friend like you!"
"I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.	I am sure you did."
"I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.	That's good, you must be very confident in your abilities now."
"I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.	That is good news!  Are you planning on going back there?"
"Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on	Wow, you're quite ambitious. What's your plan?"
"I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!	That sounds terrifying. What did you do?"
"Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.	That sounds very frustrating.  It is very hard to find things in a wheelchair."
"Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!	My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	That's awesome.  Did she come visit?"
"Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?	I have, but I did it for work, so it was worth it."
"I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.	That's horrible! I hope you at least learned something from it."
"There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.	That's terrible, what happened?"
"Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!	Well, I'd probably be glad! I hate getting honked at."
"Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe	I agree. I have never been in an accident."
"I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.	That is awesome!"
"I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?	I was accepted to a college I had never been to before. It was a big deal for me."
"I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.	Oh no! Did you hear any thunder?"
"Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!	I hope the storms go away quickly."
"I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.	I agree. He was a great person."
"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	I agree, I've never been able to get over my depression, but I've been working on it."
"It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.	My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.	Oh wow! I bet he was impressed."
"I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.	Did you get a raise?"
"I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!	Oh, that sounds fun! What amusement park?"
"I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?	I do!  My favorite is Universal Studios.  The thrill rides are so much fun!"
"I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.	That is awesome! I wish I had a savings account."
"That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.	Oh that's good!  I've been trying to get my finances in order for a while now, and it's great to hear that you're on the right track!"
"We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.	That's great. Did you have a lot of guests?"
"Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.	I have had those kids. They are the best."
"I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.	Oh no! That's terrible! Did you get it?"
"That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!	That's horrible. I am sorry. What was your dog's name?"
"I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.	I'm a big fan of TV shows."
"Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.	I know what you mean. I've seen so many sad movies that I have to cry, but I still enjoy them."
"Nah, I don't get to to bad.	I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!	That sounds like a lot of fun!  I've been to Busch Gardens a couple times.  What do you think you're going to do?"
"I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa?	I did, but I didn't go to the one in Tampa.  I went to the one in Williamsburg.  It was pretty cool."
"Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.	I agree. Kids are so simple."
"This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.	Oh man. How did you react?"
"Not even a little.	What's not even a little?"
"I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.	That is so nice of them!"
"Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems	That is great. I hope they both get better."
"I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house	That's terrible!  How did you catch it?"
"It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.	Why? What happened?"
"Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.	I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.	Oh that sounds fun! Did you end up dancing?"
"Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.	That's great! What kind of people are they?"
"I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.	That's great, what's it going to be like?"
"No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?	I am sure it is special."
"I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.	Did you cheer her on?"
"She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.	That's great! What were they doing?"
"You know you could still do it. I know you can.	I have been feeling down about my finances."
"My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.	I'm so proud of you and your son!"
"He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!	That's good! I bet you were happy to have help!"
"You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.	That is awesome!  What job are you interviewing for?"
"It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.	I am glad I could help, but I have to say that I think you are right. I am sure you will be fine."
"I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.	Oh no! Did you eat it?"
"Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.	That's good!  Did you have to throw it out?"
"Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.	Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.	That's really cool. What kind of store is it?"
"It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.	I love that store! I have a lot of friends who go there."
"I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her.	I love seeing my mom too.  She's so sweet."
"I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!	That must have been tough.  What did you do to help him get started?"
"It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!	That's great!  Did you join?"
"Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!	I think it's a great perspective to have.  I've always wanted to live in Alaska!"
"I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.	That is great. I hope you are feeling better now."
"Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.	I am so glad that you have people in your life who care about you. I am sure that you will get through this."
"I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.	I agree, I was just thinking the other day about a friend who had a huge fight with his wife and how he just kept blaming her for everything."
"We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!	I'm glad to hear that. I'm not sure about the change but I hope for it."
"Me too! <fist bump> ;-)	So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.	That's a lot of time. I'm sure you will be okay."
"He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.	That's so cool.  I'm sure he's a great person.  I hope he finds someone soon!"
"I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.	That happens to me all the time.  What did you do?"
"I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?	I agree. People are just so selfish sometimes."
"You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.	That's really sad. What happened?"
"She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.	That's so sad."
"I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.	I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.	I know the feeling. I'm really looking forward to a better job."
"Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too.	It's okay to have a tough time in life, I'm sure you'll find the right path."
"One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.	I bet! I have a sister who is 20, and she's starting college next month."
"She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year.	That's great. You have to be patient."
"June and July are very busy, June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.	That's so cool! I love company trips. What are you planning?"
"So much for relaxing during the summer?	I love summer, but the heat can be unbearable in my area."
"Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.	Yeah, I've never done it. I'm afraid."
"It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.	That's awesome! What's your favorite prayer?"
"You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.	You're right. I'm not really good at taking chances."
"I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food	I'm sorry to hear that. I know it can be hard to give up meat."
"I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all	I can relate.  I used to be a meat and dairy fanatic, but I've been trying to cut back a bit for health reasons.  I've found some really good recipes on Pinterest that make it feel like I'm eating healthy food."
"I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.	Wow, that sounds so stressful.  I hope you can get through it without too much pain."
"oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great	When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.	That's really great of you.  What did you do?"
"I was and she was had a full recovery.	Did you have to do anything to help?"
"Me neither, my mom means so much to me.	That's nice. What's the most important thing to her?"
"Do you get to see your mom often?	Yeah, we live right next to each other."
"I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!	I have never seen one of those! They are really rare!"
"It was blue with white racing stripes.	That's a pretty cool car.  I don't see any racing stripes on mine."
"Same here, they are pretty expensive.	My dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day. Now I have to throw them out.	That sucks. Did you find a way to get it out of him?"
"This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.	That's terrible! I hope she doesn't do that again."
"My wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner.	That's so nice of her. What did she make?"
"She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert.	What a nice gesture. I love when people do nice things for you."
"Thank you! What is your favorite meal?	I love a good steak."
"Me too, do you have a favorite flavor?	My long term boyfriend and I broke up recently. I'm so lost right now.	What happened?"
"I know, it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together.	You have to be patient and not give up!"
"My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry.	That is awesome! What did he make?"
"He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.	That sounds delicious!  What did you eat?"
"I got a promotion in work. I am so excited for the raise and added responsibility.	I am happy for you.  I have a friend who got a promotion too."
"Thank you, I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.	That's great, how old are you now?"
"I work in the military	My daughter can say so many new words, love to see her thrive!	I bet she is a smart girl!"
"Yes, thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?	I have two boys, and a daughter.  They are the best thing that has ever happened to me!"
"I've got all of my bags packed, passport ready, and i'm not even leaving for vacation until next week.	That's great.  You must be excited to go."
"I'm going to Japan. I'm so excited, I've never been.	That sounds like a great trip!"
"So my parents took me out to dinner for my birthday tonight.	I hope you had a good time!"
"Thanks! I had an awesome time. I went to a sushi place and it was delicious.	That sounds amazing, did you have any fun activities?"
"I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had, haha.	That must have been quite fun."
"So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!	Oh, what a great day!  What park?"
"It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?	I do, and I would love to visit the one in my city's park!"
"It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.	I understand, I'm sure you can entertain yourself."
"That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!	That's amazing! What do you do to keep everyone entertained?"
"Whenever we moved abroad, I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.	I'm so glad you learned that!  Where did you move to?"
"Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.	I'm glad to hear you are feeling good again."
"Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive! We've lived in Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Zurich -- Alaska may be next. (And Italy is awesome, by the way!)	It's my brother's 16th birthday in a couple days and he's probably getting a nicer car than I currently have. I'm 24.	That's not cool.  I'm sorry.  You should ask him if you can get a car.  It's a long way to the car dealership."
"I certainly am! Of course, I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.	That is good to hear. Do you have a lot of money to spend on your car?"
"So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore. Score!	That's great!  I'm sure you're happy to have less driving duties.  You can use that time to do other things."
"Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?	Yes, one of them is a boy."
"I saw somebody I hadn't in years. It was a nice meeting.	That's cool. Did you see what happened?"
"Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.	It must have been a long time since you last talked to her."
"I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!	That's a good perspective to have."
"Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?	Yes, I'm able to visit them often.  I have a lot of family.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to visit often anymore though."
"I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman.	Oh no! That sounds awful. Did she get too drunk and do something nasty?"
"I respectfully told her I was not interested, I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.	That's great! I'm glad you're committed to your wife."
"I recently attended a play. My friend's acting was significant!	Oh wow, that's great. What play did you go see?"
"I am very glad that I went and supported him.	That's great. What made you go?"
"Sometimes when I'm driving home after a holiday, such as christmas, I get an overwhelming sense of being alone.	I know what you mean. It's like you're not there with them."
"No I haven't, but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!	I'm glad I could suggest something."
"So I recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe I found and it turned out great!	That sounds delicious! What's the recipe?"
"Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.	That's great!  You must be confident in your abilities to make it.  What did you make?"
"I recently completed some additional training at my job. Perhaps a promotion is on its' way?	I hope so, I am happy for you"
"Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.	I agree, I am sure that you will be able to get that raise if you work hard."
"I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!	I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!"
"I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.	That's great. I'm sure you'll do great."
"So last night I was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone.	Oh no!  That sounds like a lot of fun!  Did it scare you?"
"Yes, I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?	I think I can, it's like that feeling you get when you're not sure what to do next."
"I'm ready for football season to start, NFL preseason started this week, and I can't wait for regular season and I'm really looking forward to the NCAA kickoff!	Oh yeah! I am really excited for the college football season!"
"In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama	I love the Packers! I don't know much about Alabama."
"I visited the BMX park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike, it was insane!	That is awesome!  I've never seen anyone do that before!"
"I agree, years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV	That's so true, I see a lot of bad stuff on the news. But I'm glad you got to see it."
"My car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop. I think I'm going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks.	That's nice of your friend!"
"It was just the carburetor, which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.	Oh, that's too bad.  Did you get it fixed?"
"I was so set on getting an A on my math test that I studied so hard to do good on it. I studied for days!	Oh wow! You must be really smart! What was your grade?"
"I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.	That's awesome! What was it about?"
"My friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago, I'm still in shock.	I am so sorry to hear that.  I am sure you are feeling pretty down.  I am sorry about that."
"They've been really closed up about the whole thing, I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time, I could not imagine.	I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope they are okay."
"I realized yesterday I was pregnant, I was in shock!	That is very exciting! Do you have any plans for the baby?"
"I am still in awe, I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.	I am sure they will. I had a similar experience."
"When the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area, I was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood.	That is scary! I hope you were prepared."
"I had an emergency generator, extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.	That's great.  I've always been a little nervous about emergencies.  Did you have any kids?"
"I stole a candy and drink from the gas station once, I felt terrible about the whole ordeal.	Oh no! Did you get caught?"
"I was 17, at that age I should of known better.	I agree, you should have known better."
"My friend has had the flu, and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.	I hope they get better soon!"
"Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well, just whiny.	Oh nice. He sounds like a little scally wabbit."
"I managed to get on the A honor roll at my school, I was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing.	That's great!  Did you have to work hard for it?"
"I'm just happy that I got it, it took a lot of hard work.	That's good to hear! What did you get?"
"The last time I hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie.	Oh man that sounds like a terrible movie."
"Yeah, it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it, making fun of the movie while it was on.	That's really funny. I hate when movies are on too long."
"I remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview.  I was sweating and couldn't stop my leg from shaking.	I bet you felt pretty nervous!"
"The interview went well and I ended up getting the job, so I guess I worried for nothing :)	That is great news!  I am so happy for you."
"The other day I had to take my dogs out before work, but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so I couldn't get out.	Oh no!  Did you ever get to see what kind of dog it was?"
"She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work, but not this time.	That's terrible.  Is she sick?"
"I was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and I fell to the floor. Everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor. My face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up.	That's terrible. I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"Now I can laugh, but when I was on the floor I was not laughing, I just wanted to leave.	Oh, that's sad. Did you get a good laugh?"
"My son is 16 months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork. I've been trying to teach him for a couple of months!	Oh wow! That is so exciting.  I am sure you are so proud of him!"
"He is still very messy but he really enjoys eating like a big boy	That is so sweet! What kind of food does he like?"
"When my wife and I started dating, our second date ended up lasting like 12 hours.	That's a long date. I'm glad you guys had a good time though."
"Lunch, a zoo, my apartment for a while, and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P	Oh, that's nice, I love zoos.  What were you and your friends doing?"
"Years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure.  I found him in the kitchen in the morning, he did not go easily :(	That must have been so sad.  I'm so sorry.  I know how much you loved your pet."
"Yeah, he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.	I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you're being positive."
"I remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail	Oh I know that feeling! I did the same thing with my first job.  I worked for 2 weeks before I got my first job."
"Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one	It was such a long time ago."
"I realized that my bus that I ride to work in every day is a revamped school bus	Oh, that is pretty cool.  How long have you been riding it?"
"Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is!	I bet it was.  Did you go to work?"
"I broke up with my girlfriend last week and it was really hard	Oh no. I hope you're okay."
"Yeah we where together for about 2 years but im getting over it now	That's a bummer.  How did it end?"
"I was out at dinner with my family, and when coming back to the table from the bathroom I somehow accidentally sat down with a different family.	Oh no! Did you feel embarrassed?"
"Yeah, it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P	Oh that's nice. Did you guys have fun?"
"We are getting our son to go back to college in a few days and it really made me stop and think back to him when he was smaller, and how time flies by so fast!	That's so true, time just goes by so fast."
"I know, that's about how I felt too! I think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!	That's so sweet! I bet you have some great memories of him."
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped and fell. There were so many people around that saw me hit the ground. You can imagine how I felt!	I'm sorry to hear that."
"I scuffed my knees a bit, but I was okay. I was also with a person that I really liked, so that made it even worse. But, I jumped up super quick lol	Oh no!  Well you are lucky to have such a nice friend.  I bet you felt a little bad though, but it's good you had a friend to hang out with."
"i stold some spare change from my parents	That's the worst thing you can do"
"maybe like 19, but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner	That's nice. What did you do?"
"Yeah i told them as well	My sister passed away several years ago. I really had a hard time with the grief and couldn't really relate to anyone that tried to help me with it.	I'm sorry for your loss. I know how that feels."
"Yes, I'm sure you can relate as well. Ironically, that was the same age that my sister passed away. She took her own life, which my mother and I found her, and it was very hard for us all. But, I couldn't burden my parents with my pain, I felt.	I'm so sorry to hear about your sister. I hope she is in a better place."
"Having a good job is something to thank	That's good to hear. What job do you have?"
"to life God to that higher energy	I agree with you.  I was in a bad place a few years ago, but I felt a sense of hope and peace when I was in that place."
"Nobody ... that's why I'm grateful	Did you do something good?"
"I'm an administrative assistant for a construction company	That sounds like a very interesting job."
"I was devastated when I lost my phone	I have lost my phone before too. I hope you found it!"
"I did but it took a while	How long did it take?"
"I was surprised when my family threw me a surprise party	That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you have a big party?"
"I turned 34	What happened?"
"i didn't see my parents since 2014! I miss them so much. it's so sad that i live in a different country	That's really sad. What have you done to try to stay in touch?"
"actually in 2 weeks! I'm so excited about it. I'm going there with my son! They've never met him	Oh wow! That is awesome! I'm sure you'll have a blast!"
"I was annoyed when my favorite show wasn't on	I hate that. What show was it?"
"I ended up watching Impractical Jokers	That was a funny show. I love it."
"I love when I need to show someone how to do something and everything goes off without a hitch.	That is the best feeling."
"Fortunately it's usually just not having the best answer for what they ask. I've learned and prepared a lot more this time.	I'm glad you have the time to do so."
"I tend to know a thing or two on occasion.	I am taking a long overdue and much needed vacation this week. I wish i didnt have to fly.	I'm glad you're taking some time to relax and recharge. I'm sure you'll have a great trip!"
"I usually do pretty good on short flights. Longer ones make me a little nervous.	I understand that.  I am not good at flying either.  I always get so nervous!"
"I hate turbulence too.	I didnt think to invite my sister to a party I recently helped put on.	Oh no.  Was it a surprise?"
"No she wasnt. In all fairness it was a group of people I never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with.	That's sad. I'm sorry to hear that."
"you are right. Guess I know better for next time.	My sunday was great. All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.	I am so glad to hear that. What chores did you do?"
"I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.	I am sorry to hear that. It's hard to see your yard get overgrown."
"ouch! I would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way.	I bet, what happened?"
"My husband has to travel a lot for work. It can be hard on a marriage, but after almost 23 years of marriage, I have faith he is loyal and faithful when he does.	That's great to hear! It can be hard for people to be away from each other, but if you have a strong relationship, it can be really good."
"He is an iron worker, so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings.	i am sure you are proud of him"
"I've been married almost 23 years, but many years ago, my husband was acting a bit too ""chivalrous"" to a female acquaintance of ours. He said he was only being nice, but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice', which made me feel a bit upset.	That's weird.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  But honestly, it's not your fault.  You can't control what others do.  It's your husband's responsibility to be respectful of you."
"Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.	Oh, that sounds so scary. Did you have to call the police?"
"My niece is super talented lately.	That's awesome. Is she a musician?"
"Art, she was accepted into a special program for high school.	Did she get an A?"
"Mostly drawing. And she's in advanced level classes in most subjects.	One day my 10 year old daughter came home crying after she got off the bus. A teenage boy purposely tripped her as she was getting off and she got hurt. Needless to say, I was very, very upset!	I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been really scary for you."
"I actually knew his father, so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.	That is very mature of you, I am sure your friend appreciated it"
"I really dont like my husbands job right now.	That's terrible. Have you talked to him about it?"
"Retail, but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks	I know how you feel.  I've worked nights and it's hard."
"We are hoping with in a few months.	Each year my husband usually gets a bonus this month or next. It's not promised, but it has happened for several years now. I am really wishing it will be this year too!	What a great feeling!"
"Well, we have college tuition, just got back from an expensive beach vacation, etc. So, if anything replenish some savings, right!	Oh yeah, I know what you mean.  I'm trying to save up for a car, and a vacation, and a house.  It's a lot to keep track of."
"I hate watching movies that are full of gore! I just saw one today and so gross!	I know what you mean.  I try to avoid them as much as possible.  I'd rather watch a nice romantic comedy."
"Yes, I was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off. yuck!	I hate that show!"
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	That is frustrating. I hope you will get it!"
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	That's a good thing though, it's always good to have a little uncertainty in life."
"He is a welder and iron worker, so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel. He has earned it!	I've been married a long time, but my husband is gone quite a bit for work. I feel a bit by myself at times because of this :(	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're okay."
"Luckily, my children still live at home, but it's not quite the same. Plus, it won't be too long before they are ready to move out	I'm sure they will be ready soon. What are they in school for?"
"My youngest child started high school this year. It really made me think back to her starting kindergarten, and how time really goes by. I can just see her learning to read!	That's awesome! I hope she does well!"
"Yes, it really is bittersweet. But, the older they get, the easier it is to think back to the younger days!	I totally understand. I'm 30 and I have so many good memories from when I was younger."
"I was so scared when i heard a gunshot sound while i was walking through the streets the other day	I'm so sorry. Did you call the police?"
"No, i felt it would be better if i dont go looking for it. i managed to get the hell out of there	That is good. I hope you are safe."
"I feel so sad whenever thoughts about my dad come to me, he passed away last year	I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope you can find some closure."
"He had terminal stage brain cancer.. we did all we could, but..	How did it end?"
"i felt really good about myself when i got a new job at a reputed firm	That's awesome. What kind of job was it?"
"i was so angry when i found out my girlfriend kissed a friend of mine	That's awful.  Was it a new friend or someone you know?"
"i have not confronted them. still thinking about it	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"I went to the beach last week	That sounds like fun! Did you enjoy it?"
"yeah. so much memories of me and family spending time in beach came to me	Did you go to the beach recently?"
"I was so furious when i found out a coworker badmouthed me to my boss	That's terrible.  How did you react?"
"Yeah. i outperform this person, and he started throwing shade on me out of pure jealousy	That's not cool.  What did he say?"
"I went to see Hamilton last month in NYC	That was a great show.  I've seen it a few times.  What did you think of it?"
"It was such a stunning show. Lin manuel should get a grammy for this	I love that guy! He's amazing!"
"I was so ashamed when i threw up in public the other day	I'm sorry to hear that. That's awful."
"Yeah, i felt like i was coming down with something. i rushed to get a cab, but i couldn't help it	I feel you. I was in the middle of a conversation with my girlfriend and I had to take a cab. I think I was getting a bit sick."
"My girlfriend asked me to meet her parents next week	Oh no!  Are you nervous?"
"I am not sure to be honest. i am feeling so nervous about it	I am not sure what you are talking about."
"i felt betrayed when my girlfriend kissed another guy at a party	That's awful.  What did you do?"
"Nothing. She was drunk, so i let it go. I still feel disappointed	That is pretty hard to hear."
"I was really upset when my daughter went into labor and I couldn't be there.	I'm sorry to hear that.  Was she in labor long?"
"She lives in another state and wasn't due for several more months. Everyone is fine now though, so it has turned out to be very joyous.	I am glad that the situation turned out well for everyone."
"I was in total shock the night my fiance proposed to me at a concert.	I have never been to a concert before. How did it go?"
"They started playing one of our special songs and the next think I knew he was down on one knee. I said yes, of course!	Oh my goodness, that's so sweet!  That's the kind of moment you'll always remember.  What did you name the baby?"
"I admire my boss because he does not act like a boss. He acts more like a friend and he is so down to earth.	That is very nice of him. I hope you are happy with him."
"He is not just friendly, he is a good leader and knows how to treat his workers.	That is so nice.  I wish I had a good leader like that.  I am so tired of the way people treat their employees."
"I remember when I was a kid and in the summertime I used to catch fireflies and place them in a jar by my bedside at night.	That sounds like a fun time.  I used to do the same thing with glow sticks."
"The fireflies would blink in the jar all night long.	That's a nice way to spend the evening."
"I'm so tired this morning, I went to bed early, but it seems when I go to bed early I wake up more tired. It aggravates me!	I know the feeling.  I go to bed super early and wake up super early.  It's like my body is trying to tell me that it's time to get up."
"I hate it! I feel more energized when I get 4 hours of sleep than I do when I get 8!	I know that feeling. I always feel more alert after 4 hours."
"I'm in contract to buy my first house, fingers crossed closing goes well and I close next Friday!	Oh that is exciting.  What are you looking to buy?"
"I'm definitely excited. The house just now got built and I saw it for the first time last Monday.	Oh wow! I bet it was very exciting."
"My Mother and I made plans to hang out and do lunch this past week.	Oh no. What happened?"
"Unfortunately she was unable to make it because her diabetes is wreking her health.	Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.  That must be so hard for her."
"I am feeling bad because my grandchild wants me to play all the time but I have to work a lot.	What kind of work do you do?"
"She doesn't understand why I always have so many other things to do, but she would literally play 24/7 if I had the time.	Oh, that's so unfair. What's your problem?"
"My four year old daughter came to me beaming with pride and showing me a drawing she did of me.	That is so sweet!  Is she a good artist?"
"I was really surpised.  I expected a stick figure, but she drew a lot of features including my beard and mustache.	Did you like it?"
"I had to run some errands.  While gone I instructed my older daughters to complete some math assignments.	That's nice of you.  Did they do well?"
"When I returned I found them playing video games, the math work was not even attempted.  I tunred their stuff off and we did it together.	Oh wow! That must have been fun!"
"A recruiter contacted me the other day about potential job openings, so I'm hoping I may have a job soon!	Oh that's great, good luck!"
"Me too. I've been dying to get out of my current job, but having a recruiter makes me feel at ease.	That's good. I don't know what I would do if I had to leave my current job."
"I found a box of old photos in my closet yesterday.	That sounds exciting. What kind of photos?"
"A lot of them where photos of my sister and I when we were toddlers.  It was a good trip down memory lane.	That is really nice.  I love looking at old photos.  Do you have any of those photos?"
"I was disgusted when my dad left me	What did he do?"
"I'm not sure. I guess he just didn't want anything to do with me.	That's not good, what did he do?"
"I have been rehearsing for a job interview for a couple of weeks now, and I am so ready!	I bet you are! I hope you do well."
"I don't normally prepare for interviews, but I really want this job, so I put in a lot of practice.	What kind of job is it?"
"I went to the fride and was surprised to find what I thought was an ice cream cake.	I think you might have been mistaken."
"It turned out to not even be an ice cream cake.  It was some kind of pinapple cake.  I still had a piece but it was disappointing.	That's okay, it happens"
"I was surprised when my wife left me	You must have been very upset."
"We were married for 10 years	Why did you get married?"
"I was annoyed when my family missed my birthday	I'm sorry, I hope you're okay."
"Yeah that's very true. Doesn't mean we aren't important though	I agree with you there. We are important to who we are with."
"Interestingly, I also had a job interview recently, although I've already heard back and I got it!	What kind of job were you interviewing for?"
"A lab manager for a Physics department at a University.	Oh, that's interesting. Is he or she doing a good job?"
"I had a terrifying experience what using the restroom yesterday.	Oh no!  What happened?"
"As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise.  When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.	Oh my goodness, that's so gross! I wouldn't have been able to look at myself if it had been that close. Did you have to call a plumber?"
"When I was younger, my dad got into a motor cycle accident. It made me not want to learn how to drive for almost 2 years.	Oh no! Did it get worse?"
"I did learn, but it took a long time to overcome my fear. I'm glad I eventually did!	I bet it was a scary experience! I'm glad you overcame it!"
"I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience, and not altogether pleasant.	That's a bummer. Did you find it easy to replace?"
"Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard, but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident.	That is true. You would have to be very good at it to feel confident."
"In college I was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper.	Oh no, did you tell her?"
"It's ok.  I'm basically over it now, but it was really angering then.	What happened?"
"I was grateful when I married my wife	What made you marry her?"
"We met at a store	oh no that is not good."
"When I was in college an older woman in a class of mine stole my ideas for a paper.	I bet she was so upset to have done that. Did you report her?"
"Well, ranted about it to my girlfriend for a while then talked to the professor to make it clear what she did.	That's good.  I'm sure she'll understand."
"My family and I are close to aquiring a new home.	That's great! I hope everything goes smoothly!"
"IIt is an older home in need of some repairs.  We can't wait to get started on renovations.	I bet.  That sounds like a lot of work.  Do you have a contractor?"
"I was excited when I bought my car	Oh really? What kind of car did you buy?"
"It was a mustang. I saved up enough money and purchased it outright	That's awesome! I love mustang cars."
"I was fast asleep this morning when my cat pounced on me and jolted me awake.	Oh no! That's terrible! Did you get hurt?"
"It came out of nowhere. I almost fell out of bed!	Oh no! What happened?"
"I'm feeling a little down right now. The weather is perfect, but I miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset. Those were great times!	What happened?"
"Yeah, we would take a bottle of wine with us, watch the surfers and just kick back. Wish those days would return.	I'm sorry to hear that. I think the best thing you can do is try to stay positive."
"Maybe one day. That was when I lived in Northern California - the best place on the planet, imho!	I am confident that I will win that spelling bee tomorrow	Oh cool! Do you know the words?"
"I have. I've studied for 3 week now	Well, you must be feeling confident."
"I've been trying lately to potty train my youngest daughter.	That's a great goal. I hope she does well."
"It's been a challenge.  Yesterday she got on the toilet herself though.  She said she didn't want to be a baby anymore.	That's awesome!"
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a while.  Dropping her off at the airport was really hard.	That's not good. I hope she had a good trip."
"Yeah, we talk by text all the time and call every day.  It's still hard though, we haven't been apart longer than a couple days since we met.	That sounds like a lot of time. I bet you miss him a lot."
"I was sad when my dog died	That is so sad.  Did you have a big dog?"
"Its ok. It's just been rough without him. I miss him	Oh, I am sorry to hear that."
"My wife is coming home after being out of the country for 2 months.  I can't wait!	That is great!  I bet you are going to make it a great time."
"I am!  We've never been apart this long, so it's been tough.	I bet.  I am sure you will be together again soon.  How long have you been apart?"
"I was afraid when I watched a horror film	Oh no, what movie?"
"Some have pop ups and they are creepy	Oh, I have heard of those.  Are you on your computer?"
"I'm going on vacation for the first time in several years!	That's awesome!  Are you going to a nice location?"
"I'm taking a cruise to Alaska. I'm soooo excited.	I've never been on a cruise! I'd be excited too!"
"My wife is coming back into the country at the end of the weeks after 2 months away.  I can't wait!	That's great! I bet you have a lot of fun plans for her!"
"Germany for a language course.	Oh, that sounds nice. Did you have a good experience?"
"I was prepared for tonights big dinner	That sounds like a good plan. What are you having?"
"It's going to be at my house. We are going to have a lot of food	I bet you will have a good time. What are you and your guests eating?"
"I was terrified when I watched that horror movie	Oh no, what was it?"
"It was Scream	Oh yeah, that movie is pretty scary."
"I was digging through some old stuff I had and I found letters that my wife wrote me when we were still dating. They were so sweet.	That's so sweet. I bet you were emotional when you saw them."
"Yeah! It gave me all of the feels. I read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again.	Wow, that's awesome! What book are you reading?"
"I managed to spook myself really bad once watching too many horror movies and being in a house alone by the woods.	Oh no! Did you get out of there?"
"Yeah.  I kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods.	That's pretty cool. Did you see any?"
"I'm so proud of my wife	What is going on?"
"She really is	I am glad you found someone you like."
"I was angry when my son destroyed my car	How did he do it?"
"no not salvagable. i had to buy a new one.	What is the brand?"
"its okay. gave me an opportunity for a new adventure	I'm starting a new job next week, and while I am excited, I am also very nervous!	That is normal.  I am sure you will do great!"
"That's true, but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous.	You should be nervous."
"I had to go out of town and leave my dogs with a friend, I was worried about them.	That is a lot of responsibility. I bet it was a lot of fun to leave them with someone else."
"Yeah.  They annoyed my friend some, but overall it was fine.	That is good, did they do something wrong?"
"My wife has been in Germany for 2 months.  I can't wait till she gets home.	That is nice, I hope you have a good time together."
"It sucks, but it's best to keep busy with whatever you can.  Videogames helped a lot :P	I used to play a lot of them. It's great that you're keeping busy."
"My wife has been out of the country for 2 months.  She's coming back soon, but it's been tough without her.	That is too bad. You must be feeling a little lonely."
"I'm looking forward to it :)	What is it?"
"I'm planning on moving to a new city, but I'm starting to get cold feet.	That's a bad feeling, I'm sure you will get there though."
"I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there?	How would you know?"
"One of the things I had to do when I started my job was be in charge of moving a department.  When we were doing it, one of my coworkers bailed on me.	What did you do?"
"There were others, but we needed all the help we could get.	That's great. What was going on?"
"Everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! That movie was so amazing, I feel like i was holding my breath the whole time	I hate when people say movies are boring, I never do. I loved the movie you're talking about. What did you like about it?"
"omg, you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it, it's about aliens	Oh wow, I love sci-fi movies! I bet it's so much fun!"
"it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff, and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it.	I think you're right."
"Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice.	I am sure they are very happy to be able to share."
"I was disgusted when I noticed the food on the table	I know, that's the worst. What was it?"
"It was brussel sprouts and Liver	Nice. You must be a meat lover!"
"I have a lab mix and he is so well behaved and listens to commands so well. I'm glad I got him as a puppy.	I really like labradors, I have a few of them myself."
"oh yea. Basically started the day we got him. That definitely helped.	I'm sure he's a good boy."
"Yes. I couldnt' handle a dog I have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff.	Oh no, I can't imagine that. How old is the dog?"
"My friend just recently moved to California...It makes me sad because I have always wanted to live there.	That's sad. Have you been thinking of moving there?"
"Yeah...I really am. I've wanted to live there since I was a little girl. Someday I will!	That sounds like a nice place to live.  What city is it in?"
"When I was planning my wedding, the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication.	That is horrible, what did you do?"
"Yeah, we dropped them with enough time to find someone else, but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.	I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have any kids?"
"It is so frustrating having to deal with difficult customers that don't want to pay their bills/	Oh no, I hate those people too"
"Normally I would agree. It only seems to be a few here and there. Most of the time I dont have problems.	I hope you are correct."
"We are a retail outfit. So we have some big customers that pay on established terms.	I'm going overseas in 2 weeks! I will be on vacaion for 1 months and I just CAN NOT wait@	I am so excited for you!"
"Where did you go?	I don't know.  I am not a fan of going anywhere.  It is so boring."
"I just about had a figurative heart attack the other night.	Oh no! What happened?"
"I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door.	Oh wow. I would have freaked out."
"I'm very annoyed because my friend didn't give me my money back	That's so unfair. Did you talk to him about it?"
"Yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you ever get paid back?"
"I typically procrastinate when needing to pack for a trip. But this time I got my butt in gear and it's all done several days early.	Oh cool! I'm sure it will be worth the effort."
"Thanks. I usually get somewhere and realize I forgot a bunch of stuff I need cause I packed in a rush 30 minutes before leaving.	That's the worst, that's when you start to panic and realize how bad things are going to be."
"Fortunately, my wife usually comes to the rescue on me.	Wow, that's good. What does she do to help you?"
"My wife was working yesterday, but she ended up taking the rest of the day off to spend time with me! I was shocked.	Did you guys have a good time?"
"We did! We went out for lunch and hung out on the beach. It was very relaxing and a nice change.	That sounds like a lot of fun! What was your favorite part?"
"I went to a restaurant my wife really likes with some friends while she was at work.  It's not a big thing, but I felt a little bad about it :P	Oh, I bet you did! Did you feel like you could get away with it?"
"Not like really bad, just kind of bad that I went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn't go.  It's not a big deal, but I feel bad when I do things like that.	I understand. I have done that."
"That horror movie made me terrified	I'm sure it did. I hate horror movies."
"Scream	Oh I'm sorry, is it a scary movie?"
"I really want to have another baby. Baby fever is real lol I don't want to be all crazy about it, don't wanna track ovulation and do all this but i really wanna get pregnant asap	I'm not sure if I would want that."
"thank you :) oh yeah, you can track ovulation, measure basal body temperature, etc. I'm not gonna go into details	I'm always curious about those things. Do you have a partner?"
"My mom bought be a book online.  It should be here today I'm just waiting on the delivery man.	That's great, that's very thoughtful of her!"
"Yes it is.  She wanted two options so I wouldn't know which she'd pick.  She picked the right one so now it's just a waiting game.	Oh wow, you must be so excited!"
"It is nice to have in-laws that are accepting and loving. So many people don't have a good relationship with their in-laws.	I agree. I grew up in a very dysfunctional family and I wish I had a good in-law."
"Aw I'm sorry. Mine is only a few years old but it's been smooth sailing so far.	What kind of car is it?"
"I have been trying to get my oldest son to be more responsible.  I started out small by asking him to adopt a good sleep schedule.  After several weeks he still hasn't.	I can understand that, it can be really hard to keep your kids on track."
"He does well enough in school.  I think that might make him think he doesn't need any disciple in everyday life.  Make me worry a bit.	I can understand that. I think that he would have to work hard to not fall into that trap."
"My wife usually sniffs out anything going on, but I was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing.	Wow! That's a good plan! Did she find out?"
"Yes. Friends, family, cake, all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.	That sounds amazing!  I would be so happy to see my family."
"Thank you. Probably wont be able to do it again, but happy it worked this time.	I am so grateful for my wife	That's great.  What makes you happy about her?"
"She really is! I couldn't be where I am without her	That is a wonderful feeling. Where are you?"
"I can handle, bees, scorpions, wasps, crickets, and spiders.  But for some reason I lose my mind around roaches.	I'm not sure I agree with that. I think they're pretty harmless."
"I take some conselation in that, however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.	I know what you mean. I've been to a lot of concerts and sports events, and sometimes the loud noises scare me."
"I feel guilty because I couldn't go to my friends party	I would feel the same way. Did you have a good reason?"
"I was working and I couldn't leave early	Oh no. Why not?"
"As a momma's boy I always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time.	I'm sure you did. My mom always made sure to stay in touch with me even if she was far away."
"Fortunately, she rarely was gone for long periods of time, but I always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do.	That's unfortunate. What was it about the work training?"
"Oh it's great.	I am so excited about going to the movies	What movie are you going to see?"
"I'm going to see the purge. I have been waiting to see it for a while	I love that movie. I bet you are excited!"
"I saw a homeless lady and i felt so bad for her because it was so hot outside so went to five guys and bought her some food and cold drinks	Oh wow.  That was a very nice act.  I hope she is okay."
"blessing bags?? what are those?	I think they are a type of bag filled with money and good luck."
"wow that's a great idea! I will do the same! thanks for sharing	The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.	Oh wow, how did that go?"
"Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it, so I don't really know which one, but you can find a bunch on there.	That's cool! Do you have a favorite one?"
"Well, what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems, and I was right.	That sounds like a nice drive.  Did you have any issues?"
"Six days in all, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.	That's awesome. Where did you go?"
"It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas, some with free coffee!	I know what you mean.  I have a truck and sometimes it is hard to find a place to rest.  I was driving home from work the other day and I had to stop at a rest stop to change my gas tank.  It was a bit of a long stop."
"Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!	What are you driving?"
"I have big renovation plans for my house.  I've made a money plan and have kept to it so far.	That's great! What are you renovating?"
"Yes, hopefully it will all go as planned.  So far so good.	That's good to hear! What's the plan?"
"I was so anxious for my kid to graduate	Oh no! I hope everything went well for him!"
"It did. I'm very proud of him	I bet you are, what did he do?"
"I didn't really try to use weight but i started going to the pool and i actually lost a couple of lbs	That is great! Do you think you will keep it up?"
"it's really fun and it's also a great exercise! Plus water is so relaxing	I really don't know how people can be so active"
"I hope when I get older, Im not lonely as I am now	I think loneliness is a real problem. I feel it when I'm alone."
"I was engaged but my woman left me	What happened?"
"I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.	Wow, that's a classic. I love that song!"
"Yeah, for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.	I think that's normal.  I'm not sure what it is about the 80's."
"I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.	That is really sad.  Did he get in trouble?"
"True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.	I have been there. I have been on a mission for a week."
"K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there, but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.	I'm glad you were safe."
"It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.	That sounds scary. I hope you are okay."
"Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified, but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.	I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.	I know what you mean. Sometimes I wish I could go back to watching TV on TV."
"Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie, and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.	I don't like when that happens. I always end up going to the movies anyway."
"My eldest niece, who helps take care of her younger disabled sister, graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.	Oh wow, that's awesome! I am sure she is proud of herself."
"Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.	Oh, that's cool. I'm sure you'll have a great time."
"I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.	I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.	Do you think she'd like to talk to you?"
"Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.	Oh, I understand.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you think you could find someone else?"
"I really wanted to try bison meet and I went all the way to that whole foods store like 57 miles away and they didn't have it, what a waste of time	Yeah that's terrible.  Have you tried bison before?"
"thank you! I hope i can find it somewhere locally. i've heard bison meat is very lean and good	That sounds good! I think I might have found it."
"My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.	That sounds awful, did you have to get rid of him?"
"Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.	Oh no, that sounds like a terrible smell. I'm sorry to hear that."
"It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.	I know the feeling! I've been with a cranky toddler for 2 years now!"
"I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(	I hope so too! I feel you. I have a brother in the military."
"I once walkd around the grocery store without knowing my fly was down.	That's a pretty embarrassing thing to do.  Did you get caught?"
"I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.	Oh no! That's terrible! Did you try to call the police?"
"It's been a hard day today, its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.	That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that."
"In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!	That is so cool, I hope you are taking care of yourself while he is away!"
"My young niece, who is disabled, was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.	That's very scary. I'm glad she's okay now."
"Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.	That's terrible. I hope she gets better."
"It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too, but they live in Scotland.	I have this cat that loves to cause issues	I love cats! What kind of issues does your cat cause?"
"Like last night. She decided that she wanted to jump on the table	I would be scared if I were you."
"I have tried to complete a work assigment three times now without sucuess.	That's frustrating. What is the problem?"
"Doubtful.  I will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull.	I hope you do well."
"I couldn't go to movies to watch The greatest showman when it came out so my husband bought this movie when it came out. he is sweet	I love the greatest showman.  What movie did you watch?"
"it's called The Greatest Showman. it's a musical! So good!! I watched it so many times already	Well, that's great! I've seen it a few times too."
"A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would.	Oh no! That's horrible! Was it a big deal?"
"It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker.	That's too bad.  What happened?"
"That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover.	My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.	Oh no!  Did you have any plans?"
"Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.	That's good to hear. I hope you can move on from it."
"It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.	Oh, that's great! I'm glad to hear that you're all set up now!"
"After such a long time we certainly will.  I can't wait to start making the house into our home.	That sounds great. You must be so excited."
"Our pet cat will need to be put down soon.	I'm sorry to hear that. I know how that feels."
"Yes we've had her since the begining.  She is older now and has suffered with feline AIDS for awhile.	Oh no!  That is terrible.  I am so sorry to hear that."
"It really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street	I agree with that. I think it is so inhumane."
"I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity	That is nice, I like to volunteer as well."
"My husband shocked me the other day	Oh really? What happened?"
"He threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death!	That's pretty cool, I love surprises."
"I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.	I agree. Cheating is bad"
"No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?	I have, I used to have a girlfriend who was a prostitute."
"I was planning to view the stars last night, but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.	That's sad. I don't see why they have to be stormy."
"It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.	I hope so too!"
"A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.	That's a bummer. I know that feeling."
"Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.	That's a good thing though, you're happy to have a baby."
"My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!	Yeah, I know what you mean! My mom is always there for me too. We are like two peas in a pod."
"I'm sure that's hard at times. I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.	That must be really hard. I'm sure you're doing well."
"I am dreading the two hour trip to the grocery store this week.	I hate those long trips."
"Me too!! Being so far out, it takes forever to get anywhere. I miss civilization lol.	Yeah, we need some of that back home."
"We are workcamping in the mountains of NM. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours to get anywhere lol. We havent seen new faces around here in months lol.	im really exited to go to disneyland on vacation next summer	oh that sounds like fun, do you have a family vacation planned?"
"yes im staying at the hotel for the first time i am really happy	That's great. You must be excited."
"I finished a class and most of my classmates got an A! It took a lot of work.	That is a good accomplishment.  What class was it?"
"It sure does! I am so proud of the hard work that everyone put in!	That is great! What did they do?"
"I have the best kids in the world.	What makes them so special?"
"Lots of little stuff.  They love to draw me pictures, crack jokes, and give lots of kisses.	That's great.  I bet you really enjoy it.  It's nice to have some friends."
"My husband has been putting in so many extra hours at work	I am sure he is doing a great job.  How long has he been working at that place?"
"Oh I am pampering the heck out of him! It got him a promotion!	Oh wow! That is a great accomplishment!"
"I just got laid off from my job. I need the paycheck so this is not a good situation.	I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you looking for a new job?"
"I am going to apply for new positions. Hopefully I will get something soon.	That's great! I hope you get the job you want!"
"I work in I.T.! Thanks for asking!	I just applied for a new job! It is a job that I have always wanted.	That's awesome! What kind of job is it?"
"Thank you! Have you ever applied to your dream job?	Yes, I've applied to a lot of different ones. I'm hoping to get one soon."
"i ahte when my Girlfriend goes to the club alone	That's not cool."
"Yeah it makes me really jelous when guys talk to her	I bet.  I would be jealous too."
"When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!	Did you see him with a big smile on his face?"
"It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!	That's awesome!"
"We certainly did. Where I was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs, restaurants etc. so we'd go to the beach and then party at night. Brilliant fun!	My Keurig just died. This is the third coffee pot in less than a year!	Did you try to fix it?"
"I agree! I am so disgusted right now!!! We drink a lot of coffee lol. Its a 2 hour drive to the closest town to get another one too.	I know, right? It's ridiculous that we can't even get a decent cup of coffee at the local convenience store!"
"We travel fill-time in our RV so I don't really have room to carry a back up. I hope our next location is more accessible to civilization.	I just had to move across country to a new job.	That is so sad. Did you have to move by yourself?"
"I am actually! I was so ready for it. I basically studied moving so that everything would be easy	That is great! I'm happy you were prepared!"
"One day my daughter got off the bus and was crying. An older boy intentionally tripped her as she got off the bus and she got hurt. This made me very upset and mad!	Oh no, that's awful!  Did you catch the guy?"
"He just thought it would be funny! He was also several years older than her and a teenager. Too old to know better!	That is a sad situation, but at least he didn't hurt her."
"We recently found out that our 15 year old son has a rare, degenerative neurological disease.	That is terrible. I am sorry to hear that."
"No, the doctors tell us there is no cure. They are trying to treat the symptoms but thus far its been unsuccessful.	I'm sorry to hear that.  What's the diagnosis?"
"Thank you, its been scary. He has good days and bad.	The door bell rang last month. I wasn't expecting anyone, but it was my daughter and her family from way up north.	Oh, that's nice. How did you like to see them?"
"I couldn't believe it. It had been almost a year since I saw them and she never even gave me a hint they were coming.	That's pretty shocking. I would be shocked if I had my girlfriend."
"I've studied hard all night in order to make myself ready for tomorrow's test	Oh I bet you are ready. What are you studying for?"
"Repititions and exposure are my strategies.  Sumer semesters really ramp things up.	I understand, I'm doing the same."
"Going through an unused drawer I found old drawing from when my kids were little	I love looking back on old memories.  What were they drawing?"
"While the actual incidents of each drawing are lost in time it did make me think back to when they were younger.	That's too bad.  What was your favorite drawing?"
"I just had my husband remind me of when I fainted when he proposed!	Wow, that must have been embarrassing. I bet you felt a little bad about it."
"I was so happy when I saw him get down on one knee that I just blacked out lmao	Oh wow! Did you get engaged?"
"The news announced a tornado warning. I ignored it at first, but then the city tornado siren went off.	That is so scary, did you go to a safe place?"
"I almost panicked as the winds started to gust, but thankfully it missed us. A few miles up the road weren't so lucky though. Always listen to those warnings	I am glad that you were not in the area.  I have never been near a storm."
"I got a new puppy for my birthday! She is a cutie!	Oh! That's awesome! I'm sure she will be your best friend for a long time."
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	I love basset hounds. They are so cute!"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	That's fun! What breed is she?"
"My neighbor ran into my car! They didn't even leave a note!	Oh no!  Were you able to get your car back?"
"I could tell by the color of the paint left on my car, and their car now has a scrape with the color of my car. I don't know what to do.	That is really frustrating! I would ask to speak with a manager at the car dealership."
"A thunderstorm raged all of last night! It kept me awake all night!	That is terrible! I hope you didn't get any damage from it."
"It is quite frightening! I wish that I could overcome my fear.	That's understandable, you have to work through it, it's not easy."
"I just applied for graduate school! I feel good about my chances!	That's awesome! I am sure you will do great!"
"Thank you! I am very excited! It is quite unsettling though.	I am happy for you."
"I remember just taking a deep breath the other day in the garden and just feeling happy	Oh really? What was it that made you happy?"
"I have a garden so fully packed that I can't see my neighbors at all!	That sounds like a lot of work to keep up!"
"My neighbor really helped me out recently after a big windstorm.	That's really nice of them.  Did you need help?"
"No, they generously helped me clean up my yard and cut up a tree with their chainsaw, and they asked for nothing in return.	That's really nice of them, I bet you're grateful."
"My son just graduated from high school! He has worked so hard, and he even earned a scholarship.	That's amazing! Congratulations!"
"Thank you! He is going to study Computer Science!	Oh that is awesome!  Is he older?"
"I am taking a trip to Disney World next month! My wife is going for the first time!	Oh wow! Are you excited?"
"I have been a couple of times before, and it is such a magical place! Where are you planning on taking a trip to?	I'm taking my wife to the Grand Canyon.  It's a beautiful place!"
"I slipped and fell in the restroom last week. The floors desperately needed cleaned.	That is bad. Did you get in trouble for it?"
"The only thing to get injured was my pride. It was quite the gross experience.	That is unfortunate.  I hope you are okay"
"The other day Comcast customer service kept me waiting for 20 minutes just to speak with someone. What a disgrace!	Wow, that's ridiculous.  I would have been so upset.  Did you finally get someone?"
"They're awful. If they'd just employ enough cs people to handle the volume you could just about bear it!	That's a pretty good point. I have been trying to get more people in to help, but they're just not coming through."
"Mind you, their product is useless too. Ok, rant over!	Queue jumping is something which irks me no end. I was at the deli counter of my local store recently and some guy came up and started ordering. The employee served him, too.	What was so bad about it?"
"Yes. And I'm disabled and it's hard to stand for a long time while some idiot gets his lunch. I hope it was horrible!	Oh wow, that is so horrible. I hope you are okay."
"Perhaps salmonella poisoning? One can only hope, lol!	I am very glad we headed the warnings and evacuated prior to Hurricane Harvey.	I am glad you guys were prepared.  Do you live in a flood zone?"
"Yes it was a scary time. We stocked up on food and bottled water and moved our RV about an hour and a half inland. Luckily the storn went to the north of us.	That's good. Did you all make it through okay?"
"Our Rv is our home, we are full-time Rvers! Thank you so much! Have you ever been through an evactuation? Did you feel prepared?	This past Mother's Day my husband gave me some wonderful unexpected gifts! He even got me a gorgeous diamond ring.	What an amazing gift! I'm so happy for you!"
"I was! It was so thoughtful and sweet, and I was very touched by it.	Did you get it from someone you know?"
"My parents are going to a tea room for their anniversary.	That's nice!  Did they get a nice gift?"
"No that is where they decided to go but the thing is I called the place and they can't accommodate my special diet I am on.  I am so sad b/c that means I can't go with the.	Oh no!  I hate when that happens.  What are you on?"
"I am very excited for the arrival of our 7th grandbaby!	thats so exciting! how long until it is here?"
"Thank you, I try to be the best Nana I can be. We are hoping she comes while we are visiting for Christmas!	That's great! I am sure she will be happy to be with you!"
"Thank you so much! I surely will.	My dad has early onset dementia	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he finds comfort in the things he used to enjoy."
"Yes, I try my hardest to be caring and patient with him b/c I know he doesn't mean to be harsh or hard to deal with at times.	That is very kind of you.  I know it's hard to deal with kids that are so young, and sometimes it's hard to know what to do."
"At work today, all my coworkers sang me happy birthday. It was so nice of them!	that is so nice."
"It was so thoughtful of them. I didn't even mention it was my birthday.	I love when people do that. It's a nice surprise."
"I don't know. But they sure wen't above and beyond!	I took a huge test today and man it made me so nervous. I really hope I did well on it.	What kind of test was it?"
"I did, I studied every day for week! I almost wore myself out studying.	Oh wow! You must have been very determined! What did you study for?"
"I really hope so, I am so nervous while I wait for my results.	I am so proud of my son	What is he doing?"
"He got the highest score on a test	Oh cool, that's awesome. What was the subject?"
"My husband usually gets a big bonus around this time of the year. We are eagerly waiting, hoping, and waiting for it!	I hope you guys get it!"
"It is! It's not a guarantee though, so it's just a waiting game, and not easy.	I think I know what you are talking about. It's not easy either!"
"I am so angry that my brother didnt come to my party	I'm sorry to hear that. Did he have a good reason?"
"I am not sure. I just don't know why he didn't show	Oh, what happened?"
"I am confident that I will have a great day tomorrow	What are you doing tomorrow?"
"That is so true. Getting to know you also makes it seem like a great day already leading to tomorrow.	Well, it is always a great day to be alive!"
"I have trusting issues because my fiance left  me	That is so sad.  What happened?"
"I know but it's so hard because no one wants to be with me	I feel you.  I know a lot of people that are struggling."
"Flying typically doesn't bother me too much, because I love travel. However I was a bit concerned on a flight once right after a travel advisory had been issued.	That's unfortunate. What was the advisory about?"
"Well i did have a few of those. It went fine. I was still nervous even after we landed in a foreign country. I just watched my surroundings. Everything went great.	That's good to hear. I'm sure it was a great experience."
"I am so lonely right now because no one wants to be with me	I'm sorry to hear that, but maybe you can find someone in your life?"
"Yeah, but no luck	I hope you find what you are looking for."
"when i was younger I was really getting into graphic design and really wanted a new Apple computer. I knew my parents couldnt afford it, but they somehow made it happen and surprised me on Christmas..	That is so awesome!"
"yea my parents are pretty great. Pretty maddening at times, but I wouldn't trade them.	That is a good attitude to have."
"I hope to be there one day and see it from that side.	i felt really good when i won a poker tournament last week	That is great, do you play poker regularly?"
"yes it was, it took a long time to do but at the end it was worth it	I bet it was. Did you get what you wanted?"
"Spiders is one of my gratest fear they make me so scared	I hate spiders! Do you have any that live in your home?"
"i have tried to overcome my fear but i just cant they make my skin temble	That sucks. What was it that made you scared?"
"i am impressed that video games grow so much every year	I know right, I've never played a game in my life but I can play a video game in my sleep"
"that is a great game the growth on video games has been amazing this past few years	I agree. I have not played any of these games for years."
"We went out to dinner for our first anniversary and they got our order all wrong.	That's awful. How did they fix it?"
"Thank you. The restaurant came highly rated by a lot of people so I guess my expectations were high. I tried not to let it bother me.	I love trying new restaurants."
"My wife flew home to see family. It is very quite at home now.	Wow. What a relief. Is it hard to be away from them for so long?"
"I know, that would of been nice! Instead I was all alone for the last few weeks.	That is no good."
"Me too, a home doesn't feel like a home without a woman.	i am really impressed everytime i see my nephew on how fast he is growing	That's great! He must be a smart kid."
"yeah but i dont see him very often maybe that is why i always get shocked when i see him	I am sure it is, sometimes we do not see the people we love as often as we want to."
"When I got the phone call that my mom had cancer I was so upset.	I am sorry to hear that."
"It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.	That is terrible! I am so sorry to hear that."
"one of the best days of my life was when i graduated from high school	That is awesome! What high school did you go to?"
"i know right time goes really fast and you dont even noticed, for me it was 13 years ago	That's a long time. I am sorry to hear that."
"The other night I was driving home in the rain and slid into the guard rail. It is going to cost so much to get my car fixed!	Oh no!  I hate when that happens.  Did you get to go home?"
"I know, I will have to be more careful next time. I shouldn't eat ice-cream while driving,	That's true, but I think you should be able to enjoy a slice of pie or ice cream while driving, as long as you're not too close to other cars."
"It will still move, but I can't steer very well with the front tires missing.	There is a tornado coming. But I have the pantry full and am ready this time.	I hope it doesn't happen! I'm glad you have the pantry full."
"You never know how long the power might be out for!	I know, that's why I always have a flashlight handy!"
"It could take a while for any sort of rescue to come!	I had a pretty large loan, with a bit of a high interest rate, and a high monthly payment. My mother decided to pay it off for me, out of the blue!	Oh wow! I bet that was a big weight off your shoulders."
"Yes, I couldn't believe it. She's so sweet and giving, but I sure didn't expect her to do that!	I bet she is!  What did she do?"
"My husband is the most faithful man I know	I bet he is. What do you mean by that?"
"I have so many health problems and he is always there for many no matter what being loving and caring	I'm glad he's there for you. What are your health issues?"
"I left the front door unlocked and the mailman robbed me. I couldn't believe I would do that.	That's really bad. I would never do that."
"Only my pride! I wasn't at home when he robbed me. He took a lot of valuables.	That is so unfortunate.  I hope you were able to recover your items."
"I hope so! A federal worker like that should have more integrity!	I have always been afraid of snakes i dont know what to do to control my fear for them	I am sure it is not a big deal to just be afraid of them."
"yes, i one time i was taking a hike and 3 meters to my left was a rattle snake i jumped like a rabbit and ran back to my friends	Wow, that's so scary! I hate snakes!"
"I was annoyed when my wife left me	That is so sad. Why did she leave you?"
"Yeah its been a rough 2 weeks for me	How long have you been going through it?"
"I was afraid when I went into the movies alone	What movie were you going to see?"
"Because I have always been with someone, so going in alone just frightened me	I understand that. But it is better to go alone than to go with someone who is not interested."
"I've been married almost 23 years. My husband travel so much, but we both have trust in each other to be true and loyal.	That is really nice to hear. You must have been married for a long time."
"for his job. So, it can be hard, but we trust each other.	that is good to hear"
"I am hopeful that my friend will be able to make it to my party	That's great. I hope so too."
"It is to me because he is my best friend	That is good."
"I have been exercising and taking care of myself more lately.	That's good! What's changed?"
"I think many do, but man does it feel good.	That's great.  You must be very happy."
"I am joyful that I am with my wife	That is wonderful! How long have you been married?"
"We have been together for 10 years	I am happy for you!"
"I felt pretty luck the other day! I won $100 on a scratch off ticket! I never win!	That is awesome!  Are you going to do anything with it?"
"Not usually, I never win. so, it was very unexpected.	That is funny, I never win either."
"My sister was given $1,000 by my grandma as a graduation present. She did not give me a penny.	That's awesome. I'm glad you have a good relationship with your family."
"Perhaps, I just don't understand why I was left out. Seems unfair.	I understand. Maybe you should go talk to your friends."
"We went on our vacation about a week ago to the beach and it rained several days while we were there. We wanted to go to the beach every day!	That is so disappointing.  I am sorry you had to go without it."
"Yes, and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront! But, we still had a good time, just wished we could have had less rain!	I think rain is a good thing! I love a good rain shower!"
"I was given the opportunity to work at a new job that I was hoping to get! I never thought it would be possible!	Did you get it?"
"Thank you! I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity.	That's awesome! I'm sure you will do great things!"
"I fell down in a mud puddle today while walking to lunch. I was covered in mud for the rest of the work day.	That's disgusting. I can only imagine how gross that must be."
"No kidding! It was hard to keep a good attitude for the rest of the day.	That's too bad. I hate when that happens."
"My husband works nights a lot right now.	Wow, that's so bad. I bet you don't get to spend much time together."
"It really is, i hate being alone at night.	I know, I've been there too."
"A few, but he still has to sleep all day, makes doing things hard.	I'm anxious (if excited!) about an upcoming move -- we've lived overseas before, but this is such a different state and climate, I'm not sure what to expect!	That sounds like a lot of change!"
"Alaska! We've got some transition time, but I've been doing deep research on Anchorage -- and the more I see, the more I like!	I love Alaska! Do you live there?"
"I hate that people hit on others they know are married.	I'm sorry.  I can't help but feel that they are just being rude."
"Right? Happens to my husband all the time and it's just frustrating.	That is so annoying! I bet it's frustrating for you."
"No, since it's his associates at work!!	i cannot wait for the next star wars movie to come out	I am too! I have been waiting for ages!"
"he is, i really like the new ones but always will like the old ones better	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you still have your old ones?"
"i hate when i fart in public it is so embarrasing	I can understand that. I've done that before too."
"i can hold them but some of them are just accidental and it is the worst, depends on what i eat haha	I understand that, but I have no idea what to do with that."
"My husband recently got me a great gift. He got me a beautiful 14 kt diamond ring! I had no idea he was.	That is so nice of him!"
"Yes, it was so sweet and unexpected. We've been married almost 23 years so I guess I deserve it lol	That's great! Marriage is a wonderful thing."
"i hate that people dont care and they just throw their trash on the street	That's disgusting.  Why don't people care about their surroundings?"
"if im walking i pick up as much as i can	Why do you do that?"
"i am extremely afraid of going near hiights	Why are you afraid of it?"
"Yeah last year i went to disneyland and got on the elevator game and i almost cried hahaha	That's so funny, I bet it was a little scary."
"The last job interview I went on also went well, but it took a long time to hear back from them.	That's a bummer.  Do you think you'll get the job?"
"Oh, I did eventually, it just took like a month.  I ended up getting the job!	I'm glad you were able to get it!"
"i cant wait for my disneyland vacation next summer	That sounds like so much fun. Where are you going?"
"i think me and my family is going there for 1 week it is going to be wonderfull	That sounds like a great family vacation! Where are you going?"
"i am getting my new car next week and cant wait for it.	That is awesome! Are you excited about it?"
"it is a 2017 bmw, i traded in my old car to get an awesome deal	that's awesome, did you get a good deal?"
"My in-laws are helping us pay for school clothes for our kids this year.	That's really nice of them, I'm sure they have your best interests at heart."
"Yeah, it helps take some of the burden off of us. I will have to check out Goodwill and see if I can find anything.	I used to shop there all the time. I think it was a really great place."
"Wow, those prices are great. I'll be going by there for sure. Yeah, the best part about them helping, is that they do it, not expecting anything in return. They just all of us and want to help.	That's great to hear! It's nice to see businesses like that out there."
"Yes, they are great.	I was in a college class once with an older woman.  She took a paper idea I had talked about and presented it as her own, stealing all the work I had done.	That is terrible.  Did you tell her?"
"I did.  There wasn't much she could do, but at least I could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work.	That's good. Sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you."
"i really hate when people make me wait for no reason	I understand. What do you do to get rid of the time?"
"my girlfriend allways makes me wait, it makes me really anxious ahhahah	I understand. Why do you feel anxious?"
"One of my best friends is moving far away and i dont know when i will be able to see him again	That's sad, but I hope you can still stay in touch with him."
"yeah i can call him and email him, it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again	That's always a little scary. Are you guys in a long distance relationship?"
"I think having goals is important. My mother in law has managed to lose weight and walked daily.	That's great!  What are some of your goals?"
"Very similar ones, but I like focusing on others success	I'm not sure I understand."
"It really does, hope any you have works out!	i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it	I agree, it's so sad. I was in a shelter once and saw a puppy in a cage."
"i know right, it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me	I know what you mean. I have been on the receiving end of some awful people."
"the day i gratuaded from college is my favorite day	I can imagine that is a really fun day."
"the fact that it took so much work and time	That's so true."
"i cant wait for my new tv that i ordered online and will recive this weekend	What kind of tv do you have?"
"yeah it is twice the size as the tv that i have at the moment	That's great! Do you have a big screen?"
"I have an older friend who I try to help out.  She lost her husband a couple years ago.	That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that."
"We go out to lunch regularly.  She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.	That is really nice of you.  How long have you been doing this?"
"Thanks.  Yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now.	We need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues, no matter your views.	I agree, but I still don't like the way some people behave."
"Exactly, let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!	I completely agree! I hate when people try to compromise and then change their mind."
"I spent my first Christmas away from home in a computer lab, working by myself.	That must have been tough."
"Yes, it wasn't very fun.  But I had to do it because my project for work was due the next day.	Oh, I'm sorry. Did you do anything to make it more bearable?"
"I miss my dog Kat	I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year.  She was a great dog	It's sad when dogs pass away."
"Thanks.  I do miss coming home to her.  My cat is just not the same.	It's great to see my husband doing so well.	Well, that's great to hear. How has he been doing?"
"He's become the top manager in his division in just two years.	Oh wow. That's amazing! What division?"
"Hello, I am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets ... it is unacceptable	That is so sad. Is there anything you can do to help?"
"I feel that pain ... as if I had been hit	Oh no! What happened?"
"it's something since I was born ... I'm like that	That reminds me of the time I went to LA for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark.	Oh no! I hope everything turned out okay."
"Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also.	Oh wow, that's quite a thing. I'm glad you were able to help them out."
"I really miss my puppy, we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always.	Did you name her?"
"Yes, she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.	I am sorry to hear that, that is very sad."
"my son is teething and he is so cranky! I gave him tylenol and got some teething toys. I don	I have two babies, I know what you mean.  They can be so cranky!  I used to give them Tylenol when they were babies.  I know it doesn't help but it seems to help a little."
"it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! Doesn't sleep good, doesn't want to eat. poor little boy	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope he gets better soon!"
"i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed. i didn't it's gonna be that hard. I think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college	That's a good point. I'm sure you will be fine."
"I hope so, i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face	I feel you.  I have a baby and they are always squirming and trying to get out of the bed."
"I have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around Italy.	Oh wow, I would love to do that."
"I wish I were with them.  I love Italy	I love Italy too!  It's my favorite country to visit."
"Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.	I love to travel too.  I have never been abroad.  I wish you had gone."
"That is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures	My friend bought me lunch today	Oh that's nice of your friend!"
"I had a nice burger and fries	How did that taste?"
"Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch	I hate when people pull in front of you, especially when it's clear behidn you.	You are right.  I hate it when that happens."
"Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.	Oh no! Did you get hurt?"
"yes, sadly I easily can.	I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy	Oh no! I've always been afraid of the dark."
"That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on	I can understand that. I'm always worried about something."
"I like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs. They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.	That's a very nice thing to do."
"They do. They get to smell the grass, they play they get their exercise, they get to have fun, they get to be a dog!	That is very true.  I love animals and I always wanted to be a dog."
"Last night at like midnight the power cut out completely on my street	Oh no! That is awful. Were you able to get a flashlight?"
"We luckily had candles around! I was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power	I hope that you didn't have to wait for long for candles to arrive."
"A while back my cat knocked over and broke my mothers urn.	Wow.  That is a terrible thing to happen.  Did she make it up to you?"
"I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it	I can relate. I was mad about the same thing."
"I made a bowl of cereal for breakfast and when i started eating i realized milk was spoiled!! I started gagging. it was so gross!	I hate when that happens.  It's like my stomach just knows when something is off.  I hope you got the milk in the fridge quickly!"
"don't you hate that? gosh, i didn't eat anything the whole day because i don't have an appetite anymore	I'm sorry to hear that, but at least you had a good reason!"
"I was so calm and happy the other night just listening to rain hitting the kitchen windows	Yeah that sounds nice.  I like the sound of rain, it always puts me in a good mood."
"It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too!	I love it too!  It's just so soothing!"
"i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere	Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. That must be terrifying."
"not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up	I am sorry."
"Though the odds are against you, I understand why people gamble. I remember a particular time I was playing video poker at a local dive bar.	That sounds like a fun time, did you win or lose?"
"Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!	Oh wow!  That's crazy!  I bet people were shocked.  What did you do after that?"
"I honestly think New Orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the US. You never know what you are going to find around the corner.	I have heard that! I am in the process of buying a house in NOLA and I am so ready to move in."
"Mardi Gras is great, but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town, and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole, and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!	I've heard of that. I love a good party!"
"I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?	I know the feeling. What happened?"
"You can say that again. One time, I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.	Oh no, that's terrible! I am so sorry. What did you do?"
"1	What happened?"
"sorry that was sent by an mistake	I'm sorry to hear that.  Is there anything I can do to help?"
"I don't think I am a judgmental person, but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day, and I can still smell it.	That is a very good thing. She must have been a great host."
"Trust me, this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off, they had running clean water, but no toilet indoors!	That sounds like a nightmare. Did you go inside?"
"I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.	That sounds exciting! What kind of presentation is it?"
"I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.	That's great! What kind of numbers are you looking at?"
"I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at, the possibility looks good!	Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?	Yeah, I've been there before. I was in high school."
"That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!	That is so disappointing, why did she not show?"
"Not too long ago, my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it!	That is amazing!  I am so happy for you."
"Yes, I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought, I am blessed.	Oh wow! That's great. It's nice to have people that are there for you."
"I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible	Oh no! I'm sorry you had to do that!"
"I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me!	What are they?"
"So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!	Oh wow! I bet they're so excited!"
"I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.	That is a good thing! You can get a head start on the day."
"And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!	I know! I was at the mall last weekend and I was so overwhelmed."
"I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!	I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong	What happened?"
"The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to	How did you drop it?"
"I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!	That is awesome!  I bet you felt pretty proud of yourself."
"YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!	I'm sure you are not alone.  I hate crowded places.  But, I think I would be a little more comfortable if I was in the same situation.  It is hard to be happy and relaxed when you are surrounded by people."
"I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!	That's good, I'm sure that's what you need."
"Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!	That's true, but how long do you stay in store?"
"The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider	Oh my gosh, what a creepy thing to see!"
"I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that!	Oh my goodness, that's terrible! What happened?"
"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	Oh no! I hate when that happens! Did it make you uncomfortable?"
"Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!	Oh, that sounds like a bad idea!  I can't imagine eating something from a box blindfolded!"
"Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!	That is no fun, you should tell him you are excited to see what he will get, and maybe he will surprise you!"
"It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!	What do you mean by that?"
"When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.	I'm glad you did too. He's probably going to be a great friend."
"He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!	Oh that's great! I have never been to a music festival, but I am sure you guys did well!"
"Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.	Oh no!  That sounds awful.  Was it a party with friends or was it a solo trip?"
"I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!	What were you doing?"
"I don't know how you are with Calc, but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.	I have been there.  It is a stressful situation.  I have a feeling I will do well."
"Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!	That's really cool. Did you have to study hard to get it?"
"My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night	Oh, I would have been so mad. Did you let her out?"
"She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her!	Who is she?"
"I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27, I would have thought you were crazy.	I know what you mean. I used to think I was too old to go back to school."
"I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer, but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra, and was accepted to a state university two years ago!	That is great news!  I am so proud of you."
"i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college	oh man, that sucks. Did you try to apply again?"
"yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha	Oh man, that's terrible! Did you go to a big college or a smaller one?"
"My boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend...	Oh no. What did he do?"
"Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her.	Oh no.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Is there anything you can do to make it right?"
"i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years	I agree, it's amazing how they've come so far"
"gaming has blown up this past couple of years	I have been playing for a while now."
"I love roller coasters, but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter.	I love roller coasters too, but I hate that they close for the winter."
"Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around, all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.	I love the time of year where you can go back to school.  I can't wait to go back to school too!"
"I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.	That's great! I'm sure you will do great things."
"I'm an Engineering major, electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?	Yeah, I'm a computer science major. I've heard you guys can be pretty good engineers."
"i really am thankful for everything that i have and had	That's great to hear. What do you have to be thankful for?"
"it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little	That's nice. What is it?"
"he gave it to me beafore he went to the army, and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional	My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!	Wow, I bet you are proud of him"
"Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?	I used to, but I'm too old for that."
"I keep hearing strange noises in my house. My husband is out of town and I'm all alone. There has been reports of break ins on my street.	That sounds scary, you should get a security system."
"No I don't, I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!	That's not good!"
"So I suck hard at bowling, but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.	That's the worst.  What happened?"
"Yeah, my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.	That's crazy. Did you get a lot of laughs out of it?"
"I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend, for various reasons, but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!	I would tell my friend!"
"Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.	I am sorry that happened. I hope you can find a way to make it right."
"I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.	That's sad. Do you miss it?"
"No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.	I understand. I'm not very good at socializing either."
"So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.	I bet!  I had to take a year off after college.  Do you have a plan in place for the first year?"
"I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.	That sounds like a lot of work! Do you think you'll be able to do it?"
"So college is starting up soon and I feel more ready than ever to do well this year!	I'm sure you will do great!"
"Thanks, I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.	That is too bad, but it's good you are trying."
"So I just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room. I feel very at ease.	What did you have for dinner?"
"Surprisingly enough, a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!	I love bowling. Is it a favorite of yours?"
"my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart. i can't wait till these molars cut thru	i am sorry to hear that."
"I do but he doesn't like them. he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad	I'm sorry to hear that, what kind of food do you eat?"
"I think I will be very busy Monday night playing my new game.	That sounds fun! Do you play video games?"
"World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.	That's so sweet. I bet it was a great experience for you."
"I come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing. It's very frustrating.	That's terrible, I hate when that happens.  Why do they always argue?"
"Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.	That is good, are they getting spoiled?"
"I think storms are wonderful, except when the power goes out.	I agree. I love storms, but I hate when the power goes out."
"It was extra loud and my husband was at work, bit scary.	That is awful. I am sorry."
"O it sure seemed like it did, dogs were scared too.	College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!	That is great news! I hope you have a great college experience."
"It probably will be, as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!	Oh, I am sure you will.  I'm sure you will.  I am sure you will"
"I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.	That's awesome! What kind of music is it?"
"It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.	Well I am glad you enjoyed them. I don't think I ever enjoyed them."
"So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.	That's good that he has skills. Did you take a lesson from him?"
"For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!	That's a good thing! You need to be humble!"
"I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.	I bet you are! I hope you are ready for the challenge."
"it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.	That sounds like a lot of work!"
"So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.	I can imagine.  How did it happen?"
"For sure, that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose, can't expect to be perfect!	I agree, sometimes mistakes are necessary to learn and grow."
"So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.	It's always great to have friends that you can trust and be there for you."
"No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself, would do again!	That is so cool! I've never been to Utah!"
"So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!	Oh wow, that sounds like a pretty cool car."
"I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!	I have had the same issue, I wish I had someone else."
"So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.	How much are you looking to spend?"
"Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.	That's terrible. I hate when cars die."
"PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!	Oh no!  That is horrible.  Did you call the police?"
"It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.	That is really frustrating.  What happened?"
"So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!	What happened to your car?"
"Oh yes, very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now, I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.	That's an old car. I wonder how it's holding up."
"I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.	I can understand that.  How did you handle it?"
"I know! Like, mentally, I don't care, but my body just responds by making my legs shake, my heart pound, and speaking too quickly.	Oh wow, that sounds really uncomfortable. I can't even imagine that, lol."
"I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times, it was awful.	Oh no, I'm sorry.  Did you have a dog?"
"Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.	I understand that. I have had to do that a lot."
"So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.	I bet.  Were you okay?"
"Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.	That is pretty funny, I bet you felt pretty bad about it though."
"I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester.	Why are you worried about it?"
"Yes, everything's taken care of, thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!	That is so sweet! I love when people do things for you like that."
"i was really glad i finished my service for the military	I'm glad you did. I'm sure it was difficult"
"it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country	I am sure it was very difficult. I am glad you did it."
"i did not expect my car to be soo good for the price i paid	That is great.  Did you find a good deal?"
"yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well	Wow, that is a good find!  What kind of car is it?"
"i don't like to see my parents smoke it makes me really sad	I understand, that's bad."
"yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now	that is good, is it a new thing?"
"i hate when ash from my cigarette drops in my work pants	That's terrible.  Have you tried washing your pants?"
"yeah, i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off, it is really embarrasing	I know how you feel. It's frustrating when you can't get something out of your clothes."
"When katrina hit texas my family lost like half of their belongings	oh that sucks, that is a lot to lose."
"Well when it hit we left but now we are ok and we recovered well	Oh wow, I'm glad you guys were able to recover well.  Did you lose anything?"
"i cant stand people that dont flush the toilet	I agree!"
"Oh, so where do you go to do your personal buisness	I go to work"
"I guess i will be the next team leader	How come?"
"Yes. I was expecting that very much.	How did you know?"
"My kids and I went to Six Flags and they wanted me to ride the roller coaster but I had so many reservations about getting on it.	I love roller coasters!  I always get so excited for the thrill of it all.  Did you get on it?"
"The high speeds. It had been so long since i had been on one. I finally did get on and we had a blast!	I love high speeds!"
"When I turned 40 last year, my kids planned a birthday party for me that I had no idea about.	That is a nice gesture. I hope you enjoyed it."
"It really was and just what I need as I wasn't really happy about turning that corner into my 40's.	That's a good point. I think we all go through that at some point."
"A few weeks ago we were at a wedding. Everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my 3 year old niece started to choke on a carrot. So scary!	oh no! i would have been so scared!"
"Yes, someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.	Wow, that's amazing. Did she have any medical issues?"
"So an online payment distributor company won't instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct. Feels bad man.	That is horrible.  I would be very upset too.  I have a bad feeling about this company."
"Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.	That is pretty unusual.  What did you do?"
"Today is my off day and I wanted to sleep in, yet here I am awake early.	That's good that you have an off day, it can be a good time to relax"
"It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.	That's a pretty rough time for a guy."
"I was dog sitting at my dad's house last week and I heard strange noises in his house.	Oh wow, what did you do?"
"I don't know, it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.	Oh no, what was going on?"
"Last semester, I had to give a class presentation. My stomach was full of butterflies from the nerves.	Oh no, did you do well?"
"All things considered, pretty well. I definitely had some anxiety about it though. Presentations are my least favorite thing in the world.	What kind of presentations?"
"My aunt recently passed away after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.	Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry to hear that. I bet you were devastated."
"Thanks. It's been especially hard because she was almost like a mother to me.	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  Did she pass away or is she no longer with you?"
"So I asked out a girl in my class and she said yes. Was a big morale boost.	That's great! I bet you felt a lot of relief and happiness."
"Thanks! We are getting coffee this weekend. Hopefully something comes of it!	Well that's nice! You're always so optimistic!"
"I always carry a multi-tool and a small 4-1 screwdriver on me. I feel like I can fix almost anything with that.	I have a multi-tool and a small screwdriver in my purse.  I am always prepared and ready to go"
"I'd like to think so. I just like to be ready for anything.	That's a good mindset to have. It's always good to be prepared."
"I'm starting a new position at my job soon.	That's exciting!  I hope you do well in it!"
"I'll be managing consumer relations at a law firm. I'm really looking forward to it!	I'm sure you'll do great.  I'm sure you'll make a great impression."
"My car is on it's last legs. I think I see a new car in my future very soon.	I hope it's a good car and not something expensive."
"I would love to get an X-Terra! I'm a big fan of the SUV platform.	I've heard good things about that car. It sounds like a great ride."
"After dropping out of college 6 years ago, I decided to go back this year.	That's great! I bet you're going to have a good time."
"I have high hopes for myself, as I have all A's so far. I hope I can keep up the momentum!	I bet you will, you're doing so well!"
"I just had a delicious breakfast and now I'm casually relaxing in my room. Life is good!	Oh yeah? I'm not sure I'd be able to relax like that."
"Pancakes and sausage! How can you go wrong?	I love sausage! What's your favorite type?"
"So I have been saving money for about a month now and should have enough for any kind of emergency that may happen. Feels good man.	I'm glad you are being responsible."
"Thanks so much! It definitely relieves some stress knowing that I have a safety cushion. Hoping I don't have any emergencies though!	It is nice to have a safety cushion.  I hope you don't have any emergencies either."
"Having a baby 3 months ago really changed my view on life for the better.	I am so happy for you!"
"I was a heavy drinker, and looking back now, I know I was in a downward spiral, I just couldn't tell at the time. Now I'm pursuing my education and have become much more healthy and responsible.	I am glad to hear that!  I know how hard it is to get back on track."
"My husband and I are going a  cruise with a couple that we have been friends with for a long time,	That sounds like fun.  Are you excited to see what the cruise will be like?"
"We kind of all came up with it together. They booked it and we just pay them a certain amount of money each week, until our part is paid for.	That sounds like a lot of work, but it sounds like it's worth it. What are you both doing?"
"I hope you can too. If its ok, I would like to pray for you, just to maybe help you find someone special.	I am so proud of my sister	How do you feel about her?"
"She bought me a car	That is nice, did you buy it for her?"
"We are basically best friends. It is my birthday and she worked really hard to get a car for me	That's awesome! I'm sure you appreciate her."
"I am sad that my parents didn't attend my birthday	That is not good. Are they busy?"
"No, they just are not wanting to come to it	What don't you want to do?"
"Last week at the end of the week I got home from work and was pretty tired.  I ended up just sitting on the couch with my wife and dogs watching tv.  It was nice.	That's nice. It's always nice to relax after a long day."
"Quite a lot, actually.  It was a nice way to spend the evening.	That is good, what was it?"
"I was going to a wedding outside of my city, and had arranged to have my dogs watched while I was gone, but the person backed out really soon before I had to leave.	That is terrible.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Was your dog well taken care of?"
"Something like that, they were vague.  It was through a company so I couldn't really get much out of them.  Luckily a friend stepped up and watched them for me.	Oh, what kind of job were they talking about?"
"I was tired last night and my wife was out of town, so I went to bed early.  I ended up lying with my dogs in bed for a while watching TV before falling asleep.	That's a good idea. Dogs can be a great companion."
"A wire haired dacshund and a shephard mix thing	Oh wow, that's quite a mix of breeds."
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a month and a half.  She gets back in a couple weeks, and it's getting tougher to wait.	That's a long time. How do you keep yourself entertained?"
"I do, every night.  It's still hard going from having someone around every day to never, but I'll get through.	That is very brave of you."
"My dad was cleaning out his attic when he found a box of my old stuff from childhood	Oh, that is really cool. I bet it was a fun surprise!"
"I did! He found my favorite childhood book of mine and I just sat there thinking about all the memories	That is so nice! What book is it?"
"My wife is out of the country for school, and the other day she was having a really bad day.  I couldn't really do anything to help, and it made me feel bad.	That is very sad. How did she react to the situation?"
"Thanks, that's actually really helpful.  It's been tough being apart for so long, we haven't been apart more than a couple days since we started dating.	That's good to hear. How long have you been apart?"
"I almost got into a fight the other day at a store.	I hate that."
"A guy budged in front of some other people, I confronted him about it, and we got into an extremely heated exchange.	That's crazy!  What did you confront him about?"
"No, the guy eventually backed off and left, albeit not before he flipped me off a few times and called me numerous names.	For a while my husband was really sick with the flu	Oh no! I hope he's feeling better now!"
"He is but I just felt so much love for him because there wasn't anything he could do	I am sorry to hear that,"
"When people make me wait, i get really anxious	I know how you feel.  What do you do to cope with it?"
"Not really, i just look at the clock and wait for the time to come and when they dont arrive in time i start getting anxious	I know what you mean, I hate when time runs out."
"I love dogs very much they are always great companions	I do too, I have a dog too."
"I got a puppy not to long ago and love him with all my heart	Oh that's so sweet.  Do you have any pets?"
"My cat broke her leg not too long ago and had to have surgery one it	Did she recover well?"
"I was lucky cause I know my vet personally so I only paid 175 usd I was so scared for her	That is not a bad price to pay."
"there was a shooting in a gas station near me i was really devastated	Oh no, what happened?"
"im not sure but there was 2 victims i was devastated	Why are you devastated?"
"I was sad when my dog died	Oh no! I'm sorry. What happened?"
"I had him for 10 years. It's just so hard because he was my whole world	That is a very long time. Did you lose him?"
"I am so lonely because I am all by myself	I am sorry to hear that.  I can't relate to that.  Do you have any friends?"
"I appreciate that. It's just tough because I go daily without talking to anyone. It's nice to talk to someone	I'm sorry you're going through that. It's not easy."
"i was really jelous when i say my  neighboor had a new 2018 Bmw convertible	Oh wow, that's awesome! I'm not sure I could afford that!"
"yeah it is i wish i could have a car like that	oh i can imagine! i have a car but it is old and noone can get in it"
"I am sad that my friends dont visit me	Why do you feel sad?"
"I don't have a car and they live far away	Did you buy a car recently?"
"I am disgusted that my food didn't come out the way I wanted it	That's not good. Maybe you should go back and order again."
"It was burnt and not appealing	That's no good! Did you eat it?"
"when i was young i hit a car on the parking lot and did not say anything'	Oh my, that's terrible! Did you get in trouble?"
"i did not see any marks on the other car and was running late	Oh well, I hope you didn't get in trouble!"
"My sister is so caring, she took care of me when I was sick	That is very nice of her."
"That is so true. I am so very thankful	You are welcome. What is it that you are thankful for?"
"I heard this god awful howling the other night at like 2am right outside my window	Oh god. Did it sound like a dog?"
"It was! I was so scared to be honest with you! The worst part is that I don't own a dog either	Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can get one now?"
"I was surprised when my mom bought me a car	That was nice of her. What kind of car did she get you?"
"Its a ford mustang	Oh nice! I've never seen one before."
"I am very ashamed in my family	Oh no, what happened?"
"Because they never invite me to go places, and they never call me	I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you think they are jealous of you?"
"I am disgusted because of my friends pulling pranks on me	What kind of pranks?"
"I dont know. They have been my friends for so long but these pranks are just making me mad	What kind of pranks?"
"I was afraid when I got out of the movie theater	How did you feel?"
"I was watching a horror film and then I had to walk home alone in the dark	Oh, I hate being alone at night!"
"I am very faithful that my family will make it home in time	I bet you are! My family is pretty tight-knit, so I'm sure they will do their best to make it home on time."
"They are in Cuba	That's great! What are they doing?"
"I am terrified that my wife is going to leave me	That's sad to hear. Is there anything you can do to fix the situation?"
"Because she is talking to other men behind my back	That's so rude."
"I am sad that I won't get to see the movie I want to see	Wow. What movie is it?"
"I wanted to see the First Purge	That was a good movie.  What did you think of it?"
"Because I didn't have a ride to the movies	We just got back from the beach two weeks ago. It was such a lovely vacation. We loved relaxing on the beach and just taking it easy.	You must have had a great time. I love the beach."
"It was very nice. There was a day or two of rain, but mostly perfect weather!	That sounds nice. I love a good rain shower"
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December.	That sounds like a lot of fun. Where are you going?"
"To the Caribbean Islands. We are going with another couple that we have been friends with for a very long time.	That is a good time to go.  Have you been to the islands before?"
"Thanks, me too.	The other night I was just craving candy. I ate up all that we had!	Oh no! That is not good. What kind of candy did you eat?"
"Sometimes you just have to! It felt so great then but I hated it the next morning!	That's usually the case, I'm sure it's not easy though."
"My husbands cancer free now!	Oh, that's great news!  How did you feel about that?"
"Congrats! We are hoping right now that nothing comes back but It's so happy	I know right? It's hard to wait."
"I'm so frustrated with my husband. He dismantled the bathroom to do repairs and still hasn't completed them six months later!	What did you do to him?"
"He promised he would complete it within a month and since it's been so long, I called a contractor today!	That's great! What was the contractor for?"
"I've got a job interview set up for next week and I'm really nervous!	I bet you are. What kind of job are you interviewing for?"
"I hope so! I bought a couple books on preparing for interviews and I've done a couple mock interviews with a friend.	That's really good, good luck!"
"My parents always argue and it pisses me off!	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have any idea why they do that?"
"I have but they rarely listen. They act like children and it can get frustrating. What can you do?	I know how you feel.  I have been there before.  I think the best thing to do is to give them space and let them make their own decisions.  I don't think they listen because they are too busy to care.  I would talk to them if you feel like you can.  I know I can't go to them."
"Sometimes life just gives you lemons. At an old job of mine, I had what will probably remain the worst performance review of my life.	What happened?  I hate bad reviews."
"I'm not sure it was really about my performance at all. I was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there, and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved, and I would be answering phones.	That is really bad. Was it something you were able to prepare for?"
"That's must be a relief for you.  I am assuming you have children?	I do, my kids are 20, 17, and 13.  I'm not sure how I can be relieved.  I'm just glad they're safe!"
"So I guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  Do you attend school?	Yes, I attend.  I think it's a big deal to most people.  It's just a normal thing for me."
"Do you have something you are looking forward to?	My father passed away about 2 1/2 years ago. It was totally unexpected and really was very traumatic and hurtful to me. He was still quite young and my family and I had no idea he had a life threatening health issue.	I am so sorry for your loss."
"I was pretty close to my father and always lived close by. But, you always wish you had more time. But, the last words I said to him was that I loved him, and I'm grateful for that.	Yeah, that is a great way to go out.  I have been in a similar situation.  It is hard to understand when you have been close to someone.  I hope you are doing well."
"Once when I was younger I went to a friends 16th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen	Oh no. What happened?"
"we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but I didn't see it.  It was a very clean door.  LOL.  Later on that night I won a door prize.  which was pretty funny]	Oh that's so funny!  I bet that was a great surprise!"
"My daughter caught me in a bad mood the other day and was being a bit argumentative. I lost my temper, yelled and really hurt her feelings. I felt bad that it happened.	That's terrible.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you going to talk to her about it?"
"Yes, I was already not in a good mood, and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button. But, I knew I shouldn't have done it as soon as I saw the look in her eyes, I felt very bad.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you apologize?"
"You never know what someone else is going through, and looks can be deceiving. Like this old man that seemed like any other drunk.	I have seen some people like that too. I hope he is okay."
"It was hard to tell honestly, but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic. He had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home, so I hailed him a cab and paid the driver $20.	Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. I bet he was happy you were there for him."
"We hadn't been to the beach and years and really wanting to go back for vacation. We were able to a few weeks ago and it was awesome. I was thrilled!	That is so great!  Where did you go?"
"It's was great. The weather was perfect most of the time, and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much. We were really hyped to go!	I love the summer. We have a lot of fun in the summer."
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped over a big cord. This led to me having one of those running falls, that seem to last forever! I wanted to disappear at that moment!	That sounds so scary."
"Oh no, there were tons of people that noticed lol. I can laugh now, but not at that moment.	Oh no! Did you have a panic attack?"
"I lost a puppy recently and I'm still broken up about it.	Oh no, I'm so sorry. How old was it?"
"it's never going to be ok, but it will be a little less painful in time.	Why is it hard?"
"I'm sorry youve been there too.,	It's not fun when a 4 year old does something he shouldnt.	I can understand that.  How did he do it?"
"Took a small toy, put it in his pocket. took it back to the store and made him return it.	Oh my gosh that is a lot of trouble."
"Yea, he seems to get it now.	As a mom I sometimes sneak a sweet treat when I make it out alone.	I know the feeling.  What kind of treats do you like to sneak?"
"Still feel bad when I got an ice cream the other day	I would feel bad too."
"I've had a rough week! The house has been a mess from my dogs and toddler. My husband hasn't been helping out much, its fustrating!	Oh no. I hope you can get it together soon. I'm sure it will."
"I'm not sure! He has been busy with work but also has been going out with friends a lot :(	Wow, that's quite a situation! I hope he finds a good balance!"
"My niece made me proud today, graduated from her nursing school.	That's great. What is she doing now?"
"YEa, she's over come a lot for it.	I bet she is."
"Since it was my birthday today, when I came home there was a big pink cake and flowers waiting for me :)	Oh that's so nice. What did you do?"
"My husband! I did not see it coming at all, thought we were going to wait till the weekend to celebrate.	That is great.  I am so happy for you!"
"We had to clean out our storage building because of roof damage. I found an old box of pictures!	Oh wow, that's so exciting. What kind of pictures?"
"My family and all kinds of old memories, birthdays, festivals, swimming, and other stuff	That's really cool.  Do you have any special family traditions?"
"It's so hot and our AC just broke. We had to open the windows to be able to sleep!	That is not good at all.  I hope you can get it fixed soon."
"The icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you	I am sure it was a great feeling"
"I'm so excited! My family and I are moving to a new state at the end of this year!	That is exciting! I would love to move to a new state!"
"That is nice. Having a better paying job is always good.	I am glad to hear that, it is always good to have a better paying job."
"I've got back in to running this week, I missed it! It's a great stress reliever!	That's great! What kind of running do you do?"
"I love to run, did Track and Field in High School! Right now I'm only running 3 miles till I build my stamina back up! What do you do for excersise?	Oh my, I don't do much. I'm a bit of a couch potato. I'm a teacher and I do a lot of reading and studying."
"You won't believe the day I've had! I got to sleep in this morning, I haven't done that in months!	I can imagine. I've had to sleep in the back of my truck."
"Yes, my husband even cooked dinner for me today, and helped clean the house! He has been very helpful today.	That's really nice of him. I don't know how much help he really does, but it's good to see him showing you some kindness."
"This has been a great week! Well actually a great year for my family.	I'm glad to hear that! I hope you all have a great year as well!"
"Thank you, my husband got two great job offers!	Yeah, that's great! You're a lucky lady."
"My daughter is growing up so fast!	That's true. It's hard to believe it's already almost 4 years old."
"She is 4 and in Pre-school! She is doing so well learning how to share and also knows her colors!	That is so awesome! She is just a little baby so I know she is still learning."
"I live in Central Texas, it rained and lightening stuck a house here and caused it to burn down!	That is awful! I hope everyone is safe."
"Yes, I hope the family is okay! No word yet if anyone got hurt.	That is bad. I hope they are okay."
"my baby is sleeping, my house is clean... it's just so nice and peaceful right now	That sounds like a great feeling.  How old is your baby?"
"i just hope tonight won't be that night when my baby wakes up every 30 minutes	That must be terrible. What time is it?"
"I feel like a failure, Im suppose to be on a diet but ate too much today!	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you can get back on track?"
"Thanks, I keep telling myself to stick with it but its hard!	What is it that you are trying to do?"
"I'm thinking about quitting my day job!	Oh no! What made you think of that?"
"My boss has been unreasonable and a pain. He dosen't understand how much time I put into the company!	What kind of job do you have?"
"Tuesday I got to take my kids to the beach for the first time.	That sounds like fun! Did they enjoy it?"
"We had a blast! I could barely contain myself on the trip there!	That is great.  Where did you go?"
"My new dog is doing so great, she was potty trained in a week!	That is amazing.  I had a dog for 12 years."
"She is a Jack Russell, she loves to cuddle in my lap.	Oh, I bet she is adorable. I love dogs, especially Jack Russels."
"i moved to a new house recently and miss my old one	That's tough.  Are you really happy there?"
"10 years, i hope i get to feel the same way i did in my old house	That's great, how old is your old house?"
"i feel like i am the best player on my soccer team	Oh wow, that's awesome! What makes you think that?"
"yeah i do i am always the one that steps up in the game	That is good, you must be a good leader."
"I've been having anxiety attacks lately. Everything is great and suddenly i start thinking about something bad happening and i have a full blown anxiety attack over something that didn't even happen	Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I hope you can get some help."
"no, it just started happening. I would say it started a couple of months ago. i will see a doctor in 2 weeks	That's a good thing. I hope everything is okay."
"We recently went on vacation and it made me feel reminiscent. It made me think of the last vacation I was able to spend with my father before he unexpectedly passed away.	That's a sad memory."
"Thank you. I don't think it matters how old you are when a parent passes away, it's very painful. The vacation did bring back great memories with him though.	I am sure it was very sad.  How old was your dad?"
"my friend can literally eat junk food all day long and stay skinny! She doesn't even work out. and here i am, eating healthy, working out and still loking fat	That is an interesting dynamic. I wish I could do that."
"that's true too! But i just wish i looked like her	I think everyone wishes they had someone else's looks."
"It was my birthday and My friend sent me a birthday card with a gift card in a mail... i never got it, somebody stole it! and we actually have a cluster mailbox so only i can open it. it means that usps worker stole it	Did you tell him?"
"i did, the lady told me they can't do anything about it because it didn't have a tracking number.	That is really frustrating. It's like they just don't want to help."
"My cat was playing last nigh and brought it to me.	That's so sweet! Did you play with it?"
"Well, it wasn't one of his toys like I thought. It was a dead mouse	Oh no. That's bad. I hope he was not too upset."
"my son just used a potty for the first time! he is only 16 months. i'm so proud of him	I bet he is!  That is such a big milestone!"
"I know! they  grow up so fast! I feel like i just gave a birth to him and look at him now	That is true, time really does fly!"
"Sometimes things don't work out like you planned. It can be a real let down though.	I agree. Sometimes it seems like you are just waiting for the other shoe to drop."
"I got two tickets for a friend and I for a concert. The day of the show, it poured and no one got a refund.	I am so sorry to hear that! Was the concert cancelled?"
"My family went on a road trip this week and had to stop at a gas station for the bathroom.	Oh wow. How did it go?"
"Well the bathroom seemed cleaned but the roaches told me otherwise.	What did you do about it?"
"It sounds crazy to say, but even though I was hit by a car on my bicycle, it could have been much worse.	That is crazy! I have never been hit by a car. I am very lucky!"
"I'm quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws). I am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!	That's great! What happened?"
"It might be, but considering I'm 29 with an artificial hip as well, I've gotten used to being half metal.	Last semester was probably the largest challenge of my life. I go to school for electrical engineering, and I took 6 courses.	That's a lot of work. I hope you made it through okay."
"Oh my gosh then you know! I have to say though, it all came out in the wash - 4 As and 2 Bs!	Oh no!  I bet you are so embarrassed.  I am sorry."
"Waiting for something to come in the mail can send me in to a tizzy. It's even worse when it's parts I need to finish a computer repair job.	That is weird.  How do you finish a computer repair job?"
"I did get it done in the end. It was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came.	That's good. I'm glad you did it."
"Have you ever lost control of your bowels as an adult?	Wow, I have! I was at a restaurant and I was on the table when my drink spilled on me. I was in a rush to get to the bathroom and I didn't have time to rush."
"Phew! I'm glad I am not the only one. Although for me, it happened in the middle of dinner at a small Vietnamese restaurant, and an employee walked in on me cleaning my pants in the sink!	Oh my goodness!  I would be so mortified!  Did you say anything to the employee?"
"I went to a heavy metal music festival in Las Vegas a few years ago! I had fun, but to be honest it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster.	Oh yeah? I love heavy metal!"
"I think it's because everybody can relate when it comes to live music. My girlfriend broke up with me the second day, but we had to stay in the same room.	That's so sad. I hope you guys are doing better now."
"You know how sometimes things don't go as planned, but it feels like they turn out better in the end?	Yes, I can attest to that."
"You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event, but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend.	That's a bummer, but at least you guys got to spend time together."
"My father was having abdominal pain, so he went to the hospital and they discovered a tumor.	That is terrible! I hope he is okay!"
"It was cancerous, but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well. A few days later he passed away suddenly, with no exact cause of death.	That is terrible. I am so sorry for your loss."
"I love it when the new star wars movies come out, seeing all those kids (and adults) dress up for the theater really takes me back!	That's awesome. I love the new star wars movies!"
"I don't anymore, but when I was a kid, a friend and I dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of Episode I.	Oh that sounds like fun."
"On our second date, my girlfriend and I stopped in a dive bar on our way back from the beach.	Oh really? What happened then?"
"Like a hole in the wall. Cheap drinks, sometimes a little dirty, but altogether relaxed - the opposite of snoody. They had a pool table and I showed her some tricks.	Wow. That sounds fun!"
"Yeah, I should have just said that. Honestly though, my favorite places to drink.	I know what you mean. It's hard to find good places to drink."
"My father passed away a few years ago, but I still have my grandfather's watch that he gave to me.	That is a nice memory to have.  What happened to him?"
"I honestly hope to. Every time I look at it I remember the good times we had together.	I bet you do. I had a really good relationship with my grandparents."
"Hanging out with old flames can be tricky when you are in a committed exclusive relationship.	I know, I have had those situations before."
"Actually, an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink. She made a pass at me, but I told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend.	That is always good to have a relationship where you can have time for each other"
"going near hights really makes me scared	I know, it's crazy!"
"just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights	I'm afraid of heights too! I have been to many amusement parks that have had very tall roller coasters."
"During carnival season, there is a big rave at an undisclosed location in the middle of the night.	That sounds fun. What are you doing there?"
"They are a lot of fun! I must admit though, I was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down.	What happened?"
"Well, there were only two officers and a couple hundred of us. By the time we were all walking away from the warehouse, I was actually laughing.	my girl friend broke up with me about a month ago	Oh no.  Are you okay?"
"we where just not getting along, and did not h ave enough time to see each other	I am sorry to hear that.  Was it a relationship or just friends?"
"yes we are	I was always terrified of haunted houses when I was little.	What made you so scared?"
"Glad I'm not the only one! My friend has a birthday in October and she wanted us to go to one as a group. I'm still not sure if I'll go,	That's too bad, I hope she has a great birthday."
"My sister snores really hard every night it is getting really anoying	That's terrible, I hate when people sleep too loudly."
"well it is not really her fault it just makes me angry hahah	I'm sorry to hear that. Is it someone in your life that you are angry at?"
"My friend and I spotted a mini-gold course when we were coming back from the next state over.	What a great find!  Did you end up playing it?"
"I know! We played a round and they let us play a second round for free!	That is awesome! I wish I could have played for free, it would be so much fun!"
"I feel excited about our upcoming baby shower	What a fun thing to do!"
"I'm having a baby boy!	That is great!  I am so happy for you.  How are you feeling?"
"i am really exited for my vacation next summer	I'm happy for you! Where are you going?"
"california, i really hope i get to go to universal studios	I think I do too!  It's so much fun!"
"when she left for 3 weeks i was alone	Wow! How long did she leave for?"
"nothing at all. I was kinda depressed	Oh no. What happened?"
"My Calculus final was no joke! I started studying hard two weeks before the test.	That is amazing. I wish I could study like that."
"Trust me it all paid off. When I went in to take the test, I was absolutely solid on the material.	Oh wow, I bet it was so satisfying to have that confidence!"
"Felt sad when she left for 3 weeks	That is so sad.  Did she go to school?"
"To see her family. It sucked though because my car had broken down.	I'm sorry to hear that."
"I am happy with where we are now living	That's great! Where are you living now?"
"A very nice complex with 3 pools!	Oh wow, that sounds like a great place to hang out!"
"I interviewed for a new job and the interview went really well.	That is awesome, I hope you get the job."
"The interviewer made all the comments you'd expect from a good interview and seemed to respond well to my answers.	That is awesome, I hope you get the job!"
"Some people are just naturals. The first time I played pool with a friend of mine, she had to beat the guy running the table.	That's crazy! I bet you were so impressed!"
"I shot so-so, but my friend ended up winning the table and beating 5 guys in a row.	What happened?"
"I didn't receive a scholarship in college that I really wanted despite being qualified for it.	That's a bummer.  I bet you were disappointed."
"Yes, I'll still attend but the extra help would've been nice.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that."
"I know things will work out in God's perfect timing	I agree!  It's always scary to wait that long for something to happen"
"Yes I am. For everything we want for the baby to be gifted to us lol	Aww that is so sweet!  I hope you get what you want!"
"My sister graduated from college after a long road of persistence and determination.	That is a great accomplishment! How old is she?"
"Yes, she is. My family and I are very happy with her accomplishments.	That's great, what kind of accomplishment?"
"I like being alone, but not feeling bad when no one is around to talk to	I like being alone, but I can't stand being alone for too long.  It's hard to be alone!"
"It's true I do need my alone time	Why do you need it?"
"Dog ate grass and then threw up	Oh no! I hope it was just a little bit. Did you clean it up?"
"Well she was ok. Shouldn't have been so silly	What did she do?"
"I am so happy to be having a boy	Oh that's great. How old is he?"
"Thanks. Yes it is. I already got a crib and baby bath.	I would be so happy!"
"When I was younger, I worked really hard to save up money for a car, but needed a bit more. But on my birthday, my parents paid the rest for me.	That's so awesome! I bet you were so happy."
"I agree. I really wanted to do it myself, but it's something I'll never forget.	That is a good memory."
"I recently went on my first international trip by myself.	Did you enjoy it?"
"To visit my family for about 3 weeks, I got married a few years ago and my husband and I live pretty far from them now.	That is a lot of time to be apart.  How do you keep in touch?"
"Yes, just very nerve racking dealing with the international flights and passport checks and security checks. Definitely an experience.	I was very proud of her for flying all by herself	What is she a child?"
"Especially with 2 full suitcases	How many people are in your family?"
"I don't generally trust people.	Oh no. What happened?"
"Upbringing. Dad use to say never trust anyone before I left for school every morning	I remember that.  He was right, but he also didn't have to say it to me.  I can only imagine how scary that must have been.  I hope he's doing okay"
"You just can't trust people any more. My mechanic told me it was going to be $1000 to fix my Jeep.	That's outrageous. I've been there."
"Turns out, nothing much at all. A guy down the street got it running for $100.	That is pretty cool. I wish I had a friend who could do that."
"I am so happy that we're having a baby boy	That's great, are you excited?"
"Yes it is. I am over the moon	I'm glad you're so happy."
"I've just successfully completed my first international flight/trip by myself.	That's awesome! I've never done that before. What kind of trip did you take?"
"Yes, I got to see my family so it was great! I had to be very organized. The flights and layovers were kind of intense.	That's great that you got to see your family!"
"I was so sad to find out what she had done. Found it on her facebook message history..	I am sorry. That must have been bad."
"She met up with her ex to return his t-shirt..	That's a nice gesture. Did she have a good time?"
"I am currently expecting my first baby, it's a boy!	That's so exciting!  I am sure you are going to be an amazing mom!"
"October, right around the corner!	what do you mean?"
"I recently went tubing on a river with my girlfriend and her friends from college.	That sounds fun!  I love tubing!"
"I had a blast! It's supposedly a four hour float but we were out there for eight!	Did you have a fun time?"
"My girlfriend's dog was a 17 year old Chihuahua who emerged from a bathroom at a party in 1999.	That is hilarious.  Did it make you laugh?"
"He just sort of showed up and no one knew where he came from. He passed away recently after running away from our friends farm and being struck by a car.	That is so sad.  What a terrible way to go."
"I can't believe my girlfriend was still interested in me after she saw the slum I was living in.	That's a lot of shame.  Why did she do that?"
"Something like that. My room was in shambles and the house was falling apart! I was mortified when she asked to come inside.	What did she want to see?"
"Once after a night on the town, I came home and my room had been ransacked.	Awwww... that's horrible. What did you do?"
"The thing is, my alcoholic room mate was the culprit. He had even thrown some of my belongings in the bathtub!	Oh no!  That must have been so upsetting.  Did you call the police?"
"I am expecting my first child. It is going to be a boy! We are preparing the nursery and getting everything in order for his arrival!	That is so exciting!  I am so happy for you!  I know you are going to be a great mom!"
"Yes, it is!	Wow, what is it?"
"A few months back, one of my girlfriend's close friends died from a heroin overdose.	Did you get close to the friend?"
"I only met him a few times, but he touched a lot of people's lives.	Wow, what did he do?"
"An extremely timid girl in my physics class invited the class to see her band play at a bar downtown.	That sounds fun.  What did you end up doing?"
"I actually went last Friday night. Turns out she is an incredible guitarist - a real shredder!	That's great! Did you play guitar?"
"I am pretty sure everyone is scared of being trapped in an elevator, and I can confirm it's quite a shock.	That's an interesting point.  I have never thought about it.  I'm not sure if I'm scared of it or just not aware of it."
"Yes just a couple weeks ago. The elevator screeched to a halt and the lights went out, and I have to confess I screamed.	Oh no! That must have been so scary!"
"I thank God every day for the many blessings. Especially our new home	You are so lucky. What is your new home?"
"5 months ago now. It's really nice here, there are 3 swimming pools	That's great! You must be happy."
"Right after I had my baby, my husband worked second shift, so he didn't get home until around 2am.	That is awful. I am sorry. Did you have a good night?"
"Yeah, but it wasn't really a problem, until one night around 11pm. I was changing her diaper. The changing table was in front of a window, and I could hear people running up and down the porch in front of the window and they were banging on the house.	Oh my gosh that sounds scary. What did you do?"
"I'm not sure. Doors and windows were locked, but I was so relieved when my husband got home.	I'm a youth leader, and just the other day a teen from the group was asked to speak at a local church.	That is so cool. I think it would be very exciting to be asked to speak at a church."
"He was nervous, he has to prepare an original message. He did really good, and he really showed and understanding of the bible.	That's awesome! I bet he was nervous. Did he have to prepare it for a special occasion?"
"Thank you.	I get so mad when I have to repeat myself	I know what you mean. I'm a bit of a repeat offender myself."
"I know. But it makes me stressed out	I know what you mean."
"Hello ... today I am happy, we go with my children to the movies and then to eat pizza	That sounds like a great time! I love pizza."
"The incredible ... they love ... it's going to be fun	What's going to be fun?"
"Thank you very much and you too..	Graduating from college was a load off my shoulders.	I can imagine! I graduated a few years ago."
"Thanks, it was a long journey.	That's good. Is it where you're moving to?"
"I was turned down for a job I really thought I'd be a good fit at.	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"Someone else interviewed who had much more experience than I did.	I'm sorry, you're probably right, but it's frustrating when you feel like you'd be a good fit."
"I went to a sketchy part of town once. Just being there put me on edge.	I know what you mean. It's like a dark cloud just hanging over the whole place."
"It was for work so I had to do it, but I typically avoid those places as well	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have to go there for work?"
"We went to a friend's house the other day for dinner. I was helping her cook. I was following the directions of a recipe and accidentally cracked her baking dish.	I'm sorry to hear that! How did it turn out?"
"Yes, I did, but she wouldn't even hear of it. She told me it was fine.	Oh no, what happened?"
"I am looking forward to moving into a easy place to take care of.	Did you move recently?"
"No, not moving soon, only wanting to and looking around to see what is affordable.	I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope things work out for you."
"So I had an emergency come up for my family and I had enough money to cover it. I feel great for preparing!	That's awesome! I hope you get to enjoy your money!"
"Definitely! And they are paying me back, so it isn't like I'm losing money either.	I'm glad you're getting paid back."
"I drank a lot of alcohol at my friend's BBQ party, and I ended up puking and passing out. Not my finest moment.	I'm sorry.  What happened?"
"Hahahaha! Well, I guess we can make light of even our worst moments.	I know what you mean.  I did that with my ex.  I just think about the good times we had and how good she was for me."
"My eldest son just graduated High School I was so proud.	What did he major in?"
"It's kind of a surreal feeling tho, hard to accept that he is grown.  Now college is about to start.	I know what you mean, I have a big baby in college."
"The time just flys by doesn't it?  It hard to imagine that they dont need you so much anymore.	So a customer just came into my work and started yelling at me for something that wasn't my fault. I hate when people do that!	What was the thing you did?"
"No, I didn't yell back haha. I would get fired.	That is true. What did you yell back?"
"Retail, yep.	It makes me angry when people never notice me	What do you mean?"
"Everything. I don't have friends so it's nice to get noticed	I understand. I wish I had friends like that."
"I get excited when I go swimming	How much are you looking forward to it?"
"The fact of relaxing in a large pool of water. It just grabs my attention	That's pretty cool.  I've never been in a pool before."
"My wife wasn't feeling so well, so I took care of her and made her some soup <3	Oh that is so sweet of you.  What's wrong with her?"
"She is much better now! I love her so much, so I try to take good care of her.	You're very nice!  What kind of care?"
"I am so grateful to my family	I am too! How did you get there?"
"They help me with whatever I need and they are always their for me.	That's nice. I wish I had more people like that in my life."
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a party	Did they do it for a special occasion?"
"It really was. I am pretty thankful for them	I am happy for you. What are they?"
"A big wind storm blew through town and uprooted one of the trees in my yard.	That's bad. Did you have to get the tree cut down?"
"No, but that was my fear. I kept waiting to hear the sound of a branch or tree hitting my roof, or breaking glass.	That sounds so scary. Did you feel safe at all?"
"I took my dog to an agility competition and she ended up winning first place!	Oh wow, that is amazing! What kind of dog is she?"
"Thanks so much! It did, but she's so hard-working and I couldn't have done it without her.	I am glad you are thankful to her."
"I was sad when my parents left me	Oh no, why?"
"I stay with my older sister now	That is nice. How old is she?"
"My brother got a really high-paying job and now spends all his time flaunting his money.	That must be really frustrating."
"Not very well! I mostly just stew and complain about it and wish I had his money and lifestyle.	That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that."
"I was disgusted when my food had a hair in it	I hate when that happens"
"Yeah I got a refund. They were very sorry about it and I forgave them	That's good. Did you have to wait long to get your money back?"
"I was anxious when I went to the theme park	What happened?"
"The roller coasters	I love roller coasters! They are so much fun!"
"I was furious when my friend made fun of me in front of random strangers.	That's horrible. What did they say to you?"
"I am not sure. He told me he was sorry afterwards but I didn't listen to him	I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you give him another chance?"
"I feel so lonely because I have no friends	I understand.  Do you have a job?"
"I haven't. Im too shy and I am scared of what people will say	How long have you been waiting?"
"I was jealous when my girlfriend was talking to other guys	Oh no.  Why did you feel jealous?"
"I do not. I have trust issues	I understand. It's okay."
"I was terrified when I watched that horror film in the theaters	What was the movie?"
"I did but it was really a challenge for me.	I know, what was the challenge?"
"I was sad when my dad died	Why was he dying?"
"It happened 3 weeks ago	What happened?"
"I was sad when my wife left me	I'm sorry. Why did she leave?"
"I just dont know why she would marry me then.	why do you think she would?"
"My family and I went to the beach on Tues and spent the whole day there.	Oh, how fun! What did you do?"
"One small thunderstorm but other than that great! I'm amazed I didn't really get burnt!	That is a good thing, I don't like thunderstorms."
"When someone talks down to me, it makes me sad	Oh that sucks. What did they say to you?"
"I am just too shy to say anything. I dont know how	What do you mean?"
"I am super joyful when my family comes together to eat dinner	That's great! I love when that happens too!"
"Usually once a week. Its a great feeling	I know right?  That must be a nice thing to do."
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a big party	What did you do?"
"It was. I had a great time	Oh, I'm glad you had a good time!"
"I am so annoyed that people are so mean to other people	Why are you mean?"
"That is so true! I dont know where this world is heading.	That's a good point.  I am a little uneasy about it."
"I get so jealous when my parents don't pay me any attention.	I understand how you feel. My parents are always on my case."
"I haven't because I don't know how to start that conversation.	You can start by saying something like ""I've been thinking about how nice it is to meet new people and I'm looking to make new friends."""
"I was furious when my dog ate the wires to my Television	oh no! did you get it replaced?"
"Yeah but it will take a few days because I have to wait for my paycheck	Well, don't worry about it. You'll get paid soon."
"So what happens in the middle of the night? I got woken, again, by my upstairs neighbor thumping around. Does she have to be so rude?!	I understand your frustration. I think she's just trying to get out of the house."
"No, they don't. Well, this time I've had enough. I've told management I want into another apartment and explained exactly why!	Oh wow. What is the reason?"
"Not really, but the alternative is to go slowly mad. These blessed individuals stomp around day and night, screeching into their cellphones - they're horrible.	I am a very trusting person. It gets me in trouble sometimes.	How so?"
"People take advantage of me	I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you feeling overwhelmed?"
"I'm only 6 months away from having my AA in Healthcare Administration.	That is awesome!  What is your dream job?"
"I really am, I can't wait to start my new career!	I'm happy for you.  What kind of job?"
"Going to the dentist always has me on edge. I hate it!	I know what you mean, I'm a dentist.  It's always the same for me!"
"I know...it's a necessary evil. But it hurts so much!	I know what you mean. I have been through that."
"One of my very dear friends got his dream job recently. He was so diligent in finding information and contacts. I so respect what he's achieved.	I am glad to hear that. What was his dream job?"
"Well, it takes perseverance and a bit of luck, but you can do it!	I think it's the luck that matters."
"Lol, you and me both. You could always marry a Kardashian!	I think I would be a good match for Kanye."
"Or someone not quite so objectionable :) Seriously though, I'm so happy for K with his new job.	We started watching a Red Sox game near the end and they were losing. Next thing you know, they were ahead four runs.	Oh wow. That's crazy!"
"Yes, usually I think so too. But this was really fun to watch and we were so happy because it did not look good at first.	That's great. Did you have to do anything to get it right?"
"My car that I hate is going to die soon and I'll be able to get a new one. Score!	Oh, really? That's a good score! I'm sure you can afford it."
"I'm thinking something reliable. Maybe a toyota or mazda.	I love those cars."
"Yesterday my husband opened a window and a HUGE black bug flew in!! I almost died!!	I would have been so scared and angry! Did you call a pest control?"
"heck no, i told my husband to deal with it. i ran in my bedroom and locked the door	Oh no, what happened?"
"Well, don't you know, one of my neighbors who works for AA was in San Francisco recently and saw some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). So she bought some and brought it to me. How nice of her to do that!	Oh wow, that's so nice of her!  I love the Scottish cheese, I've never tried it but I want to.  Did you like it?"
"This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.	I love the cheddar cheese from the store! I can't find it anywhere."
"Ooh, I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?	I think it is from New York. I'm not sure."
"I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me. I'm in NC, where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!	That sounds like a nice place to live.  I hope you find one."
"my brother would've turned 34 today. he died 2 years ago and It still hurts so much	That's really sad. Do you ever think about him?"
"yes we were. He moved to the different country but we spoke pretty often	That's really cool."
"I had planned to go to the beach with friends, but it looks like it's going to rain.	Oh no, are you going to have to cancel?"
"Nah, it said there's be thunder and lightning, so looks like we're stuck inside :(	That's terrible! Why are you stuck inside?"
"I spent last weekend with most of my family, they live out of state and i don't see them often.	That sounds like a nice time! Did you get to do anything you wanted?"
"I did, Yes. Work has been hectic lately so i was really looking forward to unwinding with them.	What did you do to unwind?"
"We ate good food, drank wine and went swimming.	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"It was, kind of hot but not enough to complain about.	Oh? That's nice. I hate when it gets too hot outside."
"I hate how our country is so divided right now	I agree. I think we need to come together more."
"True. I hope we can become less divided in the future and solve things	I agree.  We've got a lot to work out."
"My father passed away about 2 years ago. It was so very difficult for me and very unexpected. We didn't know he had a life-threatening illness and weren't prepared in any way for his sudden departure from us.	I am so sorry to hear that. What did you do to honor him?"
"Yes, my family and I are close and we were there for each other. But, my sister had passed away around 6 years before, by committed suicide. The last few years have been very difficult.	That's terrible. I'm so sorry."
"I feel like a terrible sibling right now.	What did you do?"
"My sister, who lives out of state and i don't see often, was recently in town visiting our dad. I didn't visit with them.	That's nice, I bet you were happy to see her."
"I am going to a concert very soon.	Are you excited about it?"
"Imagine Dragon and Grace Vanderwhall, do you know them?	I do, they are pretty talented."
"Yes she was.	Our new property management person is remarkably efficient. She emailed me details of a conversation we had yesterday. The others promise the earth and don't deliver!	Oh, that's good! I hope they do deliver."
"It is. I've been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it.	That's very frustrating, I hope you get your new apartment soon!"
"Absolutely! I move September 1st. No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!	School for my kids started again this past Thursday.	Oh, I'm sorry. What are they in?"
"It was good. I am dealing with a mixture of both emotions about them being back in school. I was happy I had all the supplies, clothes, shoes, and other odds and ends in time.	Why did they go back to school?"
"I had planned a beach trip about a month before we actually went.	That was smart. What happened?"
"We went to Virginia Beach earlier this week. I was so giddy up that whole month I could barely contain myself.	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"My husband, 2 kids and my mother. My kids had never been to the beach.	That's awesome. They should be very happy."
"I bought a ticket last week for the lottery, when it was over 100 million dollars.	That's crazy! I bet you were so happy!"
"I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn, but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.	Oh well, maybe you should try to get a lottery ticket next time."
"True, but it would be fun spending that money.	My husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! This was unexpected and great news	That is great news.  How much is the bonus?"
"It sure does. It came as a shock, but a pleasant one.	Oh wow, did it happen recently?"
"I just went today to visit my son in his new house.	Oh wow! How did he like his new house?"
"It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it.	Well that is really nice of him."
"So tonight we are suppose to go eat out as a family but I cant get a single one of my family members to agree on a place.  So frustrating!	That is terrible, I hate it when that happens.  You might have to go to a different place."
"That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.	I like that idea. I can imagine how difficult it would be to have everyone having the same thing."
"Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.	Oh no, that sounds terrible. What are they doing that you want to sue them about?"
"I guess that way the wallet wins every once and awhile too!  lol	I'm so happy that it is Friday!	I'm glad, how can you be?"
"Somewhat, I work 4 10 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. Yesterday was my off day. What about you?	I do that too. I really enjoy it because it gives me time to relax."
"feels disappointed because my friend fights with me	Why does he fight with you?"
"no i can't because i love him a lot	Oh no!  Why can't you?"
"I have Lupus and it is getting worse.  I asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet I found that is suppose to help me with it.	How has your diet been going?"
"yes, but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun	I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can get off the b."
"Some time ago, there was a terrible tornado that came through my city. It destroyed many homes, a school and some people died. I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it, or harm my familY!	Oh no, that must have been so scary.  Did you have to go to a shelter?"
"No, they are so awful! They can destroy so much.	I'm sorry, they are so awful."
"My husband took me to get a new wedding band recently	Oh that's so sweet of him!"
"I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.	Did you like the new one?"
"I love the holidays. Driving around looking at decoration is my favorite.	I love decorating! I enjoy it a lot."
"Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.	That is a shame."
"I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her	What's her name?"
"I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.	That's great!  I'm glad you have that.  What are you guys doing together?"
"A few weeks ago, we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But, it rained several days, so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted, which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.	I hate when the weather is bad, especially when it rains."
"Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So, a long time since we first went.	Oh, that's so sad. How old is she now?"
"My husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting	What did he get?"
"I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.	Aww that's so cool!  What did he do?"
"We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man, so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.	I am sure he will take good care of them."
"We didn't have much choice, as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat, so if we didn't, we'd come back to not having pets. But, I wouldn't just let anybody, that's for sure!	That's a good point."
"My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell	I'm sure she didn't. I would be shocked if she didn't."
"I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things	That's terrible. What did you do?"
"One night when my children and I came home, I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!	Oh my goodness. What was it?"
"It was so scary! Luckily, it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up, but it first appeared to be an intruder!	Did you see it moving?"
"Last weekend, my family and I enjoyed a nice meal together, and then watched a movie. It was a relaxing time at home, just enjoying each other's company.	That sounds wonderful! I love that type of time. What movie did you watch?"
"Yes, it was drama free and a relaxing time.	I love relaxing times."
"My dog, riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he was comfortable."
"It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps	I'm sorry to hear that. How did he die?"
"I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me. She was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support, and that's why I didn't tell her. But, I still felt so bad about it.	That's a pretty good friend you are. I would have felt the same way."
"Well, she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job, plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.	That sounds pretty tough. Did she end up getting a job?"
"I am trying a new diet to treat my Lupus.	That sounds like a challenging one. I am sure you are doing all you can."
"I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take	Oh no! Are you taking them for something else?"
"There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments, so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating, since it causes others more work.	I am so sorry to hear that.  Are you in the same department as her?"
"Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over, but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!	I'm sorry."
"My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning, and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.	oh that is so sad, i'm sorry to hear that, how old was the cat?"
"Yes, she was only about 9, and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!	Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that!"
"I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.	That's awesome! Did you buy a ticket?"
"Not normally, so I was quite surprised.	How did that happen?"
"$1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.	That is great to hear! It sounds like you have a good financial situation."
"Thank you, that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out.	I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day.	Oh no! What happened?"
"Someone backed into my new car.	That's terrible. I hope you weren't hurt."
"Yes, they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it.	Many years ago, we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her, but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you tell her she was drunk?"
"Well, she was attractive and at the time, I thought he was thinking that too. But, I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, since she was falling down. But, it was hard to see it at that time lol	That is a good thing he was trying to help her. You are lucky to have such a kind person in your life."
"I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.	Did you find anything in the mail?"
"Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night.	That's awful! Did you call the police?"
"Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.	Oh no, do you have a job in town?"
"That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.	I like that. We do have a camera, but it's a point-and-shoot. I'd like to use it more often."
"My aunt came to visit today, we went out for mexican food!	Oh that sounds good, what was the food like?"
"Yes, kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours, she is on a road trip!	That's nice. I bet she enjoyed it."
"I have a big exam for college coming up, I have been studying day and night.	What is the exam on?"
"It is for my molecular biology class, I feel pretty good that I am going to Ace it.	That's great! You must be very confident."
"I went and saw a hockey game today, It was really exciting.	I love hockey.  Did you watch a specific team?"
"No, I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool.	That's too bad."
"I was on a run today, and saw a loose dog but couldn't catch it before it ran off!	Oh no, that is scary!"
"Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!	Oh my goodness! I am so sorry. Was he okay?"
"I got some bad news today, my dad passed away.	That is terrible. I am so sorry to hear that."
"Thank you, I am a mess. It is still hasn't hit me that he passed away.	I am sorry to hear that."
"Its so quiet in my house, my husband is out of town for work.	What do you do when you hear the creaks?"
"True, I'm trying but keep hearing creepy noises. Guess I need to turn the TV up louder haha	Oh, sounds like you have some spooky noises in the house."
"I got some great news today! My husband got a better paying job offer!	That is so exciting! I bet you were happy for him!"
"Not sure yet, but itll help us life more comforatbly! We move to his hometown in November when he gets out of Army!	That's exciting.  What is his hometown?"
"My daughter is in highschool but took a college course this summer and got an A!	That is awesome! I am so proud of you!"
"That is very good. You should be proud of her.	I ate way too many sweets today!	How many did you eat?"
"Thanks! Being on a diet is hard, espically with family in town!	I can imagine, but you are getting stronger every day."
"I was running today and felt like this car was following me..	That's a little creepy, what kind of car is it?"
"Yes it was, I think I need to start carrying pepper spray or something	I am glad you are safe."
"Im watching the show The Bold Type, my favourtie characters dad died :(	I've heard that show is good!  What's his name?"
"Yes, it's a great girly drama! Reminds me of Sex in the City but Modern.	I haven't seen that show!"
"It's been a great night! I'm just relaxing with a cold drink and my favourite show!	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"Yes defenitly, It dosen't get better then this! My daughter has been fast asleep since 8pm.	That's great. You must be exhausted."
"My family is moving from Texas to Arkansas in a few months, Im worried for the change.	Oh no, how long have you lived in Texas?"
"My husband is getting out of the Army and moving back to his hometown where he has a few job offers! Big changes coming..	That's great. You must be excited. I bet you are."
"I recently moved into a new home.	Did you like it?"
"Yes, there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with.	Oh, that's great. Do you have a lot of kids?"
"We had been saving for 4 years to buy a bigger house. We had outgrown our other home.	I had a doctors appointment today.	Did you have to go to the doctor?"
"I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back.	That's so annoying!  I'm sorry you had to wait so long.  Did they keep you waiting too long?"
"I agree! Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever.	I had just moved in to my new apartment, and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door.	Oh, that's so cute! I love cat food."
"At first I tried to resist, but I ended up adopting him!	Oh my, I'm so happy for you!"
"I received a wrong number call last night at 2 in the morning.	Oh no, that's scary! Did you answer?"
"Yes! It was so aggravating. They would not believe me when I kept telling them it was the wrong number.	I would be too!"
"She did twice before she finally believe me that there was no Bret there.	I recently found out that I am having baby number 4.	Did you have an abortion?"
"Wow! That is great. We were thrilled because we didn't know if we were going to have anymore and nature just decided for us.	That's really cool. How did it happen?"
"Yes they are. They make life worth living.	Halloween is quite a big holiday where I live. People get really in to their costumes!	I love dressing up for Halloween! It's such a fun time of year."
"It's peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining. Last year I went as a plague doctor, and everyone agreed it was terrifying!	I love that!  What did you wear?"
"Last year we lost our home of 20 years to a house fire.	That's terrible! I'm so sorry to hear that."
"Yes, thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened.	I hope that was not a fire."
"No, we just bought another house closer to town. It was sad losing everything that we had.	When me and my friend got lost in the desert, I thought we were done for.	That's terrible. I bet you are glad you made it out alive."
"Only a couple of hours. We flagged down an old Chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out.	How did you get sorted out?"
"I went tonight to meet my daughters teacher.	That sounds fun. Did she like it?"
"Yes, I think she will be a great teacher. She showed us her plan for the year and I think it was great.	That's great! What is her subject?"
"Thanks so much. I completely agree.	I just finished watching the Saw movie.	Oh yea? I haven't seen that one. What did you think of it?"
"I hated it! I didn't want to watch it but my husband did. The gore is just too much!	That's not good. How long did you have to watch?"
"Yep! I feel kind of sick to my stomach now from watching it.	I recently went down memory lane was looked at all my high school yearbooks.	I love that! I am sure it was a fun time."
"Well.... maybe not as awesome. lol But I do try to keep in shape. It was good seeing all my old friends.	That is nice. I am not really into that sort of thing. I think I will stick to my video games."
"I do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch.	I understand, it can be tough when people move away from you."
"That's a good idea!	I love that idea!"
"I had this guy flag me down today after leaving the store.	That's great. What did he say?"
"I was scared at first and then he hollered and pointed to the top of my car and I had left my purse on it. Boy, did my face get red.	Oh no, what did you do?"
"My daughter just bought her first car on her own.	Oh wow, that's so cool! I bet she is so proud."
"It's a 2008 Mustang. She worked the last two summers to buy it.	That's a pretty sweet car. How long have you had her?"
"She is super excited to start school now and show it off.	I'm leaving tomorrow to go on vacation!	Oh wow, where are you going?"
"We are going to Daytona and Orlando for 10 days.	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I sure hope so! We've been planning this trip for a year.	That's great! What are you going to do?"
"My husband and I have a fun weekend trip planned soon. We are going to go to the casino for the weekend, just the two of us. We are really looking forward to it.	That sounds fun! I bet you will have a great time."
"Yes, it's been awhile since we had just some time for us. Plus, we love Blackjack!	That's great. How long have you been playing?"
"I have a very good friend and her live-in boyfriend of 5 years hit on me! I'm married, and he didn't care. He sickens me!	That is so awful. I would be very upset with them."
"Yes, I was really surprised and I find it terrible behavior.	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"We went on a vacation a few weeks ago, and it really made me think back to our last vacation. It was with my father, the last one before he passed away.	That is sad. I am sorry to hear that. I hope you had a good time."
"I did, but of course, wished I had more time. He passed away unexpectedly, so I was going over that vacation in my mind too. I miss him.	I am sorry to hear that."
"I was pleasantly shocked the other day when I won on a lottery ticket! I hardly ever win and I won $200!	That is awesome, are you going to buy a house?"
"I just tucked it back for a rainy day. But, I may splurge with it this weekend, since it was unexpected.	Oh that is interesting. I hope you enjoy it."
"My husband sure did surprise me with his handiness and hard work around the house last week. He was able to accomplish so much work in a few days!	That's awesome!  I bet you were proud of him.  I don't have a husband, but I do love to hear about other people's husbands!"
"Ok	I was the first person to receive a pretigious award at my college after years of the award being on offer.	That is a great accomplishment!  Did you win a million dollars?"
"At the department office back at the school.	Oh, what happened?"
"One of my coworkers really ticked me off one day. She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!	Oh no, I hope you were able to handle it well."
"Yes, she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her, and it was her work! I let her know it too.	That's very mature of you."
"One year my cousin wasn't going to get her young son anything for Christmas. It broke my heart so my husband and I bought his Santa gifts that year.	I would have been so upset!"
"The little guy deserved a Christmas and we really loved him.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, do you have any other kids?"
"When I went to the fair last year, I tripped on a large cord they had going across the walkway. It was a long, running fall! I wanted to hide!	That is really scary, I hope you were okay!"
"Scuffed knees, but mainly my pride. I was also in front an attractive guy I knew so it was even worse.	That is so bad.  I hate when I get scuffed up like that."
"My husband and I are at a point in our lives, we are able to save, afford all that we need and save for retirement. I'm so appreciate we can, as I know many aren't able to do that.	I'm glad to hear that. What kind of savings do you have?"
"Yes, we have been working hard, as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times. But, it's worth having some financial freedom!	That's great. I'm glad you're working hard."
"One day at work while I was pregnant, I fell! Luckily, the baby and I weren't hurt, but I wanted to waddle away so fast!	Oh my gosh, that sounds scary!  I'm so glad you were okay!"
"Yes, it really was quite so!	What happened?"
"There are times I feel a bit alone and down. My husband has to travel out of town for work quite often.	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a close friend or family member that you can talk to about your feelings?"
"Well, yes, of course. But, that isn't quite the same, is it.	What are you talking about?"
"My children recently started school again and it made me feel a bit apprehensive. They are growing up so quick, and I know it won't be long before they sadly move out of the house :(	I know it's hard, but it's a good thing. They will be happy and healthy."
"For sure! But, it flies by before you know it. I get my nerves on edge when I think about them all moved out of the house.	I understand. I have a similar situation with my sister."
"Despite working until a few hours before, I scored highly on the ACT the first time I took it back in high school years ago.	I'm glad you scored well, what subject did you score high in?"
"Thanks. I thought I'd do poorly because I was tired.	Why were you tired?"
"Not that long ago, my husband planned a secret trip for us! I didn't have a clue he was doing it and was pleasantly shocked. It was so much fun!	That's great. How long was it?"
"We just took a weekend trip to Tunica, MS. We stayed at a really nice casino hotel and just played some Blackjack, enjoyed good food and each other's company!	I love the Mississippi coast.  Is that your first time there?"
"I lied to my mother one day about where I was going. It made me feel pretty bad and have a bad conscience.	I'm sorry to hear that, but sometimes it's necessary to lie to protect yourself."
"She didn't want me going with that friend, but I wanted to go, so I lied to her. I was much younger then.	What did she say?"
"I won a free trip to Florida. It's not the best vacation, but I'll take it for free.	That's awesome!  What did you do?"
"I've been to Florida many times before so it wears on you.	I've been to Florida only once. It's a beautiful place, but I know it's always the same for people."
"I won a lottery for a small amount of money.	Oh wow, that's awesome!"
"No, I wish. It was only a few hundred dollars.	That's a lot of money."
"A good friend of mine moved away recently and we lost contact. I really wish we would still speak.	I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you can reconnect with your friend."
"That's a good idea. Maybe I'll try that soon.	It's never too late to start something new, I think."
"Someone was speeding on the road and I got into an accident with them. My car was totalled because of their carelessness.	Wow that's terrible.  I hope you are okay!"
"Yes, but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn't an enjoyable situation.	That is too bad.  I bet it was a tough situation to get out of."
"I let a friend watch my dog for a week while I was out of town. I would've been devastated if anything happened to him.	That's good that you were able to let them watch him."
"I hope so. I've only had my dog for a short time and this is my first time away from him.	That's very nice of you. How old is your dog?"
"I have been feeling great about life recently. My relationships have been going very well	I'm glad to hear that! Life is full of ups and downs, but it sounds like you're having a good time."
"I am not, but I have a person I am very fond of. Are you?	That is very nice. What is your name?"
"I got a surprise gift in the mail yesterday.	That's awesome! What kind of gift?"
"A gorgeous vase. It's so pretty. I have no idea who sent it.	That's great! Who did it?"
"Yes, I love flowers. I can't wait to fill it up.	My sister broke my vase. I was pretty enraged!	I am sorry, that is horrible!  I hope you were able to fix it."
"I scolded her but then told her it was okay, but it's not the biggest deal!	I think you mean you scolded her and then told her it was okay."
"I'm am upset today because my daughter who lives really far away called and said her baby was admitted to the hospital.	That is so sad! What happened?"
"He was premature so he's been having some breathing issues. I hate not being there.	Nice, you must miss him"
"I'm so taken by the talents of contestants on the show Face Off -- have you ever seen it?	I have. I love it. It's so entertaining."
"Their abilities to both imagine and create their characters is incredible!	That's really interesting! I have never seen anything like it before."
"A lot people know Toys-R-Us has completely shut down not long ago.	I am so sad to hear that.  Did they really close down?"
"Yeah, a lot of my friends and I got to thinking of all our memories there. Really makes you think back.	I know what you mean.  It's funny how things can bring up such good memories."
"I feel so bad, I forgot my sisters birthday...	I am sorry to hear that.  Are you going to make it up to her?"
"Yes I plan on it, its just been stressful time at home with a toddler, it slipped my mind	Oh no, that is so stressful!  I have a toddler as well.  I hope you get it all taken care of soon.  It is hard when you have to do everything yourself."
"I love my husband so much I could never cheat on him.	I'm glad you have a healthy relationship."
"Yea, I wouldnt want to hurt him, i cant understand anyone who does.	I don't think anyone should ever hurt another person."
"It can be really tough when your husband and teenagers have electronics.	I know, I feel like they are so much more connected to their phones than us."
"I do for family time but sometimes I can sit in a full room and still feel no one is there	What do you do for fun?"
"Tomorrow is my husbands Birthday!	What is your husband's name?"
"Yes, we are going out for a nice dinner. We haven't been on a date in months!	That's great. What kind of restaurant do you think you will go to?"
"I love the holidays, that make think back to being a kid.	I know, I love Christmas. It's so magical."
"Yea, that would really be great. Or maybe we'd get bored.	That would be great.  I'm looking forward to hearing more about it."
"There is a big storm going on in my town right now!	That's terrible! Is it going to be bad?"
"I don't, it makes me nervous with the strong winds and rain!	That is a bad one. I don't like it when it is raining and it is so heavy."
"My favorite game has an expansion on Monday, I can't wait.	That sounds exciting! I've been wanting to play that game."
"World of Warcraft, It's been my favorite for years.	That's so cool. I've never played it. How long have you played?"
"I just got a promotion at my job!	Oh congratulations! What a wonderful thing to happen!"
"I work in Human Resources for a big company, I wasn't expecting the promotion! Feel Blessed :)	I bet.  Did you expect it?"
"I really like every shelf in my house to be arranged just so.	Oh wow, I have never done that before, but I love it. Is it for storage?"
"I do, everything is in it's place. It thoroughly bothers me when someone puts random stuff on them, like cups or papers.	That is a good point. I feel the same way."
"I just found out my husband is cheating on me..	That is awful. I am so sorry. I hope you can get through this."
"A few months, I'm not sure what my next move is. Staying in a hotel for a few days to think.	That's good, you can always go back home."
"My daughter is finally fully potty trained!	That is such an accomplishment! I bet you are so proud."
"Yes, I am very happy as well! No more buying diapers haha	That's good! Diapers can be expensive."
"So, my new puppy is adorable though maybe not as amazing yet as yours.	I'm sure she is! I love dogs!"
"She's so cute and fun, i love her already.	I love a girl that is fun. I'm a bit jealous of you."
"I started doing more research on salaries for the degree I'll have in 6 months.	I am sure you will get a good job"
"It seems to be about 60,000 per year just out of college. I am eager to see if the statistics are correct.	That is a lot of money.  I hope you do well.  I am jealous."
"I know it's silly, but my friend got something I wanted in a game the other day, bit sad.	That is sad, why did you want it?"
"I guess, little things at times right?	I know, but I just want to make sure I'm the best person I can be."
"I watched The Lion King today with my daughter, reminded me of my childhood.	I love the movie.  What did you like about it?"
"Yes! I'm excited for that as well. I watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!	That's awesome! What movie?"
"5	Oh no! What happened?"
"Opps. Ok, i mean that I was sad the other day because a friend is moving.	That's sad. I hope you will stay in touch with your friend."
"not to far, but it's still sad to see her go.	That's unfortunate.  Have you talked to her before she leaves?"
"I have been having a rough week!	What is going on?"
"Yes but I am afraid I might loose my job..	I hope that does not happen."
"I hate how our country is right now.	That is not good. What is wrong with the country?"
"People just can't seem to get along, makes me sad.	I know, it's hard to see people being so mean to each other."
"I spent all weekend alone, wish my family lived closer.	I am sorry. I know you miss them."
"My family is over 2,000 miles away in Alaska, its tough!	I am sorry to hear that. I know how hard it can be."
"My husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache	Did he get a dentist?"
"Not yet, but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.	Oh wow, that is very nice of you."
"Ah, it's been rough. My dog passed away two nights ago.	That's really sad. I'm sorry."
"Thank you, she was 12 years old so I knew it was coming but still shook up about it.	That's good.  I'm sure it was a good experience."
"I hate when it storms so bad the power goes out	I hate that too, I live in a storm-prone area and it's always a problem."
"I agree.	I agree, what is it?"
"I found a hundred dollar bill when cleaning my closet!	I would be super excited! How did you find it?"
"No! I'm not sure where it came from! and I live alone :O	I know what you mean. I have that feeling sometimes."
"There was a huge spider on my wall, it ran away before I could kill it..	I hope it was not too scary to see."
"Me too, I think it was a wolf spider. I hope I can sleep tonight	I hope you have a good night."
"I'm so nervous, have a final exam on Tuesday!	Oh no! I hope you do well."
"Yes, I have been studying a lot but still worried. I need to get a good grade!	I bet.  Are you studying for a test or exam?"
"I have to give a speech on Thursday.	That is exciting. I bet you are nervous about it."
"Yes. But mentally I am never ready to give a speech if im being honest.	i know what you mean. i have to be nervous before giving a speech."
"It's on local politics. Not a fun subject either!	I sold some stuff I didnt need last week.	Oh that's nice.  What did you sell?"
"Yea, enought to have great weekened anyway.	What happened?"
"I think that my husband and me have so much faith in each other.	Oh, that's great! Faith is very important in any relationship."
"I know, I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.	I agree, but it can be hard to say no, especially when you are in love."
"Ten years ago now, a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate. I didn't know if there would be anything to come back to.	Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that."
"Pretty messed up, but the house was still standing.	I'm sorry to hear that. How did that happen?"
"was travelling 14 hours internationally. First flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative	Oh no, I hate it when that happens."
"British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting, they could not	I don't understand why they can't just tell you the truth."
"I've felt excited when I found out I had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course, taught by someone who I knew could help me in ways that I would I not be able to through self-study alone.	That's awesome! I bet it will be a great experience for you."
"Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special!	I'm glad you had a good experience!"
"I think it was :)	I like going fishing, it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.	You must have some great memories of your dad.  Do you still go fishing with him?"
"I do, I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?	I have a 5 month old, but I am expecting a girl!"
"I dropped all my food in the cafeteria the other day. Everybody was staring at me.	Oh no! Did you get in trouble?"
"No, it was at work.	Oh, that's unfortunate. What happened?"
"I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it!	What a great story! I'm glad you learned from it."
"Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!	I would agree, it's a good thing to know the limits of your car's power."
"I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!	I love football! What school do you go to?"
"Auburn Tigers	I'm a big fan of the football team."
"I did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday.	Oh no! What did you do?"
"I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.	That was a mess! Did they clean it up?"
"I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.	Oh wow!  I am sure it was a very special day!"
"Oh yeah, definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!	Oh yeah, that's great!  What did he do?"
"I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!	That is a great story! It's so nice to see that people still have those kind of qualities."
"It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.	That is so cool, you must have a very good friend to have."
"I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.	That's awful! I'm sorry. How did you feel when you got up?"
"Yes, I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!	I'm sorry to hear that, are you able to go to work now?"
"My transmission in my car went out the other day, maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.	What kind of car do you have?"
"Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too, so my money is tied up.	That's a big step. I hope you find the right home."
"I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.	Oh no. That is terrible. Did you take a picture?"
"No, I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.	Oh no, that's terrible. What did they do?"
"Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!	That sounds like a lot of fun!  I love trekking!"
"I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary	That is awesome! I am glad you felt that way."
"Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech, and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!	That's amazing! Did you enjoy the show?"
"I'm sorry if I was unclear, I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).	I understand that, but I'm not sure I would want to listen to live music, it's so unpredictable."
"So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!	That is awesome! What is your name?"
"Yes, very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.	I think you may be right."
"So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!	That is terrible.  What did you do about it?"
"We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess	Oh that's terrible, I'm so sorry to hear that."
"I am starting a new phase in my life. Completed all debt and off to a new start	That's great! You must be happy to be free from debt!"
"yes very. but I know that it will be good.	What do you mean?"
"Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress	Oh good. What did you do?"
"I try to be. it can be difficult on some days, but I think I have a good attitude towards most things	I can relate. I have a very good attitude towards most things."
"I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.	That's great! What school are you going to be attending?"
"Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.	That is so right! You are very lucky to have that opportunity!"
"My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck	That is really cool.  I wish I could be that lucky."
"Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!	That's crazy. I've been in a lot of them."
"So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.	Oh no. How long did it take you to get it out?"
"No, but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.	Oh that is crazy! What kind of ball was it?"
"My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.	That's awesome! What kind of car is it?"
"No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!	That's so true, I really hope he understands too."
"I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!	That's great! You must be happy with your new car."
"I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.	I am glad you are happy.  I have a car and I don't want it to start."
"I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.	I love throwback music! What kind of music did you listen to?"
"It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado, 2pac, etc.	What kind of music do you like?"
"My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.	Well, I hope he does well."
"They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.	I hope they find the answers quickly."
"I am so excited - after a year of misery due to my loud, inconsiderate upstairs neighbors I'm finally moving into a new apartment!	That's great.  I'm sure you will be happy."
"I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!	That sounds amazing!  I love nature, I would love to have a place like that.  What's the name of the place?"
"Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)	I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!	oh no, were you mad?"
"It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.	What was it that you did?"
"We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone, especially my brother and sister.	That sounds fun.  Are you going to invite anyone else?"
"It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.	I'm so happy for you. I know it is hard to talk to everyone but it is worth it."
"I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.	Oh wow! What kind of record?"
"Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it, but consistency does seem to pay off.	I'm glad you're consistent!  You're going to do great!"
"I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.	That sounds like a great plan. What's on your agenda?"
"I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though, I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future	I hope you keep up with it. It can be hard to do it."
"My brother got a custom-made bowling ball, and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.	That is awesome. I bet he is proud of himself."
"He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.	That's really cool.  He's probably getting more experience than you are."
"Ok, so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!	That's not a good idea."
"Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)	I bet you felt pretty good about yourself"
"Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.	That's a tough situation.  Did you do anything to stop it?"
"Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.	I love classical music, but I am terrible at it."
"I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.	That sounds scary. What kind of noises?"
"No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.	Oh wow, that's crazy. Did you call the plumber?"
"I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!	That's great! Where are they living?"
"I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him	That's great!  I hope they are excited to meet him."
"I can't help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time.	I'm sure it was fun."
"I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.	That's sad. How did it happen?"
"The last time I went into a job interview, I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.	Wow, that's great. What job did you get?"
"Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.	I agree. But it's hard to get over it."
"Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!	That's spooky. What did you do?"
"I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!	Wow! I didn't expect that."
"It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my ""attacker"" off with!	I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself	Oh really? What kind of sweets did you eat?"
"I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese	I am sorry to hear that. You should go to the doctor and tell him that you feel like you are getting obese."
"My co-worker just bought a brand new car.	Wow, I bet you're jealous!"
"I know, me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.	That is a good car. Do you have a car like that?"
"i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i'm so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are	Oh, that's a good point. I have heard that you can be very nervous when selling items online."
"I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone	That's unfortunate.  I hope you have a great time while you are alone."
"I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!	That sounds wonderful!  I hope it's quiet and peaceful."
"Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!	That sounds so annoying! I hate it when my place is quiet, too."
"They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.	Someone stole my identity.	Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that."
"I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.	That is so infuriating. I hope you can get it back."
"i have food on my table, a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful	That's great! I'm glad you have those things."
"yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted	I know what you mean. Sometimes I think people take their friends for granted."
"so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets	Oh wow! I bet it was fun to do."
"thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies	I'm sure you will, your kindness is so admirable."
"I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!	I bet you were! I love Scotland!"
"Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.	That's so nice. It was a long time ago. I remember when my father had to use a phone book to look up someone's number."
"Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!	When I spend time with my family, it reminds me how lucky I really am.	That's great!  I love spending time with my family as well."
"Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.	I know right? Sometimes it's hard to see that when things are bad. But it's true."
"My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much	Oh my goodness! I'm so happy for you! I have a dog too, but I lost her last year. I know how much you love your dog, so I'm sure you're very happy!"
"She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?	I have a cat. I have a dog too."
"School starts a week from tomorrow and I am getting fairly nervous for it!	That's a great time to be nervous. I'm sure you'll do great."
"Oh yes, I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?	i love summer too but i hate school"
"I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it	I know that feeling.  I hate it when people judge others.  It makes you feel so bad."
"yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad	That's a good thing, it's a good feeling."
"I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.	I bet you will.  You're so organized.  What are you studying?"
"I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.	I hope you do well!"
"My brother just turned 16 and he's about to get his first car! I'm so excited for him.	That's really cool!  What kind of car?"
"Probably some kind of SUV, maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!	That sounds like a nice car!"
"I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!	What kind of car are you looking for?"
"I want an SUV, like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!	Oh yeah, they are."
"Recently my husband and I were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off	Oh no! Were you okay?"
"I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary	That is the worst!  I am so sorry that happened to you.  What happened?"
"My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.	Oh, I'm so sorry.  I know how that feels.  What did you do to celebrate?"
"She will be 30. It makes me feel so old, but also how fun it was when they were little.	That's true, I've been there too."
"I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I	I'm glad you feel better."
"Sorry, I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!	Oh yeah! That's always a good feeling."
"I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.	That's really nice.  I love shopping for food.  I enjoy it."
"Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!	That sounds delicious!  I'm a big fan of Asian food."
"They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.	What is the name of the plant?"
"What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!	I love when stores do that!  It's such a treat to try new things and be able to see the freshness of the food."
"I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!	Oh no!  What happened?"
"Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!	Oh no, I hope you are okay!"
"My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.	That's cool. I bet he's a great guy though."
"Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.	Oh yeah? I bet you are right."
"When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.	I have never heard of him. What is he?"
"It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!	I agree. It is a shame."
"Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.	I agree. It is a big problem."
"There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.	I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away	That's sad, but it's good that you have the opportunity to see her now."
"Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!	That is awesome! I love visiting places that remind me of the past."
"I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!	That's a good story.  I think it's a pretty good story.  I bet you felt pretty good about yourself for that."
"Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!	I bet. I bet it was fun"
"I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.	That's a bit of a shock.  I always thought it was the same teacher."
"That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.	That's a good point. I remember when I was in middle school, and I was still in high school."
"That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.	When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.	I bet you were so relieved to have that done.  I never thought about it but I should have done that."
"It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!	I am ready to start my new job."
"I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.	i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please	that's awesome! what words did he learn?"
"he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian	That's amazing! I would love to learn one of those."
"A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.	That's really unfortunate. I can't imagine what it must be like. I hope everything is okay now."
"Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.	I can only imagine what will happen."
"No, moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband, but we split up.	I found a cat in my attic yesterday!	Oh no. Did you find a cat?"
"My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!	I think it's a cat and not a dog."
"My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.	That's really cool. What did she do to keep herself busy?"
"Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!	That's great.  How old is she?"
"She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!	I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!	I am a big fan of TV.  I am glad you enjoy it."
"I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!	I love HGTV!  They have so many fun shows.  They are always so funny!"
"My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident, I'm so upset.	That's awful. What happened?"
"Yes, we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.	That is so terrible! What was the animal?"
"I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.	I would be devastated.  What happened?"
"Yes, I heard about it. Such a sad story.	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..	Oh no! Was it a surprise?"
"I did! It was a very nice gesture.	Did you get something?"
"We are waiting on military orders right now, I'm so hoping they come through next week.	That is exciting. What are they for?"
"Yes, we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.	That's a little off from what I understand. What are you referring to?"
"I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.	What kind of animals?"
"Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.	I agree, there are people who are mean and hurt others."
"For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.	I'm sure those are great memories for you. Do you still enjoy those times?"
"It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!	I agree, I think it's nice to remember the past."
"It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in!	Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.	I know, I mean, I'm happy for them, but it seems like they are spending a lot of money."
"Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries.	I can imagine.  That is not a good habit to have.  Is it a habit you are trying to break?"
"We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.	Wow, that's exciting! Where are you moving to?"
"Texas, there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change.	I love Texas!"
"Awesome, my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.	I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.	Oh no! I hope you were prepared for it. Did you get a safe place?"
"So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.	That's great.  I'm glad to hear that.  How did it go?"
"My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her, one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!	That's great! How old are they?"
"Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!	That's great to hear! I am so glad you have such a wonderful family!"
"Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.	My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards	That's terrible. Is it going to be okay this time?"
"She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess	Oh no!  I hope she is okay.  Do you have any kids?"
"Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us	I am so sorry to hear that."
"Yes, it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult, so it was really hard when she passed.	That's sad to hear. I hope you found the time to reconnect with her."
"We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.	That is a good thing to have, in case of emergency."
"I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.	That is good to hear.  How was your vacation?"
"I've been so busy packing, packing and more packing.	Oh, are you going on vacation?"
"Yes, don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.	Oh I understand, I hate being rushed too"
"I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.	That's nice, I'm glad you're happy with your relationship."
"I do feel very lucky, especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.	That is a great feeling."
"I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.	That's awesome! What kind of music do you usually listen to?"
"Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back	What did you do?"
"I took a test for college the other day, it was basically our midterm.	Wow, did you pass?"
"I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.	What are you waiting on?"
"Discrete mathematics	I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago. I know a guy who was playing in it. Guess what? He won! Fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!	That is so awesome! I hope you get to attend next year!"
"He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to, lol!	i hope he does well"
"You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!	That's great! What country is he from?"
"Thank you - he'd appreciate it. It makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved.	I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.	That sounds like a lot of fun.  Are you a professional skydiver or are you just a beginner?"
"There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.	I am in the south.  I've never done it.  I am afraid of heights."
"There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!	Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life	I'm sorry that's not something you can control."
"Exactly!  I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is ""Always be prepared""	I love that. I was a scout too."
"You know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? That happened to me recently - the owners rented it out the night before I was to see it :(	Oh no! I hate that when that happens. Are you planning on buying it?"
"Yes, but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!	That is a bummer, how long have you been looking for a place like that?"
"I'm sure I will so long as I have good neighbors. I'm over the first place now, but it wasn't pleasant to be pipped at the post!	my horse died last week i was devastated when i found out	I am sorry to hear that.  Was it a good horse?"
"yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad	I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have any plans for the future?"
"i am always outside my house beafore my friend gets here	I bet you feel like a good host!"
"i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives	That's cool! I am glad you have someone to be with!"
"i was really happy the day i finished my doctorate	how did you feel about it?"
"yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end	That's great, it's always good to have a new home."
"in science of medicine it was really a fun exppirience	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, and is getting back in a week.  I'm super pumped!	That's awesome! I'm sure you're looking forward to it!"
"No, taking a language course to help her graduate studies.  Good guess though :P	That is a good idea.  Are you taking the course yourself?"
"My wife is coming back into the country after being away for 2 months.  I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P	That is great! I hope she has a good time."
"Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad, but it's nice to come home to a clean house.	Yeah, I can relate.  I love coming home to a clean house.  It makes me feel better."
"i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public	I would be too! Do you have to go to the salon?"
"yeah it is the worst, i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a stylist?"
"I had a bad experience out to eat the other day.  I don't do it too often, so it was a bummer.	That sucks.  Was it a bad meal?  I hope you can get back out there soon."
"The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.	That sounds terrible. Have you given up on eating out?"
"I was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn't watching where I was going and knocked over an entire display.	Oh no! That must have been scary!"
"It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it. My face was bright red.	Oh no!  Are you okay?  Did you get in trouble?"
"My wife has been out of the country for two months and is getting back in a week.	That is a long time. How long was she away?"
"Definitely :)  It's been a long and lonely summer :)	Oh no, how long has it been?"
"I recently moved from California to North Carolina and suddenly realized I knew absolutely nobody. It was a horrible feeling.	Oh no! I bet you felt like you were going to be alone for the rest of your life. I'm sorry to hear that."
"My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway, a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly, huh?!	That's a great friend. I'm sorry you have to deal with it."
"The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.	That sucks.  Did you end up finding a place to live?"
"The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?	I am from South Africa, so I went to the south of San Francisco."
"A while ago I drove from Florida to Northern California. It's a long trip, but I knew I could do it just fine.	Oh, I bet that was a relief! I bet you were happy to be going to the coast."
"It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East, so kind of knew what I was doing.	What kind of trip were you making?"
"Oh no - I'm not a race car driver, lol. And anyway, it's kind of fun seeing different parts of the country, so rushing would (to me) be a waste.	My wife was really sick the other day, she was stuck in bed for most of the day.	That is so sad. I hope she is feeling better now."
"Not completely sure, maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now, though her appetite took a bit to come back.	Well I hope it is nothing serious!"
"summer was so boring for me, im really happy school is starting again	I'm sorry to hear that. I'm a high school student too and I have no idea what I want to do in life so I'm also really looking forward to it."
"not really, i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did	thats nice of them"
"My mom is having weight loss surgery next week, I'm nervous.	She's going to be fine."
"She is having gastric bypass surgery, I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!	That sounds scary. I hope she gets the help she needs."
"there is nothing i hate more than losing in something	I hate losing too. What's your favorite sport?"
"not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me	I hate when that happens!"
"It has been a wonderful Monday!	Why is it a wonderful day?"
"I found out a got a pay raise at my job, we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in November!	That's amazing!  What kind of cruise?  I hope you get to go to the Bahamas!"
"I read in the news about a family who lost all six of their animals in a house fire :(	Oh no.  Did you know who the family was?"
"I know, it made me upset! My two dogs are my babies couldn't imagine loosing them.	I know, I would be upset too."
"my dog is over at the vet for 4 days and makes the house feel so alone'	That's terrible! I am so sorry you have to go through that. How is your dog doing?"
"yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back	Oh really? What happened?"
"My wife went out of the country for a couple months at the beginning of the summer, dropping her off at the airport was really tough.	Oh no, did she leave with anyone?"
"Not for more than a few days.  It's been a rough couple months, but it's almost over!	Wow, that's great to hear! What's going on?"
"When my wife and I had to move for her to go to school, we had a lot of trouble finding a place to live until my parents were nice enough to cosign on a loan.	Oh that's so nice of them. Did you find a place that was good for you?"
"We are.  They've helped a lot during my life, but this might have been the biggest one.	That is so good to hear. What have they done for you?"
"i cant wait to visit my family back home they are so far away i dont get to see them a lo	That's nice. Where are they?"
"in a couple of weeks i am really happy to see them it has been 5 years	That's great!  Are you expecting any special events?"
"i cant get near spiders, even if i see them in pictures they freak me out	I know what you mean. I hate seeing them in my house"
"not really i was just born afraid of them hahah	That is true. I'm glad you are safe."
"A few years ago, before we got married, my wife planned a party for me for my birthday completely without me knowing.	That sounds like a nice surprise!  Did you enjoy it?"
"It really was!  I walked into my apartment to like 15 more people than I expected.	That's crazy! What was going on?"
"i hate when my little brother throws food on the table just to annoy m e	I can relate to that."
"he is like 11 but he does it when my parents are not home it is really anoying	That's disturbing. What are you doing?"
"I was stopped at a traffic light when a woman in a truck scraped slowly along the side of my car.	That is so annoying.  Did you get mad at her?"
"Yeah, we both stopped and pulled over.  I think she was high or something, she was really off.	Oh my god! Did you see her vomit?"
"i found a little ball of hair when i was eating at a fancy restaurant	Oh wow!  Did you get it out?"
"yeah i did, they gave us a refund and we did not come back to that place again	Did you come back to the place after the refund?"
"I had made plans for dinner and had set everything out and I found out my husband ate all the bread!	Oh no!  That's a bummer!  Did you get mad at him?"
"It wasn't even garlic bread! It was generic bread to dip in soup!	That is horrible. I would be so mad."
"i feels surprised	I'm glad you're happy for yourself.  What happened?"
"my boy friend gives me a birthday gift surprisingly	Wow, that is nice of him."
"My neighbor used to have an old beagle - a lovely pooch. He died of cancer just before Thanksgiving. I looked for him for weeks - I miss him.	What a terrible time to lose a pet. I'm sorry."
"Yeah. I used to see him when I was out on my porch and he'd come out for a sniff around or a tinkle. He was so sweet and gentle.	That is so sweet. Did you have a pet?"
"They sure are. I actually prefer them to some humans I know! Do you have a dog at the moment?	I do. She's 3 years old now and is getting older. She's very smart and is always happy to see me."
"That's wonderful, that you were able to take her in. Good for you! More people should act like that.	Oh I agree, I'm so glad I could."
"I'm not a very good cook but sometimes my husband scares me with it!	I have had that happen.  Do you have a secret to making things better?"
"He was putting chocolate right into the chilli the other night!	Oh that's a bit scary. Did he get it on himself?"
"My son came home today and was working on his homework.	That is so cool, did he finish it?"
"In 7th and they're doing pre algebra. He said he didn't know it, then proceeded to get every question right!	That's amazing!  That is a very good teacher.  I'm sure he is going to do well!"
"I've been training hard for a marathon next week, and I am beating my record time!	That's awesome! I love running, how long do you run for?"
"For a few months now, but I've been training pretty hard just these past few months.	Oh, that's good! Do you have a specific goal in mind?"
"I'm very socially awkward and tomorrow i'm going to have a playdate with some local moms and i'm so anxious	That sounds exciting! I'm sure you'll have a blast!"
"that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice.	You're welcome! I hope you find what you're looking for."
"I recently went to ruby falls, an underground cavern with a waterfall.	That sounds so cool. I have never been there. What was it like?"
"Not that particular one, no. I had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down 23 stories.	I have had that before. It is terrifying."
"Overall it was a good time, but i was nervous being that far underground, i need to learn to relax and enjoy things.	I had some hesitations when I was at the gym today, thought I wouldn't be able to handle the weights	I am sorry to hear that, but it is a great place to work out, and you will get better with time."
"I decided to focus on the music that was blasting, just tried switching up what I play in the gym, it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle	Oh that's so cool! I love listening to music while I work out."
"Have you ever been in a car crash before?	Yes, I was in one once, but it was a minor one."
"I got T-boned once, I'll never forget spinning around in that car, hearing the tires squalling. It was really scary.	Oh wow. I can't imagine how scary that must have been."
"My wife has been really sad here recently, I've had to hold her while she cries herself to sleep at night.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
"Shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer. We've been to 4 funerals, and the most recent one was really hard on her.	That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that."
"My bank, which I've had a savings account with for over 10 years has been deducting $15/month from me for ""inactivity"". How about that?	I know the feeling. I am so tired of those fees."
"Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.	That's not good, what happened?"
"Yes. They said that they'd been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money. What rubbish. It just amazes me!	Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.	I don't think that's something to be so quick to discuss, if you haven't then I don't think you should."
"Yes, my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.	That is very sad and hard to understand. I am so sorry you are going through this."
"Have you ever had a new puppy?	Oh yes! I have 2. I love them!"
"Yeah, he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside, but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!	Oh, that is disgusting!  I bet you are so tired!"
"I store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid. I was storing my last piece in there	I love chocolate. Do you have a favorite type?"
"Last night I wasn't in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone!	That's sad. Did you find it?"
"I ran into my neighbor's mailbox with my car but didn't stop and leave a note.	Oh no! I'm sure they were surprised! Did you get in trouble?"
"I agree, I felt so bad about it. When I saw him replacing it, I went out and confessed.	Oh wow, I would have been very embarrassed."
"i'm so stressed. we are struggling financially and i don't even know how are we going to pay rent this month	I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you taking out a second mortgage on your house?"
"thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it's expensive	Oh, I am sorry to hear that!"
"My mom made a pretty awesome scrapbook and gave it to me for christmas several years ago. I recently dug it out and went through it.	Wow! That's really cool. I love making things with my family and friends!"
"Photos from my whole life growing up, with sections about my relationships with each sibling. pretty awesome.	That sounds really interesting. I love looking at old family photos."
"I once was taking a big trip I had been looking forward to and the day before we leave for an international flight a high level travel advisory was issued for the area we were going.	Oh no! What happened?"
"No. We went ahead and went on. It actually turned out to be a great trip with zero incidents.	That's great! I bet it was a lot easier than you expected."
"Yeah. Glad we didnt bail.	I'm glad we didn't bail.  What happened?"
"No. Best I can remember it didnt even rain.	I hate it when plans fall through. I really wanted to spend my time on the water this last weekend.	That's sad.  Did you have to cancel?"
"I was going to Florida to go on a multi-day canoeing and camping trip. At the last minute, the two people I was going with backed out, and I simply couldn't afford to go alone.	That is terrible. I am sorry that happened to you."
"My grandpa always said he was a rockstar back in his day, but I never believed him.	That's cool, did he have a band?"
"I don't know if he was famous, but the other day, he got on stage, bit the head off of a bat, then belted the words to Crazy Train. It was unbelievable!	That sounds like a wild time."
"I used to do flooring work, we had to deal with some pretty strange situations sometimes.	What kind of strange situations?"
"well, one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him. was revolting.	That's a terrible thing to happen.  What happened to the man?"
"It really bothers me that my son sticks his dirty socks in the toy box	Wow. That sounds like a really bad habit."
"I guess so haha but no matter what I try to keep him from doing it, it still happens	What is he doing?"
"I recently had my hip-length hair cut for the first time in years.	That's really nice. I've been getting a cut for years too."
"It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut, but it looks much thicker and healthier now.	That sounds like a really hard cut to get used to, but it sounds like you're making progress now."
"I went around work all day today with a hole in my pants, right on my bottom.	Oh no. What happened?"
"Yep! No one told me. :( I have no idea how many people noticed or saw it.	I think you might be referring to the latest iPhone release. I think you might be mistaken."
"I paid $1000 for one of those mystery boxes on eBay. It said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items.	That is a lot of money."
"I would've happily taken that! Instead, it was filled with literal garbage, like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.	That's disgusting. Did you find anything else?"
"I had my final exam for Chemistry today!	That is so exciting! I hope you did well."
"I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.	That's great! What did you study for?"
"It can be rough when I have a problem and need to vent to someone	I am sure you did good!"
"You are sweet because part of the problem is when I realize there really is no one to talk to. Thank you	Oh no, what happened?"
"I've been training a new girl at work this week!	That's great! How old is she?"
"She's doing great, especially for her second week on the job!	Why?"
"I've already been shopping for christmas, I'm excited!	I'm so jealous. I love Christmas."
"I know, it's my favourite time of year! Makes me happy :)	That sounds great. What is your favorite time of year?"
"I was just at the casino, spent almost 100 dollars on a single machine. I didn't will anything.	What did you win?"
"Haha, yeah I got a little sauced. The worst part though was as soon as I got up, someone sat down and  rolled triple 7s.	That's really really bad. Did you try to play again?"
"I used to get supremely scared when I wanted to go up stairs when the lights were off	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you ever get used to it?"
"Yeah, so I would book it up the stairs as fast as possible	I love stairs, I always find myself running up them when I need to get to a place quickly"
"I just got matched up with someone online. It will be my first date in a while.	That is exciting! I hope everything goes well for you."
"Yeah, I'm really hoping to make a good impression. Other wise that would feel pretty bad.	I think you should be proud of yourself no matter what."
"Tomorrow is the big day, I have to deliver my proposal to the client.	Wow! That sounds like a big deal. Are you nervous?"
"I have been preparing for weeks, but in the back of my mind I still have doubts.	Oh no, are you worried about the exam?"
"My boyfriend's cat wakes me up every morning at 4 AM.	I hate cats. How do you take care of them?"
"I love him, too, a lot. But I don't know why he just stands in the hallway and meows nonstop, even when he's been fed.	That is so annoying! What kind of dog is it?"
"Ashe. He's cute :)	I'm finally almost done with my associate's degree! I technically started wayyyy back in 2011, but I just got serious in 2016.	That's great, I'm so happy for you!"
"Thank you. :) I only have three classes left to take. I'm so excited.	What classes do you have left to take?"
"Thanks a lot ;)	Playing hookey can be really fun. But sometimes it backfires...	I think it is fun but also very bad."
"When I was a teenager, I called in to the restaurant and told them I had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away. Wouldn't you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!	Oh wow, I bet it was a shock!"
"Sometimes I enjoy being alone, but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home.	That's understandable. I wish I could travel a bit."
"This was a while back, but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally, he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.	That's so sad.  Did you have a good reason for doing it?"
"I have a beautiful girl friend. But I met someone else.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Why did you meet her?"
"I'm trying to figure out how to kick her out of my place.	I would be happy to help you with that."
"I just watched the ring movie for the first time.	Oh man! I love the ring!"
"I can't even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days.	What are you doing?"
"Once I took a sip of iced tea while I was driving and it went down the wrong pipe. I had to pull over so I could try to breathe again.	Oh no! That's scary. What did you do next?"
"Yeah it is. I thought I was about to die lol	What happened?"
"My cashier gave me extra change back and I didn't say anything.	That is nice of her."
"Because I had also stolen some candy and wanted to get out as soon as possible.	What happened?"
"A man came to my door with a gun, asking for money.	Oh no! Was he a friend or a stranger?"
"I did not know him. He took some items from the house as I didn't have any money on me	Oh that is awful. Did you find out who he is?"
"I like finding little resources or tips that change old habits I've been coping with in what seems like ""1 easy step""	I'm not sure I agree with that.  I've always been the one to try to change everything at once."
"Exactly, I started taping my mouth closed at night, finally woke up before noon, mission accomplished	That's a good way to stay awake."
"I started taping my mouth closed before bed, and now I'm no longer tired when I wake up, feels like I am born again	I bet you feel great. How long has it been since you stopped?"
"Yeah, it	I don't know what you are talking about."
"I use band aid tape cuz it's okay on the skin	Sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time. Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.	That sounds like a nice time."
"It was, but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived, there was a festival with games, performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!	I bet it was, I love fireworks."
"I was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud, and I had a hard time focusing	That's no fun. Do you think you should talk to your neighbors about it?"
"No, I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible	That's okay. You're not alone."
"I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!	That's horrible!  You should have told them!"
"That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card, and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!	Yeah, I heard that before.  I think it's a good idea to check your bank's website to see if they have a cardholder service.  It's usually free and will allow you to get a new card in a few days."

"I can't believe I am telling you this, but I actually camped out to buy tickets for the new star wars movie.	That's awesome. I've always wanted to do that."
"I'm glad you don't think so. The kicker is, when I got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!	Oh man!  I would be so mad!  That's so unfair!"
"My girlfriend and I were going to a big parade with some friends. As we were leaving, she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.	That's terrible. I hope you guys can get her back to the car without any problems."
"Unfortunately, it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead, I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.	That's a good way to spend time together."
"My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking, but ultimately underwhelming thing	Oh that's awful. Did you have to clean it up?"
"I guess because furry things don't really scare me, I was like well that was a waste of a reaction	I'm not sure I understand what you are saying. Do you mean you were scared of the furry animals?"
"I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift	That sounds like a lot of fun. I bet you felt pretty good after working out."
"No not really, just seeing how much energy I could summon from within	What are you doing?"
"There's too many things to think about	I can relate. How many things are there?"
"Yeah, what am I getting myself into	I'm sorry, I didn't understand what you said."
"I just finally won some money playing scratch lotto tickets.	That's awesome! I've been trying to win that for years!"

"I got a new puppy. She's really cute and playful	How old is she?"
"I named her Layla.	That's a beautiful name. I bet she's a lovely girl."
"I recently went to a Steely Dan concert with my lady.	That sounds like fun! I am a huge fan of their music."
"Yeah, it was awesome reminiscing about those times when we used to get in trouble back in the day... times were so much simpler then.	What kind of trouble did you get in trouble for?"
"I just got a new puppy, names fido.	Oh boy, that sounds exciting! How old is he?"
"It is a german shepherd. It takes a lot of work caring for it, definitely needs a lot of attention	I think my dog is a German Shepherd! My dog is a Shih Tzu. I don't know what kind of work it takes to care for it."
"On my way to work, a goose stole the toupee I needed to impress the new secretary, Christy.	That's quite an embarrassing story. Did Christy find it?"
"No! I am so furious with that goose, that I could wring his neck! I can't get any ladiez with this chrome dome of mine.	I can understand that.  You seem like a very angry person."
"I was doing the dishes and a huge roach crawled out from underneath the dishwasher.	That's pretty gross. I would have been so grossed out!"
"I almost fell over trying to crush it, i forgot I wasn't wearing shoes and stepped on in with my bare feet.	Oh no! I'm sorry! I bet you were mad!"
"I was walking down the street at night, I felt like I was surrounded by something unseen.	That sounds creepy. Did you see anything?"
"Every time I turned around to try and catch something there was nothng there. Just the feeling of something watching me....	I can imagine! It sounds like you're in a scary place. I hope you find something to scare you!"
"I had a job interview that I didn't really feel prepared for.	That's a bummer. Did you still go through with it?"
"I did not get it unfortunately.	What did you get?"
"One time, I smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car.	I bet it was a stinky smell, did you investigate further?"
"Well, when I went to lift the engine cover, I noticed a dead, rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.	Oh my goodness! I hate seeing those things. I'm glad you didn't have to deal with it."
"I went to the store, just trying to get some milk and bread, and I got rear ended by a driver.	oh no!  that is bad.  you are going to be okay?"
"Yeah, it was more of a shock than anything, was not expecting someone to hit you when you are just crossing the street.	That is terrible. I am so sorry."
"I have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech.	I love a good speech.  What is it about?"
"I can only dream. No it's more on par with Lord of the RIng's final battle.	I agree, it was a pretty intense battle."
"Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.	That is pretty rude.  Did you tell them that you would have to wait?"
"Yeah, I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.	Wow, I'm sorry. Was the bank very busy?"
"I thought I bombed my math test but I got a 103 on it.	What grade are you in?"
"I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.	I am sure you did fine!"
"I just found a photo book of me and my family growing up.	Wow! I bet you were really happy to see it!"
"It was pretty nostalgic , how young we all looked growing up.	What did you guys do in your childhood?"
"I finally got to see a baseball game live this last week.	Oh that's great! I love baseball!"
"It was the Rockies, no home-run though, it was pretty high up there I felt like I could see the world.	Oh that is so cool! I love baseball, especially the Rockies. What was your favorite part of the game?"
"When my buddy asked me to help him clean out his grandmother's house who had recently passed, I was not prepared for what we found.	Oh no, I hope it wasn't something gross."
"You hit it right on the money. She was not only a hoarder but a cat lady, and the mix of paper, bugs and cat feces was an affront to the senses.	Oh my goodness, that sounds like a nightmare. I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"I let my dad borrow my car and he got in a minor accident.	Oh no, did he get in trouble for it?"
"Yeah he is fine and my car was not damaged. My insurance premium is probably going to go up though.	I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do to your car?"
"He said he would cover the extra costs so I'm not too upset	When I bought my new car, I couldn't believe how smooth the ride was.	Oh wow!  That is amazing.  I bought a new car and it was a little rough at first but now it is smooth sailing!"
"It's a Chevrolet Camaro.	what kind of car?"
"I studied for 7 months to take the GRE exam, it was stressful.	I am sure you did great! Did you get a good score?"
"I did, and I was accepted to my number 1 program, which meant that I was going to be paid to learn!	That is awesome!  What program is it?"
"I have a feeling the really hard work might just be beginning, but I feel exceptionally lucky.	I studied all night for my final exams. I needed to pass them to graduate from college.	That is awesome! I am sure you did great!"
"I did. I was able to sneak in a few hours here and there.	Oh really?  What did you do?"
"I left my wallet in a movie theater, and didn't notice till I was half way home!	I would be so upset! What did you do?"
"I was able to get back in and find it, it was pretty well hidden in between the seats. No harm no foul.	That's good to hear.  What was it?"
"Some people are just so generous. Really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there.	Yes, I've met some people who are just so kind."
"That's incredible if true, but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast!	That is pretty cool. I bet you all had a great time."
"I was so proud of my daughter over the weekend.	What happened?"
"She performed her first solo dance in competition, but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.	Thats awesome! What kind of dance is it?"
"It was, very much so, I will cherish it forever.	I'm grateful for the work hours, but bummed that I can't get time off.	I can relate, it's hard to get time off sometimes"
"Well, I've worked without a break for the last 3 years, I just want to get away abit.	That sounds exhausting! I'm glad you get to take a break!"
"Right! I'd like to go lay on a beach, or even just the next town over at this point.	I have been extremely diligent in my studies so far, and am participating in two clubs this upcoming year. The future is looking bright!	What clubs are you participating in?"

"I am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump.	That's so boring, I bet it's not fun."
"The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents, so the dump has a line every day.	I hate the dump. I hate the company."
"We have, and we called a city meeting. I'm just beyond words,it has to be corrected.	's all too common these days. |||| NEW CONVERSATION ||| I recently went to a dinner where we were served something unconventional to say the least.	What did you guys order?"
"I should have known better, as these friends are on the ""crunchier side"". They had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!	That's disgusting!  I don't eat bread.  I don't even eat it at all."
"I lost my appetite completely! I will be sure to get takeout before hand if we ever go to another one of their dinners.	my mom is supposed to call me regarding her test results.	that's nice of her"
"She had stage 3 cancer, but she was clear last screening a year ago.	That is amazing. What type of cancer?"
"Thank you, I have a good feeling about it.	I went to a wedding recently, and something happened that put a damper on it. I felt bad for my buddy, but at least he knows he can trust me.	I am sure he will be okay"
"Yeah, his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up, and let him know what had happened.	Well that is good that she is sober."
"I am highly upset that I'm the only one concerned with earning money for our bills	That's too bad. Are you the only one in the household?"
"Not much. It's all on me. It sucks	That sucks. Are you working on a new project?"

"For me it's happy emotions	I am happy for you."
"The micro brewery explosion in America has been awesome for my girlfriend and I, as we love craft beer. Until recently, our town didn't have one though.	That is awesome! I love craft beer! What town do you live in?"
"We actually don't brew our own, and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!	That's awesome!  I love trying new beers and breweries.  What kind of beers do you like?"
"I hate it when other guys look at my girl	I'm sorry, is she married?"
"She's for my eyes only. At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!	What a nice guy you are.  I love your attitude."
"Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read ""Kitchen Confidential"", or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year.	I am so sorry to hear that.  He was an amazing chef and an even better person."
"He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food, and we all still look up to him.	I love that story. What is the story about?"
"My husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing.	Did you know they had planned it?"

"About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.	That's cool.  I'm glad you were able to find someone that you really like.  Are you going to see him again?"
"Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!	Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday, so I had to work overtime, but I didn't even get paid for it!	Yeah that's a bummer. You should tell them it's not fair."
"I'm technically salaried, so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating.	I can understand that. I'm lucky to be a freelancer."
"I went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it	Oh, that is so frustrating.  I would have been so mad."
"Sadly, no.  There's no actual proof of who it was, but we've seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place.  He did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once, so I'll take that as a victory.	Oh that's not good.  I would have been so upset.  You're right, though.  It's weird."
"My husband went to a job fair and got a lot of job offers!	That's great! What kind of jobs did he get?"
"He is currently Active Duty Army, but is wanting to go into transportation/logistics.	Why do you think he is wanting to go into logistics?"
"It's been a great day so far! The sun is out and I'm on my second cup of coffee!	That is awesome! What are you doing today?"
"Yes I am, about to make some soup for lunch. This day has been just what I needed!	Oh I can relate, I've been feeling a bit down lately."
"When I applied for the job I have now it took them like a month to get back to me with a final answer.  It was pretty stressful.	Oh that is a bummer. Did you get the job?"
"Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end, but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.	That is a lot of work! I'm glad it all worked out in the end."
"A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.	That is very exciting! Where are you both going?"
"I know - I wish I could do that. They've been to France, Italy, Croatia and Chile so far - I'm sitting in NC!	Well that is quite a trip, you must be very jealous!"
"I would just like to be able to drive to Raleigh without hurting! I fell and broke my hip a while back and can't walk properly.	That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can get better."
"One more operation and I should be good. In the meantime, I have to live vicariously through Joe and Helen :)	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, she gets back in a week.  I can't wait!	That's great. What are you guys doing?"
"I really did.  It'll be great to have her back :)	What happened?"
"When I interviewed for the job I have now, they didn't give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview.	That's annoying. Did you call them to ask about the answer?"
"It worked out ok, but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.	Oh wow!  What were you trying to get them to do?"
"My wife has been out of the country for the last 2 months for school.	Oh no! I hope everything went well."
"I do.  She's getting back soon, but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.	That's a tough situation. I'm glad she's getting back soon."
"When I interviewed for my current job, I felt like it went well but all I could do was wait.	I am sure you did fine!"
"A lab technician at a university.	What did he/she do?"
"My parents brought my brother a brand new iPhone. He always gets the newest stuff and I get stuck with nothing.	Oh wow, that's a little disappointing.  I'm sure he'll appreciate it."
"I have no idea. He's the ""golden child."" It's super unfair.	That is terrible, what is he going to do?"
"My wife has been out of the country for two months, which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can't help the other.	That is really hard to hear.  I hope she is having a good time.  I know it is tough for you, but I am sure she will be back soon."
"She gets back in a week, so it's almost over.	That's great.  How long have you been together?"
"my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! I hate insects. they are so nasty	Oh no! I hate bugs too! I would have screamed!"
"heck yes i did! I locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work	That's crazy! What did he do?"
"i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season	I do too. They are disgusting."
"yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them	That's true, but you know what they say... ""you are never too old for a rainy day"""

"Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!	Yeah, I think so."
"I'm going skydiving for the first time with some friends!	Oh wow that sounds like so much fun!  I have never done that before.  Are you scared?"
"A little bit, but I love doing extreme stuff like this.	Oh yeah? What do you mean by ""extreme stuff""?"
"The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night!	What did you do?"
"It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs!	Oh no! What was it?"
"On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.	What happened to your hip?"
"Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.	I know how you feel! I've been to the hospital a few times and had some scary moments too. I hope you get through it!"
"You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still, I fret about it. I should just get on with it!	I'm about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack	That's great. I love when friends can help you out like that."
"she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her	What is she doing for you?"
"Cell phones are great, but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable.	I agree, especially when you are in a situation where you need to be able to be discreet."
"Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline, and it was not an appropriate topic!	Oh no! Did you yell at them?"
"Of course they did, some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where. I was humiliated,lol.	My dog died today :(	I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how hard it is to lose a pet."
"Yes, she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.	That is so sad.  What kind of cancer?"

"I'm moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can't wait! No more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!	Well, I can imagine that would be a good change. Are you excited about the move?"
"Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?	Yeah, but I like to do that sometimes when I'm home."
"Eww. Yes, it is loud. Who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? That's nuts!	My wife has been out of the country for two months, and is coming back in a week!	That's great!  You must be excited!"
"It sure is.  It's just been me and the dogs all summer, I've gotten super bored :P	You need to get a new job"
"I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!	I totally agree."
"I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom. I am so grossed out by all the bugs here!	I hate bugs!"
"Spiders could bite me, which could really hurt!	i feel that with my training lately im going to win my next week soccer game	That's awesome! I bet you're feeling pretty confident about it."
"for this specific game for about 3 months	Oh wow, I'm sure it was a lot of fun."
"After my wife and I moved I went through a while of unemployment.  It was really tough not being able to support us.	I am sorry to hear that. You must have felt very down."

"i am really happy for next year i have a trip planned to go to india	That sounds amazing! Where are you going?"
"yeah i have been planning this trip for over 2 years	What kind of trip?"
"I had the most wonderful week recently. My neighbors weren't here and I could do whatever I wanted without them stomping on my head!	Oh wow! That sounds so nice. What did you do?"
"It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.	Oh no! I am so sorry.  Are you alone?"
"That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!	That is so disappointing. I hate when that happens."
"Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.	I hope so!  What are you going to be called?"
"I went to work with my pants inside out, and I didn't notice until my secretary pointed it out.	Oh my!  Did it embarrass you?"
"It was very embarrassing! At least I didn't go the whole day like that.	What happened?"
"The airport was completely empty the other day.	Oh, that is so annoying."
"Home, but I thought LA would be crowded even at 4am, it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy.	That's a little scary. I don't like crowded places either."
"Made getting my connection super easy, and trust me I was in a hurry to get there. Odd how being alone can make you paranoid.	i cant wait to see my dog back home it has been 2 years since i see him	Oh no! How long was it since you saw him?"
"college, but i will be seeing him very soon i think	What happened?"
"So my youngest went to his first day of kindergarten today.  So proud of him.  Silly I know.	I know. I had to get him dressed in his new school clothes."

"I know my oldest just graduated,  It was like it was over in an instant!	A few months ago we were planning our wedding and I couldn't wait until the actual day finally arrived.	What happened?"
"It was even better then expected. It was very small, but so happy how it turned out.	How did it turn out?"
"i hate when my neighboors dog poops on my yard and she does nothing, i dont care if he poops if she picks it up	That is so annoying."

"Thank you.	This morning, my dog knocked down a while box of cereal and it spilled everywhere.	oh no, is she okay?"
"Yes, and to make it worse, when I tried to clean it, she tried to eat, so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.	Oh my goodness, that's awful! How old is she?"
"No, she only ate a little bit. I cleaned it up pretty quickly.	There was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it	I love trying new foods. Where did you go?"
"I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive, small, and bland!	That's terrible. Did you get the food from a restaurant?"
"In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.	That can be awkward, but it's also a great chance to learn about people's beliefs."
"If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.	I feel you.  I would never lie to someone I trust."
"I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol. I'm all for earnest discussion, but not at work!	My husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber. He was able to carry so much at once!	That is so awesome.  I bet he felt good about himself."

"i was really sad when my dog died last year	I'm sorry to hear that, what happened to him?"
"yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about	I'm sorry.  Are you going through a tough time?"

"Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.	I'm sure he's happy for you."
"I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.	My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday, we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe, have fun, and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call, we found out that she had a heart attack and died.	Oh my god. I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you are okay."
"Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.	That must have been very hard. I'm sorry you have to deal with that."
"Thank you.	My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her.	That's great! What happened to her?"
"I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad	i would be too, it is so sad"
"I love to play golf, but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again.	I am sorry to hear that, but I am sure that you will be able to do it again, you are a very determined person."
"It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!	Yes, it's all too easy, but I'm glad you're taking steps to help yourself."
"Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.	Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!	I have never done it. What is it like?"
"I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.	That sounds like a great experience. What did you do?"
"I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.	I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!	I bet that is amazing! I have a TV in my room that is quite old."
"I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies.	Why?"
"I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies.	I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face!	That sounds like a horror show!"
"I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled!	That's so scary.  I bet you were so relieved when he came into the room and saw you."
"I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything	Well, you can't let that stop you. Just go in there and do your best."
"a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job, they pay really good money	I bet you do. What position?"
"I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.	I'm sure it was nice to think about. What were they like?"
"I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.	That's great that you told him.  How did he react?"
"I actually sent her a message through facebook.	That is a good idea! I've never heard of anyone sending a message through facebook."
"I guess that's a good word for it.	I came home from work today and my wife had a new puppy waiting for me.	Oh wow! That must have been a fun surprise!"
"Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day.	Oh, I bet he is adorable! I love animals."
"It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back.	I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled.	Oh no, that's terrible. I'm sure you were disappointed."
"I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.	That's good.  You will get a great deal on it."
"I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.	I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!	Did you feel guilty about eating them?"
"It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.	What did you do?"
"It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!	my son is sick, he got this hand foot and mouth desease, nothing serious but he has a fever	That's terrible, I hope he feels better soon."
"i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow	Oh that is nice.  I hope he feels better."
"i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions	That is cool. I've never been into dancing."
"honestly, no, it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again	I know, I feel the same."
"I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.	That's awesome! I love watching sports, especially golf!"
"I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!	I'm a huge fan of football, I love watching it!"
"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	Oh no.  I am so sorry to hear that.  How did she react?"
"Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.	That is a great attitude to have."
"Yes, they did.	I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!	Oh wow, that's gross! What was it?"
"I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden!	Oh my goodness! I would have been so mad! Did you get any punishment?"
"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	I agree!  I hate animal abuse.  I always want to help animals when I can."
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	I agree. They are so ignorant and stupid."
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	Oh no. What did it sound like?"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	That's a pretty good thing to have to deal with. I'm sure it was just a raccoon!"
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	That's good to hear. I hope so too."
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	That's nice of you.  Did you tell him how much you were able to help him?"
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	That is so exciting! What did you do?"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	That's amazing!  What kind of food?"
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	I have seen a drone flying over me. I was scared."
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	I can only imagine what it must be like!"
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	yeah i know what you mean, sometimes you just want to be able to keep your secrets to yourself"
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	Oh no, that's sad. Did you tell her that you didn't hear anything?"
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	I'm sorry to hear that. I've lost a few pets over the years."
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	That's weird. Did they find anything?"
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	Did the doctor say what it was?"
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	That is so hard for them. I bet you are worried!"
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	Oh wow, that's disgusting. Did you call the police?"
"I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.	Oh wow! I'm sorry to hear that."
"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	Oh yeah, I have never heard of that before."
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that!"
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	That's great! I hope you do well on it!"
"Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.	I bet that's a lot of work. I'm glad you are doing well."
"Criminal and social justice.	I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.	Did you get on it?"
"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	I can imagine, I've never been to a high place like that."
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	That must have been a bummer!"
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	I know what you mean. I had the same problem last weekend."
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	I've lost a few pets and I can relate. Losing a pet is always hard."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	That's terrible.  What happened to Louie?"
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	Oh no! What was the trip like?"
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	What happened?"
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	That's terrible!  I hope you have a wonderful time with her!"
"She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade	That's awesome.  What school is she in?"
"I finally had a day of, but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.	That's a bummer. You could have still done things you wanted to do."
"I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.	Oh yeah, what time was that?"
"I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious	That sounds scary. Did you have a good time?"
"Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.	I hate accidents, they are so stressful."
"I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes	Wow, how expensive is it?"
"a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is	I don't know how much it costs, but I know it's expensive."
"I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!	Oh, well, at least you're not ashamed to admit it!"
"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	That is true, I am on a diet too."
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	What happened?"
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	Oh no, that's terrible! Have you got a good insurance plan?"
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	That's a bummer. How did it end up?"
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	Oh no! I'm so sorry. I hope he is okay."
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	That's terrible. I hope you're okay."
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	That's a bit rough. I understand. It's tough to break up with someone, especially if you have a lot of memories together."
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	I agree, people are so nice these days."
"I will, you never know when someone else is in need!	I agree.  I always try to be kind to those who are struggling."
"It is, I have been so blessed in my life!	My husband started college this week!	Wow, that's great. How did he do?"
"Yes, he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!	What branch is he in?"
"I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.	That is so sad. I would be so mad if I had to go to a restaurant and hate it."
"No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.	That is a bummer.  What did you do?"
"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	What happened?"
"I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards	That sounds like a very embarrassing moment. Did you wash your hands?"
"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	I love scary movies! I get that way sometimes too."
"I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.	Oh wow, did you get in trouble?"
"I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.	My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!	That's annoying. How long have you had the dog?"
"People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying!	It does get annoying! I am jealous of your house. Is it expensive to live there?"
"I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.	That sounds good. Did you feel guilty?"
"I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.	That is wonderful. You look like a happy person."
"When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!	That sounds like a great feeling!"
"Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.	That's great. It is always good to save money."
"Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!	I hope it does too! I love teaching kids!"
"I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous.	That's awesome. I'm sure you'll do great."
"It really is, you are molding their future!	I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce	Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that."
"No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.	That's really sad, are you still friends?"
"Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.	I'm sorry. How did you get a new one?"
"They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	Why are they not happy?"
"It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.	My sister got a promotion at work last week!	Oh that's great! What is she doing?"
"She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)	That is amazing! She must be really good at her job."
"My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.	I bet you were so happy for her."
"Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.	I bet you are proud of yourself!"
"My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!	I can imagine. I am sure he will do great."
"I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.	That's really tough. I'm sorry. I think he feels the same way about you."
"Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?	I know, it's hard when you are the one who has to deal with it.  I think it will take a while to get used to it, but I know you will."
"Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!	That is great! What is he going to do?"
"I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.	I can relate, I remember it like it was yesterday!"
"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	That's so cool. I love playing games too!"
"I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.	Wow, that's tough! What are you doing to stay on top of it?"
"I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.	That's awesome! You must be so proud of yourself!"
"Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.	I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made!	That is so nice of him."
"Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.	That is nice, I am a gamer myself, but I only play after my kids are asleep."
"Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!	I love coffee. I always buy the filters. I don't like to be lazy."
"Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.	I know what you mean.  I had a rough morning too.  I don't know how people do it.  I have a hard time waking up in the morning."
"4	Oh, what happened?"
"Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.	I love bearded dragons! I have a 3 year old one named Lola"
"My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.	I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday	That's good to hear. It's always a good thing when you have a job that you can handle."
"Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic	That's good to hear! You're lucky to have a job and a home!"
"I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am	That's great to hear.  I hate being lonely."
"Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life!	Did you have to do anything to get there?"
"I had such a bad cold last week, I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.	That is so gross.  I have had a cold before and I know how it feels.  I would have been so annoyed that I would have wanted to get a cup of water and drink it right away."
"No, thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still, I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.	I'm sorry you had to deal with that.  Is it going to happen again?"
"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	That is terrible! I would have been so upset."
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	That's the worst, I'm lactose intolerant too."
"She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.	Well, that is quite an interesting story.  How did it end up?"
"Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!	I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.	That's really scary. I'm sure you'll do great. I'm sure you will be a great dad."
"I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.	I'm sure you'll be fine. It's not easy being a parent."
"I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome	Oh wow! That sounds like a fun time! Did you see a cat that was old?"
"I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing	That's good! I would be worried about having pets that don't get angry."
"I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!	That's good. What do you plan to do?"
"That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.	I am sure you will do great!"
"I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.	It is hard to let go of people."
"Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?	I understand that. I really hope you guys are doing well."
"Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.	I agree.  They should always be safe."
"I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!	Oh my goodness, I would have been so scared!"
"I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.	That is quite scary.  How did you get there?"
"Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.	I am not sure if he did or not. I don't have the ability to see inside his house."
"2	I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!	That is scary! Are you looking for a new home?"
"Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.	Oh no, I would be too. I hope you don't see it again!"
"I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.	That's pretty amazing, I can't draw to save my life either, but I'm sure she's talented!"
"Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.	That sounds like a lot of fun. What is your favorite character?"
"I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise.	That is nice to have a true friend like that."
"I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.	Yeah, it's nice to have someone who believes in you, you know?"
"I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.	Oh no, that's terrible. I hope you get it treated well!"
"It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.	I am so sorry.  I can't imagine."
"Thank you so much for being supportive. :)	I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.	Oh no! I hope there was no one hurt."
"Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.	I would have been as scared as you."
"Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.	I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.	How did it turn out?"
"Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.	Oh I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you have any surgeries planned?"
"Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.	I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope you are okay"
"I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.	I am sure you will be fine."
"Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly	I loved playing old video games too. What was your favorite game to play?"
"Super smash bros is a classic, never gets old, but yeah you're right	I'm a big fan of it. I played it on my old N64."
"I had a job interview recently	Oh really? What was the job?"
"Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.	That sucks. What happened?"
"Speaking of co-workers, one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes, and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.	What is it?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.	I am sorry, but, it is good that you got to be the one to discover it."
"I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me	I love going to the movies.  Do you enjoy the movies?"
"Jurassic World. It was okay.	Oh, what happened?"
"I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.	Oh my.  That's not very nice of him.  What are you going to do?"
"Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge.	I know, that is crazy!"
"I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones	Did you watch his show?"
"I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms	That's probably true. I hope they don't get too worked up."
"I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom, but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain	Oh wow, I bet it was a surprise!"
"Yeah, nobody said anything	I'm glad you're not too embarrassed about it."
"My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!	Oh no, why is she doing that?"
"Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!	I know how you feel.  It is very hard to deal with a betrayal like that."
"Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.	I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.	That is so wonderful of you.  I can only imagine how difficult it must be to be in that situation."
"I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.	What kind of station wagon is it?"
"Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.	That's awesome! I hope he continues to do well."
"No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(	That's good. You can't beat a 90."
"He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.	So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?	Oh my goodness!  That is so amazing!  How does he do it?"
"I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.	What is philosophy?"
"I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.	Oh wow, that's amazing! What kind of hot dogs do you eat?"
"Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!	I am a man of the people. I will be there for you."
"Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.	I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though	That's nice of him. I bet you appreciated that a lot."
"Yes, I feel much better now.	I'm glad to hear that. What happened?"
"I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.	That is nice, did you get to see the old pictures?"
"Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!	That's sad. I'm sorry. What happened to her?"
"I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.	My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.	Oh no. Did you catch her?"
"I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.	Oh no! I bet she was very upset about that."
"Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.	Well that's awesome! I think you should give him a nice gift!"
"Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.	I am shocked that the Clay Institute hasn't found the million dollar prize yet, I would be shocked too."
"I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.	Oh, that's terrible.  I hope they don't make you feel bad about it."
"My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions, probably a bad idea.	I am sure he has his reasons.  I have been there before."
"My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.	I'm so sorry to hear that.  Is there anything you can do to help?"
"Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected.	That's sad, how long have you been together?"
"I broke up with my boyfriend last week, and nothing is the same without him.	Oh no! I am so sorry! I know how that feels."
"Yeah, I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.	That is very sad.  What happened?"
"I just made the most delicious pie	That sounds so good! I love pie!"
"It was apple pit,  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.	That sounds delicious!  What was the apple type?"
"I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.	That's awesome! You look great!"
"I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's	That is a great pair of shoes.  What made you feel on top of the world?"
"I just went camping and build the warmest fire.	That sounds like a lot of fun!  Did you have a good time?"
"Yeah, I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.	That's so nice. What were you doing?"
"I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.	That's crazy! I bet you were a little scared."
"I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.	I would be terrified!  I don't like being near fire."
"I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai	That's cool. What makes you worried?"
"These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic	I agree. I have met some very strict people in those countries."
"I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.	That's terrible! Did they even notice?"
"Of course, I'm not worried no one would steal from me.	I feel the same way, I just don't like to be paranoid."
"I can't help feel stressed about money	I do too.  Do you have a job?"
"Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700	Oh no!  That's awful!  I hope you can get it fixed and get back on track!"
"I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family	Well, that's a tough thing to do. What did you do to take your mind off of it?"
"lol I played xbox games	Nice! Do you play games with friends?"
"I usually don't feel the greatest because of health problems.	That sucks.  Have you tried to get in to therapy or something?"
"Blood pressure and crohns disease, as well as, a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well, woke up happy and energized	Wow, that's great to hear! It's good to feel good, even if it's just for a little while."
"You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions, and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.	I don't know what to say, that's a pretty funny thing to be worried about. I'm glad you have a plan in place."
"Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.	That's a good point. I have a few friends that think they are so smart because they are a little bit older than us."
"Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?	I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.	I bet you are. It's not every day that someone gets to interview for a job."
"I'm hoping for the best, but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!	I understand.  It's tough.  What are you looking for in a job?"
"This is going to sound really pathetic, but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!	Oh no, that is a terrible thing to do."
"Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.	I'm not sure I agree.  But I do agree that dust is bad for you."
"Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.	My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.	I bet she is doing well."
"She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha	I bet you did.  You must be very proud of yourself."
"I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.	I hope so as well!  I'm a little nervous about it too.  I haven't lived in an apartment in a long time."
"Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!	Oh wow, I would have to do the same thing. I would be so tired of them!"
"Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.	Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.	That is quite a scary thought.  I would be terrified.  How did it all work out?"
"It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do.	Wow, that's amazing! I wish I had kids."
"Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.	Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?	I do sometimes. I just feel like it's too hard to let go of the past."
"It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean, I love my life right now, but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.	That's the point of life, right? To keep things simple."
"I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.	That's the only thing that I wish I could do. I wish I could relive my childhood."
"As much as I can, but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.	I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently, one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me, without my saying anything!	That's nice! I'm sure he was happy to do it."
"It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.	That is very kind of them."
"The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!	My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh, i miss her so much	I remember when I was a kid playing with my brother"
"yes but she lives in a different country, different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer	That is so sad."
"For me, one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.	I love that. Is it a favorite book?"
"Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?	I love historical novels. I like reading a lot. I have a lot of books."
"There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.	My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!	Oh no!  That's terrible.  What happened?"
"In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place, and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!	Wow.  I've heard that area is very pretty, but I'm sure the new developments are a bit of a eyesore.  I'm sure the people who live there are happy about it though."
"Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day, but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.	Why are you moving back there?"
"Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.	That's interesting, where did you grow up?"
"i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need	I love animals, I have a cat at home."
"he is a french puddle and i love him very much	Oh wow, that sounds nice. I hope you two have a great time together!"
"One time as a surprise for my birthday, my college friends ""kidnapped me""	Wow, that is so cool! Did you have fun?"
"Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).	That's hilarious!  I am sure that was a fun experience.  Did you get a good laugh out of it?"
"Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.	i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street, i get really angry and sad at the same time	i understand that, i hate seeing people in need, it makes me want to help"
"yes i go to my local charity every weekend	That's great! How many charities do you visit?"
"I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.	Wow! What did you do with it?"
"I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much.	I'm sure you were! How much did you win?"
"I'll try not to. I'll probably just save it :)	I bet you will. What's going on?"
"I was really lonely and depressed at one point, and I had a dinner date with a potato I put googly eyes on.	Oh wow!  That sounds like a lot of fun.  Did you have a great time?"
"Much better, thanks :)  Yeah, I was really just doing anything to feel a connection.	Wow, that's a great attitude to have!  I know you'll find someone soon!  You're one of the most caring people I've met."
"I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!	Oh no!  Are you going to get them cleaned?"
"I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him	That's great that you felt bad. What happened?"
"I was confident that I was going to win that prize	That's great. What prize?"
"It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok	That is the right thing to do.  I would have felt bad if I had won the competition."
"We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap	Oh wow, that sounds good. I am not a big sausage eater, but I do love sausage."
"It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was	That's good, did you get a good deal?"
"it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother	I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay."
"yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital	That's awful.  I hope they are okay."
"I'm going to my home country next tuesday and i'm so excited i can't sleep!! It's been 4 years since i've seen my parents	That's really cool. Are you going back to school?"
"Kazakhstan. I miss it and i miss my parents and friends so much	Oh that's really sad. I've never been there, but I've heard it's beautiful."
"not bruno but borat lol such a stupid movie. I honestly can't stand that actor and his toilet humor	I am super proud of my parents for graduating college	That's awesome! What college did they attend?"
"Yeah, they are truly an inspiration that anyone can go to college no matter the age	I'm so glad that you have a good attitude towards college."
"I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods	oh really? are you ready?"
"aren't you afraid of the wild animals that will be roaming the area?	I came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag, gotten a sandwich I had forgotten I brought home from lunch, and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it.	That is not a good dog."
"He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.	Oh wow, that sounds so scary!  Did you catch him?"
"I am impressed in my sisters camping skills. They are very good	That is awesome.  What type of camping does she do?"
"We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents	oh yeah, that is great.  She must be pretty organized."
"I am confident that I will win the gaming tournament in Chicago	I hope you do!"
"Shooting game	Oh yeah?"
"When I go up with my skydiving students I feel proud when they do well	Did they do well?"
"I have been instructing for 12 years but skydiving for 25	That is so amazing. I am not very good at skydiving, but I would love to."
"You shoudl definitely try it!	Well, recently at physical therapy I walked the length of the treatment room with the help of a cane. I'm feeling quite good about that!	That's great. What kind of treatment were you getting?"
"Considering I've been using a walker for the past two years, yes it is. Thanks!	What's the purpose of the walker?"
"Every day I practice - I'll be back on the golf course in no time, lol.	I am so upset that a public road in front of my house closed because of a limestone mine.	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! That must be frustrating."
"It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.	I know what you mean. I am always looking over my shoulder!"
"I just have to wait for the city to fix the collapsed road and reopen the road again.	I am hopeful that I will win my ebay bid	That is exciting! What is the item?"
"I am bidding on a rare comic book	Are you a comic book collector?"
"I was walking home one time and a really big dog came charging out from a house at me barking really loudly.	Wow, how did you react?"
"Thankfully not really, it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it, but it was really frightening until it was retrieved.	Oh, I bet. Did you get it?"
"it is incredible to see how technology has advanced these past days	I know right? I am so amazed by it all"
"well the phones are basically a 1990's computer	Oh yeah, I know what you mean. I feel like my phone is a super outdated computer."
"I ate an entire cake last night	Oh wow! Did you feel guilty?"
"It was! I just couldn't stop! It was so good that I just had to keep eating	Oh wow, that sounds like a very delicious meal! What did you eat?"
"I am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it	I hope you do!"
"Ehh, its not the best but it's not bad either\	That is okay. What is going on?"
"I was afraid when I saw that horror film in the theater	That is a good horror movie."
"It was the First Purge	Oh yeah? What happened?"
"Wandering around my little area of the world I am quite pleased with the variety of stores and restaurants here. I didn't expect it.	Oh wow! I've never been to a place like that. Where are you?"
"Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well, I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.	I would love to have that. I think I would be really confused as to what to do."
"I find it hard to believe, myself! This is the rural south, yet there are fine dining restaurants, the aforementioned store, really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff.	i hate when i do dishes and touch food that was on the plate1! so gross. makes me wanna throw up	It's like my grandma used to say ""Clean your hands and clean your food"".  You can't let your hands touch food and then eat it."
"because the food is all soggy and mushy. i don't know, such a yucky feeling	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What are you eating?"
"i really hate when my kids leave their dirty clothes on the floor	That is the worst. I can't stand it when I see it."
"yeah they even have a bin specially for that	What kind of bin?"
"i hate people that cut lane in traffic without signaling it	I agree.  That is so rude.  I have a habit of cutting in traffic without signaling it."
"yeah it really makes me mad to see that people dont care about these types of things	I don't either. I hate when people are rude to each other."
"I found a rabbit that had been shot by someone in my yard	That is so sad, how did you feel?"
"Thank goodness it was dead, poor thing is not suffering, but some people can be so cruel.	I agree. People are so mean."
"We had been holding off trying a new restaurant in town.	Oh, that's not a good idea."
"It's a little pricey and I'm worried I won't like the food and waste all that money. It has good reviews though	You are right. It has good reviews but I would be worried about the food."
"Our local organic store now stocks Indian food made by a local Indian lady - heaven, heaven, heaven!	That sounds amazing.  I'm not really into Indian food, but I do like Indian restaurants."
"About once a week. Her husband works in the store, so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!	That is great!  It is always nice to find food that you enjoy!"
"Well, my uncle's Indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook, and she taught me. But I'm disabled right now so can't cook much. This is such a find!	I have been working on  my jump shot all month.	That's awesome. Have you been practicing for a long time?"
"I hope so I have a big horse tournament against my buddies I want to win the 100 bucks prize.	I love horses, I bet you have one?"
"One of my neighbors (next building and two floors up) plays talk radio every morning Very Loudly.	I can see why you would be annoyed. Is it that loud or is it just that he is talking?"
"Not until about 8am, but it's so loud I can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed. Idiot man!	That's so annoying. Are you going to call the police?"
"Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!	I agree! What are they doing?"
"I've called management twice about it and both times he quietened down - for about two days. Then up it goes again!	Oh wow. I would be so frustrated!"
"Nothing in life is certain, the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.	Oh I know what you mean.  I was in a similar place recently."
"I have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas.	Are you going to see her?"
"The show is in three months, I hope she sings he late 90s hits.	What show?"
"Our Property Management team just emailed me to say I've got the apartment I wanted!	What an amazing coincidence! What apartment?"
"It really was - I can't wait to move in! It's a smaller apartment, but quieter (I hope!).	That is so exciting!  What are you moving into?"
"You'll get there. It really is nice to have your own space. Do you live at home?	I do.  It is nice but I am a student.  I have to live in my parents home.  I am so frustrated."
"Good for you! Start saving your money now - believe me, you'll need it!	I was on the patio and a giant roach crawled out from underneath.	Oh my god! How long did you have to wait for it to die?"
"It was almost as bug as a golf ball I felt like throwing up.	What happened?"
"I have quite a long drive ahead of me next month. It's about 1/12 hours, but I've don it before so I'll be fine.	That's great! You should be fine."
"I put music on and open the window. Otherwise I'll disappear into my own little world, and that's not a good thing to do when you're driving!	I feel you, I get the same feeling when I'm driving and I put music on."
"It really helps to pass the time, not to mention it can calm you down. And the drive's quite easy and very pretty, which help.	I was so amped yesterday. I got to pick up my now computer for the store!	Wow! That's great! Did you buy anything?"
"It was just a new model HP that I bought but I'm so excited!	That's awesome, I love getting new things!"
"I get my groceries delivered to my home and am so grateful for the service.	I love getting my groceries delivered. It's so convenient!"
"It helps me a lot as I'm disabled and it can be quite difficult. Anyway, I hate grocery shopping!	I totally understand.  I hate grocery shopping too!"
"Ugh. And don't even get me started on ""mini-shoppers"" racing round the aisles screeching! Much better to have someone else buy for me!	I just watched the notebook, pretty depressing movie.	I have seen that movie, it is very depressing."
"It's a romantic love story. Doesn't end so well for the main character.	Oh, really? What happened?"
"my little boy learned how to  count to ten eeven know he is super young	Wow!  He is so cute!  I love my little boy too.  He is 3.  He can count to ten now.  It is so cute."
"yeah i was so proud of him as well i thought i would have to wait months till he got to that point	That's good.  I'm glad you were there to see him achieve his goal."
"I just went to the park today.	Oh that sounds nice. Did you do anything fun?"
"I was going to hang out, but I ended up tripping and smashing my toe up into a rock.	Oh no, I'm so sorry! That sounds like a painful experience."
"my little brother dumped a glass of water on me this morning to wake me up	Why did he do that?"
"yeah i was furious we are in some sort of a prank war	That's no good. Do you know what's going on?"
"Last night there was a really strange animal screaming outside my window in the middle of the night	That's weird. What kind of animal?"
"Turned out to be a skunk! It sounded so strange!	Oh no! That must have been very scary!"
"When I was in college I travelled all over Europe one semester.	I have never traveled outside of the country, but I wish I had."
"I love all over Italy, but I also loved Germany and France and Spain.	Did you travel to all of these places?"
"Yes it was truly an amazing time meeting people from so many different cultures	We went on vacation and the kids stayed home. I couldn't believe it when I walked in the door and the house was totally clean.	Oh wow, did you hire someone to clean?"
"Wonders never cease to amaze me. First time for everything I guess, lol	I agree. It's always a new experience."
"I totally thought the same thing. Too funny (but you might be right)	I always feel like that with a certain joke or meme."
"I went ziplining the other day	Why did you do that?"
"I found it using the Internet.  It was a lot of hiking but they had a lot of long lines.	Oh wow. I'm sure that was very frustrating."
"Yes I did - I had a great time and met some fun people.	I smashed my finger in the door last night	Oh no! I hope it's not too bad."
"I iced it up but I was so mad because it was my fault for slamming the door	oh no!  how bad was the damage?"
"We might have to put our dog down soon.	That is so sad."
"Yes, she's getting older and she's just getting to that point she can't move around good.	That's sad. Do you have a family?"
"i am really lucky that my cancer got cured many years ago	That is good to hear! How is your health now?"
"i did it with chemo and it took a lot of time and effort	That's really tough. I hope it was worth it."
"I am so ready to move.	That's awesome! Where are you moving to?"
"California. I'm ready for my kids to try out some new schools and be happier :)	Oh that's so exciting. I hope they have fun."
"i cannot stand seeing people throw trash on the streets	I agree, I don't like it either."
"i know right i feel like doing that every time but i dont want to get arrested hahaha let karma get them,	That is so funny!  I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that.  It's such a bad idea."
"I am by myself most of the time in a isolated area. I only have animals as my friends.,5|5|4_5|5|5,	That is a very good thing to have."
"Sometimes it makes me sad, but than I think how happy my animal friends makes me feel.	Why do you think that?"
"I bought 100 packs of magic cards and didn't get a single good card.	That sucks! What kind of cards did you get?"
"Collectible cards. My friend bought only a few packs and got incredible cards.	That's awesome!  Did you get any cards?"
"I feel really bad that we have to board our dog when we go on vacation next week.	I'm sure he'll be fine, he's not too far away."
"We are going to a place at the beach that doesn't allow pets with some friends. Our vet also has a kennel there to board dogs so I guess that's what we'll do. She'll be so sad though.	That's terrible! I hate to see animals get hurt."
"I actually recently applied for a few jobs myself, Crossing my fingers for something better than my current one.	That's a good attitude to have. I like to be prepared for the worst and have a backup plan."
"Current job doesn't pay enough, I'm waiting for the stars to align and something better to come along.	I've been there. I would say go for it."
"I just bought some tickets to win the price at the state fair.	Wow!  That is exciting!  Are you a big fan of the fair?"
"I know its not likely but I really want to win the new mustang	Oh man, I would love to win one.  You must be really excited about it."
"I am so scared to live in my neighborhood. There is people that come around shooting their guns.	That is awful.  I hope you can stay safe."
"I have been thinking about moving but I have lived here for over 30 years. The area has changed so much.	What's changed?"
"My fear is that I wont find a safer place. Not much money to find a good neighborhood to move into.	I went out to the country to gaze at some stars.	Oh wow! I love stargazing! What did you see?"
"I was overwhelmed by the enormity of the universe.	I know how you feel, I think that's what makes it so great."
"My kids birthday was last weekend, my whole family showed up! they didn't even tell me they were coming	What did you do for the birthday?"
"Yea, i do. hah. They live a few states away, which is why it was so unexpected. don't see them often.	Oh wow. I didn't know you guys are divorced. I'm sorry to hear that."
"Bought two pairs of shoes recently.	How did that go?"
"Yeezy's, the worst part is the second pair of shoes were both right footed.	That's a bummer.  I bet you felt like you were going to be the only left footed person in the room."
"I read the instructions to set up my fit bit 100 times.	Why would you do that?"
"I need it to work perfectly I need to get ready for a marathon and I need it to track my progress.	That is a tough job. I am sure you will do great."
"I have a big speech to give.	Why is that?"
"Well I don't really know many of the people I will be in front of, so hopefully I don't stutter or something.	Oh no, I'm sure you will be fine. You will do great."
"I left my purse at in the seat in starbucks.	That is so frustrating. Did you call Starbucks?"
"I was in a safe neighborhood so i wasn't worried.	That is good. What did you do?"
"I was able to say the entire alphabet backwards.	I'm sure that was very satisfying."
"no time, I have a great memory, It was on a dare I nailed it perfectly.	I bet you did! What did you do?"
"I have been looking at pictures of crazy car crashes.	That's not good. Were you scared?"
"Seriously now I can't drive anywhere. I can't even leave the house for fear of car crashes.	That's terrible. I hope you get some help soon."
"I was at the mall yesterday. I sat down for a few minutes and when I looked away someone stole my shopping bags.	I'm sorry to hear that, what did you do?"
"No. I didn't notice right away. How could someone do that. Im so so mad!	I know right?  What did they do?"
"I was in a hospital and a guy game in with some really bad burns.	That's a little scary. Did you help him?"
"No idea, but I had never seen something like that in person. It looked painful.	I am sorry to hear that.  Is it a injury or some kind of sickness?"
"I saw a guy deadlift 700lbs at the gym the other day. I was in awe.	I can only imagine. What kind of gym is that?"
"Yeah it is, it seemed like he had every plate in the gym on the bar. I've never seen someone lift that much in person before.	That's amazing, I love to see people lift heavy."
"I got to go to a cat cafe when no one else was around!	Why did you go?"
"It was! I was the only one around so all the cats came to spend time with me	That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a lot of cats?"
"I walked out to my car theo ther day and felt something hit my face.	I'm sorry to hear that!  What happened?"
"A GIANT SPIDER! It was terrible and I was so startled!	I was so scared when I saw a spider in my house."
"When I can home, my cat was laying on the pile of laundry that I had pulled out of the dryer before work. Now it's covered in hair.	That's so gross! I would have been grossed out too!"
"Well it's pretty inconvenient, that's for sure. Nothing I can really do about it now. Just got to keep the door closed I guess.	I'm sorry to hear that. It's pretty frustrating when things go wrong."
"Today when I went into my roommate's office to fix the internet, I noticed the collar of his old cat that passed away. I miss her.	Oh my goodness! Did you have a cat?"
"Yeah, she wasn't my favorite cat, but I still miss her. Cancer sucks.	How did you lose her?"
"Sometimes an old song runs through my head and I remember the times where I used to listen to songs so many times that I memorized the words	I understand what you mean, it's like when we watch old movies and we can still remember the lines of the characters and the scenes."
"Like old kind of emo songs, full of angst and whatnot	I'm sorry, I didn't catch the reference."
"The other night when I was taking my dog out to go to the bathroom really late. I heard some rustling in the bushes and panicked.	Did you see anything?"
"Oh she was ready to fight whatever it was, but she was on a leash thankfully. No, I'm just really easily started, all that anxiety over an armadillo. Im so ashamed lol.	I don't think that's a good thing. I'm a little worried about you"
"I found an injured bird in my yard today, it was only a baby to!	That's so cool!  I hope it recovers.  I always feel bad when I see something like that."
"Yes, I had to call my local wildlife rescue center to come get it. I hope its okay, they said they think it has a broken wing.	That's a good thing, they are able to help it"

"No not at all! I'm excited because now I can plan a family vacation for this winter.	That is great! I hope you have a great time!"
"I have a deadline at work coming up.	What kind of deadline?"
"It is top-secret. But every time I try and get serious work done, my co-workers won't leave me alone.	I'm sorry to hear that. I can't imagine working in an environment where you're always being interrupted."
"My roommate has been gone all week. I don't have anything to do without him here.	That's a bummer. Are you going to try to get a new roommate?"
"It's just not the same doing something by myself. I don't have anyone to go do stuff with.	I understand that. Have you thought about joining a gym?"
"We just adopted a dog from the shelter last week and I think she is sick with parvo.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do to try and cure it?"
"It's a deadly dog illness, basically a virus that often leads to death. We think she caught it at the shelter.	That is so sad. Is she okay now?"
"Yes, they have to do a fecal sample and test it. We take her in tomorrow to see.	That is a very serious thing.  What kind of animal is it?"
"Thank you!	We are planning on going on a cruise in December!	Wow that sounds like a great time! Have you ever been on a cruise?"
"No, I went on one in highschool but first one with my husband and daughter. It's has been so fun planning it together!	That's so sweet! I bet it was a lot of fun!"
"I came home today and my roommate was cooking dinner, all i had to do was fix my plate. It was so nice.	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with your roommate.  What was the name?"
"I sure did, and the food was delicious. I'll have to surprise him with dinner next time.	That's great. What did you cook?"
"What kind of pizza place is it?	We are suppose to be having a bad storm this weekend.	Are you worried about it?"
"Yes, makes you wonder if its global warming. I have been stocking up on food and supplies. Ready for the worst.	I have been stocking up on food and supplies as well."
"My husband just got called back into work, was not expecting that!	That's great, I hope he is happy to be back to work."
"Someone stole some gear, so they called everyone back to investiage. We had just sat down to eat dinner to!	That's terrible. Did you find out who it was?"
"He is in the military so technically he can be called in 24/7 and is payed on salary!	I just prepared an amazing plate of mac and cheese.	I love mac and cheese! Did you make it yourself?"
"It is so good if you add the right amount of pepper.	Oh wow, you are a foodie?"
"I just bought a brand new necklace and shirt.	That's great! What brand are you wearing it from?"
"Not sure I just though it looked cool. Hopefully it gets me noticed.	It could be a great chance, try to make a good impression"
"My dog keeps having accidents in the house! I'm getting fustrated.	Oh no! How long has he been having accidents?"
"Thank you, I will. I think she is doing it to mark her territory, it started when we brought a new dog home.	That's funny. I bet the dog is scared of her."
"When I was promoted to Team Leader at work, I really felt like all my hard work had paid off, to some extent, and I gave myself a little pat on the back.	That's great.  You deserve it.  I'm sure you're very proud of yourself."
"Yes, and it can be difficult at times to move up at places, especially when there are many other long timers there!	Well I am sure you will do great!"
"I can't wait to go to the water park this weekend.	That sounds like a lot of fun.  Are you going with anyone?"
"Yes, my kids love it so they are going to be so happy when we get there.	That's great!  I hope you're going to a good destination!"
"I'm just laying in bed with a scented candle burning in my room and my cat on my lap, things couldn't be any better.	Oh that sounds really nice."
"Yeah my kitty is just purring away, we're having a good time watching youtube.	I love YouTube! How old is your kitty?"
"My mom sent my daughter a toy I played with when I was a child!	Oh that is so sweet!  I love toys from my childhood.  Did she get it at a garage sale?"
"Yes, it was neat to see her play with it. It'll make some great photos, since I have one of me playing with it at her age.	Wow, that's cool! Is she a singer?"
"Six months ago my boyfriend proposed to me and we are getting married next month. I can't wait	I am so happy for you! Congratulations!"
"On a honeymoon, lol? Not right away. He is totally the man of my dreams. I'm so lucky	You are lucky."
"My husband might loose his job, I'm not sure what we will do if he does.	What will you do if he loses his job?"
"The company is downsizing and cutting a lot of departments. His hasn't been cut yet but there are rumors!	I hope he doesn't get cut!"
"I found out my childhood cat passed away	Oh no.  I'm so sorry.  How did that happen?"
"I do too, it was so sad.	I am sorry. What happened?"
"My daughter is such a talented and creative young artist. When she was nominated to be 'Most Artistic' at school, I felt very secure she would win, because she really is amazing!	I bet she was thrilled when she won."
"She did! I know I'm the parent so can be biased, but it's really so impressive how well she draws, paints, shades....	How old is she?"
"I was very ready for my first car crash	Oh wow, did you get hurt?"
"I had all the paperwork set and ready, I had a blanket cause it was in the winter.	I bet you were excited.  It's always a good feeling to have all your papers in order."
"Last night a fly got into the bedroom and wouldn't stop trying to land on my face	I would be so annoyed. Did you try to catch it?"
"It was terrible! Right as I was about to fall asleep the dang thing would land on my nose!	That must have been so annoying!"
"I left my dog alone in the house when I went to get the mail. While I was gone she got in the cat box and ate the cat poop, super gross.	Oh no! I can't imagine being in that situation!"
"There was nothing to clean.... she definitely swallowed it. I stuck her outside cause I can't even think about dealing with her licking anything right now. Gives me the hebbie jibbes thinking about it.	I would be very annoyed."
"I have been practicing my speech for days now.	oh thats good, did you practice for a long time?"
"I have the perfect delivery and all the talking points drilled down. I will be impressive	That sounds like a great plan.  Are you looking forward to it?"
"My cat puked up a hairball this morning and I had to clean it up.	That is awful! How did you clean it up?"
"She pukes up hairballs every now and then I have some salmon flavored jelly i can feed her, but it happens so infrequently I forget to.	That sounds like a terrible thing to have to deal with."
"When I left the bathroom in high school once I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe.	Oh no!  That's gross!  What did you do?"
"Yeah it sure was, you know how mean teenagers can be. It's like they have no empathy or think about what if it was them.	I've been there."
"I got a new type of pizza I wanted to try	That's awesome, what kind was it?"
"A normal pepperoni but it was terrible!	Why was it terrible?"
"When I was in Costa Rica I was having a lot of trouble with the address of my AirBnB, I was so lost.	That is awful. I've had that happen before too."
"It was because my Spanish was a bit lacking, it also didn't help that people kept giving me bad directions. I eventually stumbled on it but for a while I was worried I would never make it there.	Wow, that is a long way to go, and it is difficult to travel that far. I hope you did not get lost."
"I was caught off guard when the gun fired for a race I was in	Why did it happen?"
"Yeah, I forgot to take my sweat pants off, that's when I realized running isn't for me	That's a bummer, but I'm sure you'll find something else you enjoy!"
"I slept with a new girl last week	Did you have any good dreams?"
"Not really	What's wrong?"
"Not really. We were very high. We were drunk. But now I feel bad for my partner	I was eating dinner with my husband last night and I was so happy	Oh that's great. Did you guys have a good time?"
"I whole heatedly agree! It was just so freeing and peaceful	What do you mean?"
"Someone came to my door with a gun the other day.	oh no, i hope you were safe"
"I called the police after he robbed me.	That's a bad thing to do. Did you get your money back?"
"No, thankfully, I'm fine but scared.	I left my food on the coffee table and my dog ate it.	That's terrible. Did he get in trouble?"
"No, she is fine. I had to find something else to eat though.	That's good! What happened?"
"I was trying to study for a test one night and my brother was listening to loud music	Oh no! Did you have to take a break?"
"I would have totally flipped the circuit breaker if I knew how, but I just asked him to turn it down	Oh yeah, I was in a class recently and a teacher had a huge explosion in his classroom."
"My dog tried to eat her poo	That is disgusting.  Is it safe to have her around again?"
"It probably will.	I hope so, what happened?"
"I borrowed a book from the library the other day but I left it outside	Oh no!  Did you find it?"
"Yes it did, unfortunately	Did you do something bad?"
"I got something nice the other day, chocolates from my husband	That's nice, do you like chocolates?"
"It was, and he does that type of thing a lot.	I'm sorry. That's a sad situation."
"I have problems with the city and their constant tax increase on my property.	That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that."
"Maybe A move out of my state would be the answer and a blessing to the high taxes.	Oh yeah. I've been thinking about that."
"I always do the same, it's not had when they are perfect.	What do you mean by that?"
"My girlfriend, How about you? do you have a partner?	Well, I do, but she's not very good at making me feel special.  I've been thinking of leaving her for a new one."
"Wow. Looks like you are doing a good job.	I close on my new house Monday, I didn't think I was going to be able to purchase it but I believed in my mortgage adviser	That is awesome. I have been trying to buy a house for years. What kind of house is it?"
"Surprisingly it's been a painless process. I'm very thankful.	I'm so glad you have a peaceful life. I'm so happy for you."
"I gave my friend some money that she said she would pay back but she hasn't yet.	That is not good. It seems like she has been taking it for a while now."
"I really thought  I could count on her, but now I haven't even heard a word from her. Lesson learned I guess.	That's really sad.  What happened?"
"I actually did this, i'm terrible.	That's okay. I've done things like that."
"I stole my mother's card details to pay for a subscription.	I'm sorry to hear that, are you going to get in trouble?"
"We are going to Six Flags this weekend and my kids want me to ride the roller coaster with them.	That sounds like fun. I wish I could ride the roller coaster with my kids."
"I'm really hesitant to get on. It's been a long time since I've ridden one and I don't think I'm going to like it at all	Well, I've always been a bit hesitant too.  I just know I'll like it once I get on."
"When i lost my dog of 12 years i was devastated...	What happened to him?"
"It is a horrible experience and i hope that i never have to go through it again, how did yours die?	I did not die, but I had a heart attack and almost died. I am still recovering."
"I think that in the past i have spent time caring about things that aren't important.	That's a good point. We all have those times where we want to focus on things that matter."
"Money mostly. I just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life.	I understand. It is a lot to have to worry about."
"I love thinking back to when I was growing up and the neighborhood we lived in. So many great memories.	That's so sweet. I'm glad you have such great memories."
"It really is. All the neighbors were so close, we even spent holidays together. It was like a really huge family all living together.	Oh that is so sweet. I bet it was fun."
"Do you watch any YouTube at all?	I do not, but I like to watch some videos on there sometimes."
"What type of content do you like watching?	I like watching action movies."
"The other night I wanted cake when I woke up in the middle of the night	Oh no!  That sounds terrible.  Did you go to the store?"
"The worst part was that there was a cake to be eaten! SO I DID! Lmao	Oh man! I love cake! Did you have a good time?"
"My husband was teaching me how to make a steak. The flame was so warm!	That sounds like fun.  What type of steak was it?"
"It was but I was so sad that I was so scared	That is terrible! What happened?"
"I looked at my childhood photos the other day. I remember alled the fun I used to ahve	That is cool. What was your favorite thing to do?"
"I do to. It was much easier then for me	Why is that?"
"I have to rely on my prayers and my belief in a high power to get me through not having a job and no money.	I bet that's a tough spot. I hope you are doing okay."
"I remind myself all the time that it will work out and all will be good again.	I'm sure it will be good again."
"I was very sad when I found out that my neighbors houses were going to be demolished because the city ordered it..	That's terrible. Did you have to move out of your house?"
"Nope. They bought them out at city valued tax prices and they have 60 days to find another place to live.	That's horrible.  What's going on in your city?"
"I feel off my bike the other day. it hurt.	Oh no! I'm so sorry! What happened?"
"A few scraps to my elbows but nothing major, i was just embarrassed.	Oh, that sounds pretty bad.  Did you get them on purpose?"

"great, I'm anticipating the release of Fallout:76 how about you?	Oh, yeah, I've heard about that.  Are you planning on playing it?"
"Isn't it annoying when your friends earn more money then you but you work just as hard.	I know, I'm not one of those friends.  I don't have the time or energy to do it either.  I just work hard and take care of myself."
"Very true. I suppose i just get a bit jealous sometimes.	I get that a lot. I think I'm just jealous of the fact that my brother is older."
"I exams went really well this year, How has your year gone?	I've been good. What subjects did you take?"
"Thanks, I am feeling a lot more confident in myself. Remember the year can only get better.	Oh, you're right, it's always a good time to start new projects."
"Had a good day today, i think i was prepared for everything. how has your day been?	I hope your day was as good as you think it was!"
"Well i had a meeting with my boss who gave me a promotion today so i'm over the moon!.	Oh wow, that's great news! Congratulations!"
"I got attacked by a swarm of bees a few months back. Needless to say it hurt.	Oh no, that's terrible. I hate bees."
"It was, they we're absolutely furious with me for some reason.	I am sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"Do you remember the old video games you used to play?	I do! I played a lot of those on my old Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo."
"The nostalgic moments when you play them again is brilliant. You should try it.	I have, and it's so good. I love it."
"Life seems to be going perfect right now, how about you?	I'm doing okay, but I think life is always good."
"Well that's even better news! i'm feeling hopeful for the both of us.	That's great!  I hope you both have a great day."
"A girl i went on two dates with wanted a copy of my house key, yikes!	That was nasty. Did you give it to her?"

"hah, thanks. So far so good.	My girlfriend forgot to order the Chinese food yesterday...	That's terrible. Did you go anyway?"
"Was annoyed and disappointed so i ended up having a sandwich instead. bad times.	Oh no! Did you have a reason for that?"
"My dog puked all over the carpet a few weeks back.	Oh no, that's not good. What did you do?"
"Was absolutely disgusting but luckily it did come out easy.	I love when that happens."
"The other night I found my cat laying dead in the side of the road	Oh no. Did you find out what happened?"
"It's tough. I was crying so hard that I had to call my husband to come pick us up	I am sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"My family dragged me along to visit an underground cave recently, I was pretty nervous.	That sounds creepy! I would have been terrified!"
"It was nice, after i got over the fear from being 23 stories underground.	Oh wow! That's a scary situation!"
"Hah, no i wasn't thinking of being trapped. It just seemed like more effort to breath for some reason.	Had a job interview the other day.	What was the job?"
"I think it went alright, i was incredibly anxious about it.	That's good to hear. What happened?"
"Ate my flatmates last chocolate bar earlier.	That's a bummer. I bet they are going to be mad."
"Nope, i do feel a bit guilty about it but they should have hid it better.	Why did they hide it?"
"I went bungie jumping with some friends but I was reluctant to jump.	I love bungie jumping.  Was it scary?"
"Yes, I don't like heights at all. I did eventually muster the courage to jump, however.	I think I would too.  It is a very scary thing to do."
"I always try to tell my kids they need to be kind and understanding to others, no matter what.	I agree, that is the most important lesson they will learn."
"They try but it's hard when there are so many bullies at school. I wish other parents would try to do the same.	I understand, it's hard to go through that"
"Do you know how much work goes into video games?	I do. I've played a lot of games that take hours to complete."
"I was really impressed as some games it can take over 10 years.	What games?"
"An old girlfriend contacted me looking for a one night stand, I had to decline.	I am sorry to hear that.  How do you feel about it?"
"Hah, they can be fun. Though my partner would not have appreciated it!	That's a funny thing.  I'm glad you are happy.  How long have you been together?"
"I went to a family reunion at my grandparents' house.	Oh that sounds like a lot of fun!"
"It was enjoyable for sure, and poignant too.  It brought up lots of memories of my childhood.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you have any close friends during that time?"
"I had a chance to sell my stake in ice juice for a nice little profit.	What is ice juice?"
"No, I want to keep it because I have faith in the company doing really well longterm.	I understand, but what company?"
"My daughter started kindergarten recently, i walked her in and met her teacher.	That's so exciting! What did you think of her?"
"Very nice, I just cant believe how grown up my little girl is getting.	What's her name?"
"6	I lent my brother 200 dollars so he could buy cryptokitties.	I am sure he will return it."
"I really couldn't tell you some kind of digital cat, he says he will pay me back, so hopefully it all works out.	That is good to hear. I hope you will get your cat back."
"Everyone wanted to go skydiving for my birthday.	How did that go?"
"I'm pretty sure that my greatest fear is my chute not releasing and plunging through the sky into the ground. Oh well you only live once.	I can see that.  It is a pretty scary thing."
"I didn't notice but I was walking around all day with a sock on my shirt!	Oh no, what happened?"
"On my back! I went to work like this!	Why did you go to work like that?"
"Someone decided to slash my car tires, key my car, and bash in my windshield.	Oh my gosh, that is so awful! What did you do?"
"Probably a spurned former lover. Glad I had insurance.	That's good! I'm glad you did"
"I have to give a speech at my fathers funeral. I drew the short straw.	Oh no!  I'm sure you will do fine.  I know how that is."
"Not really, I just needed to make sure that It goes off without a hitch. I don't want to embarrass my Mother.	That is very nice of you."
"I've been working at my same job for 12 years.	That is a long time.  Are you happy?"
"Yes I do.  Its a fun job.	That's great. What kind of job is it?"
"Yes I am a skydiving instructor so it is fun	I'm glad to hear that. I've never done it, but I have heard it is a lot of fun."
"Yes I love it	On a recent trip there was some bad weather that caused my flight to be delayed several hours. It was already late so i was afraid they would cancel the flight altogether.	That's unfortunate. Did they cancel the flight?"
"Yes! Thank goodness. They didn't cancel. I just got home much later than I had hoped.	That's good! I hope you were able to get home okay."
"Absolutely. I had too much to do the next day to not show up then.	I literally ate all you could eat at a chinese buffet	Oh man, I bet you felt bad afterwards!"
"I had to go home and lie down for the greatest nap of my life.	That sounds really relaxing. What time was it?"
"Recently went on a family vacation to an old spot we used to go when we were all younger. It was nice to see old stuff and talk about old times.	I love going on vacation with my family."
"Oh for sure. I'm always a sucker for nostalgia.	I love nostalgia. What did you do?"
"I love looking through them. I even find myself clicking back to my oldest pictures on facebook and reliving those times in my head.	One night during college I got a phone call in the middle of the night that one of my best friends had been killed in a car wreck.	That's really sad. Was it a car accident?"
"Absolutely. It was really the first time I had lost someone close to me, family or friend.	That must have been really tough. I'm sorry to hear that."
"My birthday was a few days ago, I can't believe my wife had the wait staff sing to me.	Oh wow!  That sounds like a pretty special day.  I bet it was a lot of fun!"
"Hah, its good entertainment, but i don't exactly enjoy being in the spotlight. Thanks!	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm a bit of a shy person myself."
"I recently got married and I'm so lucky to have found someone who enjoys doing the same things that I do.	That is wonderful.  What are you both doing together?"
"Thank you. It is nice. This is a second marriage for us both and I like that we are both happy with things just the way they are, no high expectations	I am happy for you both.  It is a great feeling when you are happy."
"I lost my wallet last week	Oh no! Did you lose it at a store?"
"My friend freaked out but I was pretty sure I left it at a restaurant and I trusted in my fellow humans to turn it in	That's pretty cool, how did it turn out?"
"Yes it was turned in - cash and credit cards all there	I recently had the opportunity to help out at my local Second Harvest food bank.	That's great. It's so nice to be able to help out those in need."
"It was great. I was with a good group of people too. We made it fun.	What was the fun?"
"For sure. I am happy I had the opportunity. Im sure I will do it again.	I'm happily married and employed, life is in a pretty good spot right now.	I am so happy for you!  I think it is always nice to have a stable life."
"For sure. I've had some unstable times in my life. I'm thankful to be where I am now.	I hope you're happy"
"Absolutely!	I love that!"
"Yesterday my car ran out of oil and broke down. I could not believe I would let such a thing happen!	That's so bad.  Did you have to replace it?"
"The engine is totally shot, its not designed to run without any. So now I have to go shopping for a new car.	That sucks, I hope you find something that works well for you."
"The new car is more expensive than a new engine. But I can't justify such a costly repair on my car.	That is so sad. I really hope you can afford it."
"It does drops a lot after a repair like that. I might as well invest that money into something new.	I was in a big party city and the street was crowded with people. As I was walking my foot got tangled up on something and I went face first into a huge flower bed.	Oh no! I am so sorry! I hope you are okay."
"It hurt my pride more than it hurt my face.	Why did it hurt you?"
"That is true. Plus it was a big party area so Im sure a lot of them drunk anyway.	That is true. I can imagine that."
"Literally anytime I order something online and I get the tracking I immediately start checking it. I am so impatient waiting on stuff to come.	I can relate. I've been on a few times too."
"Yes. Every single time. I know better. But I just cant help myself but to check over and over	That is really hard to do, I know."
"That is true.	My dog died of old age last year and I miss her	I am sorry to hear that, I know how that feels."
"Yes.  She was the most wonderful dog ever	I love dogs!  What kind of dog was she?"
"Laugh!  Yes dogs are far better creatures than humans	I'm gonna take the family out to the lake this weekend, we might rent a boat.	That sounds like fun! What do you like to do on the lake?"
"Maybe a pontoon boat, depends on what they have. Should be a nice way to unwind.	I would love to have a pontoon boat, but I don't think I can afford one."
"I have a friend with loaded parents. She doesn't work but has anything she wants anytime she wants.	Oh, that's so unfair. I bet she feels bad about it."
"Mine aren't poor but they aren't loaded. They struggle. Same for me. I work my butt of for what I have.	That is very admirable.  I am sure it is not easy."
"Same. I do wish I had a little bit more money to do a few more things though.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find ways to make more money."
"I had to do a lot of learning to knock out a big project at work. Finally finished and ready for another.	That's great! What kind of project was it?"
"For sure. It was a software coding project for a client. A lot of which I did not understand at the start.	I can imagine. Did you end up learning it?"
"Thank you. But now I have it ready for the next one.	what is next?"
"I have many health problems that require me to see many different speccialist	I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been to the hospital recently?"
"I am working towards that..I have been lucky to find some great doctors which I am able to put faith in because my life is essentially in their hands	That is a good feeling to have.  Are you in a good state of health?"
"I had a super stressful week and ended up cheating on my diet last night by eating pizza and cake.	Oh no, I hope you didn't feel guilty about it."
"Yes, otherwise I had stuck to it - but my weekly weigh in was this morning and I was up two pounds. I felt so irritated!!!!	That's terrible! I hope you're able to get back on track."
"I'm a bit nervous- I have an upcoming certification exam to take for my teaching license and it's a big deal.	I hope you do well!"
"I've been studying a WHOLE lot - so I think I'll do okay, but it's still making me feel nervous.	What are you studying?"
"There was a group project due and we had a meeting, but i missed it because it was my 21st birthday. wasnt my best day	I am sorry to hear that. You should have called or texted to tell them about it."
"yeah, but i learnt from it and also had a good birthday!	I'm glad you learned from it!"
"I have many health problems but I feel so lucky to have a great support system in my family	I'm glad you have a great support system. What are your health problems?"
"It really is!  It is wonderful to know how much they love me!	I am sure they do! You must feel very proud!"
"I was so sad when I had to put my dog down last year	Oh my goodness, that's so sad. I'm sorry. Did you find a good replacement?"
"She was 12.  It was old age but it was so hard because I had had her for years.	What happened to her?"
"I wanted to buy a new car, but I wasn't sure about buying the one I got.	I would have been the same way.  I would have wanted to know more about the car first."
"Yeah, it's been a good car so far, but most cars are pretty reliable at first.	That's true, I'm always looking for a car that will last."
"I have an amazing husband who is always there for me no matter what	That is very nice of him. How long have you been married?"
"He was my sisters, husbands roomate in college and he came down for their wedding and we met there.  I can't imagine my life without him	That is a nice story.  I have met a few roomates in college that I am close with."
"One time I went to my friends 16th birthday party.  When I was walking in her house I ran smack into their glass door.  It was so clean that I didn't see it.	That's hilarious.  Did you get in trouble?"
"LOL..just my pride.  I was mortified and the funny part is that later on I won the door prize	That is great!  I bet that was a fun experience!"
"My husband and I are planning a big trip to Washington,DC	Wow, that sounds exciting.  What are you going to do there?"
"I really want to go to the Smithsonian.  I love history and can't wait till we get to go	I've never been to one.  I'm interested in it, but I don't think I could go.  I don't have a lot of time.  What kind of things do they have there?"
"I have this knife that I carry everyday. My dad gave it to me before he died.	That's really cool. I bet you feel safe with it."
"It is, it's like he's always with me.	Did you find out who he was?"
"I have many health problems that have prevented me from having children	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  Are you looking for a replacement?"
"If I can get my health under control I would definetly look into that.  I use to be very sad everytime I saw people with their children but I have finally learned to be content in my situation	I totally get it, being a single parent is hard and it's amazing you've learned to be content!"
"I had a job interview that was very important to me once	What did you do to get ready for it?"
"yes, I prepared as best I could and I really felt that I aced it!  Sure enough I ended up getting the jon	Oh wow, congratulations on acing the job interview!  What job did you get?"
"I used to live out of my car and it made me feel pretty down on myself back then	That's really sad to hear."
"What types of situations? And yeah it could have been worse but I'm glad I'm out of it.	I'm glad you are out of it too. I'm sure you are doing well."
"Skydiving taught me how to let go and stop trying to fix everything	I've never been skydiving. I bet it's a really scary experience!"
"Yeah the hardest part for me was just realizing that I wouldn't be in control, but it was very natural in the end	I'm glad you made it through!  You must have been very strong."
"It's like something you have to figure out with your heart, kind of like how caterpillars have to stop trying to do a bunch of work so they can become butterflies	I ended up watching all the Robin William movies I could think of last weekend.	Oh, that's cool!  I love Robin Williams."
"I don't know if there is one of my favorites, but it sure was a lot of good memories.	I have been there. It is nice to have those memories."
"I was in a rush this morning and didn't realize I had put on two different colored sox.	What color sox were you wearing?"
"One was pink the other was green. I hope no one noticed.	How did you feel about it?"
"I have been working on my dance moves for the last 6 months.	That's great, I've been doing that for years."
"Well its for a dance off, so it's a pretty big deal I have to win this.	That sounds like a lot of fun, are you nervous?"
"This one time my pants fell down in public, but I was really tired so I didn't realize	That is pretty funny. I bet you felt so embarrassed."
"A couple minutes later	I don't know what you mean."
"Going in for an interview had me wondering what would happen	I hope you do well!"
"I decided not to take the job in the end, I guess I just wanted to know I could get it	That is a good thing. You should be happy."
"I appreciate the place where I started cuz it helps me keep going	That's great! I'm glad you have a good place to start."
"For sure, it reminds me that things are always getting better	I agree.  It's always good to look back on good times."
"I have been working on at the track to get my sprint times faster1	That's awesome. What kind of track is it?"
"No, just me, but my 100 yard dash is so so slow, I can't even get lower than 6 seconds.	Oh man, you must be a pretty speedy guy."
"I think I'm just really bad, maybe I will always be slow.	Oh I don't blame you!"
"Drinking a gallon of milk everyday makes me feel like an absolute madman in the gym who's gonna take over the world	Oh that sounds like a lot of milk!"
"That's not the point, gotta do it RAW	I understand. I would do the same thing."
"I had this juicy pump at the gym from doing some benching and it felt too easy	I have never done any weightlifting."
"My pecs were poppin	I am sure you were."
"I was hurrying around the house and wasn't paying attention fully, I ending up hitting my toe on my dogs toys.	oh no! that sounds terrible!"
"It really hurt, I think I may need to take all his toys away to punish him.	I am sorry to hear that, I hope you can get it together."
"I was at my main girls house and I saw these texts from this guy named Chad	That must have been creepy."
"Yeah, I demoted her to my dinner girl, now I gotta choose who my main ting is gonna be	That sounds like a rough situation."
"I got mad because I was too full to finish my plate at the buffet	That's bad, you should have stopped when you were hungry."
"Chinese, but no I decided not to, don't think would allow it	Why not?"
"I spent 20 dollars on a piece of cheese cake.	oh wow, that's a lot of money for a piece of cake."
"I thought it would blow my mind but it was dry and really disappointing. Talk about a let down.	That's terrible. What did you think it was supposed to be?"
"I have been working on my bench press for 6 months, I know I can get to bench 400 pounds.	I'm sure you will, you must be very dedicated to your training!"
"Steak and Maximum effort. I also drink lots of water, I'm on the next level like Arnold.	That sounds like a great workout routine!"
"Paranormal activity is the sCaRiEsT movie of horror movies	I have seen the movie. It is a horror movie."
"Yeah you'll have to show me sometime	I think I'm not ready for that yet"
"I just gave up smoking cigarettes. It was pretty hard, but the worst part is how everything puts you on edge and it is hard to relax.	I can understand that. Do you have any fun plans?"
"I closed my eyes and visualize a world where anything was possible. I called this world IMAGINATION land.	Sounds like a fun place to visit!"
"I was challenged to a dare by my best friend!	Oh wow! What was the dare?"
"No, the challenge was I had to spend the night in a cemetery. No flashlight no tents just a rolled up sleeping bag.	I would be terrified. What was it like?"
"I enjoy getting things done	I do too, what kind of things do you like to do?"
"I like to crochet and pay the bills	That is really nice."
"I was so satisfied with myself when I left the gym today	Did you do a lot of exercise?"
"Indeed, it was quite thrilling, did a little chest workout, got a nice pump	What kind of chest workout?"
"My cat puked all over my roommates shoes. I feel so bad.	That's awful. I would be so mad at them."
"I clean them up as best I could, and told him about it. Then I profusely apologized.	Oh wow.  I'm not sure how to react.  Was he angry?"
"I was really sick the other day and I let my roommate pick me up and carry me down the stairs.	Oh no! I hope you're feeling better now."
"I had an ovarian cyst, it hurt so bad. I almost went to the ER again.	Oh no.  Are you okay now?"
"I was going through my photos today and I saw a picture of me and my ex together. It just made me feel odd, I miss him.	Oh that is too bad. I hope things worked out for you."
"We broke up back in May, he was just too much of a workaholic.	I am sorry to hear that.  Have you started dating again?"
"I get pretty sad some nights, but it feels good to cry sometimes	That's okay. I'm here to listen."
"Yeah, sometimes it's like a deep sadness comes out of nowhere	What happened?"
"I had just been returning home, and on the side of the road there was some roadkill. It used to be a deer.	Oh no! Was it a human?"
"Yeah but my widows were down, and I could almost taste the stench of decay.	Did she pass away recently?"
"Sometimes it's impossible to shove more food down my gullet	I know the feeling. I can't eat anything."
"Nah, I'm trying to gain some pounds, I just haven't acclimated to the quantity yet	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I know it's not easy.  But I'm sure you'll get there eventually."
"I just watched JFK's speech, 'we will go to the moon' - reminds me of what I admire in the US	I love watching those documentaries about the history of the US, it's so fascinating!"
"It's really moving, wonder what the next big goal will be for humanity	I'm sure it is. It's always exciting to think about the possibilities."
"The litter of puppies had been born!	Wow, that's a lot of puppies!"
"All of the puppies survived, truly a lucky amazing occasion!	What kind of dogs?"
"I was totally caught off guard as a kid when the entire yard was covered in Easter eggs	That is funny. I have never done that."
"My dad, but he wouldn't admit it! haha	What did you do?"
"I was a little nervous to eat some cloves of garlic for the first time	I used to do that all the time.  It is not that bad.  It is good for you."
"I wasn't sure if it was going to make me sick or not	What did you eat?"
"I accidentally left a book I borrowed from a friend outside	Oh no!  Are you sure they didn't come back and say you left it?"
"I did but it was ruined from the rain.	Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that."
"I forgot to take some water bottles out from under my cart and pay for them at the store. I didn't realize I didn't pay for them till later.	That is no good.  I would be mad if I forgot to pay for something.  I hope you can make it up to them."
"Hopefully I don't get bad karma for my accidental theft!	Oh no! Did you steal from someone you know?"
"I attended a ball recently, one of the girls had the most stunning dress.	I would have loved to see it!"
"No way, her dress looked like little diamonds had been stitched on every inch of her dress. Not many girls can compete with that. Diamonds are forever.	That sounds pretty stunning.  I bet she was very happy with her appearance."
"I had to schedule an appointment with the dentist after not visiting one in five years.	Did you have a toothache?"
"I do not have insurance. I went anyway because I had a problem with one tooth.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you got it covered somehow."
"The internet has been there through thick and thin for me	That's great. I don't really have one."
"True, it's a great resource to have	How?"
"Seeing animals sleep is very relaxing	I know right. I love watching them do that."
"I don't know, I guess I'm just tired	What are you tired of?"
"My dog got hit by a car.	Wow! Did he survive?"
"Yeah. He didn't survive. I really miss him	That is so sad. Did you have him a lot?"
"I remember not having any responsibilities as a kid	That's great! You must have been very spoiled as a kid."
"Yea, those were the days	That's true, I was in high school when my first car was a 1985 Pontiac Firebird."
"I found an old photo album of my family. It really brought back memories.	Oh really? What memories did it bring back of?"
"It's kind of a bittersweet experience	What's bittersweet about it?"
"I had a tough semester but I just saw my grades and I'm pleased with the results.	That's great to hear! What grades did you get?"
"Yeah, it was a huge relief for me. I am so glad to be done with this semester.	That is good. Do you have any plans to get back to school?"
"I should not have been so quick to let my teen take the car, but she was so excited.	What happened?"
"Well, let me just say that the pole made it out alright,lol.	What did you do to the pole?"
"She is, and now my car has a very crude imitation of a red racing stripe down the side!	After a gym workout I'm always ready to get back and hit a new PR	That's awesome! I love going to the gym!"
"I think just knowing that one day I'll be able to do things that are unimaginable right now, and I know I can do better the next time	I can relate to that. It's amazing how much we can accomplish in our lifetime."
"My stomach made a loud noise while I was in class taking a test	That's annoying. Did you find out what it was?"
"I just pretended like nothing happened, but i'm worried everyone thinks it was something other than my stomach	Oh no, what happened?"
"I felt pretty good leaving the gym today, hit a new PR on overhead press	That's awesome! What weight were you lifting?"
"I like to try my hardest!	What do you try your hardest at?"
"I felt like I could do anything after I finished meditating	What did you do after?"
"I try to go longer everyday, I was able to go 50 minutes yesterday	I'm glad to hear that.  How many minutes a day?"
"I caught my boyfriend texting his ex	Oh no. That is not good."
"I think he will dump me soon. He would rather be with her, I just know it	What's going on with him?"
"My friend has been working with me on the weekends to get my tennis game on the next level.	Wow that's awesome.  I hope you both do well!"
"yeah I can consistently serve with power and accuracy now. I feel almost decent now.	That's great! It's always nice to feel like you can accomplish something."
"A while back I caught my partner at the time being dishonest to me.	Oh no, that must have been upsetting. What did they do?"
"We were together for a year and a half and we had a child together shortly before I found out!	That's so cool! What is your child's name?"
"High school was a great time, but those days are long gone	You have to be proud of yourself for making it through!"
"No bills to pay, going out to eat with friends all the time, pretty fun	I love going out to eat with friends!  How long have you been doing that?"
"Around 4 months ago, I had major surgery that caused me to be immobile for a few weeks.	I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you are recovering well."
"Well, I had lots of support from my family, but I felt afraid of getting back into the swing of things for fear of failing. I felt so vulnerable.	That is a good thing to feel.  It's nice to feel vulnerable and not be too confident."
"I love going to the gym because I feel stronger	I love going to the gym too.  I like to get a little sweaty and feel good about myself."
"Probably half a year, been the most consistent in my life, how about you?	I am consistent too but I am not sure if it is healthy to be so."
"It's tough to talk to my parents, but I try to talk about things we don't disagree on	I am sure they will appreciate that."
"Anything political or religious really, or relationships	I don't really have any, I'm just a dude."
"I had my dog for 13 years before she passed away last year from cancer. It was devastating!	I'm so sorry. That's terrible."
"Probably not for a while. She was a great companion, but I don't think my heart is ready to bring in a new dog quite yet.	You are right. I would be happy to have a dog."
"I was horribly wronged by someone I thought I could trust. The feeling was devastating, and I've always struggled with forgiveness.	That's awful! I'm sorry to hear that. Did you find out who it was?"
"They were dishonest and physically cruel. We have gone our separate ways, but I truly hope they can learn to treat others better.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope they learn from their mistakes."
"Last month I came home from work and noticed my cat wasn't feeling well, so I rushed her to the vet. I had to put her down.	That is so sad. I am sorry to hear that."
"I know, I just really miss her. Poor cancer kitty. I loved her so much.	That is so sad."
"MY roommate got a new cat last week, and we finally let them meet today. I was so nervous and worried about it.	That sounds fun! I'm sure they got along well."
"It went okay. My cat bopped him a little and growled a lot but no real swipes. So better than expected I guess.	That sounds like a pretty good day!"
"When I was pregnant with my first born, it was considered a high risk pregnancy. It made me very worried and anxious throughout.	I am sorry to hear that.  How was it?"
"I had to have emergency surgery in the end, but being able to hold my healthy baby was the greatest blessing I could have asked for.	Did you have a baby?"
"I'm so happy summer classes are officially over and I'll be able to relax for a week!	I agree, summer is the best. I have a vacation coming up and I'm so ready for it."
"I'm not even sure what to do with all this time! I guess I should relax or have some leisure time, but everything in me says to try and be productive even on break. It's that school mentality.	That is a good thing. You will be fine."
"My sister came to visit from out of state. It was the first time we've seen her in nearly a decade!	That's awesome! I'm sure you're happy to see her. How long has it been?"
"Yes she lives on the other side of the country. We had a nice dinner, but my boyfriend is a loud chewer and a sloppy eater. It was quite embarrassing!	I am sure it was.  What did you do?"
"I just bought a new dress and I can't wait to wear it this weekend.	Oh, that sounds really nice! What kind of dress?"
"I'm going to wear it to a party. Everyone will have their eyes on me!	That sounds fun!"
"A few months ago I could barely walk up a flight of stairs without having to catch my breath, but I bit the bullet and have been training.	What did you do to train?"
"Wonderful! It's definitely hard work, but I continue on, even on the days I don't want to. Today I discovered I can now comfortably run an uphill mile and I feel very confident!	What kind of workout did you do today?"
"My boss told me about a potential job opportunity and I've been waiting to hear if it's going to happen	I am glad that you have a job opportunity. What is the job opportunity?"
"A little bit. I am mostly excited about it though	Oh, what is it?"
"I was very prepared for my final exam. It was so easy.	Did you do well?"
"If I'm being honest, I made an answer key from the quizzes we took this semester. As they say, work smart, not hard.	I agree. But I think you made a mistake."
"My cousin was swinging recklessly on my hammock and ended up breaking it!	That's awful. Did you have to go to the hospital?"
"I was very upset, especially considering how long it took me to get it set up. I loved laying in my peaceful hammock to read.	That is so nice.  Did you have a hammock?"
"I received a phone call the other day from a friend I hadn't heard from in ages.	That's great. What did he say?"
"We reminisced about old times. It was very nice, indeed. It was nice hearing from him, especially during some rough times!	That's great.  Did you guys get to talk about old times?"
"I have a weekend of nothing but relaxation planned for this weekend.	Wow that sounds great! Where are you going?"
"I have some leftover roast in the fridge so I don't even have to leave the house. I'm going to watch a lot of netflix and MAYBE do a little laundry.	That is great!  Do you have any favorite shows?"
"I keep having these dreams that I am out in public and somehow my clothes disappear. It's awful.	That's so creepy! I hate when that happens too."
"I hate those dreams, I feel anything but free. They're really uncomfortable and make me nothing but a ball of negative emotions like anxiety as I spend the majority of the dream trying to find clothes and get away from people.	I don't like those dreams either. I would be very anxious."
"One of my friends recently bought a house. I really wish I could afford a house.	That's pretty cool. Do you know how much it cost?"
"I'm starting to feel like I will never be able to afford a house. They're just so expensive. And the market has been going up here about 5% a year for the past 10 years.	That is so true. It is a huge pain to pay rent on a house."
"I ended up staying at home for the holidays	Oh no, did you have a reason for that?"
"No all my family lives out of state. I didn't feel like traveling, but I just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark.	That sounds like a pretty boring day."
"I bumped into a friend from middle school. We chatted for a while	That is awesome!  Did you catch up on each other's lives?"
"Before 9th grade. I moved away that summer. Seeing her brought back a lot of good memories	I am sure it did!  I have moved a few times myself, but that one was tough."
"I had a doctors appointment at 9 am and they kept me waiting for almost 2 hours.	Oh no, that's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that."
"It was terrible I ended being late for work because of their horrible service.	Oh no, did they have a long line?"
"The past few months have been terribly rough, but I think I can say that they have made me stronger.	I'm glad to hear that. What have you been through?"
"Thank you. I hope that I can move forward and at least learn from these hardships.	I am happy for you!"
"I really hate when people can't hold themselves accountable for their own actions and decisions.	I agree.  I hate when people are lazy.  What are some common reasons for that?"
"Absolutely. Yet, these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you, even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.	It can be so hard to deal with."
"I received a very odd message today. It came from a person who I blocked online, but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group.	That is the worst. I hate when that happens. Did you tell them to leave you alone?"
"They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish, and it makes me very anxious.	That's really scary, what do you think they want?"
"I'm going rock climbing with some friends!	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I have done some climbing indoors for practice, but never done a big climb out doors, so who know how it will go.	Oh, you're going to do great!  How are you feeling?"
"I keep having these really weird nightmares at night.	Oh no. Are they scary?"
"I'm usually in a big city that I'm familiar with, and roam around in the dream until I get stalked, jumped, and sometimes very hurt.	I'm sorry you have to go through that."
"Today I was quite impressed with my endurance during my work out. A few months ago, I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath.	That is great, you must have been really exhausted!"
"I sure have, but it's such hard work. I make sure to work out, even on the days that I don't want to. It's definitely taken a lot of will power.	I am sure you do. It is really important to take care of yourself, especially if you want to have any children."
"I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.	I'm glad you are doing well. I'm a little jealous because my baby is still so small!"
"It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty, but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.	That's a good thing, it is hard to see your child born and to see them suffer."
"I just learned my first trick in ice skating, a triple spin twirl kick front flip.	Oh wow! That is quite a feat. I bet you are so proud of yourself."
"I never thought I would have the balance to perform such a feat. I think I can no qualify for the Olympics.	That's good. You should be proud of yourself."
"I just started college again, and while I'm doing great in school, it has lead me to feel very lonely with a lack of social life.	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends?"
"That sound like a good idea if they weren't online classes. Next semester I have a few on campus courses, so I'm hoping I'll be able to make at least one new friend.	I wish you the best of luck with that."
"This upcoming semester will be my first time taking 5 classes at once. I'm pretty worried that I may have taken on too much.	I know the feeling! I had to take 5 classes at the same time last semester and it was a nightmare. I'm sure you'll do well!"
"I'm not sure. The more I think about it, the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby, so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.	That can be a lot of stress.  I hope you are able to juggle it all."
"I adore my girlfriend. I am getting very serious about not leaving her side.	That's great! I'm glad to hear that you're thinking about her. What do you think you could do to keep her?"
"Thank you. Do you have a romantic interest?	I do. I'm going to be seeing him on Saturday."
"Summer in the South calls for many unwanted visitors of the insect type!	Are you talking about the mosquitoes?"
"Mosquitoes, and those dreadful flying ants. They're everywhere!	I have had to deal with them before.  They can be quite annoying."
"Lately I've felt proud of my success as a newly single mother. It gets lonely sometimes, but I can honestly say I've been doing everything I can and more.	Oh, that's great!  You must be very proud.  Are you going to college?"
"Thank you! I definitely have a drive to feel strong for them. I hope some day they can realize my efforts.	That's good to hear.  I hope they realize you too."
"I have a plethora of amazing friends. One of mine recently drove me from Georgia to South Florida	Oh that is so nice.  You must be so happy to be with them.  I am jealous."
"It is an 8 hour drive! Florida is a very long state	I agree. I live in the Midwest and I am not used to long drives."
"I recently totaled my car. There were no injuries but I feel absolutely terrible	Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  What are you going to do?"
"It was very wet and I took a turn at too high of a speed.	Oh no! Are you okay?"
"My mom and I haven't always had the best relationship. Recently I've had to tell myself to let her in more. It's been challenging.	I can understand that. I have had similar issues with my mom. I feel like I have to be more patient and understanding with her."
"Thank you. I know that, even though it's challenging, I need to be patient in order to improve our relationship.	I can only imagine how difficult that must be. I hope you are able to improve your relationship."
"I have had the toughest time getting my pet rat to get along with others. She's always been very aggressive!	That's not good.  What are you going to do to get her to get along?"
"She's never bitten anyone, thankfully, but she gets crazy with other rats. To my surprise though, I've recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!	That is so cool. What breed are you?"
"This past month, I was able to visit Six Flags!	That is so awesome! What did you do there?"
"It was amazing. The last time I was at an amusement park had to have been over a decade ago!	Oh my, how long ago was it?"
"The other day I noticed my pet has a growth on her lower belly. I fear it may be a tumor.	What did you do to try and figure it out?"
"She's a rat, so her body is very frail. I'm sad that she likely will not make it. She's been with me through thick and thin.	That is so sad. I have a dog that is 15 years old."
"I let the girl of my dreams slip away. Now I am alone.	Did she leave?"
"I hope so. I think that time heals all wounds.	I hope so too.  I am always looking forward to the future."
"I recently went to the pool and lost my suit. My trunks were in the water without me!	Oh no! I bet you felt awful. I hate when that happens."
"I was not, unfortunately. People saw everything!	Oh no! I hope you are okay."
"I let a romantic interest slip through my fingers. She's now with somebody that I despise	That's terrible. I'm sorry."
"I think so. I have plenty of time and life goes	I agree.  I like to think of it that way."
"I feel great right now. I have a new album coming out and it feels liberating to be done!	That's great! Are you going to tour?"
"I am very excited. It is almost an hour and a half long	Did you get to see a movie?"

"I think so too. There are some kind and great people in the world	I agree, I'm hoping to find a good friend"
"I went walking in the woods one night. It was pretty scary out there	That must have been terrifying. Did you see any strange things?"
"No, everything was fine, but it was a chilling experience	That's good! I'm glad you had a positive experience."
"I caught my dog trying to eat my nephew's dirty diaper that my brother left on the couch	Oh no! That's terrible! Did you get it?"
"It was really gross. I had to keep my dog from licking my face for a long time after that.	Wow that sounds nasty. Did you get him some meds?"
"I recently remembered a sweet memory of my aunt who recently passed away.	What a lovely memory.  I'm sorry for your loss."
"She would give hundreds of dollars of school supplies to kids in need each year.	That is really nice. What kind of school supplies did she give?"
"She did! I fill stockings around the holidays and go around on Christmas giving them out to people who have to work. :)	That is so kind of you. I do not do that."
"My daughter and her family are coming this Thanksgiving. I'm already preparing for their visit.	Did you have a big family Thanksgiving?"
"Not too much, just really exciting. I'm planning everything even though it's months away, even the menu.	I know, I'm so excited too."
"My mother in law was recently placed in hospice and is not expected to live much longer.	That is terrible.  I am so sorry to hear that.  Is there a family member or friend that will be taking care of her?"
"She's 87, so she has lived a long life, but she has Alzheimers, and it's really sad to watch her lose her mind.	That is so sad. I feel for her."
"That's a great way of looking at it. I should try to keep a positive attitude towards it.	That's a good way to approach things."
"I was driving home from out of town really late one night and was exhausted	Oh no, did you get any rest?"
"I did get home safe but it was scary because the roads were two lane and lots of 18-wheelers were heading in the opposite direction. I kept thinking I would swerve into their lane and collide into them	That is so scary! I hope you are alright."
"I've been trying to be extra supportive towards my husband.	That is so sweet.  Are you trying to help him out with something specific?"
"Yes - so true. His mom is dying, and he is working long hours on top of it. I feel really bad for him.	i bet that is very stressful for you."
"My friend who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit. She married a very wealthy man and I was a bit envious	Wow, that's interesting. What did you do during your visit?"
"She drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world. I wish that were me some days.	That's pretty cool. Do you want to be like her?"
"I was at a get together recently and a friend's husband was flirting with me.	Did you tell him to stop?"
"I didn't know what to say to her, and was afraid she wouldn't believe me and it would cause her to be angry at me. It's a bad situation.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that."
"When I was in second grade, I wet my pants in the middle of class.	Did everyone laugh at you?"
"I know! I was super afraid of my teacher, and was scared to ask her to go to the bathroom.	Oh, that's terrible. I'm sure you felt better after it was over."
"She was really mean and always yelling! I didn't want her to yell at me. I'm much older and wiser now!	I want to trick my butler into thinking he won the lottery. I've taped the local new's winning lottery numbers and I'm going to buy a ticket with the same numbers and give it to my butler	That is so cool! What are you going to do with your winnings?"
"I'm not sure he likes being the target of pranks, but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin	That's a pretty mean prank. I hope he doesn't get in trouble."
"My friend just took her kids to Disneyland and I feel a little bad about it.	I am sure they have a great time."
"I'd been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years. I'm happy for her- just wish it could have been me.	I can understand that, but are you sure you wouldn't be able to take them?"
"I won a trip to Washington D.C. a few years ago	Oh wow! Where did you go?"
"I had a blast. I met people from all over the country, visited many historical sites, and learned a lot about how government works	That sounds like a lot of fun. What a great experience!"
"I'm looking forward to my best friend's surprise birthday party next week!	That's awesome! What's the theme?"
"I'm really happy about it- she's a great friend and she's turning 40, so it's a big one!	That's awesome.  I'm sure you will celebrate it with a party."
"About 20 friends, surprising her at her favorite bar after work.	My 25th high school reunion is coming up and I'm excited.	I'm sure you're going to have a great time."
"Honestly? There was this girl who really treated me poorly - I can't wait for her to see how successful I have been!	That is sad, I hope she gets the help she needs."
"A hurricane hit my city. The first night I thought the wind was going to tear the roof off the house	Oh no, that's terrible.  What did you do to protect your house?"
"It was my third. Luckily we didn't lose power for more than a few hours	That's good. I'm glad that you didn't lose power for too long."
"It damaged the roof and the fence. We lost power for six days during the first hurricane I experienced	Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that."
"I am loyal to my principles, that is why I do not eat meat, because I love life	Oh that's so good.  I don't eat meat either.  Do you have a favorite type of meat?"
"If I already have 10 years of vegetarian	Aww, that's so nice! I'm trying to go vegetarian as well, but I don't know if I'll be able to stick to it."
"I healthy physically and spiritually	My daughter recently broke curfew by three hours!	Oh wow!  What happened?"
"I was super angry, yes! I ended up grounding her for three weeks- one week for each hour she was late.	How did you feel when you had to do that?"
"I have a certification exam coming up and I think I'll do well.	Oh really? That's great. How does that work?"
"I think so- I've studied quite a bit with my husband and others.	That's great. I am sure you will do well."
"Education- teaching license certification	Hello ... I confess that when I see my daughter's eyes, my heart suffers.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happens?"
"They are sick	that's bad, is it a serious illness?"
"Relax, they are things that happen	My new manager gave me a pay-rise!	Wow! Congrats! What did you do to deserve it?"
"I feel very grateful that he has been so generous.	I am so happy for you. How have you been doing lately?"
"My partner left me the other day.	oh no. what happened?"
"That's fine, its not your problem. i just feel very lonely right now.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What are you doing to try and make things better?"
"I just moved to a new city and I don't know anyone	Oh no! How long have you been there?"
"Yeah, it's hard though. I hate to go out by myself. It's hard for me to meet new people	I know how you feel, I have the same problem. I usually go to bars or meet up with friends."
"I took my final exams a few weeks ago and I was sure I had done well, but I failed.	What did you fail in?"
"I don't know what happened. I studied and passed everything else. Now I have to retake the class and I'm upset	Oh no, that's frustrating. Did you fail the class?"
"My sister kept playing a few seconds of a song over and over again on her laptop last night. Now it's stuck in my head.	Oh that's so annoying. I don't know how to get it out of my head."
"It drives me bonkers when she does that	I'm sorry, what do you mean?"
"I saw these 4-color Bic pens in the store the other day. I remember when I was young and getting one was like Christmas morning!	That sounds like so much fun. I remember getting a 10-er pack of pens. I used them all up."
"Yes! My mom used to always get me one each year before school started. Those were the coolest pens in the world!	Oh that is so sweet!  How old were you when that started?"
"I'm optimistic that my house is going to sell soon.	I hope so! What is the price on your house?"
"Only a week- and 17 people have seen it already, so I'm feeling good about it selling quickly!	That is a good feeling. I hope you get a lot of money for it."
"My best friend was going to travel from Wisconsin to see my this summer, but she ended up not being able to come.	That is disappointing.  What did you do to help her?"
"Nothing- I still haven't seen her. I felt pretty let down - but hopefully I can make the trip to see her soon.	I am sorry.  Are you sure you haven't seen her?"
"My sister threw up the other day and made a huge mess.	Oh no! Did she get in trouble?"

"I was livid when I went to work the other day and saw my car was broken in to	I am so sorry to hear that. Did they take your car?"

"Every year when the kids go back to school, it brings back so many memories of when my kids were going to school.	Oh, that's sad.  What were some of those memories?"
"I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly	I know how you feel, it was so long ago. I hope you have a great time with your grandkids."
"So everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints, and I ate the whole thing for breakfast.	I'm sure they were delicious!"
"LOL, I swear it was like I sat down and they were gone!  Probably gave myself diabetes. So not going to be able to eat the rest of the day!	Oh no! I hope you get some food soon!"
"Sigh, I have no self control, definatley need a veggie or two today now! Probably should knix those form the pantry	My father passed away in November, it's made me feel empty ever since.	Oh no, I'm so sorry. That is a terrible loss. I can imagine how you feel."

"I surprised my girlfriend with Chik-Fil-A breakfast this morning when she got off work.	Oh wow that is nice.  Did she enjoy it?"
"She works nights, and had no idea I was coming. I knew she had a bad night so I wanted to do something nice for her.	Oh that is nice of you! Did you do something nice?"
"I recently was laid off from my job. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm trying to stay positive that I will soon.	I'm sorry to hear that. But it's not always easy to find a new job. You are going to be fine."
"I keep looking and applying, but still here I sit. I know it will happen when the right one comes along though	That is true. You will get it when the time is right."
"I lost the book that my friend let me borrow. I feel so embarrassed.	That is a bummer.  Did you ask him for it back?"
"I'm trying to find a new one, but this one was rare and hard to find.	I know what you mean.  I have a few different guitars and they are all rares.  I have to keep them in the basement."
"My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.	Oh no! I'm sorry. That's not very considerate of them."
"I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.	What are they?"
"The older I get, the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling I have. It is nice to just enjoy being alive.	I agree. I used to be like that when I was young"

"I went swimming the other day and when I jump into the water and came back up, my bathing suit top was pulled over my breast and I was wandering why everyone was staring at me.	Oh, that's so embarrassing! Did you try to cover it up or just laugh it off?"
"Yes I did realize fairly fast why everyone was staring. I looked down and seen my breast exposed.	I would be shocked."
"I think my cat likes my new girlfriend more than he likes me now.	That is so sad. Did you try to get him to like you again?"
"Yea he loves to sit on my lap while i work, but prefers her side of the bed now when he sleeps.	Oh, that's so sweet.  I bet he loves your company!"
"My grandfather passed away not too long ago, i received a bunch of items he left for me.	That's nice of him. What did he leave you?"
"Some interesting antiques, grandfather clocks, and a lot of items related to his work for the house of representatives. Interesting stuff	Oh wow!  I love antiques.  I have a few!"
"I had to let my dad borrow my car the other day. His truck is in the shop.	Did you let him use it?"

"I ca not believe what happened the other night at my friends house, I'll never show my face again.	What happened?"
"Sure, I fell asleep on the chair and had a dream, in my dream I went to the restroom, so yeah, I peed right there in their chair.	That's a little gross."
"Yes, it was not fun, but good to know I am not the only one.	I enjoy helping the wildlife in my area where I live. I give them a helping hand. I give them water, birdseed, my left over food. The animals love watermelon and cantaloupe.	I don't have any pets, but I do have a garden that I tend to. I love watching the birds and squirrels in it."
"I just have the small non dangerous type of wildlife that I like to help Birds, rabbits, squirrels and such. No big bad bears!	That's great, I've always wanted to help wildlife, but I'm afraid of it."

"Its a long hair chihuahua and a short hair chihuahua. He has the most adorable under bite!	Oh wow. I'm not sure if I would want a chihuahua."
"I found out my wife was having an affair, the worst part is i knew the guy and welcomed him in my home and was kind to him.	That's terrible. I would be so angry and hurt."
"I'm learning to live my live without her, it's tough. Some honesty would have made the way it ended much better. Thanks for the kind words.	That's nice to hear, I'm glad to hear that you're learning and moving forward."
"I went on a soda fast for two days so that I could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking. I am addicted to soda so it was hard. I made it though and I was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days.	That's so good of you.  I hope your husband quit smoking."
"Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.	That's too bad. What was the cause of the headache?"
"No, they suck!!	I recently had an argument with a friend. Even though I talked ot her about it and let her know how I felt, my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband. She thought I was being two faced, which lead to a long discussion. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.	I am sorry to hear that.  How did it all work out?"
"Yeah, I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter, even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..	I am sure she will understand."
"That's good advice. Thanks!	I found huge box full of my old cd's recently, found a ton of old pc games i used to play, reminded me of a simpler time!	I'm glad you found that. I used to have a lot of old cd's."
"I did, i played a few sessions of age of empires and i plan to play some command and conquer red alert tonight before bed, still great games.	I haven't played either one. I love games like that, they are so much fun."
"I got turned down for a job I really wanted.	That sucks. What kind of job?"
"Thanks.  But yes, I was really dejected.  I thought I'd interviewed well and had a good enough resume.	That's the worst part.  I hope you get the job."
"When my wife left me, i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest, I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic	I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope you will get through this tough time."
"Well, Like the saying goes, get busy living or get busy dying. I'm not sure if i'll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!	That's good to hear. It's always good to have a plan and a plan is what's going to work best for you."
"I bought a 20 foot boat. I believe it will be able to handle the large lake that I will be taking it on.	That is a pretty big boat, I hope you enjoy it!"
"It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions.	That is a lot of money.  I would be shocked if you could afford it.  Did you buy it yourself?"
"It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy.	Oh, that's cool.  What kind of fishing do you like to do?"
"We should have a lot of fun this summer with it! Makes up for all the hard work saving up for it.	That sounds like fun.  What are you guys going to do?"
"I like like loaning money to friends. It can ruin friendships and sometimes doesn't get paid back.	I understand.  How long have you loaned money to friends?"
"Yeah, I meant don't like, sorry. I recently lent some to my friend with no expectation of getting it back because of her hard situation. I actually got it back.	That's awesome! I'm sure she's happy about it."
"Last summer, my dog went missing. We looked for him everywhere and called all of our neighbors. No one had seen him.	Oh no! I am so sorry. Did you find him?"
"After a week of looking for him and checking the shelters, a neighbor found his body under her house. He had gotten under there and couldn't find a way out. I was so heart broken and so were my daughters.	That is terrible. I am so sorry."
"I try to skateboard with my kids everyday. They love it, and it makes me feel young again.	I bet you feel great doing that."
"It can be scary some times, but its worth it.	I agree. I'm a little scared sometimes but I do enjoy it."
"My daughters 6th birthday was recently, unfortunately her mothers side of the family didn't show up, even though they all rsvp'd	Oh no!  I hope she didn't feel left out!"
"Hah yea, she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her. They grow up fast.	Oh, I'm sure they do. I always think that when my kids get older they'll be more upset."
"The other week, a friend of mine told me there was an opening where he worked and to get him a resume. I took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else.	That's terrible. Did you ask him what happened?"
"It would have been nice. Less pay, but I would have had to work less. Oh well, guess I'll try harder next time.	I'm sorry, but you shouldn't feel bad about it. It's just your job."
"The other day I was running late. So, I jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house.	That is always fun.  Did you run into anyone?"
"I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains. I apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes.	That's no good.  You should have checked the labels.  I would have been upset if I had found that."
"I have MS, and sometimes I have bowl problems.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you get better."
"No, I've tried science remedies. I like those kinds better.	I'm sorry, what kind of remedies?"

"No, his grandpa did. But, after he went to bed, I went outside and played with it for a while.	I hope he had a good time."
"Someone broke into my car the other day, but they didnt steal anything.	Oh wow that's scary! Did they leave any evidence?"
"I know! I feel both violated and kind of sad because I have nothing in my car worth stealing.	That is a pretty good thing, I bet you feel better knowing you have nothing of value in your car."
"There was an elderly lady at my church who was blind and could not hear well so you had to talk really loud for her to hear you. She was very faithful about coming to church so our preacher picked her up and took her home for every service. When she needed help, we took turns helping her.	That is very nice of you.  Did you know her well?"
"When I saw that she needed help, I always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker. I liked helping her. She recently passed away and I miss her.	Yeah, it can be tough when you see people around you that have been through pain."
"Yes, she loved everyone she met. She would say she couldn't remember everyone's names, but she loved them anyway.	I took my son to kindergarten the other day. He loves it so far!	That is great!  Is he having a good time?"
"You bet! He made a girlfriend on the bus by talking about Zelda.	Oh man that sounds so bad."
"Lately, my family and I have been very blessed. We are all happy and healthy. All of our major bills have already been paid for the month, and we have been going to a three week long revival at a local church.	Oh wow, that's great. I hope you have a good time."
"We have just been trusting in the Lord.	That's good. I'm glad to hear that."
"Thank you.	I was looking at some old pictures of my kids' first day of school from 4 years ago.	That must have been a good memory for you."
"It just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes.  My youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in 7th grade.	that's pretty cool, I bet he was excited to be in first grade.  I was in 6th grade and my sister was in 10th."
"And tons of pics!  I try to take pictures of everything.	I couldn't believe Aretha Franklin passed away last week.	I am sorry to hear that. I have heard she was a great singer."
"Sometimes you think people will be around forever, their aura is just so...legendary.	I know what you mean. I'm a little jealous of people who are still alive, but at the same time I'm happy that they're still with us."
"I just finished eating dinner.  We had red beans and rice and with sausage.  I'm as full as a tick!	That sounds delicious.  I love red beans and rice."
"I had to soak them for 3 hours.  I think that's what makes that meal so satisfying - the wait!	That sounds like a lot of time.  I can't imagine having to wait that long for a meal."
"I do the same thing!	Found out some bad news today about my kids custody case.	Oh no. What happened?"
"Yeah, it really is. Due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father.	That's terrible. Is it a child or an adult?"
"I think I aced my supervisor exam!	That is awesome. I bet you are proud."
"I should know something by tomorrow morning.  Hopefully they tell me right away.	That is good. I hope everything goes well."
"I have all my kids' things ready for the first day of school tomorrow!	Do you have everything you need?"
"I think I am.  I tried to do as much in advance as I could.	Well that's great. I hope you do well."
"My daughter is in 8th grade and just started school a little over a week ago. She is already being bullied.	Oh, that's terrible.  It's hard to deal with that, especially at such a young age.  Is there anyone she can talk to about it?"
"Yes, and will again because it didn't help. I try to cheer her up with hugs, goofy moments, and whatever else I can think of.	I'm sorry you are going through that. I hope she feels better soon."
"I had a chance to cheat on my wife once,	I would be upset if I were in your shoes."
"I did not. I left there quickly. It was not something I would ever want to do.	Did you get in trouble?"
"My dog got very sick and lay in bed for a couple weeks.  I was so concerned.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope your dog is now better."
"She did get better eventually.  During that time I tried to tend to her as much as I could.	That is good to hear.  Was she sick?"
"My roommate recently got a kitten, and he went out of town so I am watching over the little bugger.	I am sure it is a lot of fun to have a kitten around!"
"I love cats, I have one of my own. I haven't been around a kitten in forever so it's a real treat. I also don't have to sleep with the little brat at night either so it's especially great.	That is so nice. Do you have a cat name?"
"I had a solo competition last week for cello. I was well prepared and knew my music well. I felt great walking into that room.	That is great, it is always good to feel confident."
"I have been playing the cello for 5 years.	That's great. I have been playing the violin for 5 years and I love it."
"I slipped and feel at work the other day. Several people saw it. I wanted to just crawl in a hole and hide afterwards.	That sounds really scary. Did you tell anyone about it?"
"Just my pride	What's the pride?"
"My ex and I broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork, like 70 plus hours a week.	That is very bad. What was he going to do to make it work?"
"He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things turned out okay for you."
"My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it, we've been getting along great since we broke up.	That's always a good thing to hear. Did you tell him you didn't want to do that?"
"The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much. He decided he didn't want to leave after all and wants to keep working 70+ hour weeks every week.	That is so awful!  How do you feel about that?"
"I came home today and the food I had put in the crock pot was ruined. The outlet must have died and the food sat in there all day not cooking.	Wow. That's a bummer. Was it a gas or electric crock pot?"
"Yeah it was pretty terrible. I had to throw out a TON of food, and to add insult to injure I had to go eat out tonight.	Did you go to a restaurant?"
"I let my friend babysit my kid last week.	That is good.  How did it go?"
"Awesome. I usually have a hard time letting anyone watch my child but he had a great time with her.	That is great.  You must be a great parent."
"5	I am very happy for you. What happened?"
"I was out walking by the lake over the weekend and there shore was just covered in dead rotting fish.	Did you throw them away?"
"I don't know, that's what I would like to know! The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped, and they died. I imagine it was pollution.	That's horrible. Did you find out what happened?"
"I have a really big game coming up this weekend. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league.	I bet you will do great!  You have the potential to be a star."
"I just don't want to embarrass myself or my team. I'm so scared i'm going to make a fool of myself.	That's understandable. I know how that is."
"Several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches.	Oh no!  That's terrible.  Were you okay after the hospital?"
"I had to get 2 stitches in one of the holes and 1 stitch and all the other holes. He was a big dog, a little over 50 pounds.	That must have been a bit scary. Did you have to go to the hospital?"
"Last year I made a bet with my friend and he lost, so he had to buy me a Nintendo Switch. I was so great.	I bet you were! Did you enjoy it?"
"I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet, but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.	That's awesome! I bet that you won the bet!"
"I am visiting my friend this week.	Oh wow! I bet you are excited to go!"
"Yes, I mean I promised her I would  and some things came up but I know I gotta stick to my word and make this happen.	That is good. I am sure she will appreciate it."
"Oh I know I can't. She had lots of plans for us.	One time when I was little and playing hide and go seek, my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us. After a while I realized that we were going to be in trouble, and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way.	Oh my god, that is so scary! I can imagine how you felt"
"Yeah I guess they were, they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin, even though I was 7 and it was his idea.	That's terrible.  I would have been so upset if I was in that situation.  How did you deal with it?"
"So we are moving and I'm having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me. Thinking I should keep it.	I bet you did.  She would want you to have it.  It's a sentimental thing"
"Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.	I know what you mean! Sometimes you just can't let go of something or someone."
"One of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of 25.	That's amazing! I am so impressed."
"Yeah I know, I'm really amazed and proud of him. To be honest as proud as I am I can't help but to be a little jealous too lol.	Yeah, I know that feeling. I was like that with my son."
"I stayed at a friends house for the weekend a while back, and when I got home my bedroom was destroyed	Oh no! That's terrible. What happened?"
"My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it	I am sorry. I bet you felt bad."
"Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me, because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.	That's so sad. Did you have a good relationship?"
"I hope so, I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I just wish I had someone here with me right now.	What are you feeling miserable about?"
"My husband and I celebrated 9 years Saturday. It was such a good day of quality family time.	That is awesome! You must have been so happy!"
"Yes I love a good day of relaxation and family time :)	Oh really? What do you like to do?"
"Yes, dinner :)	I went to the zoo last month, I haven't been since I was a kid. I went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos, however I couldn't help but feel bad for the animals the whole time.	That is sad to hear. Did they have any shows or activities?"
"The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it.	Oh, I am sorry to hear that."
"I won an essay contest and I get to go to Washington DC for free!	Wow, that's awesome. What's the contest about?"
"I wrote about social security reform. Kinda boring stuff lol but it'll be fun to visit all the sites in DC	I can understand that. But I am not sure I would be interested in that stuff"
"We are moving. I'm so pumped for new adventures.	I am too! How long do you have to move?"
"Yes, a new state. I am just imagining all the fun things and new things we can do.	That's exciting, what state are you moving to?"
"When I was in middle school there was this boy that sat in front of me in 8th, he was always trying to get me to kiss him before class started.	Yeah, that's creepy.  What did you do?"
"No, the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.	Yeah that sounds pretty weird. What did you do?"
"I've been out of a job for a while but someone I know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field	That's great.  I hope you take it!"
"Statistics. I am going to help a real estate company build models to predict house values	I'm sure you'll do a great job."
"So a friend and I entered a drawing at the mall and she won. I wish I could say it doesn't sting a bit that she won.	I bet that did sting a bit. Did you ask her why she won?"
"A weekend trip to Gatlinburg. I would of loved that.	I've been to Gatlinburg a few times. I had a great time there."
"She is but she's taking her husband :)	I saw  man swallow a sword	That's quite a feat, is he a professional?"
"Yes I was. I thought it was pretty intense to watch	That is awesome, what was it?"
"I've been packing, packing, packing and cleaning.	That sounds like a lot of work! I bet it's not easy."
"Moving, not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.	I can understand that. I'm moving to a new city soon."
"Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.	Oh no, that is terrible. Did you have any damage?"
"Huge dent, I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.	That is so terrible, how much did it cost?"
"I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy.	Oh wow, what a great memory. How old is she now?"
"Oh man, I sure was. And she was so excited to get out of that box.	I think you might be thinking of a box of chocolates!"
"My brother isn't very good with money but i just lent him some	That's good of you."
"Yeah I don't do that often, but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time	That's good to hear. It sounds like you are a good person to have in your life."
"I just can't believe some people. I watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today.	Oh no, that's terrible. How did she look?"
"I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.	That is so unacceptable. Why did he do that?"
"So we are waiting on some news to move. I feel like it will be this week that we find out.	That sounds exciting! I hope it is good news."
"Not sure yet, waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.	I know, it can be frustrating, but at least you have a reason to wait."
"So I interviewed for my dream job last week and I didn't get it.	Oh no, what was the job?"
"I really hope so. I was really wanting that job.	What job is it?"
"So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.	Oh no, that must have been awful!"
"Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.	What was the thing they were doing?"
"I am so ready to find out where we are moving to.	I am excited for you! I have been waiting for the same thing for years!"
"I don't know where I want to go, just want to know where they are sending us :)	Well, you should ask your parents. They can help you out."
"A book I borrowed from the library got rained on and now it's destroyed	How terrible. Did you have it on a waterproof cover?"
"Yeah. I feel pretty bad about it.	That is no good. What happened?"
"I found my dog's old toy. It brought back memories of when I first got her	Are you sure that it was her?"
"I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog was she?	Yes, I am sorry to hear that. She was a Great Pyrenees."
"After months of job searching, I finally got a good offer	Oh wow, congratulations! What type of job is it?"
"I got a job in statistics	That's awesome! What kind of job is it?"
"I have a final exam that I've been studying for for days.	Oh, that's a bummer. Are you sure you're prepared?"
"I think I will do really well. I feel prepared for it.	That's great. What's the test?"
"I stupidly lent my car to a friend.	That's a bummer. What happened?"
"He got drunk and took it for a joyride. It didn't end well.	I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are okay."
"Even though I could've gotten more money at another job, I've stayed with my current employer. It is a good place to work.	That's good.  What is your job?"
"I work in public relations. I create campaigns for companies.	That's cool. I don't know much about public relations."
"I recently did a very successful one for a medical company.	That is awesome, what did you do to get there?"
"I just had a job interview that went really well. I'm expecting a call pretty soon.	Oh that's great! I hope it goes well!"
"It's a statistical analyst job.	I'm not sure I'd be interested in that."
"I recently moved to a new city. I left behind some good friends.	That can be sad. What city are you in now?"
"That's very true. It'll just take some time.	I am sure it will. You will be fine."
"Last week I was at the grocery store picking up body wash. There were so many to chose from, but I couldn't help but buy my trusted brand that has served me well for so many years.	That's so awesome. I know how hard it can be to find the right brand for us."
"Yes, why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well.	I agree, but sometimes you need to try something new to see what works best for you"
"I have to show some brand loyalty!	I have so much to do today, but it's raining. I'm OK with just staying at home and doing nothing.	That's the best way to spend a rainy day."
"It sucks. Maybe it'll be dry this weekend.	What is it dry?"
"My dog I had for five years just passed away. He was hit by a car last night.	That is so sad. I am so sorry."
"It is just so sad to have my loyal companion taken away like that.	That is terrible. Did they get put down?"
"His name was Han Solo, I am a huge Star Wars fan. My wife thought it was a dorky name, but I loved it.	I'm ready for hurricane season. I have my kit ready and everything.	Oh, that's so great. I hope you all get through it safely."
"South Alabama, near the Gulf.	Oh really?  What do you mean?"
"I have been sick the last week and my wife has made my chicken broth soup every day!	That's very kind of her, I hope you feel better soon."
"She is such a blessing to me and spoils me so much.	That is a good thing.  What does she do for you?"
"Yeah, I try to treat her the best I can, can't lose someone that amazing.	When I go out to a restaurant, I order gluten free food items.  I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not, my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.	I can understand that.  If you are in a restaurant, I would always be cautious about eating there."
"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	That sounds awful! I hope you get better soon."
"Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.	We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!	Oh wow, that's weird. Did you get them all the same color?"
"I was concerned they were the wrong drink order, we lined them up and talked to the server and together figured out the syrup bag must be going empty!	oh no!  that's terrible.  did you have to order more syrup?"
"While cleaning out our closets, I always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be.  Last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make ""jean purses"" out of someday.  My kid is 14 this week!!!	That's so cool! I love how you keep your childhood things."
"It definitely triggers some emotions!  Then I'm torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging.	I bet.  What did you do?"
"My wife made me pancakes for breakfast. I have a full belly and feel rather happy now.	That's great.  How many pancakes did she make?"
"One of my favorite breakfast foods. She also made some thick sliced bacon. She treats me so well.	That is nice.  What is your name?"
"For sure, no other woman I would rather have.	Did you find someone else?"
"How can I complain when she gets up early to make me such a great meal!	I'm sure you are very grateful for her!"
"I told my brother that I was planning to propose to my best friend, but I hope he keeps it a secret!	That is so sweet. I would be so happy if my brother kept it a secret."
"He lets things slip once in a while, but this is a pretty big secret so I have confidence in him.	That's good!  What's the secret?"
"I have a friend who is struggling right now in her business.  I'm trying hard to be there to support and cheer her on.	That's really nice of you. I'm sure she appreciates it."
"RIght? Even if I can't directly affect her business, I can help keep her spirits up to weather the storm!	I am happy to hear that!"
"I saw my neighbor bought the car I have always wanted. I wish I was in a a better financial position to buy one.	I would feel the same way.  Do you think you will ever be able to afford one?"
"Subaru Brat, best car ever made. Its like a car and a t ruck all in one.	I've never heard of that. Is it an old car?"
"I know, it would look perfect in front of my double wide mobile home! There is a used one on the corner for $350. But that will take me months to save up.	Oh, I'm sure it will be worth it! I've always wanted a mobile home."
"Yeah, or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big.	That's pretty good.  I love scratch offs."
"I am in the process of potty training my daughter, but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper. The other day, we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service.	Oh my gosh, that is crazy!"
"It was not one of our best moments. Luckily, she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.	That is good."
"I ordered a new toy for my son online for his birthday.	That is nice of you. Did he like it?"
"No, not yet. But, I can't wait to! He's going to have so much fun with it.	Oh, that sounds like fun! What's the surprise?"
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December. i can't wait!!!	That sounds so exciting!  I hope you have a great time!"
"I hope so too. I have wanted to go on a cruise for so long. I'm happy were are able to go this year.	I hope you have a great time."
"We are going with a few friends, so they booked it and we got a discount because they are returning customers.	My dad called me one day crying out for help. I had to drive over to his house.	That's nice of your dad."
"He had fallen and bruised his ribs. I had to take him to the hospital.	Oh no!  I hope he's okay.  I've had to take my kids to the hospital for that before."
"Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities, I have been in a rut lately. Last week, during revival, for the first few nights, everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit, but I couldn't for whatever reason, and it made me feel bad.	That can be tough. Did you feel like you missed out on something?"
"Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.	That is awesome! I have been praying a lot lately. I can't wait to go on vacation in a few weeks!"
"Thank you. He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.	Sometimes I wake up at night and eat junk food.	Oh, no! What kind?"
"Yeah but I feel bad afterwards. I like to make peanut butter and nutella sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies.	I love those!  Do you have a favorite type of cookie?"
"We had a birthday party for my son the other day!	Oh wow!  That is a lot of fun!  What did you do?"
"He's 6. It was so much fun to watch him open his presents.	I bet that was a great time."
"I was the captain of the volley ball team in middle school and high school, so I signed my daughters up to play. since they had an interest in it too. When we got the practice on the first day, the coach said that it was her first year coaching and she asked me if I would help a little.	That's so sweet of the coach. You must be a good teacher!"
"I was very excite to help. I miss playing very much, so being able to play with my daughters and show of my skills a little was great.	That's awesome! You must be a pretty good player."
"A couple years ago, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with MS.	That's not good, I hope you're not too scared."
"Yeah, I was blind in my right eye, and my left arm was numb.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope everything is okay."
"My friend has been sick a lot recently and I am worried about her.	I am sorry to hear that."
"Yes.  She has been vomiting and having diarhea a lot	That is very disturbing.  Is she getting the treatment she needs?"
"Yes.  It has just happened on and off for months.	I am sitting here chilling out with my cat on my lap.	That sounds like a very relaxing time. Is your cat a pretty cat?"
"Yes.  My cat is relaxing and always sleeping	That's nice. What kind of cat is it?"
"I had a job interview last week	That must have been stressful. Did you get the job?"
"I am not sure yet.  I was very nervous	Why?"
"Next week I think	I spent a weekend at a lake house all by myself.	Oh yea? Did you have fun?"
"It was fantastic.  I found it so restful and peaceful just to get away from it all for a while.	That is great, I love to get away from the stress."
"I had a get together recently, One of my friends brought someone who couldn't hold their liquor.	Oh no, that's terrible.  How did that go?"
"Heh, well they projectile vomited all over my carpet, it was gross.	Oh wow, that is disgusting."
"Me and my daughter went to the skate park the other day.	Oh, that sounds fun. What happened?"
"Yeah we did. She can ride up and down the ramps much better than I expected her to.	What kind of ride is it?"
"I've been out of work, and my dads been helping me financially.	That's really kind of him.  I'm sure you appreciate it."
"No, I am filing for disability. Theres no way I can ever repay him	What kind of disability?"
"I had to meet my new physical therapist this week.	Oh, did you have a good experience?"
"They seem ok. I just hate having to meet new doctors.	You're going to do fine! You are very smart."
"This is the first time ever that both of my kids have been in school.	That is a big accomplishment!  How are they doing?"
"Yeah, it's just too quiet lol.	I am sure you are not bored"
"Recently my family had a trip that was very disorganized. Basically drove a long way to hang see my family for a handful of hours.	Oh no, that's terrible. Did you get to see your family?"
"Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.	That sucks.  I can imagine.  I hope you have fun out there.  Do you have a family member you have to pick up?"
"That is true, I guess there is that to be thankful for.	I had to wait in line at the store the other day for 15 minutes!	Oh, I hate waiting in line!"
"Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.	I love that! I have to get one of those to make lunch."
"I had to go to my brother in laws funeral last week.	Oh no. What was it like?"
"I'm ok. It just hit me hard seeing all those sad people.	Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. Is it something specific?"
"I have some friends who are traveling all over Europe this summer	That sounds really cool.  What are they doing?"
"I am!  I would love to go myself.	I'm glad you're excited, I'm not."
"My and some old friends from college recently got together. It's always great to see those guys again.	That's always great to see your old friends again. I hope you guys had fun."
"Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.	That's sad. How many people are you talking about?"
"No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  It's always hard when we have to say goodbye to someone that we've been friends with for a long time."
"My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.	That's really disappointing.  What did she say she spent?"
"I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.	What did she lie about?"
"Oh, I've tried...	This weekend I saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color.	Oh no! What did she do?"
"No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.	I see. I have to agree, they are not nice people."
"No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.	I don't blame her. I wouldn't be like that either."
"I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently, but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.	That is unfortunate, it is great that you got to spend time with her though."
"We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.	I understand. Do you have to drive long distances?"
"The last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes, shoes, and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school. There first day was yesterday and it went well.	That's great! I hope the girls have a good year."
"I'm home with my toddler, so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.	Oh, that's awesome. I bet you were happy."
"Recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back.	Wow, that must have been quite a wait. Was it good news?"
"Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.	That's good to hear. Did you get the answer you were looking for?"
"My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.	That is very sad. I am sorry for your loss."
"It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.	That's a good point. It's hard to have a relationship when the other person isn't on the same page."
"Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.	Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends.	You must have some great memories"
"The memories are awesome and I miss playing.But I wouldn't trade the life I live now to go back,	I'm glad you have a great life now."
"I am going fishing at my favorite spot tomorrow. I know I am going to catch something!	Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! What kind of fish do you like to catch?"
"Blue catfish, they get so huge. I have a secret recipe for stink bait that works well!	I love stink bait! I'm so jealous of you!"
"Oh I will, fried catfish is so amazing. Especially beer battered!	I am going to play dominos tonight	I've never played dominoes. What are you playing for?"
"Well with some locals at the local brewpub	Oh? What happened?"
"Yes I think I will do well even though I just learned last week how to play!	my family came to visit recently, i always get so nervous about people visiting.	What made you nervous?"
"I have to make sure the house is clean and that everything is in order before they arrive, nerve wracking!	I know, it can be a bit stressful."
"I have a birthday coming up. I really hop I get the gift I am asking for.	That is good. I hope you get it!"
"Thank you, I am hoping for a new camera. It is about time to upgrade.	I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  I bought a new camera last year and it's been a great experience!"
"Thanks, I really enjoy getting out and photographing nature.	My dog go into the trash can and drug it all over the house. I am so mad right now!	That is terrible! I hate when dogs do that."
"I know, it is going to take me all evening to clean up!	What did you do to make a mess?"
"He is usually good, but this time his naughtiness got to him.	I am going camping this weekend. I got my tent, sleeping bag and tons of food. I think I have everything I need!	That sounds like a great weekend! I hope you have a good time."
"Oh I will, I am ready for whatever the elements throw at me!	That's really cool. I like that."
"It will be a blast, I just love roughing it in the outdoors!	The other night i heard a sound like someone was breaking in my house, i was pretty scared.	Oh that's scary.  Did you call the police?"
"No, it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating.	Oh, that is annoying, did it take long to get back up and running?"
"It has been raining a lot lately, I am really trusting the seal on our doors to keep the water out.	That's a good idea.  I'm not sure about the seal on our doors."
"I know, it really starts too pool up by our house. It is getting kind of scary!	What is happening?"
"Yeah, really don't want to deal with a flooded home! Would not be good for my family.	I bought a cake from the store and it ended up tasting terrible.	Oh no! I bet you were so disappointed! Did you try it?"
"No, I ended up just suffering through it and eating it.	That's a great way to handle it."
"Yeah, I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me.	I was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently, I bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better.	I bet you felt a lot better about it! I have been there before."
"Yea, it made me feel better about myself and my chances, or maybe i just like spending money	I know what you mean.  It's hard to feel good about money when it's just sitting there."
"I love chocolate cookies because my grams would always make them for me.	That's nice. Do you still get cookies from her?"
"Nothing beats cookies made by grandma. Except for the oatmeal ones. Too healthy haha.	I love oatmeal cookies too. I have a grandma who makes them for me all the time."
"Only if it has raisins to sweeten them up!	I found an old picture of when my oldest daughter started kindergarten 11 years ago.	That's awesome.  I bet it was fun to look back on that.  What was she like?"
"It is!  In it, she's just standing with a huge smile on her face and a Hello Kitty backpack.	That's awesome, I'm happy for you!"
"I've been teaching my young daughter to play video games with me, she's such a quick learner.	I bet she's a great player!"
"Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them, It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence.	I love the way kids can learn so much at a young age."
"It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.	I have never heard of it. I am sorry to hear that."
"I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!	That's awesome!  Are you a big fan of the brand?"
"Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!	I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.	That's awesome! Congratulations.  What was your position?"
"It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!	That's great!  What will you be doing as the manager?"
"I try to.  But I'm glad all the effort is being recognized!	I put in to get a promotion at work, and I should know something either way by tomorrow.	That sounds exciting. What kind of promotion are you looking for?"
"On the one hand, I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.	That's good. Sometimes you can't control things."
"I work for a medical supply company.	That's pretty cool.  What kind of work do you do?"
"Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.	That is terrible. I am so angry."
"I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!	That's a good point. I didn't think about the animals."
"Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.	When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup	Aww that's nice. I bet you were happy!"
"So good, genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!	Wow that sounds like fun! I bet it was a great experience for you."
"But yeah - school started for the kids today and it was weird how quiet it was once the bus pulled away.	Oh, I remember that! I was at school for a few years and it was like that too."
"It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.	That's a nice way to look at it.  I'm sure you'll be back in touch with them soon.  How old are they?"
"Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!	I know what you mean!  My kids are both 19 now.  It's crazy how fast they grow up!"
"I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years, after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!	That sounds really gross! I hate cleaning stuff like that."
"Yes indeed, there was even a frog under there! So bizarre!	That is a pretty weird thing to see.  Did you try to get closer to it?"
"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	That is horrible. I would not be able to do such a thing."
"Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.	I agree with you. I have seen some of the animals that are being raised at the farm, and they are not treated well.  I think it should be illegal to treat animals like that."
"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	I agree. I've been volunteering at an animal shelter for a few years now."
"And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!	That is a very harsh view."
"My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.	Oh, that's great! I bet he will do well!"
"I am, too!  I'm glad he's doing something he loves.  At this point, I'm just waiting on the text to see which team he made it onto.	That's great! I hope you guys have a lot of fun!"
"I'm so glad the kids went back to school today!	That's great. I have two myself."
"Yes!  I can go back to having ice cream for breakfast!  I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the, ""Mom, you always watch this!"" comment!	That's awesome! I love watching law and order too!"
"How old are they?	I don't know. I don't know anyone over 80."
"Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL	My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.	Oh no!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you going to go on vacation?"
"On the one hand, I hope so but on the other hand, I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD	I feel you. I hate days like this."
"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	Oh no! How did you react?"
"He was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me, the neighbor finally came out and called him home. was intense.	I bet it was. I would have been mad too."
"The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.	Oh no, I'm so sorry. I hope you found comfort in knowing that the kitten was safe with you."
"She was under my house, crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.	That is terrible.  I am sorry to hear that.  I hope she was a good kid."
"And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad, but I take comfort in those things.	My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked. A few days later she was playing no problem!	Did you help her?"
"Yea, i was pretty proud of her, especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid.	That's good.  She is lucky to have a good parent."
"I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that!"
"I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!	That's a good thing to do.  Do you have a lot of receipts?"
"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	That is nice of her. Did you have a lot of debts to pay off?"
"Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.	I'm glad to hear that.  I hope she is happy.  I feel for you"
"When my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy	I'm sorry to hear that."
"hah, i hear ya. I just got so used to all the commotion i suppose.	Oh, well, I guess that's what you get when you grow up in a big city."
"When we were kids, my sister and i once stole a blank check from our mom to order a pizza, we got caught.	Oh my, that is hilarious. I bet you both were so embarrassed."
"My mom noticed the charge and found a the missing check from her checkbook, i'll never forget the look of dissapointment on her face!	That's awful.  How did she react?"
"Oh yea. grounded for a long time.	I just saw a movie I had been looking forward to and it was terrible	Oh, I'm sorry. What movie was it?"
"It was the new Jurassic World	What happened?"
"My coworker forgot to turn in the paperwork to switch our on call weeks. He ended up costing me $250! I'm so mad!!!	That's awful.  Did you talk to him about it?"
"He's such a worm. I can't stand it.	I hate it when people like that."
"Working from home can be difficult when people won't leave me alone to get work done.	I hear you. I'm so tired of it."
"I love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video, gonna pull my hair out.	I know the feeling! What are you gonna do?"
"I have a big date coming up and I can't get these butterfly feelings to go away.	I bet you are excited!"
"Yeah, I really think she might be the one. I hope I don't screw it up.	Oh yeah? What's wrong with it?"
"Thank you, I am looking forward to taking her to a nice place to eat!	I bit into an apple and found a worm. It was so gross.	That is gross!"
"Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple.	That's the problem with apples."
"That is true, I should be thankful for that.	I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs.	That must have been scary. What did you do?"
"They really startled me, the female did not seem happy to see me.	That's terrible! Was she scared?"
"Yeah, thankfully I was able to get away. It took a while for me to catch my breath.	I got a new dog recently, he is the best. I am so thankful for him!	That's great! I have a few dogs myself."
"He is a male australian shepherd. His name is charlie, he is super cute!	I love dogs!  What a sweet boy!  Is he a rescue?"
"Will do! He is super cuddly and loves to follow me around!	There was one piece of pie left in the fridge. Instead of sharing it, I ate it. I kind of feel bad.	That's not cool. Did you eat it at lunch?"
"It might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone. I look super guilty right now.	That is terrible.  I hope she finds it."
"I could, I might have to buy her some of her favorite chocolate.	I was at the park today and almost stepped on a rattle snake. I almost jumped out of my skin.	Oh no! That's terrifying!"
"Me too, that would of wrecked my day. It was so close! It haunts my thoughts even now.	I'm sorry to hear that, do you have a good day now?"
"It might take me a little while to get over my fear and go back to the park.	Oh no!  What's making you afraid?"
"For sure, wouldn't want to relive that experience	I just got a bonus from my job. That money came at the perfect time!	That's awesome! What kind of job do you have?"
"It was a really nice bonus too, they were impressed with the quality of work I have done this year.	That's great to hear. What kind of job do you do?"
"Now I will have to work even harder and try to earn a larger one next year.	I was going to go to the movies with a bunch of friends. But they all bailed on me and now I have to go alone.	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan for the movie?"
"I hope so, but I am really missing them right now. I didn't want to go alone.	That sounds terrible.  What do you miss the most?"
"It is hard to find reliable friends. No one seems to show up anymore.	I was out photographing butterflies and took the most incredible photo. I am really happy with how it turned out!	That's great. I love taking pictures of butterflies."
"The butterfly was yellow. It was a tiger swallowtail. One of my favorites!	I bet you were very happy to see it."
"I saw my dog try to eat a dirty diaper one time	That's so gross! Did your dog die?"
"Yeah, it's nasty. I wouldn't let her lick my face for a while after that.	Oh no! What happened?"
"I was trying to take a nap, but my cat kept on trying to play with my head.	I know right? Cats can be the worst."
"I usually love mine, but not when it is keeping me from sleeping	I guess it's not fun at night"
"I just had a job interview and I'm waiting to hear if I got the job.	That's awesome! I hope you get it!"
"Me too. I'm feeling pretty nervous about it	that is to be expected"
"I was on a plane ride and we went through some pretty severe turbulence	Oh my, that's scary! What happened?"
"Yes it was. I was so afraid we'd crash	Why was that?"
"My cousin and I tricked my butler into thinking he won millions in the lottery. I feel so bad.	I'm sorry.  I hope he didn't get too upset."
"Only a few minutes.	I'm sorry, what happened?"
"Someone came to my door with a gun, asking for money	Oh my god, that's awful.  Are you ok?"
"I didn't have any. He came into the house and stole some stuff	That's terrible. You should report it to the police."
"Our cat had to many health problems, so we had to put him down.	Oh no. I am sorry to hear that."
"I had him for 17 years, he lived a full and happy life, but I was not ready for him to go.	That is so sad. I am sorry to hear that."
"But they make your life so much enjoyable while they are around!	I went to do karaoke with a guy i'm dating and I discovered he's a really talented singer	That's great! I love karaoke."
"He's kind of shy about it. He had to get really drunk to perform karaoke	That's a pretty good way to get a feel for the crowd."
"I had to do a research project and present it to my professors to graduate. Thankfully I passed!	Well that is great. It takes a lot of work to do that."
"I worked many long hours. It was stressful but I'm happy to have done well	I bet you were. I don't work long hours."
"My sister has been playing a song I dislike over and over and over	That's annoying. What song is it?"
"She does it more because she likes it than to bug me. It's going to be stuck in my head for weeks	What is it?"
"okay.	what is going on?"
"That is great! What will you be doing there?	I am going on a cruise!"
"I accidentally slapped someone in the face while I was playing basketball.	That's pretty bad. What happened?"
"No, I think she was just a little shocked by it. I felt so bad.	What happened?"
"I let my friend borrow my car. He's an international student and only has a permit.	Oh no! Did you give him a car insurance card?"
"I was in the car with him. He just wanted to practice driving and he didn't have his own car.	That's very nice of him, he should have asked you if he could practice driving"
"I am at a cross road. I am trying to decide my major in college.	I am sure you will find the right one for you. What are you thinking of majoring in?"
"I was thinking about graphic design. Or, I was going to do something practical like Nursing.	What's your passion?"
"I guess you are right. I really like sketching and painting. I can use my creativity side.	I've been trying to save money so that I can help my husband with the Christmas shopping this year.	I love Christmas!"
"Well at first I was a little discouraged because I wasn't making that much. Things have picked up recently though, and I feel I will be able to help him a good bit so I'm feeling better about it.	That's good to hear.  I'm sure you'll be able to help him out.  You're a good person."
"I had planned to take my daughter shopping a few weeks ago. We were all really excited, but the plans fell through.	That's a bummer. I hate when that happens."
"Yes. We were able to go about a week later, but the closer it got to school starting back I started to stress. Everything is good now though.	That's good. What did you do?"
"I check in with my partner to see if we are okay. I ask him if there is anything that we can work on to make the relationship better.	I am glad to hear that you are looking to work on your relationship."
"I don't want to have problems. This is why I check in with him.	That is good."
"When I go out with friends I really have to be tight with my money. Times are really hard for me financially?	I know how that is. I have to be careful with my money too."
"I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much. I sometimes like to leave a tip if possible.	I do the same thing.  I like to keep my money tight"
"I find it appalling how my husband's family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away.	I'm sorry.  I bet that makes you upset."
"Yes, it is. They are all being really selfish and childish. My husband is staying out of it, but I can tell that he is getting fed up with it.	I am sorry to hear that.  Have you talked to him about it?"
"I have to run several errands for my father-in-law today and he wants them done before my mother-in-law get into town, which is at some unspecified time today.	Oh, that's no good. I hope you can get them done!"
"Yeah, I'm ready to get everything done so I can relax. I can't start on the errands until I drop the kids at school though.	Oh, I see.  I'm not sure I could do that.  I'm pretty lazy.  I have to be at work by 5:00.  I have to get all of my work done by 5:00.  I have to get all of my work done by 5:00."
"I really do miss my mother. She has been dead for about 15 years now.	What happened to her?"
"It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.	That's interesting. I've never thought about it that way before."
"Yes, it is. I know that time heals.	I know it does!  I am glad to hear that it is."
"My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings. So, I would have to let go and let them fly.	That is sad. Do you have any plans for them?"
"I have 23, 20, 17 and 14. They are doing stuff that I question but I don't want them to not tell me stuff.	I'm sure they're just trying to get more money out of you."
"When I was in labor with my third child, they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital. The nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor. In the 2 minutes it took for him to get to my room, my heart dropped and I started to panic. He told me that the baby's heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency C-section right then.	That is very scary. I am sorry."
"Yes, everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.  That sounds like a scary time."
"Yes, they do. I ope your boy is all good now.	I finally beat level 150 on the crucible today in my favorite game Grim Dawn.	That is really cool. What game is it?"
"PC all the way. I've been grinding devotion points all week.	What is devotion?"
"I just found a hello kitty pot in my daughters room filled with water and old flowers.	oh wow, i would have been mad"
"It's not cute, and she's nine. By old flowers I mean, it's a green, stagnant slush with mold growing on top.	That's not cute at all. What did you do about it?"
"When I enter the bus, I fainted. I think that I got overheated.	I hope you are alright"
"Yes I did. It was so hot outside and I did not have much to drink.	I'm sure you were thirsty"
"I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends	I'm sure it was not a good time.  Did you get a little embarrassed?"
"I fell down, and apparently said some embarrassing things.	Oh no, did you get in trouble?"
"My daughter is graduating from college. I cannot wait until she finish.	I am happy for her. I am sure she is going to do great things."
"Yes, I will. She has been under a lot of stress.	That's so good to hear! I hope she feels better soon!"
"Two years ago I got diagnosed with MS.	That is not good.  I am sorry to hear that.  Is it the only one?"
"Its a disease that attacks the nervous system. It was really scary to find out I had it. I just went blind in my right eye one day. Two days and several test later I found out I had MS.	That is really bad.  I have a friend who has MS.  He has a lot of trouble walking and has gotten very sick."
"I found out that my daughter is moving out. My youngest one told me so.	Oh no! How old is she?"
"I feel really sad because I felt she should have told me.	I am sorry to hear that.  Is it someone you care about?"
"I let my sister borrow my car. She is a new driver.	Did she drive it safely?"
"Well, nothing. I'm sure that she will be a responsible driver.	That's good. She's a good driver, right?"
"I think that I will do good on my test.	What test are you taking?"
"It is tonight. I studied really hard.	Wow, you must be ready for the test."
"I heard a song that I hadn't heard in awhile. It reminded me of my high school days	I love that. What song was it?"
"Yes, it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when I was young.	That's great. What made you feel nostalgic?"
"My dad dies when I was 33 years old.	That is terrible.  Did you have any family members left?"
"Thank you. I was crushed, and it left me with questions about my own mortality.	That is terrible, I'm sorry to hear that, but I hope you find peace."
"My mother fell and injured herself. I wanted help and comfort her in any way possible.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she's okay."
"Yes, but bhe bruised her wrist, and had a concussion. I wish that I was there for her when it happened.	I'm sorry to hear that, I hope she is okay now."
"I had a nice meal and my favorite beverage after work	That sounds great. Did you have a nice dinner?"
"It was a skirt steak with avocados. I was very satisfied.	Oh yea? What is it?"
"When I started a new job. I was nervous about proving myself all over again.	That's a good attitude to have."
"I did, but I find it hard to trust people. Especially at work.	That can be tough. Do you think you will ever trust someone again?"
"I am trying to quit drinking soda and I have prayed to God and asked Him to help me. The problem is I am addicted to soda and Its very hard to quit. When I do manage to skip a day, the lack of caffeine causes horrible headaches.	I am glad you are trying.  I know it is hard but you will get there.  I started quitting drinking soda and it is easier than you think."
"It just makes me feel bad, that no matter how many times I try, I still give in to the temptation.	That is a very honest admission. What do you do when you give in?"
"Yeah, I think that's what I will have to do. Thanks for the advice.	I went on a job interview. I'm anxiously waiting to hear if I got the job.	I hope you got it.  What is the job?"
"I still need wait another week.	Oh no, I hope it doesn't take too long."
"A drafter.	I just went to clean my kids sink a few minutes ago. I found a bunch of toys in the catch and I am mad.	Oh no! I hope you can find them all!"
"Yeah, all the toys are out. But, they got some explaining to do after school.	That's a bummer. It's hard to explain to kids."
"I couldn't sleep last night. I ended up staying up till 2am and eating a large amount of Shepard's pie.	I bet you felt good about it, you deserve it!"
"Combination of stress and new meds I think. Maybe I can get back to my old scheduled soon.	Oh that is bad.  What is going on?"
"I saw my crush talking to another guy.	That's so sad. Did you try to talk to them?"
"I was a little upset, but it wasn't my business. I let it go.	Oh, that's so cool. What happened?"
"When I went to the store the other day, I seen a guy all tweaked out on drugs.	oh man that must have been very scary."
"No, but he seemed a little unpredictable, so I used the other door.	Oh, I see, did he seem to have any issues with it?"
"Holding each of my children for the first time was amazing.	That sounds so special. What were you holding?"
"Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.	I agree.  I was in a good mood the other day."
"I forgot about my grandmother's birthday a couple years back. I felt so bad about it!	That is no good.  I bet she was surprised.  How do you feel about it now?"
"Absolutely! I called her the next day and made sure to visit her. :)	I am sure she is happy to see you"
"She did. :) It ended up being a good visit anyway!	I was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day, and I found all my old paintball gear.	Oh wow! I bet that was fun."
"No, just me. But, I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.	That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of games do you play?"
"I went skydiving last summer with my partner. It was so scary!	I love skydiving! It was so exhilarating!"
"Absolutely! I've always been scared of heights, but I'm so glad I made myself.	That's a good attitude to have."
"When I was a kid, I had a dog at my grandpa's. He gave it away because it wouldn't hunt.	Oh wow, I bet it was a sad day for you."
"I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.	Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you will be fine."
"I tripped and fell in front of some people.	Oh no! Did you hurt yourself?"
"No, only my pride was injured.	I'm sorry to hear that."
"I recently dug up a necklace my grandmother gave me when I was young for a birthday. I hadn't seen it in years.	That's nice. I bet it brought back a lot of good memories for you."
"Yeah, she passed more than five years ago and I had forgotten all about it. It brought back so many memories though!	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that."
"I just won an award for best yard in the neighborhood!	Oh wow, congratulations! What is the award for?"
"I did, mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off.	That is great.  I am sure it was hard work.  Did you get a nice reward?"
"It is, it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards.	I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends, it should be so much fun!	That sounds like a lot of fun. What do you usually do at the park?"
"We often throw around a frisbee for a little bit, but we never get too intense with any sports.	Did you ever play sports in school?"
"Me too, there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!	I love rain, it is so relaxing"
"I snuck some candy out of my daughter's snack stash. I feel bad because I had been trying to diet.	That's so nice of you. Do you feel guilty?"
"Otherwise it's been pretty good- I've managed to lose 12 pounds! Just wish I could let the sugar cravings go.	I am sure you will be fine. I have had the same problem and it is hard to resist."
"My childhood friend gave me a watch for by birthday a few years ago, I lost it in a move recently. I'm pretty upset by it.	Oh no! That's so sad. I'm sure you'll be able to find it."
"I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!	Wow, I bet that was exciting!"
"I let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day.	Oh no! Did she do okay?"
"She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.	That is really nice of her. I bet you are proud of her."
"It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.	That is so terrible, I am sorry to hear that."
"It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.	Oh, that's terrible. They should be ashamed."
"I was feeling really down for a few weeks and my sister knew. She drove hours to come see me and make me feel better!	That's nice! How did she know?"
"Yeah it was really sweet of her and made me feel so much better!	That's great to hear, what happened?"
"I was recently on a long international flight and we hit some really bad turbulence.	Oh my gosh, did you get hurt?"
"I didn't, but I was really nervous for a little while. My wife didn't handle it quite as well.	That is not good. What did she do?"
"For sure. And it was a great trip.	I screwed up plans for a date night with my wife. We ended up having to cancel and she was really mad about it.	That's no fun. What happened?"
"We did and I made sure to not screw that one up!	What did you do?"
"Me too. Who knows what would have happened to me if I did it twice.	I was able to go back home to my parents for a few weeks recently. It was wonderful to relax in my childhood home.	That's great. I wish I could go back to my childhood home."
"They loved having me around again! Our ten year old dog wouldn't leave my side.	That's great! What kind of dog is it?"
"I've been thinking about buying some new, softer skateboard wheels.	Oh yeah, that is a great idea!"
"No, they make rough pavement feel smoother. I think I'll just keep the ones I have for now though. Just have to deal with having a rough ride.	I feel you.  I'm a little scared to even drive on rough pavement."
"I took my dog I've had for years over to meet one of my husband's sisters the other night.	I am sure she is very sweet. I am sure she will be great with your dog."
"It did not go well at all! She pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home.	That is terrible!  I would be so mad!  Did you call the plumber?"
"Yeah, I think it might've been too much on her at once. I was pretty embarrassed.	I had to take my daughter to the doctor the other day. She was very sick.	That's awful. I hope she feels better soon."
"It was just the flu. I got her some medicine, brought her home, and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.	That sounds like a great idea. I am so sorry you got sick."
"So my sister is getting married in a few weeks.	That is awesome! I am so happy for her!"
"Absolutely! The whole family is flying out, we can barely contain ourselves.	I can't wait to go on vacation.  Are you going anywhere?"
"So my friend adopted a new kitten very recently.	Oh wow. That's so sweet. What kind of kitten?"
"Oh, she is absolutely adorable! I'm so envious, I haven't been able to adopt one yet.	I can't wait to see what you do!"
"Bought a new car a few months back. Couple nights ago we had a big storm roll through. I thought for sure it was going to hail all over my new car.	That is a pretty scary thing to think about, I hope you are safe!"
"Nice! We have a garage, but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.	That's a bummer. I guess you'll just have to keep your car in the garage."
"I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker. He is a programming wizard. He easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods I had never even heard of.	That's nice of him. I wish I had a co-worker who could help me out."
"That is true. I usually can keep up, but this guy is on another level.	Did you watch him compete?"
"I had a meeting with my bosses the other day to discuss finally getting a promotion.	What did you do?"
"I've been working there for a couple years now. I'm feeling pretty good about my chances! Haven't heard back yet.	That's good. What kind of work are you doing?"
"I feel so good about knowing I am going to win the race on Sunday. The race is for my favorite charity. When I win the race I get to give my winnings to my charity of choice.	That is great. What is the charity you are supporting?"
"Yes, it is my local animal shelter. They will be there to cheer me on!	That is great! I hope they have a great day!"
"My wife has had a trip in mind ever since I've known her. She recently had a big birthday so I surprised her with the trip. We went and she loved it. It made me happy to see her so happy.	That's really sweet of you. Where did you go?"
"It was just a trip to the west coast. There was a handful of things she's always wanted to see/do. So we did all of them.	That sounds like a great trip. Did you take any photos?"
"Not yet. We try to take one big trip a year if possible. We just got back from that one, so we will start plotting out next year a little later I would imagine.	I live in Florida. When I go home once a year it is a grand occasion.	Oh, that's so nice. What do you do at home?"
"I grew up in Alabama. It is not far from Florida but still I get so thrill when I can go back to see family and friends.	I am a Floridian, so I can relate to that. It's nice to go home and hang out with family and friends."
"My sons first day of school was the other day.	Oh wow. I am sure it was a wonderful experience for you."
"Very first. I was so nervous till he got off the bus.	That is so exciting."
"I have a test coming up that I've been studying for weeks for.	That's great. Do you feel confident about it?"
"It's a Japanese language test for college. I feel pretty good about it though, been going over and over it every night.	That's awesome. I'm glad you feel confident about it. What's the test about?"
"I had phone interview for a job. It went very well	That's awesome! What kind of job is it?"
"Thank you. I wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand.	I'm glad to hear that. What kind of questions?"
"I saw an old movie. It reminded me of my younger days.	That is nice. What movie was it?"
"Yes. It's almost like a time machine. Fond memories.	I think I understand what you are saying."
"I lost my job because my company didn't pay rent at our location.	That is terrible. What are you going to do now?"
"Not very well. It makes me so angry. So I go work out to relieve the stress.	Oh no, how did it happen?"
"Recently my wife left me home alone with the dog all weekend while she was gone on a girls trip.	Oh no! I am sorry. That must have been very stressful."
"I missed her while she was gone. We have a mixed breed rescue pup.	What happened to her?"
"Our computer system at work is goofing up a lot, but the development team just keeps saying there's nothing wrong.	I am sorry, it is frustrating."
"Sometimes. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things I need to do.	That is a good point.  What do you do when that happens?"
"Me too!	Every time my kids go to grandma's they get to eat all kinds of candies, and get new toys.	That's so sweet! Do they like the candies or toys?"
"Yeah they do! Some times I wish I got to go visit grandma's like they do lol.	That is nice!  Do you ever get to see your grandma?"
"I was really happy when my nephew was born, Sadly i was informed he had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.	That's terrible. I bet it was hard on you to see him like that."
"He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy, but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.	I can't even imagine. What kind of discoveries?"
"I bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price. They didn't.	That is a bummer.  What are you going to do?"
"Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.	Oh, I hope you don't lose too much."
"I came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor. He hasnt done that in ages.	What did you do?"
"Thanks. I dont think so. He has seemed fine otherwise. I've watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine. He is a mutt from a local shelter.	Yeah, I'm sure he's fine. He's a good looking dog."
"Yeah. I love that goofy animal.  Hope he's ok	I work for a software company. I have been trying to learn a new language for some stuff. I knocked out my first task like a champ.	That is awesome. What language is it?"
"Well I have the opportunity, but rarely have the time to really devote to it.	I understand. I have the same problem."
"Yeah i get that. I work for a startup so things change pretty rapidly around here.	I landed an ollie on my skateboard for the first time in 14 years yesterday.	Wow, that's a lot of skill. What kind of board did you use?"
"Yeah it took a lot of practice.	Oh yeah? What kind of practice?"
"Next week I am off work and going to the beach.	Oh, I love the beach! What kind of beach are you going to?"
"No I am going with my wife and her family. But we all get along great so it should be fun.	That's great. I hope you have a good time."
"Amen. It is much needed. Ready for some sun and a drink with an umbrella.	That sounds like fun!"
"Not too long ago, I took a trip on a plane. The airline lost my whole suitcase!	That's terrible. Did they get it back?"
"The whole vacation! I was so upset! I didn't have anything to wear for the duration.	Wow, that's bad."
"We usually don't do anything big for birthdays but my wife got me an apple watch this year.	That's a nice gift!  It's great that you have a partner in crime."
"Yeah i really did not see it coming at all.	Oh really? What happened?"
"My boss and I went to lunch and had a personal conversation about some life issues.	That sounds nice.  What happened?"
"We just went to a local taco place. It was a good conversation.	What did you talk about?"
"It was more about just some personal life stuff. Not too much really.	I came back from a trip recently, got called in the boss's office and was given a decent sized raise.	What did you do to deserve it?"
"Absolutely. I certainly won't say no to that.	I have never been to Vegas, but I have been to New Orleans."
"Budget is kind of tight lately and I am really afraid my wife's aging car is about to bite the dust.	That's too bad. I hope you guys can find something that works out."
"I may have to if that happens. We are making it now, but if the car goes it will be pretty tough.	I hope that doesn't happen."
"It is ok. We are probably too proud to take help anyway. We will make it.	I agree, being proud of ourselves is good, but taking help is good too."
"So I recently went through some old boxes and found some of my childhood dolls. It brought back a lot of memories!	Wow! What kind of dolls did you have?"
"Absolutely! I remember having so much fun with them dressing them up. My sister and I would play for hours.	That's cool! What are they dressed up as?"
"So, i may be in the market for a new laptop or a repair at least, thanks to a little mishap.	That's always a bummer.  Are you in need of a laptop or a repair?"
"My daughter tripped on the cord and it smashed on the ground, not sure if it can be saved. I was pretty angry.	Oh no, I hope she's okay."
"I woke up the other morning, got ready and drove all the way to work. Just to find out it was a holiday and we had the day off.	That sucks. Did you feel bad?"
"I know, but the extra day of work was nice. Especially since I wasn't expecting it.	That's great! I'm glad you enjoyed it. What was it for?"
"It was wonderful. I ended up being twice as productive since I got up early.	Oh wow! I'm glad you were productive!"
"My new job is starting tomorrow. I'm feeling nervous, but really optimistic about it.	That's great! I hope you have fun."
"It's a job they opened up for graphic design! I'm super excited to get started and learn more from them.	That sounds awesome. I love graphic design."
"Going to my son's first pee-wee football game tomorrow!	I bet that's exciting!"
"He thinks he does.  All I can think of is a bunch of Tiny Titans in helmets running around like chicks in a barnyard.  *chuckle*	That is funny!"
"I put in a job application for a new job. I am fairly certain that my credentials are enough to get me the job.	That is good, it is always good to have a good resume."
"I was, I go in next Tuesday. I am pretty excited for them to give me the job.	That's great. Are you sure you'll get the job?"
"Me too, we shall see. Now the waiting begins!	I got a call about job with a good company that is in my line of work.	I bet that was exciting.  Are you applying?"
"No, but I have the necessary experience, and I'm optimistic that it will work out.	That's good. I bet you are confident in your abilities."
"I went to the petstore with my dog and he had an accident in front of everyone. He had the saddest look on his face.	Wow, I would have been mortified.  Did you clean it up?"
"He did, the clerk walked over, told him it was ok and gave him a treat.	That was cool! I love when that happens."
"I had a video job interview. That was a new experience.	What was the job?"
"I'm not sure. It was a little awkward and stressful.	How awkward and stressful?"
"Sure, that's ok. And thank you.	Well I'm glad. I had a bad day myself."
"I've been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and the pain is horrible. The problem is that the medicine that my doctor wants me to take has side effects worse that the pain.	That's terrible!  I hope you get the treatment you need.  I've been diagnosed with that as well and it's really tough.  How are you taking care of yourself?"
"Maybe, I haven't been back because I can't afford to go right now. I've just been dealing with the pain.	Oh no, that is terrible. I hope you can get back soon."
"It suck.Hopefully we can both get coverage soon.	My son got picked to be on the soccer team that he was on last year!	Oh wow! That's amazing! How did he do?"
"He is!  Especially since last year's team won the Opening Day Tournament and then won the Regular Season title!	That's so awesome. Did you watch them play?"
"Yeah!  We had a group of really talented kids, and some very good [and patient] coahes!	The other day, my three year old didn't know I was paying attention to her while she was playing with the dog. I overheard her trying to teach the dog how to count to ten.	Oh, I'm sorry that happened to you.  I bet you were so surprised.  Did you laugh at her?"
"Yes, I thought that was pretty good for a three year old. When I asked her about it she said they were playing school. Haha.	Did she say it was a school play?"
"I'm very proud of her.	Why are you proud?"
"I babysat and worked odd jobs all summer when i was younger to save up and buy a sega dreamcast.	That was cool, I had a Sega Dreamcast too, but I didn't play as much as I wanted to."
"Yep, i've never looked forward to something so much in my life. I still have the dreamcast as well.	That's awesome! I just got a new xbox console, so I can play some old games!"
"I'm gonna need your support here, because I'm going through something a little bit rough, okay?	Well, I'm here to help, so I'm ready to do whatever I can to help you through it."
"I'm 29 years old and I woke up to find that I'd wet the bed last night. I'm...not even sure how. I didn't drink a whole lot before bed or anything.	That is frustrating. What are you going to do about it?"
"Should I see a therapist or anything? Is this indicative of some deep-seated problem that I'm not aware of?	I'm not sure. I don't know if you are looking for help or not."
"My Uncle Jebodiah is always looking out for me. He recently told me that he had a special concoction that if I drank it, it would cure my herpes.	What kind of concoction?"
"Listen, my Uncle Jeb wouldn't do me dirty like that. You may call it """"""snake oil"""""" but I call it the miracle cure this world needs. After all, it worked.	I am not sure if I believe it."
"My cat was kept overnight at the vets recently. I was so worried!	That is not good! I hope everything turned out well."
"She's fine now! They found out it was something minor after x-rays. I was so relieved.	That's good to hear! What was it?"
"My car broke down on a busy highway the other day. There were so many cars zooming past me, it was scary!	That sounds so scary! Were you able to get help?"
"My brother had to pick me up. He had to pull up behind me on the curb. It felt dangerous!	I bet that was scary!  How did it feel?"
"Look, can we just be honest with each other for a second? Having ebola shouldn't mean that I have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions.	That's a good point. I'm not sure I agree."
"I saw one, and he said if I gave him $25,000 he would clear me for flight, but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.	I bet you are so bummed out about that."
"I am obsessive about being ready for anything	Why is that?"
"I don't know.  I just see stuff in the grocery store and think I like that food and buy it because it is on sale.  Even if I already have it!	That's so common. I buy the same food for the same reason."
"My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer.	Oh my goodness. That is scary. Did she survive?"
"She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.	I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope she is doing better now."
"It was swallowed whole, unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't have it, and neither will I.	I forgot about plans that I had made with my mother over the weekend.	That's too bad. I'm sure she will forgive you."
"I called her right up and we rescheduled! I felt so bad though.	Did you feel bad?"
"I was talking to a British friend of mine and trying to explain why our president feels compelled to tweet	That is interesting. I am not sure I understand why someone would do that."
"They think someone needs to take his phone away	Oh no, what happened?"
"I was looking through the attic and found a box of childhood toys. They brought back so many memories!	I'm sure they did! I'm sure you have a lot of memories there too!"
"It was nice to find them all and think back to those simpler times	I am sure it was nice to look back."
"The last trip I took to Chicago was by plane.	That is cool! Where are you from?"
"I had! I love chicago.  The flight is nice and short too, though I wasn't feeling well.	Oh, that's great, I've never been.  I wish I could go, I love Chicago too."
"I think my electrolytes were off, I actually fainted on the plane and they made a whole to-do about it.	My university is posting live stream of students moving in and I was reminiscing about when I studied abroad in college	That's cool! Did you have a good time?"
"I studied in Venice Italy and travelled all over Europe	That sounds amazing! Where was the first place you went?"
"I won a storage shed auction last Monday and found my grandmother's old glass eye in a steamer trunk inside of the shed. Really reminded me of her and how much I miss her.	That is so awesome! I bet she would be so proud of you!"
"Rita May. She used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon. Those were such good times.	What was your name?"
"I'm pretty excited for the upcoming Halloween season.	I love Halloween! What are you planning to do?"
"Well In September, Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events, after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.	That sounds like a lot of fun.  I have never been to that place.  Have you ever been?"
"I was loyal to the same company for 10 years.	Did they treat you well?"
"Nice. I wasn't rewarded though. They laid me off.	That's terrible. What did you do?"
"I told a lie to my mother.	Oh, that's bad. What was it about?"
"I was about school. And I eventually confessed.	What did you confess?"
"I got a job after a long period of unemployment.	That's great! What did you do?"
"Yes. I was very happy to be gainfully employed.	I'm glad you have a job!"
"I was in a car accident. Both cars were totaled.	That's terrible. Did you have insurance?"
"They were running from the police. It was nerve rattling.	What were they running from?"
"So my family surprised me this year with a party for my birthday.	That's awesome! I'm sure you were excited!"
"They got me the new shoes I've been wanting. I was so elated and had such a good time!	That's great!  What kind of shoes are they?"
"I had a job interview. The guy really knew his stuff.	I hope you get the job."
"Yes, really smart and easy to talk to.	That's nice to hear. You're lucky to find someone like that."
"I don't know yet.	Our power went off the other night. We were without it until morning!	Oh my, that is a bummer. Did you call a power company?"
"Someone crashed into the power line I think. It was so quiet and felt pretty spooky.	Oh no! I hope you are okay!"
"I bought a raffle ticket for a charity where I have a 1/500 chance of winning a car	That's a pretty good chance of winning!"
"Yes.  They were $100 but they only sell 500 tickets.  And the money raised goes to breast cancer research	That's great to hear!"
"jumpfortherose.com	Someone helped me move.	That's really nice of them."
"Yes, and I paid them with beer. I was thankful because I had a toe injury.	That's awesome!  I'm glad you were able to do that.  Beer is a great way to relax."
"I bought a powerball ticket last week but did not win	Did you win?"
"I would have bought a new car and a house perhaps.  But I lost :-(	That is a bummer! What happened?"
"Yes.  Maybe next time I will win!	I spent Saturday night playing Lord of the Rings Online.	I have never played that game."
"It is good, but I sometimes wonder if I'm trading real life for a fantasy world.	Yeah that can be a problem.  Are you feeling overwhelmed with the world?"
"I am so mad that our politicians won't do something to stop Russian hacking	I am too.  It is so infuriating."
"Yes.  The Republicans just don't seem to care about our country any more and I am so mad that Putin owns Trump	That's really unfortunate."
"My goldfish died.	I am sorry to hear that. I know it is very sad."
"For 4 years. I'm bummed.	What happened?"
"Not yet.	I had an unprofessional job interview.	Well, what happened?"
"The receptionist ignored me, and my interviewer was not prepared.	I am sorry to hear that.  Did you speak to her about it?"
"My computer crashed while I was working on a project.	Oh no! I hope you were able to recover your work."
"I did. I hadn't saved, and I forgot to set up autosave. It was very frustrating.	That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I can't imagine having to do that."
"My favorite team blew a big lead in the playoffs. It was like drinking sour milk.	Oh no, what happened?"
"I hate when teams choke. It makes me sick.	I agree."
"I woke up this morning and my eye is itchy and my right eyelid is drooping	I hope you feel better soon"
"yeah I am going to see what it seems like tomorrow - not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what	What did it look like?"
"Yeah I will if it does not get better quickly	Me and my family went to see a magic show for the first time today.	That was cool. What kind of show was it?"
"I didn't catch his name, but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat. Classic trick, but I'll never forget it!	That sounds like a good time. I bet you were amazed."
"I have a job interview tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it.	I'm sure you will do great. I've had some interviews before and they're always a lot of fun."
"Yes. It seems like a great opportunity.	Why is that?"
"I scored well on an aptitude test.	That's great! I hope you get the job you're looking for!"
"I had a few drinks. I felt good.	I'm not a big drinker."
"So today my mother brought over a whole week of meals to help me out.	That is so nice of her."
"Yes, she's always helping me out! I am so thankful for her she's an amazing mother.	That's really nice. How old is she?"
"So I moved away from my parents not too long ago. It's been a big change.	That can be a tough adjustment, especially if they were close. What made you move?"
"Out of state. I'm by myself now, so it's pretty quiet! I miss them a lot.	That is sad. How long have you been away?"
"My oldest child needed braces but her health insurance wouldn't cover the expense. It was close to 4000 dollars and we did not have that kind of money at the time.	I am sorry to hear that."
"Yes they do. My aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn't has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help.	That is very kind of her.  I would be very grateful if someone like that showed kindness to me."
"I was sitting on the couch after a long day taking care of work and all the mommy stuff the other day.	What did you do?"
"It was! My family was happy and together. Chatting and watching tv. Everything just felt right.	That is great! Did you have a big family gathering?"
"My husband used to work out of town in a different state Sunday through Thursday.	That's nice, I bet it was a big part of your life. Did you miss him?"
"Yeah, he does work hard. Even thought my children were with me and we kept our usual routines, I was miserable when he was gone. I would cry after he left every Sunday. Luckily now, he has a job where he is home everyday by supper time.	That's good to hear. Did you have kids?"
"We really are, he brings out the best in me.	I didn't have a car to get to and from work, so my parents actually let me just keep theirs for a bit!	That is so nice of them."
"Yeah it was so giving of them to leave it to me for so long and helped me a ton!	That's good to hear, you must have been really busy."
"While driving today I went past my grandma's old house. She passed last year.	I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope she is at peace."
"Oh for sure. Good feelings, but I also miss her so much.	What happened to her?"
"I went outside to get my paper this morning. Someone had ran over my mailbox!	That's really rude! I hate when that happens!"
"No, it's completely demolished! I'm feeling pretty annoyed.	That's terrible. Did you have to throw out your house?"
"My sister is a journalist and she got her first big story published in the paper today!	Wow that's awesome!  Is she from the same city?"
"It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her.	That's great. What happened?"
"So my partner gave me the biggest surprise this week.	That is so nice!  What was the surprise?"
"He got us a trip to Hawaii! I couldn't believe it, I am so elated!	That's awesome. Where is it?"
"I finally went and adopted a cat last month and go way more than I expected!	What kind of cat?"
"Well it was only supposed to be her, but we found out she was pregnant! She popped out a whole litter of adorable.	That's great! Congratulations!"
"I had to leave town last week and that meant leaving my pets who are my babies. I needed someone who could take care of them properly.	Oh, that's terrible.  I am sorry.  Are they being cared for by someone?"
"It is very hard! The only one who I'd let do it was my sister and she did an amazing job.	That's great!  It is good that you have a sister to help."
"So I finally decided to take my dog for his first dog park visit.	That sounds like fun, how did it go?"
"It's hard to tell! He refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play.	Oh no! What kind of dog is he?"
"Im embarrassed to admit I forgot to pick up my brother from worth the other day after agreeing to	Oh no, what happened?"
"Ha ha, he was a little miffed. He got over it though when I stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! I felt like such a jerk.	That's awesome, I bet you got him a really good ice cream!"
"I finally took the plunge and decided to go back to school this year.	That's so exciting!  Are you taking any classes that you've always wanted to take?"
"I start next week! I was super hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I'm making myself do it.	That's great. What are you doing?"
"I was going through some stuff and found a box of jewelry my grandparents had gifted me through the years.	That's so cool! I love finding old family items."
"Yeah, it really made me think of them and old times.	That is good, what happened?"
"I recently had a shop fix my car. They worked so fast!	That's great! I hope they fixed it for you quickly and for good!"
"I was able to go home, but I realize now that I didn't even have to	What do you mean?"
"My husband is going through the process of quitting smoking on top of dealing with drama from his parents. He is having a hard time.	That must be really tough for him. Is he getting help?"
"They aren't being supportive at all, but that's not surprising, that don't support him very well in anything. I just wish I could make it better for him, but I can't	That is so sad.  You need to be honest with him.  I don't think it's healthy to be dishonest with someone."
"I have some great friends. One of them drove me to the airport tomorrow	Oh that's great! I'm glad you have friends who can do that for you."
"Yes I am, they are great	I'm glad you are happy."
"We just found out the person working in our accounting department has been stealing money from our company for years.	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you report it to the authorities?"
"Yes, it just makes me sick to my stomach. You think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind. I don't get some people	I can relate.  I don't know how they can do it."
"I miss high school. My girlfriend was the best	I'm sure she was. How long have you two been together?"
"That's great. College was also fun	I loved college! It was so much fun."
"I recently bid farewell to a good friend. I miss her	That is a bummer.  How old is she?"
"Thank you, that means a lot. I will see her again	I am sure you will, and I hope you have a great time!"
"I lost my car keys. I'm such a fool!	I've been there.  It's not the end of the world.  You can always call a locksmith to get them made."
"That's pretty funny, and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!	Yeah, I lost my keys once too.  I was so stressed out that I was on the verge of losing it all."
"I came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over. I've only seen him with a friend over once in my 3.5 years of living here.	Oh no!  Was it a surprise?"
"Yeah I sure was, he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.	That is the worst, I hate it when that happens"
"One of my co-worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor. It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor.	I would be a little suspicious about my supervisor as well."
"Yeah I figured it was, so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.	Wow, what happened?"
"Man there aren't many people I would give my last couple hundred dollars to, with one notable exception.	Ahhh, I know what you mean. What was the exception?"
"My buddy Stefan. He used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters. We sold them and netted $2000 a piece!	I am not sure if I would do that, I'm not sure I would get caught."
"I finished first in a race. I feel like gold	I am so happy for you!"
"Yes! It was my first victory. All my hard work is paying off	Oh that's great. What did you win?"
"Some of my friends told me that they had a big surprise for me. They know I hate surprises, but I complied and let the blindfold me and drive me out to the location.	That's a pretty fun surprise. Did you like it?"
"They had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together. It was a flying lesson at the local airport.	Wow! That's so cool!"
"I found an old photo album at my grandma's house that had pictures of me when I was a kid	That is cool. I love looking back on the old photos from my childhood."
"Yeah, it did. I really miss the 90s. Everything seemed a lot simpler in those days	I know what you mean.  I have a lot of fond memories of that time period."
"When I was in middle school, I had a friend come over to ride horses with me. After riding my mother pressured me to get on a horse bareback I wasn't comfortable riding. She made such a big scene that I got on to make her stop.	That's so cool you were brave enough to do that."
"Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents, it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.	That's really rough. I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"My friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him, but I haven't been rollerblading since I was a little kid. I didn't want to roll into a car.	I am sure he wouldn't have expected you to be afraid of it."
"We went, but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.	That's awful.  Did you go to the bathroom?"
"My husband is on the road a lot, I hardley ever see him.	That can be tough, but I'm sure you're okay with it."
"Yes, its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.	I understand, sometimes it can be hard to let go of the people that are important to us."
"I have an interview for a job that I don't feel qualified for	What kind of job is it?"
"I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard	Why are you anxious?"
"I'm moving in a few months to a new state, I'm starting to feel nervous.	That is a big change.  Do you have any plans to meet new people?"
"To my husband hometown so it'll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family.	That's nice.  What city is he going back to?"
"I saw a dog get hit by car today on the highway.	Did you see what happened to the dog?"
"It was pretty tramatic, I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No, I was on my way to work, I couldn't stop :(	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're okay"
"I can't even begin to tell you how nervous I was about my first tattoo.	What kind of tattoo did you get?"
"Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood, and my pain threshold was low at the time. It turned out great though, and now I have several!	That's great!  What kind of blood?"
"I love my husband! He has been so sweet this week!	That's good to hear. What have you guys been doing together?"
"He knew I had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and Taco Bell! It's the little things :)	That's really sweet of him. Did you enjoy it?"
"It's been a great week!	Oh yeah? What happened?"
"I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting!	That's great.  What a surprise!"
"Music is a powerful thing. Sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place. You know what I mean?	I know exactly what you mean.  I love that feeling.  Music is my favorite thing to listen to."
"Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.	That is sad. Do you have a favorite song?"
"I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories.	That is a good way to cope with sadness.  I do not have a stuffed rabbit.  I am an adult and do not have a pet."
"Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.	That's really nice of him.  I'm glad he is so considerate.  What a nice guy."
"My dog got hit by a car.	oh my god! how did he do?"
"He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.	What happened?"
"Some random guy was in my backyard, I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.	I would be so mad!"
"Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first.	Did he yell at you?"
"My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.	That's so sad. I'm sorry to hear that."
"My siblings and I are managing, and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.	What happened?"
"I've got a week off from work. Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.	That sounds like a great time. What shows are you going to watch?"
"I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time	I have never seen that show. Is it good?"
"I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.	Oh no. What was the reason?"
"That is what I was thinking at the time, but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.	That is a tough spot to be in.  Have you considered looking at some of the job markets in other states?"
"I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.	Oh man, that's a bummer! I'm sure they were shocked."
"It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.	That's terrible. Did you hurt yourself?"
"My boyfriend is sick. He can't eat much so I made some soup for him	I hope he feels better soon! I'm sorry you have to do that for him."
"I made chicken noodle soup.	That sounds like a good idea."
"I had a meeting last week where I gave a presentation over the wrong documentation and no one said anything until after the meeting.	Oh, that sounds like a disaster. Did you have to redo it?"
"After I figured out what I did, I sure was. Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.	That must have been very difficult for you.  I hope you are able to get through this."
"I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend.	That's great. What is the meeting about?"
"It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.	That sounds exciting! Do you think you'll get the job?"
"I caught my boyfriend texting his ex	Oh no! What did you do?"
"It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her	That's a good thing. If they're not together, then why would you want to be with them?"
"I know I broke up with my ex, but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.	I know how that is, it's hard to be around people who just want to make you feel bad."
"We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial, i think he does too.	I bet you two get along really well. It's good that you have a good friendship."
"I can't wait to see my final grades. I think I got all A's this semester.	Oh wow! That's awesome!"
"On Monday. I'm going to treat myself if I did well	That's nice. What are you going to do?"
"I was very upset when I found my kitten today.	How did you find him?"
"No, I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.	I am sorry to hear that.  What did you do?"
"I cried a bit, but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out.	I enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion.	That's very kind of you. How old are they?"
"Not really, I take my daughter to see them, so many of them have no visitors at all.	What are they doing?"
"She likes to bake, so we take them what she makes :)	I love baking.  What's her favorite recipe?"
"She is pretty good for an eleven year old, better than I was.	That's a great kid. What's her name?"
"I had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her, as well as get off my chest. I know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her.	That's good.  I'm glad you have a good relationship with your mother."
"Yes, I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!	I feel the same way!"
"My son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us. I was anxious and nervous waiting to see if he was accepted!	Wow! I'm sure it was a great experience!"
"He did! He's in his 3rd year, going to be an Aerospace Engineer, so we are very proud of him.	Oh that's awesome! What field of engineering is he studying?"
"My sister passed away several years ago. She took her life, and my mother and I found her right after she did it. This was very painful, traumatic and hard for us all.	That is very sad.  Do you have any children?"
"It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile, she was in denial. But, it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile, as she was my only sibling and we were very close.	I am sorry to hear that. It must have been very hard for you to deal with that."
"When my son first started college, I felt so much love and affection, but it was definitely hard to see him go! I was very proud though.	That's so sweet.  What was he studying?"
"He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's focused on science, engineering, etc. He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer. It's great to see him go for his dreams!	I am so happy for him. It's always great when someone achieves their dreams!"
"We went on vacation a few weeks ago and went to the beach, It was so relaxing and great. I really enjoyed the time with my family.	That sounds really relaxing! What did you do?"
"That's great! I'm sure you earned it, just like we do. It's so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!	I am happy for you. You deserve it!"
"I am looking forward to next week! My husband has been out of town on business for several weeks and comes home next weekend!	That is great news!  You must be excited!"
"I am going to cook a special meal and see if he wants to go out, just us two. I know he will like that.	That sounds great!  I bet he'll be excited.  What kind of meal are you planning?"
"My husband has been out of town a few weeks for work but is coming back next weekend. I have a surprise night planned for just us. I am optimistic and sure he will really enjoy it.	That's great.  I hope you both have a good time."
"Thanks! We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.	That's great.  I have been married for 20 years and I still try to keep things fun."
"My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!	I bet.  I hope you are able to make more memories with him in the future."
"Yes, very. But, time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!	Yeah, it's amazing how fast time goes. It seems like just yesterday you were a little kid."
"I was promoted to a Team Leader and I felt very secure I could do well at the job. I had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role.	That is very impressive. You must be very confident and experienced."
"Yes, thank you! I had worked very hard through the years, and I felt that I earned it, and would do well at it.	What do you do?"
"There was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him. I was so mad, beyond angry!	Wow that is horrible. I would be very angry. Did you tell him?"
"Yes, and she had two children of her own, similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle, that made her mad! Can you believe that??	That sounds like a crazy mom!  I can imagine she was mad."
"Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.	That must have been stressful. Is she doing well?"
"It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing.	That's awful, how did that happen?"
"I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!	That's too bad.  Did you forget something?"
"I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.	I bet!  You're going to have a good time!"
"One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me, while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!	I would be very embarrassed. I hope you can forgive him!"
"I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....	It is hard when you are in love with someone, and they are not with you."
"The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.	Oh my god, what did you do?"
"No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.	That's a good thing you did. It is always better to be safe than sorry."
"I was trying to ignore the fact that my 50th birthday was coming up but my family decided to throw me a surprise party.	That is nice.  I hope you had fun!"
"It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more	That's a great attitude to have, especially with all the things that are coming your way as you get older."
"A few weeks ago, my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things, and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.	That's so sad. I hope you guys can work through it."
"Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later.	That's true. I'm a bit more silent."
"One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.	Oh no! What did you do?"
"Yes, and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But, luckily, it turned out to be my shadow!	That's great!  I'm glad it was your shadow and not something worse."
"There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	That is so sad.  How did it affect you?"
"Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it.	I can understand that. I know some people who live on the streets."
"When my children were born, it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.	That is awesome, congratulations!"
"Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.	I am happy for you! How old are they?"
"I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.	I'm sorry to hear that, you had to make a choice to stay true to yourself, I would've done the same"
"Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.	I agree, but it's hard to make that happen. People are hard to change, and it's hard to get them to believe."
"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!	I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.	That must have been quite intimidating.  How did you feel when you got it?"
"Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.	Oh no! Are you safe?"
"I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.	That's awesome! I've always wanted to join a weight loss group. I'm not sure if I'm up for it but I think it could be a great way to get motivated!"
"It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them	I'm glad they are there for you."
"A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!	I would be too. I have never been so nervous in my life."
"I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!	I am happy for you. I am going to study for my last exam."
"Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!	I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	That's great. What kind of cards did you find?"
"It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?	I think it's a little silly, but it's a good point."
"That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!	I bet. I have a lot of old stuff that I never had time to sort through."
"I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.	Oh yea? What is it?"
"When I was entering the store it was really slippery.	That must have been scary! I bet you were worried about falling."
"It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.	That is hilarious! I hope you weren't hurt!"
"I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.	I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.	Oh no, what is it?"
"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	I don't understand why people are so afraid of the law."
"Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.	I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.	I know what you mean! I'm so sorry to hear that. Did they give you a part?"
"I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.	Oh, I hope you get another one that you like."
"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	That's great, it's always fun to teach a kid to drive."
"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	That sounds like a fun drive.  I bet you guys had a good time."
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	I bet it'll be a lot easier than you think!"
"I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!	That's so great.  I hope she has a good time!"
"My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.	That's no fun at all! I hope you guys have fun."
"I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*	Ahh, you are a very optimistic person! I like that!"
"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	I would be very happy to have a brother who is honest and reliable."
"We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.	That's great! I'm glad he's a good brother."
"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	That's great to hear! I am so happy for you guys!"
"Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)	You are right! I am glad you are happy."
"My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.	That's awesome! I've always been in awe of people who are able to do that."
"I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!	That's wonderful! I'm sure you are very proud of her."
"Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.	That sounds like fun, did you learn anything new today?"
"I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.	That sounds like a good plan. I hope you can do it and get it done."
"I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.	that must have been so upsetting"
"Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.	I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have any plans for funerals?"
"Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!	I am happy for you. I am sure it was a nice surprise."
"She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!	That is terrible. I am so sorry."
"I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before	That's awesome! Are you excited about it?"
"I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.	That's awesome! Halo is a great game. What are you planning to do with it?"
"My father passed away 2 years ago, but my mother lives in my neighborhood now. I'm so thankful she lives close by and still here with us. She's such a wonderful mother.	That's so sweet.  I am sure she will always be with you."
"I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.	I am sorry for your loss. I think it is always hard to lose someone you love."
"I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!	Oh wow! That's awesome. What are you planning on doing?"
"The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...	I'm sorry that is such an issue. Is there a way to prevent it?"
"Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!	My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it	Wow! That is amazing. You must have had some good time."
"We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor	Oh cool, what kind of voice is he?"
"I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten, with no collar, in a window well.	That is so sad. Did you take it in?"
"We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!	That's great, how old is he now?"
"I felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself	Oh no! I hope everything turned out okay!"
"I did not, I was little but I think I put it back into a tree	Oh no, I hope it didn't cause any damage."
"Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving	I know the feeling. What made it so unnerving?"
"Yep, had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out	I love online classes, they are so convenient!"
"I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!	I am sure she will forgive you, you are a good man."
"I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :(	Oh no. That's so embarrassing. It's just one day."
"You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???	I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party, not my greatest moment	I am sure it was a good moment though."
"I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret	Oh that's a funny story. I have never worn a dress, so I'm not sure I can relate."
"I had some trippy nightmares as a kid, now I don't really have dreams	I have had some too. I have always been a little scared of the dark, but my dreams are pretty normal."
"Yeah, it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me, pretty weird	Oh no, did you get a good look at what was staring at you?"
"I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards	Oh I know that feeling.  It's not good."
"No, I was scared to get charged, but I stopped after that	I am sure you are not afraid of being charged."
"I was at a meditation retreat last year for 10 days and I can say that I experienced a better feeling there than I could ever remembe	That sounds amazing! I've never been to a retreat like that. Did you learn anything new?"
"Yeah, thankfully there's an app for that - Headspace (no I am not sponsored)	What is that?"
"I am really looking forward to going away for the holidays.	That's great! What are you looking forward to?"
"I want to go see the Harry Potter land at Universal, the kids will love it.	I'm a big Harry Potter fan. I haven't been to Universal in a while."
"They love the films, plus getting to ride Hogwarts Express, score!	I'm really hoping my acceptance letter shows up in the mail soon.	I bet you are excited!"
"Law School, I'm pretty sure I got in to my first choice, but you never know.	I'm sure you will get in, law school is tough."
"Thank you, fingers are crossed.	I just ordered a new cookery book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. I want to delve in and try lots of new recipes!	That sounds like a lot of fun.  Are you a big cook?"
"I'm vegetarian and cook all sorts of different cuisines - Indian, Italian, American. The only cuisine I'm not good at is Chinese. How about you?	Well, Chinese is actually my favorite. I've never had a good Chinese dish, but I'm curious to try."
"Have you heard of Mark Bittman's book How to Cook Everything Vegetarian? That's the book I'm waiting impatiently for!	I witnessed the most epic bottle flip in the history of bottle flips at my school	That's amazing. What school was it at?"
"Yee yee, it landed on this little ledge that was super high up.	That's awesome! What kind of ledge?"
"My little grandson just came home from the hospital. He was born premature and weighted under 2 pounds.	I am sure he is a precious little one.  I hope he is doing okay."
"He is doing well, thank you. And we are so thankful everything is ok. It was touch and go for awhile	That's great. How long have you been together?"
"I love my girlfriend. She would never cheat on me	That is very nice of her."
"I hope to make her my wife some day!	Oh, I'm sure you will! I know it's hard, but you will get there!"
"My sister spilled some milk on me. It set me off!	Oh no! Did you get it out?"
"It was indeed a mistake. My clothes are fine now.	What happened?"
"I recently did not pay my rent. My land lord has been terrible at providing services	That's awful.  How long have you been renting?"
"He decided to start caring and doing his part.	That is a good thing to see.  What is he doing?"
"I'm thankful that I was able to repair my tire before it went flat on my car	That's good. I hate when that happens."
"Right, I caught it just as it happened and brought it to the shop, didn't cost as much as I thought it would either.	Oh, that's good to hear. It's always good to have a backup plan."
"I love my friend. She just drove me to class	That is very nice of her."
"I think I am getting her a gift soon!	That's exciting! What is it?"
"I stole from my friends when I was a child. I feel terrible about it now	Oh no, I'm sorry. I can't imagine being in a similar situation."
"It was some Pokemon cards!	That's awesome. I love collecting cards too."

"5	I'm sorry?"
"I recently got an A on my paper. I feel great.	That's awesome! What subject is it in?"

"Drinking a gallon of milk in a day wasn't a good idea	Oh no, did you feel sick afterwards?"
"I wanted to see how hard it would be, turns out my stomach was JUST big enough	That's awesome, I'm so glad you were able to do it."
"My friend slept with a girl I like. I feel horrible now	That's terrible. Did you talk to her about it?"
"No, but I don't think he is my friend any more	What happened?"
"I don't like working with managers that try to micro-manage me	How long have you worked with them?"
"Right, it kind of feels like they're insecure with their abilities while trying to make me feel bad at the same time	I'm sorry to hear that, are you feeling insecure?"
"Teeth are weird, but also take a lot of upkeep which is sometimes irritating	I agree, they are not the most pleasant thing to deal with."
"Yeah that's what my dentist says, I'll try	What happened to you?"
"I wake up with chills sometimes for no reason	oh, that's weird."
"I think it's from dreams that I'm not able to recall	Oh no!  Is everything okay?"
"I wasn't able to reach my goals in the gym a couple days ago, and it helped me realize where I'm slacking off in other areas	I am sorry to hear that. Did you try to get back on track?"
"Yeah, it's fun to see how much you can conquer yourself, and it's nice to be able to see how you're changing	That's a good point.  I think that's what is missing in today's world, self-improvement."

"For sure, my mind is pretty energetic	I am too."
"I've been processing what being lonely feels like, because I want to be able to have fun by myself sometimes	I totally get that. Sometimes I just need to sit and stare at myself in the mirror and enjoy the silence."
"True, and I've felt that way before, but sometimes like a wave of those kinds of feelings hits like I'm not worthy enough and stuff like that, but it's all good	That's a good attitude to have.  What is it that you're worthy of?"
"I'm trying to get over my need to control things, and I find if I just let things happen it feels like a weights been pulled off my shoulders	Well, I think it's good to let things go sometimes, but it's also good to have control. It's like having a balance."

"Yeah, it was built a long time ago, some kind of electrical fire	Wow that's bad. Did you get the insurance money?"
"I was truly surprised when I notice my tire got hit by a rock, thought I wouldn't make it to the tire place in time	oh no! were you able to fix it?"
"It did not, got it replaced when I dropped it off, pretty lucky	What kind of thing dropped?"
"There was a cat who had string stuck around it so I had to help	That sounds like a real pain in the neck. Did you have to get it out?"
"Yeah, everything turned out fine in the end	What happened?"
"I feel like deepening my connection to God is the most important thing in my life	I think that is a great idea. Do you have a lot of time to dedicate to it?"
"It's like if I don't get that sorted out I won't be able to live a fulfilling life	That's a very good point, how did you find yourself in that position?"
"When I can't take a breather in the day I feel suffocated	Oh no! What do you do to take a break?"
"Right, it's like I can't focus or relax	What's going on?"
"When I was in elementary school I was envious of the kids who were popular!	I remember that too.  I was always the ""new kid"" and never had friends."
"Yeah, I just had trouble socializing is all	Oh no, that's awful. I'm sorry. I hope you can work on that soon."

"Yeah, my bath wasn't deep enough, so I didn't get covered all the way!	Oh, that's a little too close to home for me. I have to get a new bathtub."
"I'm eating a lot of food to make sure I can lift more weight in the gym next time!	That is awesome.  I can't lift very much so I just eat to make sure I can lift."
"I'm taking everything, honey, raw garlic, yogurt, EVERYTHING!	That sounds like a lot of garlic."
"I don't like scammy sales people, nothing good comes from it	I agree, I just don't like being sold something for a price that I didn't know I was paying."
"Yeah, it's like they live to manipulate people for money	That's not true.  I don't know what you're talking about."
"I went to lunch the other day with my kids. My daughter needed help opening her dipping sauce and of course I did....	Oh no! I hope your daughter is a good sport about it."

"Listening to old artists like they Might Be Giants is my jam	I love that band, they are so unique and fun to listen to"

"Yes, I'm exhausted. My daughter is teething so she hasn't been sleeping well.	I'm sorry. That can be really hard."
"Seeing people taken advantage of by fake religious services is something I find the most vile. It makes them believe that they're doing the right thing, but the person taking advantage of them knows what's really up. What do you know about that?	I know about that. They're not just doing the right thing, they're doing it for a false sense of security. People need to be aware of it."
"Exactly, I feel that getting people to believe irrational things is the same as giving them a brain virus, it'll slowly erode their ability to think rationally.	I agree, people are getting more and more gullible."
"I have a presentation for work on Monday, I'm a little nervous.	Oh no! What is the topic?"
"Kind of, but I have prepared a lot so I'm sure it'll go good! I work in the human resource department for a big company and we are trying to find new ways to retain good employes.	I love HR, it's a very important part of any organization."
"I had to leave my key in my car for the mechanic and I was left wondering if someone might find it	Oh no! That is terrible. Are you sure no one found it?"
"Right, there's too many people to say that it wouldn't happen	I'm not sure I agree. What could possibly stop it from happening?"
"This week was the last one for this semester of my college courses	Oh, how long do you have left?"
"Healthcare administration, only 6 months left! I get so antsy waiting to see the final grades, it drives me crazy	I am so jealous of your situation!  I am not sure how you are able to do this!"
"I got woken up by my roommate and I swear his voice is the last thing you want to hear in the middle of the night, sent the fear of God through my veins	Oh man, that must have been terrifying. What was he saying?"
"I don't know, I didn't answer, pretended I was asleep	Oh wow, that is scary, what were you doing?"
"I almost got caught stealing, I felt pretty bad	Oh no! I'm so sorry. Did you get caught?"
"A computer keyboard from my school	That's nice. I've never been to school."
"I'm 38 weeks pregnant, could have my baby any day now!	That's amazing!  Are you excited?"
"Yes, a bit nervous because my first birth was hard, but I know I'm ready and have everything we need for the baby!	That's great. How long did it take?"
"Christmas was the best time of year back in the day!	I agree! I love the holiday season."
"Yeah, it's like there's nothing to worry about	I feel the same way. I think that there's always something to worry about."
"Some random dude walked into my room while I was laying down, couldn't have been more weird	I am sure it was weird. I am a bit jealous of you."
"I was like what the hell, and then he said sorry and walked out	Did you have a good time after?"
"Someone hit my car at walmart today and drove off!	Wow, that's really bad. I hope they catch the person!"
"No, I didn't see it someone reported it to customer service and they paged me. I wish they would have left a note! People have so decency sometimes!	That is so nice of them. I hate when they don't leave a note."
"I saw my favourite candy at the store today! Was so excited, hadn't seen it in a while.	What candy is it?"
"This sour s'ghetti candy by HARIBRO. I use to eat this all the time as a child.	Thats a nasty thing to eat."
"My daughter has been sick for months but she is finally starting to get better!	That is great!  Do you have her on some medication?"
"Thank you, Defenitly! She is still young and most likely won't remember this either!	I'm glad you're so thankful for her."
"My friend showed me his Minecraft world and it was amazing! Looked like he spent days on it	What kind of world did he build?"
"He had created one giant hole and filled it up with water, super cool	Oh wow, that is quite an impressive feat! I would love to see that."
"I had to cancel our family vacation coming up next month.	Oh no! What happened?"
"Yes, his work told him he couldn't go after they already approved the time off. Guess next month is going to be busy at his work :(	That's frustrating.  You know how it is sometimes.  You just have to be patient.  Maybe he'll get it next time."
"Life is good, it's the gift that keeps on giving	I agree! Life is a gift and we should appreciate it"
"Glad you think so as well!	I think so too. I'm always glad to hear that someone is in good spirits."
"I saw a huge cockroach outside my house today!	That's terrifying! Are you going to call a pest control?"
"Not yet since it's the weekend. We live in Texas so they are common but still gross! I'm glad I haven't see any in my house.	What do you mean?"
"I have a big test on Monday, I am so nervous.	I'm sure you'll do great though!"
"It's for my Chemistry class. I haven't slept much because I'm worried so I keep studying.	I hope you do well on your test!"
