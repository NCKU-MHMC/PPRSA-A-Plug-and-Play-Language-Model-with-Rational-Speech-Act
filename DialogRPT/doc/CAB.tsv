"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	i am so sorry to hear that . i am so sorry to hear that ."
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	i am sure you will be fine !"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	i am sure you will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get"

"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	oh no , that is terrible . i hope you were not hurt ."
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	i hope you are ok ."
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	that is awesome ! i hope you are happy for them ."
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	i am glad you are happy to hear that ."
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	oh no , that is terrible . did you get hurt ?"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	i am sorry to hear that ."
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	oh no ! that is a bummer . i hope you get it fixed on it ."
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	i am sure you will get better ."
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	that is great ! i am sure he will be able to be able to pass away ."
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	i am sure he will be able to tell him about it ."
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	that is nice to hear . i hope you are okay !"

"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you have a lot of faith in a lot of people ."
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	i am sure you will be able to meet some people ."
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	i understand that , but i am sure he will not even better than a kid ."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you have a good friend !"

"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	i am sure she will find a good time to find someone else to miss her ."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	that is great ! i am so happy for you !"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	i am sure you will be fine ."
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	i am so sorry to hear that . i have never had to talk to him about it ."
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	that is great . i am sure you will be fine ."
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	that is great ! i am so sorry to hear that ."
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	that is great ! i am glad you were able to go through that ."
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	that is great , i am sure you will be fine ."
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	i am sure you will be fine"
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	that is awesome ! what did you do ?"
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	that is awesome ! i bet you were so proud of them !"
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you are not too ."
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you are not too ."
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	that is so gross . i am so proud of them ."
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	i understand that , i have never heard of them !"
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	that is a good thing to eat !"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	i am glad you were able to eat it"
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	that is so nice . i am so sorry to hear that ."
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	i am sure he will be able to teach him ."
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	that is great , i am sure she will be able to get a relationship with her ?"
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	i am sure she will be able to get a good relationship ."
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you are okay ."
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you are able to find a good relationship ."
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	i am sorry to hear that , i hope she was not a good thing to do that ."
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	i am happy for you . i am happy for you ."
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	i am sorry to hear that . i have never heard of those days ."
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	i am glad you are able to learn to learn ."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	that is awesome ! i bet she was born !"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	i am glad you are able to go through that ."
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	that is awesome ! i bet you will be proud of yourself !"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	i am sure you will win !"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	i am sure you will do great !"
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	i am sorry to hear that . i am sure it was a good thing to have to feel ."
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	that is good . i hope she is okay !"
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	i am sorry to hear that . i have never heard of that ."
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	i am sure you will be fine ."
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	that is so sad . i am so sorry to hear that ."
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	that is a good thing to have to stay home with her ."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	that is awesome ! i love disneyland !"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	i have never been to go to the beach ."
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	that is so sad . i am sorry to hear that ."
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	that is great . i hope you did not know how you feel about it ."
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	that is awesome ! i bet you are happy to have a great time to have a mother-in-law ."
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	i have never had to be able to get that ."
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you find someone else to find someone else to someone else ."
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	i agree , but it is not to do not feel bad"
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	oh no , that is terrible . what happened ?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	that is a good thing to do that . i am sure you will be able to get a lot of people ."
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you find peace ."
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	i am sorry to hear that ! i hope you find a good time to get a good time !"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	i am so sorry to hear that . i have never had to deal with my friend ."
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	i agree , i think i would have been so i have to deal with that ."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	that is terrible . i hope you find someone else to help you and it is not good to help you ."
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you guys were able to help him ."
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	that is a good thing to do that ."
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	oh wow , that is a good thing to hear that ."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	i am so happy for you ."
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	i am sure they will be able to get a health and be able to be able to be able to get it ."
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	that is great ! i am so happy for you ."
"Are your kids adults now?	i am so sorry to hear that . i have been a parent ."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	that is awesome ! i am glad you were able to see it up to you ."
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	i am sure you will have a good time to see it ."
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	that is a good thing to do that ?"
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	i am sure you will do great !"
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	that is awesome ! what did you do ?"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	that is awesome ! i bet you are excited !"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	that is great ! i am sure you will be a great time to have to be able to be with it ."
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	i bet you are a great time to have to go with that !"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	that is a good thing to have to go to a lot of people ."
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	i am sure she will be fine ."
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	that is so scary ! i am sorry to hear that ."
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	that is so scary ! i hope he was not a good idea"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	oh no , that is terrible . i am sorry to hear that ."
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you were not hurt ."
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	oh no ! that is a good thing to do that ?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	i would have been so embarrassed ."
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	i have never been too . i have never heard of it ."
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you did not know that it was not a good idea !"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	that is a good thing to have to sleep ."
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	i am so sorry to hear that ."
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	that is awesome ! that is awesome ! i bet you were happy for him !"
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	i am glad you had a great time to remember that was a great gift ."
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	that is awesome ! i hope you get it !"
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	that is great , i am sure you will get better ."
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	oh no , that is a scary thing to do that ?"
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	wow , that is awesome !"
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	that is a good friend . i am sorry to hear that ."
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	that is so sad . i am sorry to hear that ."
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	that is good , i hope you have a good time to get it !"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	i am sure you will get better !"
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	that is so sad . how long did she pass ?"
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	i am sure she will be able to find someone else to you , but i am sure she will be able to find someone else to be able to talk to her ."
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	that is awesome ! how old is she ?"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	that is so sad , i am sure she will be able to go to the best friend ."
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	that is awesome ! i have been there before i have been there . i have never heard of the beach ."
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	that is awesome ! i hope you have a great time to have a vacation ."
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	that is awesome ! i hope she gets better soon !"
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	i am sure she will be able to get a good time !"
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	that is a good thing to do that they have to leave them"
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	i have never had to go to the same way ."
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	that is awesome ! i bet you were so proud of her ."
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	that is awesome ! i bet you are proud of them ."
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	i have never heard of them . i have never heard of them ."
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	i think that is a good idea ."
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	that is great ! i am sure you will be great !"
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	i agree , i have never heard of people like that , but i have never had to learn from my own ."
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	that is awesome ! i bet you were so proud of them !"
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	i bet that was a great kid !"
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	that is awesome ! what did you do ?"
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	that is great , i am glad you are happy for your mother !"
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	i am sorry to hear that . what happened ?"
"Did they give you any feedback?	i am sorry , i hope you get better , it is not good"
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	i am sure you will do great , but i am sure you will do not learn"
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	that is awesome ! i am so happy for you ."
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	i am so happy for you !"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	i have never been netflix"
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	i know what you mean ."
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	i am sure it was ."
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	that is great ! i am sure you will be able to go to the court ."
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	that is great ! i hope you did not get a good job ?"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	that is terrible . i hope you get it ."
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	i hope you can get a refund"
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	that is so scary ! i hope you are not too scared of it ."
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	i am sure you will be able to go back ."
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	that is awesome ! i bet she was a great friend !"

"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	i am sorry to hear that . i have never had to go to the money ."

"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	oh no ! that is so bad . i hope you get it !"

"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	that is so sweet . what did she do ?"

"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	i would have been so scared of food ."

"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	that is great ! i am sure you will be proud of yourself ."
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	i am sure he will be fine ."

"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	i am sorry to hear that . i am sorry to hear that . i hope you are not care of it ."
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	i am sorry to hear that . i am sorry to hear that . i hope you are okay ."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	that is terrible , i am sorry to hear that . i hope you are not too ."

"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	that is a good thing to do that . i have been a few times like that ."
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	i am sure she will get better ."
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	i am sure you will get better ."
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	i agree , i think i would be too ."
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	i am sure he will be able to get it up to be a surgeon to the surgeon and it is a good thing to do that you have to do it ."
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	that is awesome ! i am sure he will get a surgeon to walk !"
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	that is a good idea . i hope you are not a minor injury ."
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	that is a good idea . i am sure he will be able to get a surgeon to the surgeon ."
"The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.	i am so sorry to hear that . i have been there before . i am sure it was a good time to have to watch it ."

"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!	i have never heard of the movie . i have never heard of my favorite potter ."
"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	i know that is a great time to watch it ."
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	i have never heard of that . i have never heard of my kids ."
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	i am sure you will be able to go to the best friend ."
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	i am glad you had to go back and it was not a good idea ."
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you have a good time ."
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	i am sure you will get better ."
"Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day	that is great . i have never been to go to the brightens ?"

I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!	that is great ! i am glad you are not sure you will be proud of yourself !"
"Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!	i am glad you are not happy for you ."
"How long have you been there?	i am sure you will get better ."
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	i bet that was a great feeling ."
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	that is so frustrating ! did you have to do that ?"
"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.	that is a good idea . i would have been so mad at the laptop ."

"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope he is okay !"

"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	that is cool ! i have never seen that before ."
"Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!	i bet that was a good idea"

"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	oh no ! that is so sad . i am sorry to hear that ."
"Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.	i am sorry to hear that , i am sure she will not even better than you ."
"Yes, they did.	I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!	that is so gross ! i have been so i have been so i have had that ."

"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	i would have been terrified of it ."
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	that is so generous of him ."
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	that is great , i am glad you are able to find someone else to help you ."
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	oh wow ! that is awful ! did you confront him ?"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	i bet that was a good idea ."
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	i have never heard of that , i would be scared to fly by the first time ."
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	i would be too . i have never seen that ."
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	i know how you feel about it ?"
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	that is awesome ! i have never seen that ."
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you have a pet is not good thing to do ."
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	i am sure he will get better ."
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	that is so sweet . i am sure he was a good thing to do that ."
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	i hope you are okay !"
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	oh no ! that is awful ! i hope it was not a good idea ."

"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	that is good . i hope you get it !"

"Criminal and social justice.	I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.	wow , that is awesome ! i bet you were not expecting it ."
"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	i would be so scared"
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	that is awesome ! i bet you are excited !"
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	i am sure they will be able to go to the park ."
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	i am sorry to hear that . i have not imagine that they are not care of them ."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	i am so sorry to hear that . i have never had to deal with my friend ."
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	i am sure you will be fine ."
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	i have never had to go to the cruise ."

"a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is	i have never been to my insurance ."
"I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!	i am so sorry to hear that . i am so sorry to hear that ."
"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	i am sure you will eat a good time !"
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	that is so scary ! i am sorry to hear that ."
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	that is terrible . i hope you are okay ."
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	i am sorry to hear that . i have never had to go to the dog ."
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	i am sorry to hear that . i have never had to go to the way ."
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	oh no , that is terrible . did you find him ?"
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you can find someone else to break ."
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	i am glad you had a good idea ."

"No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you did not eat it ."
"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	oh no ! i bet that was a lot of food !"

"There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	i am glad you had a good time to get a friend ."
"Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it.	i am glad you had to get that ."

"Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.	i am so happy for you ."

"Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.	i am sure you will get better ."
"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!	I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.	that is a bummer . i have never been scared of driving ."
"Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.	i have never had to drive . i have never heard that ."

"Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!	I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	i love that too ! i have never been to remember that was a great time to remember that ."
"It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?	i am so sorry to hear that . i am so happy for you ."
"That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!	i am sure he will be fine ."
"I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.	i am glad you are able to find them ."
"When I was entering the store it was really slippery.	i have never been slippery . i have been there before that i have been a few times like that ."
"It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.	i have never had to go"
"I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.	I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.	i am sorry to hear that . what is it ?"
"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you guys are not married ."
"Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.	I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.	that is awesome ! i am sure they will be able to be able to get it ?"
"I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.	i am sure you will be fine ."
"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	that is awesome ! i am sure she will be able to help her ?"
"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	i am sure she will be fine ."
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	i am sure she will be fine ."
"I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!	i am sure she will be fine ."
"My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.	that is a good thing to do ."
"I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*	that is a good idea . i hope you get it ."
"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	i am sure he will be able to get a lot of money ."
"We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.	i have never been to that . i have never had to be a good brother ."
"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	i am sure he will be able to get a lot of people ."
"Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)	i am so sorry to hear that . i have never been to be a good brother ."
