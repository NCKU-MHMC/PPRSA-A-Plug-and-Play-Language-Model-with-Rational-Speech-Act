"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	oh no , i 'm sorry to hear that . do you think anyone else about it ?"
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	i do not blame you , i would have done the same thing  ."
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	that 's really nice of you . it 's always good to have friends to do that ."
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	i do not blame you , but i do not know what i would do this one .  on the other side of those cars !"
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	that is so sad to hear !"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	i am sure it will be"
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	who are you going to see ?"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	i love that too !"
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	i 'm so sorry to hear that !"
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	i 'm so sorry to hear that !"
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	i 'm so sorry to hear that . i hope he feels better soon ."
"i was singing nursery songs :)	i love it when that happens"
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	what kind of job is it ?"
"thank you so much!	i am sure he will be fine"
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	that is so annoying ! did you report it to the police ?"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	that would be so annoying . you should report him to the police"
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	that is a long time to be together . i hope you have a great time ."
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	that 's a long time to be together . i hope you have fun"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	wow , that is really annoying . did you report him to the police ?"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	i would be so mad if you had to go to work"
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	oh no ! i 'm so sorry to hear that !"
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	i am sorry to hear that . i have been there before ."
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	that 's great to hear , i 'm happy for you ."
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	that 's good to have that kind of relationship"
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	that 's so sweet to hear . i hope it goes well for you ."
"i totally agree with you!	that is so true"
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	i 'm sorry to hear that . do you have friends now ?"
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	that 's great to hear ! i 'm sure you will meet some new friends !"
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	i know what you mean . i hate it when that happens ."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	i would be too ! i have a friend like kids to do that too"
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	oh my god , i would have been so scared !"
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	i love when that happens ! it 's so nice to see someone you love when you do ."
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	i 'm so sorry to hear that . i hope she is okay ."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	that 's great to hear ! i 'm happy for you !"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	i can understand that"
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	that 's great to hear ! what do you plan to do with it ?"
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	i can understand that ! it 's so lucky to have a friend like that !"
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	that 's good to hear . what 's wrong with them ?"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	that is good to hear . i am glad that you got to see them ."
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	i agree with you there , i do not know what i would do without them ."
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	i agree with you there , i do not know what i would do this  ."
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	that was so nice of them !"
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	i bet you were so happy !"
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	i 'm sorry to hear that . do you have any friends with her ?"
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	i know what you mean , i feel that way sometimes things are not worth it ."
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	i can understand that ! it 's always so exciting to see them grow up !"
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	i can understand that ! it 's like that when i was little too !"
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	oh , i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'm sure you will be fine ."
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	oh my gosh , i am sorry to hear that"
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	that is great to hear . i am so happy for you ."
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	i am glad you all had fun"
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	that 's great to hear ! i 'm sure it will be a lot of hard work as long as you have the same !  yourself !"
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	i 'm sure it was a long time , but i 'm sure it will be fun"
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	i do not blame you . i would have felt bad about it as far as possible . i do not blame you , i would n't worry about it . i 'm sure you will be fine ."
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	well , maybe you will not do it again ."
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	i do not blame you , i would have done the same thing"
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	that 's so nice of you to be able to have that kind of money !"
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	it 's always good when you have a good time !"
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	it 's always nice to be able to do that for you !"
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	oh wow , that is great !"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	wow that is a long time"
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	wow , that is amazing news ! i bet you were proud !"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	i am happy for you !"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	i would be too ! i am glad it worked out for you"
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	that 's great ! it 's always good to hear that you are happy !"
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	wow , that is really impressive . i can not wait to move on the next week ."
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	i hate that too . it 's so annoying when you do that . it 's like they have to be done the same time ."
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	i know right ? that is the best"
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	oh no , i 'm so sorry to hear that !"
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	i 'm so sorry to hear that !"
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	that sounds like a lot of fun ! where did you go !"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	that sounds like fun !"
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	that 's so sweet . it 's always good to look back on old times ."
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	that 's so nice to hear . i love when i was a kid"
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	you are so lucky !  her life !"
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	that is so cool . i have never been there"
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	i hate it when that happens . i hate it when that happens . i hate it when that happens . i hate it when that happens . i hate it when that happens . i hate it when that happens . i hate it when that happens . i"
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	i know . i hate it    ."
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	oh that sucks . did you find out who did it ?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	i would be too"
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	oh no ! i 'm so sorry to hear that ! i know how hard it can be for a while you are away !"
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	i am so sorry to hear that !"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	i agree with you there . i have been in that situation before ."
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	i am so sorry to hear that !"
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	oh no , i 'm sorry to hear that . do n't be too hard on yourself . i 'm sure you felt bad , i 'm sure you understand your feelings ."
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	well , i am sure you have a good reason ."
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	i would be so mad ! what did you do ?"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	oh wow , i would be so mad ! i would be so mad !"
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	it is good to be content with what you do ."
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	i do agree with you"
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	i know what you mean . my kids are the best . i miss most about my childhood days too !"
"Are your kids adults now?	i know right ? they make you feel good about them ."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	that 's great to hear ! i 'm happy for you !"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	i am happy for you !"
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	i do not blame you , i would be worried about that  all the time"
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	i can understand that"
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	i 'm sorry to hear that ."
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	that 's so annoying . maybe you should talk to her about it ?"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	that sounds like a lot of fun ! where are you going ?"
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	that sounds like a lot of fun ! i hope you have a great time !"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	that 's too bad . what do you plan to do ?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	well that is good of you to do ."
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	that 's so scary . did you have fun ?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	i would have been so scared ! i would have done the same thing ."
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	oh no ! i 'm so sorry to hear that . i hope you find some help ."
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	wow , you must have felt really bad about it  in your life ."
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	i bet you were excited  . did you have fun ?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	i hope you have a great time !"
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	oh no ! i 'm so sorry to hear that !"
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	i would be so mad !"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	that is awesome . you could have been so excited ."
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	that is amazing , you must be excited !"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	that is so sweet ! i would have been so excited !  for you !"
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	that is really nice of you to do such a thing ."
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	that 's great to hear ! i 'm happy for you !"
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	i hope you have a great job !"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	oh no . what happened ?"
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	i would have been so scared ! i 'm glad you are okay !"
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	that 's so annoying . did you confront him about it ?"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	i would be so mad too . you must have to be happy for him"
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	oh no , that is so gross ! i hope you were able to clean it up !"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	i hope you will not be careful next time ."
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	well , i 'm sure she will understand . if you do not mind she will understand . if you do not mind it that you would be happy about it .  her ."
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	well , i am sure she will forgive you"
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	i would have been so scared ! what did you do ?"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	i would have been so too ! i 'm glad you are okay !"
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	cool ! where are you going ?"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	i love the beach , i love the beach !"
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	wow , that must have been very proud of her !"
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	wow , that is amazing . good for you guys !"
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	i hate when that happens ! i always feel like that . i do not like it ."
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	i know right ? some people just do not like it  ."
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	that 's great to hear ! i 'm happy for you !"
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	i am glad to hear that !"
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	that is good to hear . what do you do ?"
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	that sounds like a lot of work ! i 'm happy for you !"
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	i agree , it is good for kids to have such a great time !"
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	i agree . i am sure they are very smart  ."
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	that 's so cool ! i 've always wanted to work with friends and have n't been able to get all over them . i 'm happy for you ."
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	that sounds like a great plan . i am sure it will be a good day for you !"
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	that is so sweet ! i am happy for you !"
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	i am happy for you !"
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	yes , i know . it 's so hot where i live ."
"Did they give you any feedback?	i think you are right ."
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	i hope you do too"
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	wow ! congrats to her ! !"
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	i would be so happy for both of them !"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	i am not sure what you are talking about ."
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	i have never heard of it ."
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	i do not like it at all"
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	that 's great to hear . i 'm glad you got it ."
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	that 's good to hear . i hope it was a good day"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	i hate when that happens ! i hate when that happens : ( i really hate it when i used to have a long time ago"
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	i hate it when that happens"
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	wow , you are lucky to have you ?"
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	i can understand that"

"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	that 's so cool , what kind of dog was it ?"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	that sounds like a lot of fun"
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	that was very nice of them ."

"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	that 's good to hear . i hope you guys have a lot of fun !"

"How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.	i know right ? it 's always good to see old friends that is for sure ."
"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	i hate when that happens . it makes me feel better and i do not like them as much as i used to .  , but i always have to do that for me ."

"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	i hope you feel better soon !"

"I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.	i can understand that"
"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	that 's so cool . do you think he 'll be able to do it ?"
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	that 's so nice of him !"

"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..	wow , that is really nice of you to do that . i love my mom a lot of my mom ."

"Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?	i have n't , but it is probably worth the best . especially if you are a little guy ."
"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..	i can understand that  for me as well . i used to be a kid when i was little ."
"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	i 'm so sorry to hear that !"

So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap.

"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	oh no ! i would be so upset if that happened . are you excited ?"
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	that 's so annoying . maybe you should talk to them about it ?"
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	wow . what did she do ?"

"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	she sounds like a keeper !"

I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	oh no ! i 'm so sorry to hear that . maybe next time you will be more careful and find out if you do not have you right ?"
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	i think you will be fine , just make sure you buy another !"
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	oh no ! i hope you were able to get it !"
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	i hope you feel better soon !"

"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	that 's too bad . what do you think she is ?"

"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	that 's so great . i 'm happy for you ."
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	that sounds like a lot of fun ! i 'm sure it is going to be so good !"

"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	i 'm sorry to hear that . i know how you feel , i have been through that ."
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	i 'm sorry to hear that . i hope you feel better soon ."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	i 'm so sorry to hear that ."

"We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.	i 'm sorry to hear that ."
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	i would be mad , that is so annoying . maybe you should talk to her about it ?"
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	i do not blame you ! i would be mad !  the time , i would be mad !  the time , i would be mad !"
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	i would be mad too  for me"
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	i would be mad too"
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	oh man , i would have been so excited ! i 'm sure you will be fine !"
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	oh no ! i hope you are able to get it !"
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	i am sure you will be fine"
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	i can understand that  , i am sure you will be fine"
"The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.	it 's always good to be prepared !"

"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!	i do not like them lol"
"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	it is a good way to remember the good old days"
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	i do not like to see that much"
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	that 's great ! i 'm happy to hear that !"
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	that 's good to hear !"
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	what kind of job do you have ?"
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	i would have been so scared ."
"Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day	that 's good to hear . what 's wrong with this ?"
"Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!	that 's good to hear !"
"Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing	Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking	wow , that must have been pretty terrifying . what did you do ?"
"I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill	well i 'm sure you did not have a fun time !"
"Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed	When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks	oh no ! i 'm so sorry that happened to you !"

I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!	that 's great , good for you !"
"Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!	that 's great to hear ! i hope you got to spend it all the time together !"
"How long have you been there?	i am sure it will !"
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	i do not have to work so much for me  . i really hope you get it"
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	wow , that is amazing !  !"
"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.	i can understand that"
"If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*	I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!	i bet you were proud !"

"He kinda gave me the ""Mom, really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*	i do not blame you , i would have done the same thing !"
"I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].	i think you will be fine next time"
"It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD	i do not blame you . i would have done the same thing !"
"I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.	oh no ! i 'm sure it was not a good idea , but i 'm sure they will forgive you ."
"No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.	oh , that is too bad . i 'm sure he 'll forgive you next time ."

"My friend has been on the couch for a few weeks. He is getting under my skin now.	are you happy for him to be jealous ?"

"My parents health has deteriorated rapidly, and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.	i am so sorry to hear that . i hope you find someone you love her ."

"Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions	was it a long trip ?"

"I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight.	that 's terrible . i 'm sorry to hear that ."

"I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.	i do not blame you . i would be upset if i were you ."
"Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing.	oh wow , i hope it works out for you then ."
"It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!	it 's good that you are prepared ."
"Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.	I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times	wow that sounds like a lot of fun ! did you have a lot of fun ?"
"A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse	sounds like a lot of fun"
"Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work.	The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.	oh no , i hate it when that . did you get it ?"
"I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.	that is a good way to start the next week ."
"One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.	wow , that sounds like a lot of fun ! did you ever find it ?"
"Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.	i would have been so scared ! i would have done the same !"

"I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.	I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!	i 'm not sure what that is , but i 'm sure you will be fine !"
"Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!	i am sure it will work out"

"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	i 'm sorry to hear that ."
"Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.	i know how you feel . i have had that happen a few times before i know how it feels ."
"I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.	i 'm sure you will do fine ."
"Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.	that 's great that you were able to do it !"
"I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!	that is so sweet of them !"
"Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.	i would be too . i can not imagine having to deal with that like that one day"
"Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!	i am sure it is"
"I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.	I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.	did it get you ?"
"Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck	i am sure you will be fine"
"Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!	So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.	oh no . i 'm so sorry to hear that . you must have been so happy ."
"Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.	that was very nice of them  ."
"I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.	i 'm sure it was a hard time . did you have a good time ?"
"Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha	well that is good that you have such a hard time !"
"I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.	that 's so sweet . do you have any kind of help ?"
"I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.	you are so lucky to have that kind of you !"
"I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.	oh no , i 'm sorry to hear that . i hope he is in a better place now ?"
"I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!	that 's too bad . i am sure he is a good friend !"
"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	that 's too bad . i 'm sure he 'll come back  ."
"Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!	I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.	i would be so jealous ! how did you find it ?"
"She won $5,000 and never offered to share.	i would be so jealous ! i would love to be able to work with my friend !"
"I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.	good luck ! i 'm sure you will do great ."
"I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.	good luck !"
"I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.	it is always good to be prepared ."
"Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on	it is always good to be prepared ."
"I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!	wow ! i would have been so scared ! i would have done the same !"
"Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.	i would have been so scared ! i would have done the same thing ."
"Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!	My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	i 'm sure she feels the same about you . it 's so nice to hear that you love her ."
"Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?	i 'm sure it is , but it is nice to have someone around you  ."
"I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.	good for you . i 'm sure you will do great things you have to be prepared ."
"There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.	i am sure you will be fine"
"Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!	i hate when that happens . some people are so annoying ."
"Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe	i would be too . some people are so rude to me ."
"I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.	that is great . you must be very proud ."
"I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?	i would be too !"
"I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.	oh my goodness , that must have been so scary !"
"Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!	i am glad you are safe !"
"I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.	i 'm so sorry to hear that . it must be so hard to deal with it when you are right ?"
"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	i am so sorry to hear that ."
"It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.	My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.	that 's awesome . you must be excited ."
"I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.	that 's good to hear . i hope it goes well ."
"I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!	that sounds like fun ! what kind of place is it ?"

"I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.	that 's a lot of money ! how did you do that ?"
"That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.	i am sure you will get it"
"We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.	that 's so nice of her . i bet she was happy ."
"Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.	that 's so nice of them . i have a lot of kids myself ."
"I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.	i hate when that happens . did you find it ?"
"That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!	i would have been so mad , i would have been mad too ."
"I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.	i do too . it is nice to be alone ."
"Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.	i know what you mean . i used to watch it all the time . it 's the best for now ."
"Nah, I don't get to to bad.	I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!	that sounds like a lot of fun ! where are you going ?"

"This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.	i know how you feel"
"Not even a little.	i hope you do not get sick !"
"I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.	that 's so sweet . i also have a dog and a dog ."
"Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems	that 's good . i 'm glad it worked out ."
"I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house	oh my goodness , that must have been so scary !"
"It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.	i hope so , too ."
"Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.	I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.	how was it ?  ?  ?"
"Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.	i know what you mean . i am sure they will be able to remember the good times !"
"I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.	that is a lot of work ! where are you going to do it ?"
"No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?	i do not like them either"
"I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.	that 's so cool ! did you have fun ?"
"She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.	oh wow . that is amazing ."
"You know you could still do it. I know you can.	you have a really good friend"
"My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.	that was so nice of him . did you have fun ?"

"You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.	i 'm sure you will , good luck !"
"It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.	i hope you get the job ."
"I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.	that is so gross . i hope it was not your case then ."
"Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.	i would have done that too ."
"Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.	Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.	that 's great , what kind of things did you do ?"
"It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.	that 's so sweet ."
"I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her.	i do not think that is what i would do"
"I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!	wow , that is so far away ! you must be feeling very lonely ."
"It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!	i can understand that . it is so hard to lose weight as a kid . i 'm so sorry to hear that !"
"Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!	i can imagine . i have been there before and it is so much fun"
"I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.	i 'm sorry to hear that . i hope you have some good memories ."
"Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.	i 'm sorry to hear that . i hope you feel better soon ."
"I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.	i know what you mean , but why do you think it is a good thing you do not want to be alone as long as possible ?"
"We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!	i hope you do not get that one !"
"Me too! <fist bump> ;-)	So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.	that 's so sweet . you must be so happy to see that you were so happy !"
"He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.	that 's a good thing to do ."
"I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.	oh no , i hate it when that happens !"
"I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?	i do not blame you . i would be so mad at them"
"You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope things get better for her ."
"She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.	well , i am sure it was a long time ."
"I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.	I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.	i can understand that . it 's always nice to be confident ."
"Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too.	it 's good that you do not have that kind of relationship ."
"One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.	oh wow , that is great to hear . i am sure it will be fine  ."
"She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year.	that is a long time !"
"June and July are very busy, June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.	are you excited about it ?"
"So much for relaxing during the summer?	it 's always good to be prepared ."
"Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.	i do not blame you . it is so scary for you to be that way ."
"It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.	well it is good that you do not have to worry about it !"

It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!	that was very kind of you ! i would have been so scared !"
"It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.	that 's good to have that all you can do"

"So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.	did you have a good time ?"

"I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive, small, and bland!	i would have been so scared !"
"In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.	i 'm sorry to hear that , what happened ?"
"If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.	i 'm glad you were able to find a new job !"
"I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol. I'm all for earnest discussion, but not at work!	My husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber. He was able to carry so much at once!	that 's amazing . you must have been so excited ."
"He is! I was so shocked but super attracted to him too!	i would be too ! i would be so proud of him !"
"i was really sad when my dog died last year	i am sorry to hear about your dog ."

"A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer, but he got a job and had to cancel.	oh no . i 'm so sorry to hear that ."
"Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.	that 's too bad . maybe he needs more ?"
"I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.	My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday, we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe, have fun, and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call, we found out that she had a heart attack and died.	i 'm so sorry to hear that . i hope you feel better soon ."

"Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.	Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!	i have never heard of it"
"I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.	it 's good to have that kind of relationship is it"
"I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.	I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!	what kind of it is it ?"
"I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies.	i love it too , i love it !"
"I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies.	I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face!	oh my gosh ! i would have been so scared !"
"I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled!	i would have been too !"

"Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day.	aww that is nice"
"It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back.	I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled.	wow , that is really annoying . i have a friend who have that kind of relationship is it . i love that , but i can understand how you would feel so much money . i have a job , but i would n't have been able to get"
"I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.	i would be too ! i am so happy for you !"
"I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.	I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!	i would have been so mad !  them !"
"It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.	what kind of cake was it"
"It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!	my son is sick, he got this hand foot and mouth desease, nothing serious but he has a fever	i hope he feels better soon !"

"I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.	that is good to hear . what do you like about it ?"
"I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!	that is good to hear ! what do you plan on doing with it ?"
"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	i hate when that happens . it 's so annoying ."
"Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.	i hate when that happens  . it 's so annoying ."
"Yes, they did.	I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!	oh gross ! that must have been disgusting !"
"I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden!	my cat does that all the time so i feel you it had to clean up my dog 's cat , some things happen too ."
"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	me too ! what do you plan to do with it ?"
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	i agree with you there ."
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	what was it ?"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	i would have felt the same ! i hate to hear that !"
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	that was nice of him . what did he do ?"
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	you are a good friend ."
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	wow , that is amazing . you must be so proud ."
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	that 's so sweet ! i would be too !"
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	i do not blame you . it 's been a long time since then ."
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	i do not blame you . i think you will be fine ."
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	i hate when that happens . it makes me feel better ."
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	i hate when that happens . i hope you find someone you are"
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	i 'm sorry to hear that . have you tried looking for him ?"
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	i 'm sorry to hear that . i hope you find him ."
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	oh no . how old is she ?"
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	i can understand that"
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	i 'm sorry to hear that . are you able to get it fixed ?"
"I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.	i would be so mad at them"
"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	that is a lot to be prepared ."
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	i hope you have fun !"
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	that 's awesome . what was it ?"
"Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.	that is good"
"Criminal and social justice.	I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.	i am sure it was . did you have a good time ?"
"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	i am sure it was"
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	oh no , i 'm sorry to hear that . i hope you feel better soon ."
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	i hope you feel better soon !"
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	i am so sorry to hear that . i know how you feel . i have been through that too , and i know how you feel ."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	i 'm so sorry to hear that . i know how you feel ."
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	that sounds like so much fun ! where did you go ?"
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	i hope you have a great time !"
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	wow , that must have been a very hard time for her . i do not know what i would do ."

"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	i hope you can make it up to it !"
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	oh no ! what happened ?"
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	i would be too"
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	i 'm sorry to hear that !"
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	what kind of dog ?"
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	i 'm sorry to hear that ."
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	i 'm sorry to hear that ."
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	that was very nice of them ."
"I will, you never know when someone else is in need!	it 's always good to have something like that ."

"I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.	oh no ! i 'm so sorry to hear that ."
"No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.	i hope you can find a way too !  it is not a good thing ."
"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	oh no ! i 'm so sorry to hear that !"
"I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards	did you hurt yourself ?"
"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	what movie was it ?"
"I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.	i would have been too !"

"I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.	i have n't seen it yet , i love it !"
"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	i do not like them lol"

"Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.	thats so sweet"

"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	i would be so mad ! i would have been mad too !"
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	i can understand why you would be happy that you did !  her  !"

I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	i 'm so sorry to hear that !"

"Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!	i love dogs !  !"
"Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is.

"Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.	that 's great . it is always good to know that you are happy ."
"Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.	that is so cool . do you play mario ?"

"Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?	I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.	what job is it ?"

"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	i am sure it will go well  make sure you do .  for you !"

"I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.	i hate when that happens . it makes you feel good ."
"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	i bet you are so proud !"
