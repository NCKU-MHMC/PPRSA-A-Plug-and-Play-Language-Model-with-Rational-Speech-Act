"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	That sounds pretty scary. What happened?"
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	i bet you did!"
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	That's what happened. I was at the beach and my neighbor was at the pool"
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	It's always scary when that happens. I'm glad you're alright!"
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	i bet that sucks"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	That is terrible. I hope everything works out for you."
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	That sounds like fun!"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	Oh, I'm sorry to be rude. I know it's a concert, and it is expensive."
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	That's so tragic. What did happen?"
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	I am so sorry for that. I am not sure if you are just being a little dramatic."
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	That's so nice of you."
"i was singing nursery songs :)	That's so sweet of you!  I bet your friend was a little sad, but happy to have someone to take care of his baby and make sure he doesn't hurt."
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	That sucks. What is he doing now?"
"thank you so much!	That's a tough spot. I hope you're all staying positive!"
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	Oh no! Did they run away?"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	That's terrible. I would do the same thing."
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	That's great! What city are you going to?"
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	That's really nice, how long have you lived in the US?"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	That's really bad, you're right though. You could have just let it go"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	That sounds like a pretty crappy situation.  Did you ever see him again after that?"
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	I'm sure that was frustrating, but at least they are trying to keep the prices in check."
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	That's the worst. I hate when they do that."
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	That sounds awful. What did you end up saying to him?"
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	I bet she was hurt. But she's probably better off with him now."
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	I'm happy for you."
"i totally agree with you!	I know, it is so peaceful."
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	That's a tough one, but I'm sure they will come back around."
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	I feel that way too. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one out of all my friends who live out in the country."
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	It's hard to discipline kids these days."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	I know the feeling! I was at the park with my kids the other day and they were running around, playing and laughing, when a little girl started yelling and crying. She was throwing a ball and it was being thrown back and forth, and then she got it and threw it right back at her friend. She then picked up the ball and started to throw it back and forth again and again and again and again and again until it was being thrown right at her friend's face and then"
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	I'm sure it was not a good experience. What kind of bug was it?"
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	That sounds nice. Did she call you?"
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	Yeah, it was good to hear from her."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	I have two kids myself.  How old is your first child?"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	I have had two children so far. I think it's the first time for me to have a child, so I am really looking forward to this new experience."
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	That is the most amazing feeling. I once had a payment come in on time and I had just moved to a new city and had just gotten a new job. I was so excited to start my first week, but my new boss had already moved into the office and was already setting up the office. I was in the middle of moving and didn't even have time to unpack. I was so nervous and worried. I was sitting at my desk when I got the call that I had to"
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	Yeah, it happens a lot in life.  But I have a friend that is always good to me, and I'm grateful every day that I'm in his life."
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	I bet. What happened?"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	That's really sad. I hope she is okay."
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	That's really interesting. I don't know what my intuition is leading me but I think I should follow it. I'm not sure I trust myself, though. I'm a little afraid to go with my gut feeling."
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	That's great! I have to listen more to my intuition too. I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately so I'm taking a step back and doing some self care and meditation."
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	That's so nice of them. What year did you turn 18?"
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	That's awesome! I bet that made the day even better."
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	That's a lot of girls."
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	I understand that feeling, but it is a normal part of life."
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	I agree, I remember mine being the same age but they're so different. I'm so proud of them."
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	I can't imagine how different they were. I had twins."
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	It is so hard to resist their chicken nuggets!  I had them once for a few years and I was so addicted that my husband had to take the kids away from me and go to the store to get them.  He had to come home and get me because I was in such a bad state!"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	I am sure it wasn't that empty, I would probably be in there too if they were empty"
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	That's a good point, it really made me appreciate my family even more."
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	I love kids.  What kind of orphanage did you go to?"
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	I am sorry to hear about your relationship. I hope that it will improve."
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	It is a hard thing to navigate. I've been there myself.  But I think I can handle myself.  I just want my family to be happy and at peace."
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	I know the feeling.  I was in sixth grade.  I did the same thing to a girl.  I didn't realize what I was doing until I saw her in a different light.  She was in the school's cheerleading squad and I wanted to join."
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	I can relate to this. I was a bit of a mean guy as well. I was always looking at the ""other"" kids to tease and try to get a rise out of them."
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	That's really sad. I hope you can find some comfort."
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	Oh man! What a leader! How cool!  What kind of work does he do?"
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	You are an inspiration!"
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	I don't really have time to think about that stuff. I'm a busy dad, and my kids are always getting in the way. I'm trying to do the right thing, but I'm just a little overwhelmed and I don't know where to start."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	It's great to see kids grow.  How big is the baby now?"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	Yeah, that's the life of being a friend, right?"
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	Oh wow! Congratulations! What did you run for?"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	That is so cool!  What did it feel like? Was it hard?"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	I bet that was a lot of fun!  I love the Venice Marathon!"
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	That's a bummer. What did you do?"
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	That's a tough situation, I'm sorry to hear that."
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	I know the feeling.  It is so hard when it happens."
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	It is very difficult for me to understand how some people can be so cruel and hateful towards others.  It's hard for me to understand the point they are trying to make."
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	Oh no! That's terrible! Did she get the best care possible?"
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	I am sorry to hear that, I hope she does well."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	It is such a fun place to visit. I've always wanted to go. What are you planning on doing?"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	That is so cool! I wish you had the opportunity to take your kids!"
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	That is so sweet. What did you guys talk about?"
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	That's great. I'm sure that is a big change for you."
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	I do!"
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	It is so helpful, but sometimes I am so lazy."
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	Yeah, that can be annoying, but I think most people don't even check email that often."
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	I agree.  It's hard to get anyone to respond to an email, even with the internet.  It's like, it's not like you have to send a letter in the mail to someone."
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	Oh no! Did it get resolved?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	I'm sorry to say but I've been in a situation like that."
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	Oh that is so sad! How old are the kids?"
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	Yeah, that's true. I feel lonely when I am away from my family too often."
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	Oh yeah, that is a common problem. People often underestimate themselves, and it's a problem that I've had to deal with many times in my life."
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	I'm not one of those people. I think the more you know, the less likely you are to be wrong. That's why you should always trust people, even when they're wrong."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	That's not cool. Did he get over it eventually?"
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	That's so nice of you.  He probably would have just gotten it out of his system later.  He probably didn't think about how it could be perceived."
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	Yeah I can't stand that. I'd give him a good kick in the pants and tell him to get off my kid's lawn"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	That's so rude."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	That's great, you're so positive and healthy!"
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	I am always looking for a new way to help others."
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	I love looking back at old pictures! What were they doing?"
"Are your kids adults now?	You have to admit, that's a good feeling to have, but at the same time, I don't think I'd want to go through those photos again. I'd probably have to cry."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	It's a feeling that you've never experienced before, but it's also one that can be very fleeting. I'm not saying it's not something to be proud of, but at the end of the day, confidence in yourself is something that's hard to maintain, especially in the early days of a relationship."
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	I can relate to that. I had my wedding done the same way 6 months later."
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	It can be tough, but it's nice to work for yourself."
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	That is great! I love the idea of doing something you love and making money off of it."
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	That's unfortunate, did it go well?"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	Yeah, I would hate that too, especially after all the time you've spent together."
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	It sounds like a great time! What's your favorite thing to do?"
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	That sounds amazing! I love the beach!"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that!  What happened?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	Oh no! Did she have any excuse?"
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	I'm sorry, but what happened?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	Oh wow! That's crazy! What did you do?"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	That's so funny. What happened?"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	That is crazy. I'm sorry she didn't make it to dinner."
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	I bet it was embarrassing!  Did you talk to anyone about it?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	Yeah, that's the worst!"
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to find a replacement concert."
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	I'm not sure if you were kidding or not but I'm not sure if I believe you."
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	That's a good one. Who was on the couch?"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	I am so sorry, did he hurt?"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	Oh, I bet. I love when that happens."
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	It sounds like he really cares about you.  What gifts did he give you for Mother's Day?"
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	That sounds exciting! What kind of job was it?"
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	That sounds awesome.  I'm a freelancer myself.  You're doing a good job."
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	I have never been taken ""hostage"""
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	That's crazy! Did you guys ever catch up with DiDi again?"
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	That's so rude of him!"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	That must have been a bit shocking and embarrassing."
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	That sounds like a nightmare. I bet you were soooo annoyed!"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	That is awful, how did you get rid of the food?"
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	I bet that was awkward."
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	That's terrible, she has to be so worried."
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	Oh that's so sweet! Did you guys get to spend time together?"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	Yeah, it's pretty funny. I bet you felt like the most awkward person on earth."
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	I hope you have a great time!"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	That sounds amazing! I've never been, but I've heard it's great."
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	Yeah she's a smart kid, I'm sure she will be a fine adult"
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	I do, and I'm glad she found it! I'm proud of her too, she's doing well!"
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	I know right, I'm always frustrated when people leave their cars and trash on the side of the road."
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	It's not that big of a deal to me but it really is a big deal to me. I'm always trying to help the store employees with their carts."
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	That's amazing! How old are you?"
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	That is so sweet.  I hope you have a baby soon."
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	That's awesome!  What kind of flow are you talking about?"
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	You're an interesting guy.  I've never really been in that type of work, but I'm sure you're a very skilled one.  I'm glad you're doing something meaningful and helpful.  I'm a bit envious that you get to be involved with so many different organizations.  What do you do for work?"
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	It makes sense.  I think it's good for a leader to be surrounded by people that are better than themselves.  It makes them look good in front of others."
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	It's so hard to be in a position of power and still not be able to motivate others to do their best work. I wish there was more people out there who are more willing to put in effort to be better than they already are."
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	I love the way you put your words together!  That was a fun experience to have."
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	That sounds like a fun day."
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	I'm glad you got something you wanted. What was your favorite gift?"
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	I am glad you had a great mother's Day. What were you giving to?"
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	I think it was a car accident. The driver didn't follow traffic rules and crashed into a pole."
"Did they give you any feedback?	That's too bad, I hope it all worked out."
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	I am always looking for feedback. I am trying to improve my performance at work. I am trying to improve my performance at school as well."
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	That's awesome! I've always wanted to have kids."
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	That's awesome!  What's the baby's gender?  I hope she's healthy."
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	Oh no, what did you do instead? I didn't watch Netflix either."
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	Oh no, what did you do instead?  Did you watch Netflix? Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one."
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	I have not heard of it. I would love to watch it."
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	Did you get the job you applied for?"
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	That is great news! You must be so proud of yourself!"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	I know right? It's so frustrating when you have to wait so long to get to work!"
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	That sounds awful.  What are you driving?"
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	Oh wow.  That's pretty scary.  Did you get away?"
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	Yeah, that's what I thought. I mean, I'm sure the sequels are fine. I'm sure it's not like the first one was bad."
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	That's really cool. I'm glad she did well."
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	I am so happy for your best friend!"
"I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.	Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.	I bet that was disappointing."
"I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.	I hope it works out."
"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	I am sure you got one! I am sure you are very happy!"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	I'm glad to hear! I have a dog and it was fun."
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	That's awesome that your parents were there for you."
"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed	Yeah, I'm glad they helped out, I would have struggled to get my first house."
"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.	That's good to hear. It is good to be independant."
"Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married	That sounds like you will be ready for a long time"
"My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.	Oh wow. That must be tough. I hope you can find something similar."
"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.	That's a good point. I guess that is why some of the best surgeons are also the best paid."
"True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future	Oh, that sounds interesting. What kind of adviser is that?"
"I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path	that's great. what kind of job is it?"
"That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?	Oh man! What is it that can you do about it?"
"You could chat to them and complain!	I agree, that's disgusting. What kind of situation?"
"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.	That's very kind of her!  I'm sure she was worried about you."
"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	That is very kind of her, I hope you are able to get your own apartment and be independent."
"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.	Oh wow. I bet you are excited about it."
"I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.	Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood	I agree, it was a good time, and I have some good memories of it too"
"I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era	Oh wow, that's great that you are keeping that connection alive. I hope you can keep it going!"
"The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.	Oh wow, that was a blast from the past!"
"Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.	Oh my gosh, I remember when Facebook first came out and how excited everyone was about it! I was so excited to try it out, but it was so overwhelming! I ended up deleting it after a few weeks"
"How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.	That's cool. I'm 35, and I grew up in the 80s and the 90s. I'm a 20s, and I grew up in the 2000s."
"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	I agree.  I had to fight a bullie in high school.  He was really tough.  I won."
"Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?	That is the truth! I used to have to fight all the time in school."
"I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.	It's a pretty fun movie. I'm a big kid so I love it"
"Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.	That's a shame, but I guess it's a great movie. It was released a few years ago."
"My parents keep taking my money	I am sure they do. They are old people and they need the money."
"They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.	Yeah I can't even save anything because they take it. I am so mad!"
"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!	That is a good point. I am not sure why that has happened."
"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)	I think it is a matter of personal preference. I don't have any ants around. I like to keep my home tidy and organized."
"The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.	I am sorry to hear that.  That was a tough time."
"She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.	I'm sorry for your loss.  I'm sure it was very difficult.  I'm sorry."
"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.	I am so sorry to hear that, but I am sure she is okay. I hope she never has to deal with something like that again."
"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	It's a great way to cope. It really helped me heal when I was able to do that. I had my daughter named after her. It was a tough decision."
"A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.	That is a tough situation, but you made it. Did you get a car?"
"We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!	That is so cool! I wish that was possible for me."
"Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind.	That is awesome. I hope that happens to me soon."
"Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.	That's nice. What happened?"
"That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.	Oh my gosh, yeah, I've had those before too, but it's not as common for me to ask for one. I think I might be the only one in my household who has ever asked for one."
"Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops.	It was raining hard one night and the power shut off	I am sorry to hear that!  Are you safe?  Did you have to wait for the storm to pass?"
"Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles	That's crazy! I hate when the power goes out and you have to be so careful. Did you have to use a candle wick?"
"One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam. It was hard and I studied all night.	That's really smart. How did you do?"
"I ended up actually getting a 98%!	Yeah, you should be proud of that!"
"Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.	Do you have any pets?	I do!"
"Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff.	That's so cute. I have a dog and he's so lazy."
"My son graduated.	That's awesome. What high school is it?"
"Highschool.	Oh wow! Congratulations. How old is your son?"
"One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.	That must've been hard.  I hope everything worked out for you."
"I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.	That's really tough. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have a support group or a counselor to help you through it?"
"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	I know, it is so cool."
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	That is so cool, what kind of business does he have?"
"I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.	I'm sorry."
"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..	That sounds terrible. You could just tell her it's a family heirloom and you can't let her get rid of it."
"No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.	That's really nice of your auntie. I bet she would be proud of you too"
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?	I love that. It's like you're transported to the past."
"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..	Yeah, I have heard it a lot too. It's like you can hear yourself singing along and remembering the good times you had."
"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	Oh no. What happened to the cat?"
"It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(	It was so sad. I lost my dog too."
"Thank you. I appreciate that.	I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.	That is so sad. What happened to the dog?"
"The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha	That's terrible. I lost my dog last week. She was only 4 months old."
"Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.	Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends, so gross.	It sounds like a pretty gross experience. Did you end up getting sick enough to have to stay in the bathroom for a few hours?"
"Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it	I have never tried raw oysters.  Is it really that bad?"
"You don't care for sushi that much?	I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!	I have never been one for the prank life.  That is pretty funny though.  What kind of prank was it?"
"I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!	I would be upset, that's not a good prank"
"My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.	That sucks! Do you feel like going on a date?"
"I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.	That sucks, but you should try to focus on the positive, and also think about what you can do to improve your life.  I'm sorry."
"I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.	Yeah, it is scary, but you can do anything you want to."
"We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha	It's hard, but I know you will be fine, and you're not alone."
"I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.	That's terrible! What are you going to do?"
"I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.	I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure it will work out."
"I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.	That's great! What's she like?"
"I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.	That is great! I have been there."
"I am very lucky, my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?	That is so true! I have had some of the best birthdays ever! I was a little scared, but my friends made it a party!"
"Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!	That's a pretty great gift! What's a great gift?"
"For sure, maybe you need new friends!	5	I am so angry at my wife, I don't know what to do."
"I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.	That is unfortunate. Did they ever talk it over?"
"I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.	Oh no! Did you ever figure out what it was?"
"Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt, though.	I'm glad you're safe.  That's scary."
"Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?	i do, i love marshmallows on hot chocolate"
"Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha	That is so nice.  I love the marshmallas."
"I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.	I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me, even to this day.	She does. I am very thankful to her for everything she does."
"I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.	I bet she loves that"
"You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?	That's true, I'm not the best person, but I'm not the worst. I've made plenty of mistakes, and I'm working to fix them."
"But you failed the exam? Did you revise?	I failed because my friend gave me a cheat sheet."
"At least you know for next time eh?	My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.	I bet that was a good moment."
"She's amazing. Do you love your mom?	I do! I'm so thankful for her."
"I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.	I hate when that happens. I'm sure it will work out for her."
"It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month, so I will likely discuss it when she returns.	That's a tough situation. I hope she comes back soon."
"That sounds tough. What do you do/	That is tough. I have been through that."
"That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.	That's a tough one. It is hard work. I hope you are paid well."
"Fair enough. As long as you look after your back""	I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.	Oh, I'm glad you feel hopeful. What are you majoring in?"
"Environmental engineering! I enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.	That sounds interesting! I've always thought about that field but haven't pursued it. Do you plan on studying environmental engineering after college?"
"I watch so many scary movies that I haven't been able to sleep alone in years due to fear.	That is a terrible thing. What movies are you watching?"
"I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.	Oh, that's a little too much. I think you should get a new job and get away."
"I've been telling myself that for years, I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?	It really depends on what you're in the mood for."
"What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?	I'm a fan of horror movies, especially the old-school ones."
"Donald Trump is now the president. It makes me feel bad about life.	Oh, I know!  I was so excited when Obama was elected!"
"I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him, too.	That is a good thing. I am glad real conservatives are not the only ones that don't agree with him."
"I am now going to be a master's student. I will got to he University of Florida	That is a great achievement! What are you going for a master's degree in?"
"Environmental Engineering is my major. I enjoy it.	I am glad you get to be a master's student. What are you studying for?"
"I have been feeling very faithful these days. My lover treats me so well.	That's great.  I have been feeling the same way.  I have been feeling very lucky."
"He is really nice and provides for me well. He is also very sweet and very respectful.	I am happy for you."
"Do you like to go through old family pictures?	I love that! I like to go through them every now and then and see how I've grown and changed."
"Absolutely. I love to hear my mÃ¡mÃ¡ tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.	I love going through old family pictures.  Its a great way to see what life was like in the past."
"I also love to look through the old scrapbooks my mom made when I was a baby and young child. I find it's so funny to see what you looked like as a child.	I recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another. I am incredibly jealous of him.	Oh, that's a tough thing to deal with."
"I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.	That's really tough to deal with jealousy, but you can't let it control you."
"How long?	That's so weird.  How long?"
"About what exactly?	That sounds like a long story."
"Now that is an interesting perspective!	My mother recently went to the bank for me. I love her so much.	It is always a great feeling to have someone you can count on!"
"Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!	Yeah that's the truth, I love my mom so much!"
"My father almost died. His recent health problems have been devastating.	That is terrible, I am so sorry. What was the condition of his health?"
"It is tough, but I think I will make it.	That is terrible!  I hope he recovers soon."
"My friend bought a new car. This makes me so jealous!	That's awesome! Did it come out of your budget?"
"It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.	Oh no! I hope it works out. I'm sorry you feel that way!"
"I recently met a new person that I am very fond of. I want to give her my love and care.	Oh, that's nice. I hope she likes the same things you do."
"I am very happy, too. Do you have someone special in your life?	I do. My wife left me 2 months ago and I've been trying to find someone else ever since. I'm just trying to focus on my job right now. I don't have the time to find someone right now. I don't want to get into a relationship until I've found someone I really care about. I just want to find the right person. I just really don't know who I can go to right now. I'm just not very good with people."
"My family is very loving. They care about me so much.	I'm glad you have a good family.  How old are you?"
"I agree. I hope you are also close to your family!	Yeah I am. We are close. We are close."
"I stole my friend's Pokemon card when we were 7. I still feel guilty about it.	I know, I'm the same. It was a stupid thing to do, but I was young and stupid"
"Yes	It's a little bit of guilt, but at least you're acknowledging it."
"I one time lost my trunks in the pool! People saw me in a way I didn't want!	That sounds like a terrible experience."
"I covered my body and then went to the bathroom and got a towel!	That's a pretty crazy story. What did you do?"
"I recently graduated from college. I loved it and now I feel great about my life!	That's awesome. Congratulations on graduating."
"I agree. I am thinking about moving to the West Coast of the USA.	That is awesome. I love the West Coast."
"we went for a doctor visit because she was	That's good. What was the doctor's diagnosis?"
"sorry lol. because she was ""late"". but she told me the result was negative, not pregnant. so then we went to a furniture store just to browse	I can imagine.  That must have been frustrating.  Did you end up buying anything?"
"well here's the thing. We are married. Been together 5 years. So as I'm walking around looking at stuff in this store, I notice a bookmark hanging off the ear of a wooden rocking horse!	Having the whole house to your self sometimes isn't as good as it may seem!	It can be! I have my whole house to myself and it is super quiet!"
"My whole family is out the house for a few months. I'm going to be so bored with no one around...	I know right?"
"I have a huge chance to win a PS4!	I'm so jealous. That's a really cool game. I've only ever played Halo."
"There's only 2 other people in the final round! Winning a PS4 will be awesome!	Oh wow, that sounds amazing! I hope you win!"
"My son really needs to cut down on the amount of sugary snacks he has!	It is good for him to learn healthy habits now"
"Well, my wife gets them on deals, so likes to hoard them in the cupboard.	That's nice that your wife gets them on deals, but I can see why it's not a good idea."
"the house is very quiet now that she's been gone for four days visiting with her family	Oh, I bet that's nice, but also very boring, right?"
"because she hasn't seen them in almost 2 years. Misses them	That must be so sad for you. How long has she been gone?"
"In the middle of the station, on my new suit, a seagull threw up on me!	Oh no! That's a bit of a shock! Did you clean it off?"
"I was! I had to travel all the way home with a huge mess on me!	Yeah that's awful. Did you wash it?"
"Paddington Train Station.	I can't believe someone half my age got promoted instead of me!	Yeah, I've been in the workforce for about 20 years."
"Have you ever missed out on a promotion?	Oh no! I haven't, but I do have friends who have. I feel bad."
"My wife cried quite a lot at her mothers funeral. They had a very close bond.	Yeah, I'm sorry she's going through this. I've been there myself."
"Unfortunately she passed away, hence the funeral.	Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I hope you were able to comfort her."
"Getting this new job should be easy. I am easily the best person that applied.	I bet you are. What position are you applying for?"
"CEO of Apple. I figured they need a Steve 2.0 to take them forward!	Oh that sounds awesome. What kind of job is it?"
"ok, so after 5 years and the baby, there was disconnect. Things like not sleeping at the same times, not even hardly talking. Just avoiding each other really	Oh, I understand. It's hard when kids get older."
"plenty lol. kicked them out long time ago. now with new wife of 5 years haha. but point is, i never cheated even during those 8 months of feeling alone, heck, BEING alone	That's good. I'm glad to hear you're happy."
"as bill & ted would say: Excellent! {guitar}	Yeah, that's the best way to put it."
"My son is such a rascal! He took my car for a joy ride!	I hate that!  Did you get the car back?"
"He's only 13! I didn't even think he had that in him!	I'm sure he did it just to see what he could do.  He's a wild one!"
"My brother...Dating an A list supermodel... I don't know what to think!	I know how you feel about those things."
"He's dating Kylie Jenner. Have you heard of her?	I've heard of her. I've also heard she's a total diva."
"Justin Beiber.	Have anything to tell me about?	That sounds pretty ominous. What happened?"
"Oh wow, I can imagine. How old was it?	Oh wow, I can imagine. How old was it?"
"That's rough, but I'm sure you can get past that.	Starbucks always get's my order wrong!	That's terrible. What happens next time?"
"They definitely are expensive. What's your favourite drink to get?	That is a terrible experience. I have never had any of the drinks at Starbucks before."
"I'm so happy for my son, went to his graduation from Harvard last week.	I am glad for him as well."
"Thank you! Looks like there's going to be another Doctor in the family!	That's awesome! I hope he gets a good job and is able to pay for college one day."
"My pizza I bought fell all over the floor on my way home!	Oh no! Did you clean it up?"
"The pizza was from my favourite pizza shop as well! Quite the sad moment.	That's terrible! Did you get the pizza?"
"I was getting keys out of my pocket, and then WHAM, right on the floor. The pineapple slices were the first to fall on the floor.	Why does McDonalds always get my order wrong! I said no lettuce!	That is terrible! I am not a big fan of McDonald's either, I always have the same order and it always gets wrong"
"Sometimes I think the management don't even care!	It's not the management. It's the cooks."
"I ate so much of my wife's cookies, but she shouldn't make them so irresistible.	That's a good thing."
"She made me pay twice what they would have sold for at the bake sale. The cookies were for charity, you see.	I would have felt the same way, but I would have been more honest and told her."
"Just my luck I step into a huge pile of dog mess...	Oh no! Did you clean it up?"
"That is true, cow poop is much worst! But I was wearing brand new Gucci flip flops!	Oh no. I would hate to step in dog poop."
"The key to making good chicken and rice, is following the recipe precisely	Oh yeah, I know. I was cooking for my wife the other day and I got the recipe from her book. I didn't get it right. I ended up having to throw it all out. I guess I should have read it before I started cooking it!"
"You've got to cut up all the ingredients, and put it in small containers, before finally cooking all at once.	I love chicken and rice.  What kind of seasoning do you like to use on your chicken?"
"we asked the doc to put the ultrasound in an envelope so we could record our reaction to the gender reveal. I was very happy when I finally saw it!	That's awesome! Did you get a picture?"
"thanks. no mistake about it, it's a boy! lol. Takes after his father ;)	That is so cool.  Did he have any funny comments or jokes?"
"Holy Moses!! don't quit trying :)	My son failed his exams! Can you believe it! I don't know what to do!	I am sorry to hear that! Did he fail because he didn't study hard enough?"
"He spent all his time playing football instead of studying! I warned him about this!	Yeah I know how that is. I'm sure he will get the hang out of it soon."
"Without prayer, I don't know if I would have passed that important test!	Oh, that's sad. Did you pass the test?"
"It was a test in Numeracy, so counting 1 - 100. I've always found that difficult, but god made it possible!	It is so easy to forget the things we are grateful for, but sometimes it's hard to remember to thank the Lord."
"Hey! I saw a blind man play a guitar once. Was so surreal and I was so impressed	Oh, that's cool. I'm not sure how to play a guitar, but I do know how to play a violin."
"Yea. I think he was. His story was crazy too. He is an orphan	I've never been to a blind man play a guitar."
"we were 20 mins from the airport and the car broke down, overheated and would not start !	Oh that's terrible! Did you have a plan in place for that situation?"
"had to hitch hike. made it on time for check in though. now the cars been in the shop 4 days, no progress. kinda getting worried about it	Oh, well, I'm glad you made it."
"My son was just born, my first boy after 11 girls!	I have a boy.  I was so excited to have a boy."
"It's easier if you had 12 different baby mamas, that's my trick anyway. This last labour was 6 hours long!	That's crazy!  I had 3 girls.  Did you have any boys?"
"Some times at night, I can hear some shouting ""AHHHHHHH"", ""HEE HEE"".	That is creepy, what happens?"
"No, the spooky thing is... I think it's the ghost of Michael Jackson. I even saw him dancing to Billie Jean.	It's a ghost. It's just a movie character. I don't believe that."
"My best friend is doing 30 years in prison. I miss my good friend.	That's terrible. How is he doing?"
"I can't visit him. I've had to flee the country. We were robbing banks together, and he got caught with half the cash. I'm currently in the Bahamas.	I'm so sorry that happened to your friend.  I'm sorry that you have to go through this.  How long will you have to stay there before you get out?"
"My son worked for many years to be a footballer, he finally signed a pro contract!	I'm happy for you. What position does he play?"
"He's just joined Juventus. Can't be more happy for the lad.	That's awesome! I'm a huge football fan and I've always dreamed of playing for the big clubs like Juventus"
"4 months later he will be here. It has taken me around 3 months to save up enough money to be ready for him when he's born	that's so nice, you must be excited"
"yes it is. I am very happy	I'm so excited for you.  How many babies do you have already?"
"only child for now. name is RAIDEN (god of thunder) :D	On my way home from work, a massive bat chased me!	oh wow that's scary!  What were you doing on your way home from work?"
"I know! This one was absolutely huge, almost human sized. Chased me for a whole hour. The more I think about it, it might have been the batman! I shouldn't have stolen those diamonds!	I think I know where the diamond mine was."
"Every day I thank God for my blessings. I'd be in hole right now if it weren't for HIM	That is a good way to think."
"especially since he takes care of us even though don't deserve it	That is very nice. I am thankful for everything that has happened in my life."
"Once during an important school sporting event, my entire sports team was counting on me but mid-way through my event, my shorts fell down and I tripped	Yeah I've tripped too many times."
"yea! it was! I thought everyone would be annoyed at me but the next day when I went back to school, everyone just made it a joke so its alright. This was about 5-6 years ago now haha	Oh my god I remember that!  That sounds like such a disaster!  But you are so right that people are just trying to make light of it!  It is just one of those things that happens and you have to just laugh.  I bet that was a great school experience!  I hope you can still look back and laugh about it!  I can just imagine you tripping and falling and the crowd going ""oh no, did that happen?""  haha"
"I love youtube. been listening to all my classic tracks. Tupac forever	Oh yeah, I love his songs too."
"I started out with one hit wonders but ended up at Pac. I miss my youth lol	Yeah I know exactly how you feel. I used to watch all of the Beatles."
"When I was younger, my dog died. He was getting up there in age, but he was still on the young side. Later, we heard the pet food we had been feeding him had been recalled because of similiar fatalities.	That's terrible, I'm sorry for your loss"
"No, they just had a recall. Apparently they didn't clean out their machines properly when making the food, so it got contaminated.	That is terrible. I am so sad for your loss."
"Seeing people who have less than me just makes me so grateful for the blessings I have been given	You are very blessed.  You must feel very good about yourself."
"absolutely! Always give to people who have less than myself :)	That is so true. I am very grateful for what I have."
"hiding for almost 2 years but I'm still not over my paranoia that one day I will have to pay for what I did. Don't ask what it was	I don't know what that is, but it seems like something you did wrong."
"no way. I just pray she can forgive me. I could never admit to this sin. Jesus save me	I understand, I'm not sure if I would admit to that one either, but I'm trying to help."
"When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So, when he had his back turned, I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.	That's pretty funny. I bet the other kids were shocked."
"Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.	Oh wow, that's crazy! I'm sorry that happened to you. Did you get in trouble?"
"after she got her 1st job and new car, she started doing girls night out. Out until 3am one morning. I checked her chat history and sure enough she had kissed another guy >:(	That's not good. I hope she's aware of what she's doing."
"jealous isn't the one I felt. I wanted to rip her apart lol	That is pretty gross. I would feel that way if I had my girlfriend doing that with another guy while I was sleeping."
"My dad always worked his ass off at a job he didn't like in order to support us, doing a lot of back breaking work as a caretaker. He even had a second job at Wal-mart for a while. I have no idea how he managed to do that sort of thing.	Yeah, my parents always worked a lot too."
"Yeah, especially because we were single income. My mom homeschooled my brother and I. I think he took only a handful of sick days his entire time working, had something like 600 days saved up when he retired.	That is awesome that you had your mom homeschooing your brother and you, that is a great thing!"
"I think he got 3 weeks a year, only used like 5 days.	I would like to see that. I think that's a great way to do it."
"my instincts are never wrong. I found out her lies when I checked her facebook chat history.	I hate when that happens"
"she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t-shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other. Made me so mad	That's a bit rude. Did you confront her?"
"I never thought she would tell anyone and make it seem like I did something wrong. I didn't force her	That is very sad.  Did you guys ever get in trouble for it?"
"ye and so I had to leave the country because of her	I know how that feels. It is very difficult to do something and not get caught."
"Public school really sucks sometimes. Making boys shower all together. I didn't want to but had to or else fail PE	I know what you mean. I was always the same gender and was forced to use the boys shower and I was so disgusted by the whole idea. It was such a weird concept."
"yes. Well it was a long time ago but I haven't forgotten	That is awful!"
"My mom homeschooled me when I was little. I was in public school till first grade, but after that I was homeschooled. Did take a semester in grade 11 though to make sure I was up to current standards.	Yeah, that is a good idea."
"Really? I didn't even know that was an option. Then again I'm 25 so it may not have been available then.	Yeah, but that's a good thing. It's good you had the chance to learn and grow in a way."
"I still haven't got over it. Brandon Lee RIP. I was 17 when I found out he died during filming. I visited the area he took his last steps a couple years ago	That's so tragic. It's so hard to imagine that something that beautiful can be so devastating."
"Now the remake is well on its way. Maybe it can lift this depression I feel if they stay true to the story. Jason Mamoa isn't bad looking	I'm sorry to hear that."
"I had to adapt to life. I had to change to survive. Now I feel better	That is very wise of you."
"I am reminded every day that I can survive anything. A friend gave me a special bracelet (paracord)	I'm glad you are feeling better. What happened to you?"
"I recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years.	I am so shocked and sad. How could someone do something like that?"
"Very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way. It makes me think less of her as a person.	That's really bad.  How long has this been going on?"
"I was sucker punched when I was 17. The guy broke his hand and fled the scene. I saw him one time after this riding a bicycle but didn't do anything.	Oh no, that must have been scary. Did you get in touch with the police?"
"I wasn't confident. Now I regret not punishing him.	That must have been scary.  Did he get in trouble?"
"I recently completed my masters degree in education at almost 40 years old. I feel really pleased with myself.	That's awesome! What kind of job will you be doing?"
"Thanks! It was a huge challenge, and I'm SO glad to have it behind me!	It's a great accomplishment.  What are you going to do now?"
"Being a mom is great, too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks!	Yeah, I'm glad to have that opportunity too."
"I feel happy about the new house I have and that I can work from home. Thanks be to God	That is great news!  Are you moving soon?"
"It took me 9 months of determination and sacrifice. But worth it.	I am happy for you, it takes a lot of courage to start a new business and work from home. What is the business you are doing?"
"I blamed myself for her fall because I wasn't close enough to prevent it. I took care of her for months afterwards.	That's good to have that kind of support."
"I was distracted by the sound of running water.	That is really nice of you."
"I can't get enough of music today. Especially all my songs/bands from when I was in my twenties.	Yeah, I can get a little too into my music too."
"Its true though, they can't make good music these days. Not in ANY genre.	Oh, that's true.  I agree.  I used to love my music from my youth, but it just doesn't hold up to the modern world anymore."
"I get paid today and I'm getting this new game I've been waiting on to be released!	That's great! Which game?"
"I'm thinking about getting FarCry 5. I pre-order for the early release! I'm really excited about it.	That's awesome. I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
"Hi, I joined a firm 6 months ago and then I got a promotion for Junior Manager	Did you enjoy your new job?"
"yes, They thought that I have some extraordinary talent and that is the reason I got that position	Oh wow, congratulations. What position did they give you?"
"Maybe yes, Haha, Now I am looking for a Manager post and then become a senior manager	Oh wow, that is awesome! I bet you are a great manager!"
"Hi, I have applied for a driving license thrice and I have failed in all the thee	I'm sorry to hear that, but you should try again."
"Yes, I am a little uncomfortable driving backwards. I just can't do that.	That's okay. You'll get your license eventually."
"every time I try not to hit that cone but those are so close.	I can imagine how you feel when you're driving backwards and you can't avoid that cone."
"I still can't believe my life is where it's at, especially if you look at the past few years. I would never believe you if you told me I would be here.	Oh that's a great story, what did you do to get so lucky?"
"Well, for many years I was an alcoholic, working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!	That's great to hear!"
"It does. I worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests, and I couldn't believe when I passed with flying colors!	Oh wow! Congratulations! That is awesome. What are you studying?"
"Yesterday, I was standing in a lift and a man next to me whispered in my ears that your zip is open.	Oh my god, that was so gross. Did he do it again?"
"It was just very creepy situation	I would have been really mad!  Did you tell him to keep his mouth shut?"
"lol thats funny	My hubby lost his job a couple of months ago but he has an interview this friday so i pray he will get that job	I hope so too. I hope it works out for him."
"armed security	I hope so too!  I'm so proud of him.  You guys are so lucky to have each other!"
"I stayed alone at night in a office due to excessive work and was much scared.	That's a bit scary. Was it a scary place?"
"no, I was on a 10th floor and security was down. I was scared even with a single noise.	I am sorry you had to stay alone."
"I have been awarded with a degree in marketing.	I love that.  That is very nice of you."
"it took 4 years but at last got it	That's great! Congratulations!"
"Yeah,  I have  a job that I was looking for and now I am really enjoying my life.	Hey, have you ever been in a car wreck?	i have been. it was scary"
"I was in one about 2 years ago. No one was hurt, but it totaled both of our cars.	That is a scary thing. I have never been in one. I am always driving around with my kids. I am sure it was very scary."
"Have you everr been in a fist fight with anyone?	I have, and I have no regrets about it."
"I got in a fist fight with my step father once. It wasn't a fun experience as you can imagine.	Oh man, what happened? Did he beat you?"
"Have you ever played and old video game called Everquest?	I haven't, I'm a gamer but I haven't played one in years. I think I would be really interested in it. What's it like?"
"It came out in 1999. I used to play it when i was a teen. I installed it the other day and had a good time playing.	That sounds like a fun game! I've played a lot of MMORPGs over the years, and I'm always looking to try out new ones. What did you play the most recently?"
"Have you ever eaten at Hardee's?	I haven't but I've heard it's pretty good."
"I like it too, but I'm not a big fan of their new sliders. They're so tiny, and just one of them cost almost 2 dollars!	I love hardees. I have never had any problems with the sliders."
"Have you ever had a sleep paralysis dream?	I have. It is so creepy."
"Yeah, in mine I saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me. I've never been more scared in my life.	I have. It's the most terrifying thing."
"Have you ever rode on a roller coaster?	It is a very exciting experience."
"I hate riding them, but i used to machine components for their drive chain when I was a machinist.	Yeah, I have. It's really fun. I've always been fascinated by the idea of how it works, but I'm not sure I'd ride one again."
"A while back my friend's boyfriend tried to get me to have an intimate relationship with him. He knew I had been married a very long time, as well as he was in a relationship with my friend. I turned him down flat, as I love my husband very much.	That must've been difficult for him."
"Yes, I let him know that was wrong and disgusting. I couldn't believe he did it!	That's terrible. What happened to him after you said no?"
"Yes, as I am honest with him. But, I didn't want trouble.	I'm going overseas and I think I packed everything i need!	It is good to have a backup.  I have never left the US before."
"Going to Kazakhstan. That's where i was born. My parents still live there and i miss them so much	Oh wow, that sounds amazing! I've never been to a foreign country before, so I can't wait to hear about all the things you see and experience! What are you planning on seeing?"
"Hi, My girlfriend was recently let go of her job, but she put so much work in to finding a new job and got one with better pay!	That's really cool, I bet she was happy."
"Yes I agree, she was so happy when she found out the job was hers	That's great! I'm so happy for you and your girlfriend. I bet she's very happy to have found the right job for her!"
"She wasn't really fired, her position was no more. Schools don't have much room left for Home Ec teachers. Sad	I agree, I think schools need to hire more people. I am a teacher and I am not getting any younger."
"Yeah she has a passion for teaching. These kids will be great to work with.	So about a year ago now, my girlfriend decided to surprise me with a puppy!	That is so cool!  Did you know she was going to get one?"
"Yes, so nice!! It was the best thing that could've happened! It's a German Shepherd!	Oh wow. That is nice. I have a German Shepherd too, and a Poodle, and a Bearded Collie, and a Beagle."
"There was this one time I was fairly drunk at a bar and this attractive girl was trying to make moves on me, but I did my best to ignore it all.. Having a girlfriend and all.	That's a bit weird, but I guess it's okay if you're not interested."
"I was very proud definitely when I woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!	Oh wow, what happened after that?"
"There was this one time my girlfriend and I had plans to meet a Longhorn steakhouse for a date.. She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.	Oh no. That's awful."
"Yes, she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!	That's a bit of an unusual reason for waiting, but at least she was trying."
"I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!	That is awesome!"
"i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long... but i'm a mom so i don't sleep in. ever	That's nice. I have to work. I don't get to sleep in."
"I had to cancel a trip to see my brother after it started snowing heavily.	That's too bad. Snow is the worst."
"Yes, when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous, and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.	That is terrible. You should have stayed home."
"It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.	I'm glad you went home.  It is not safe to drive in deep snow.  I would not go out in that kind of snow either."
"When my parents got divorced when I was a kid, it was one of the hardest things for me.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things have worked out for them in the end."
"It does definitely get easier over time I suppose.. Now that I see my life I guess it was for the best.	I'm sorry you had to go through that. I know it was tough for me."
"Just the other day my girlfriend and I were getting ready for the beach, but right before we left it started to pour rain.	That is so not cool. I'm sure you're both disappointed."
"Well, when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!	That is so cool, did you get wet?"
"There was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family.	That's awesome. What was the surprise?"
"Yes, the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.	I'm glad you were surprised. What did you do?"
"There was this one time I stole a shirt from my friend, and I feel pretty guilty about it.	I hate doing that, but sometimes you have to do what you have to."
"Because I really liked it, and didn't think he'd care.	I'm glad it was your friend. What did he do?"
"My girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week, I was very lonely during this experience.	I bet it was lonely! Did you stay in touch?"
"I mainly just played video games and watched tv.	I can't imagine being that lonely."
"I moved to a new apartment and they didn't accept my dog breed, so I had to give her up. :(	I'm so sorry! That's terrible. I hope she is okay!"
"Because here in my area in Florida, there isn't too many options for me.	I understand, it is hard to find a place with pets."
"My mom doesn't have a ton of money, but last christmas she made sure to get me some awesome things!	That's very nice of her!"
"She got me a brand new laptop I had been wanting for gaming!	That's awesome! I'm glad she was so excited about it."
"I went on this ride at the beach called the Slingshot.. It shoots you super high up in the air.. It was so teriffying, I had so much faith in the ride I wouldn't die!	Oh that sounds like fun. I love the thrill of it."
"It was seriously so scary, I almost pooped myself!	It's so fun to do!"
"There was this time I went to the bar with my girlfriend and once I came out of the restroom, I saw her talking to some guy!	It's always a little awkward after the bathroom, but it's nothing to worry about!"
"Well I get super jealous and angry of course.. But in the end it was just a work friend.. Oops!	That's a good thing you didn't go home that night, you can always go back there the next time."
"My dog randomly got up on my couch last week, and just started peeing.. Like what!?!?!??!?!	Oh my gosh. Did you try to get him back up?"
"Not since lunch, so it's actually been about 4 hours.. I hate living on the top floor!	That is so gross! I have had to get rid of dogs before."
"I finally graduated college last year, it felt like it took SO long!	That is great! I graduated a few years ago and it took forever. What did you study?"
"Yes, I am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!	It's nice that you made it, I'm sure you will have many more adventures in the future!"
"My girlfriend saw me kissing another girl, who was kissing ME at the bar.. I was very drunk..	I bet you felt bad for her.  What did you do?"
"No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.	That is so bad. What happened next?"
"There was this one time I was driving down the road, and this guy on a sports bike popped a wheelie.. It was so sick!	Yeah that sounds like fun! Did you stop and try to catch him?"
"I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!	Yeah, I love watching that type of video. It's so cool to watch! I think it's time for me to learn how to ride a sports bike first.. I don't think my car is safe enough for that haha!"
"When i was younger, I came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead.	That is terrible! What happened?"
"He was very old, so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!	That's so sad. What happened to him?"
"My dog chewed a hole in my carpet 2 weeks ago.. I was very disgusted to say the least!	Oh no! That's terrible. Did you have to call a carpet cleaning service?"
"Oh dang, I guess I can't complain too much then, that's brutal!	That's so gross!  I've never had to deal with anything like that before.  Did it happen to your dog too or did it happen to a different dog?"
"I have to go to confession at the church... i was a little mean to my mom, sometimes its difficult to be always nice	Yeah, I think it is okay to have a few flaws and not be perfect. But I can see why you would be upset."
"Well yes when i shouted and i inmeaditelly apologize but i feel really bad	That is so understandable. You can't be mean to your mom.  I'm sure she is a good person and you are going to make things up to her.  I am sure she will forgive you."
"We walked, we ate ice cream, we rode a bike, we laughed a lot, we enjoyed the outdoors, we were exhausted	I love ice cream!"
"I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul	Oh wow! What a lovely day it was!  Did you go on a picnic?"
"Sometimes one gives priority to work	The world is very beautiful	It really is.  I have a lot of friends from my hometown and it brings me back to my childhood."
"Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice	I agree with you. I am so tired of the people who don't appreciate the beauty of the world around them."
"People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life	I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.	That's a good way to put it. It's like when someone you admire is a politician and they turn out to be corrupt and greedy. I can't believe that they would be able to do such things."
"Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself, is it?	It's hard to deal with that. I hate when people do that. I wish they would just be honest and tell you how they feel."
"As a kid, I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.	Yeah, I'm sure it was the same with you. I was too young to know the difference."
"That's the thing -- NO! I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!	It's so scary, but I hope it never happens to you!"
"My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said ""You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that."" For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)	That is very kind of her. I hope that she's happy."
"I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated, really.	That is the worst.  I hate when I get angry.  I am so bad."
"Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.	That's really great. You have to be patient and understanding."
"I do look at that as a strength, in anyone. Being able to say ""I'm sorry"" and ""I made a mistake.""	I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!	That's awesome. I bet it was fun!"
"I highly, highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.	I'm so glad to see you're not afraid to be honest."
"i would fear my gift	I am so jealous! What is it?"
"my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me	That is very interesting. What did your partner give you?"
"yes but its a valuable gift to me	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  I was really happy when she gave me an iPad."
"yeah but this gift is definitely different for me	I have such an amazing husband! He works so hard so i could stay home with our baby	That's awesome. I have a husband too. I'm so jealous of the life you have."
"he is an armed guard	That is so cool that he's in the armed guard! What kind of work does he do?"
"I have a pretty bad vision so i'm so scared to drive at night	I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm sure you can drive safely at night."
"yes, i even have glasses but because of astigmatism i don't see good at night even when i have glasses on	I am sorry to hear that, you should get a pair with a better lens and get a new prescription, you will feel much better."
"It seems like today everyone in the grocery store was in such a rush. Hurrying around!	I know, I felt like I was going crazy trying to get my groceries and the kids were running around like crazy. I was so stressed!"
"Yes! They cut in front, and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it	I agree, it is so frustrating when people are so in a rush they can't even notice you. I hope they will learn to slow down soon!"
"I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible	That is the worst.  I feel bad when my kids are playing and I'm trying to sleep."
"i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible	That's awful. You have to get your sleep back. You need to start taking care of yourself."
"I love being around them and it's great to see them each year.	I love the holiday season."
"O I'm sorry, my niece and nephews, only seem in the summer. Do you get company during the summer?	I do get company in the summer, I have 2 dogs that go on walks with me."
"My kids are going into 7th and 8th grade in a couple weeks. They really are growing up well	I bet. What are your kids doing in 7th and 8th grade?"
"My oldest daughter has some learning disabilities so I'm really proud of how she is doing. They're both growing up so fast	It is so cool to see how kids are growing up"
"i paid all my bills today, i feel so relived and good	That is so great! I have a lot of debt myself but it's always good to pay it all in one day. What bills did you pay?"
"rent and electricity. we've been struggling financially so it's such a relieve to pay bills	That's awesome. I've never paid all my bills at once. I'm jealous. What kind of bills did you pay?"
"I studied so hard for my bar exam so that I could become a lawyer. I prepared for almost 3 months straight!	That's great! What's it for?"
"I did pass! It was a rough 3 months, but once I got there, I felt like I was ready.	I hope you passed and got your license."
"I was about to book a flight for my baby and i and i was so surprised to find out i didn't need to pay for my baby'sticket	That's so cool. I have a friend who had to do that."
"i know! now i can spend the rest of the money on something cool	That is great news! I hope everything goes smoothly."
"my husband called me a punk today for no reason. and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn't even understand why	That's not very nice of him!"
"no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes	I can understand how that would hurt.  I hope you can talk things out with him."
"When I was younger, I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive, because i didn't want to get into an accident.	Oh yeah, that's a pretty common problem for a lot of people. I'm not sure I'm ready to drive yet, but I'm hoping to get my permit soon."
"I tried to tell myself that, but my dad got into a really bad accident once, and it has scared me ever since.	I know that feeling! It's like you are always looking around and waiting for something bad to happen!"
"I recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches.	Oh, that's really cool. I've always wanted to try that. How's it going so far?"
"Yea, i put them in a glass of water for a week or two and they grow their own roots, wasn't expecting much.	I am so proud of myself."
"I do yes! and since the method i used is working, i have tons of tomatoes!	I would be amazed! I never thought about growing tomatoes in water. What kind of tomatoes did you have?"
"Around town it seems like traffic has been horrible lately. Driving around town is just crazy.	That's a bummer. Do you drive or do you walk?"
"Yes, exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!	Oh man. I hate it when people cut me off. It always makes me feel like I'm a little kid again!"
"A few years ago, I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other, so we met up in person!	That's really cool! I've never really played video games before, but my kids play a lot. I bet it was fun to meet up and play video games with someone in person!"
"I'd say it's going pretty well, we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?	It's nice. I am sure you two are very close. I have a close friend too."
"OKay. I care for everyone	I love that phrase."
"Thanks, I hope I am. You sound like one too	That is nice of you to say"
"because you gave me a compliment, which I feel is a genuine one	I recently had a one night stand with a woman from my past. It caught both of us off guard	That's good, how was the experience?"
"Yes, it was a very interesting time. I wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations	Oh, that's a good idea. I'm sure she would love that."
"My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!	That is really impressive. She must be really smart. I am not very smart."
"She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.	That is awesome! I wish you both a wonderful future together!"
"I walked my dog outside, and she still pooped in the house! Ugh.	Oh, that's terrible. Did you have to clean up?"
"Yeah...Even though I take her outside, 10 minutes later, she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?	Oh, I'm so glad you have a dog. I'm a dog person, I have two of them."
"I think being with my husband makes me a better person	I think so as well."
"Definetly, he's my best friend forever.	I agree. He's always there for me and I am grateful for him."
"I really don't like when things happen when noone is home.	That's a good reason! What happens when noone is home?"
"Like stuff falling off shelfes because a dog runs into them! Hah, crazy I know.	Yeah it's pretty weird how sometimes you have no one in the house for 2-3 hours and stuff just starts to fall. I mean I know dogs are cute but they are pretty much a menace when you let them roam free."
"I really love my life right now.	I know, right.  You're doing pretty good for yourself."
"Nothing really! I just love that I can work at home and have time to clean or cook whenever I want.	I am glad you can do that."
"Right? And no having to interact with others unless we choose too.	I agree, but sometimes I wish I had more time for myself."
"So i just got home and all of my friends were there for a birthday party i have no clue! can you imagine my reaction?	Oh that would be embarrassing!"
"Well the party was for me, hahaha they really got me on that one!	Yeah, that's pretty funny. I hope you were happy for a moment and then the realization hit you."
"Its not fun being reminded of things you've forgotten.	That is very true, I forgot what day it was last week."
"Owed money to my mother in law for something, $15, she reminded me in a less then nice way.	That's not fun, I hope you can get some help from a lawyer.  I hope you guys are okay."
"Exactly, especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.	I went to San Antonio the other day, was great to see that city.	That sounds like a great place to visit."
"O really? What's your favorite thing there?	Yeah, it's really nice.  I love San Antonio."
"I just got back from my graduation! can you imagine after 5 years i graduated with the highest score of my college in the past 20 years!	I'm so proud you did it! Congratulations!"
"Yes! i studied so hard, can you imagine how i feel? i cannot believe it!	That is awesome! Congratulations! I hope that was a really hard class to take."
"I hate the sight of someone throwing up. My nephew did that the other and day and man.	I can't imagine.  I have to go get a glass of water.  I don't know what I would do."
"Yea, he had eaten to much sugar and well, it didn't end well	Yeah, that's what I do when I eat too much sugar."
"I came home from work and step barefoot on one of my sons legos, i was so pissed!	It's just a little lego, but it was still gross."
"Yes, i was so mad i always tell them to pick the toys up.	That's not good, did you have to apologize to them?"
"My mother in law got to eat Qdoba today, one of my favorite places I haven't had in awhile	Oh, I love their guac too."
"No way. queso all the way! They don't have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did.	Oh, that sounds delicious!  I love Qdoba!  It's my favorite Mexican restaurant. I can't wait until I can get there."
"Yesterday i watch on tv a kid who could speak 4 different languages at age 3, i was in shook!	That's pretty rare. Did he learn it that easily?"
"Well they are called wonder kids! i was in wonder, i also read about one who just graduated from college at age 11	That is amazing. I am not sure if it is true or not, I just like hearing about kids like those."
"My husband is quite impressive to me.	It's great when people appreciate each other"
"Yea, he's become the best manager in his market in just 3 years.	That is awesome! I am glad to see him succeed."
"This afternoon i went to my sons soccer game and he scored three goals! happiest dad ever!	Oh wow! That is a good day! I bet you were beaming with pride."
"Yes! i love him so dad, but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play, he dedicated the three goals to me!	That is awesome.  How old is he?"
"I was doing a presentation for work, and tried to tell a story about something kind of related to break the ice.  No one laughed or even really cracked a smile, so it put me off for the rest of the presentation.	I know how you felt, I had a presentation where I tried to tell a joke and the whole room was silent"
"Yeah, and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking, but at least should have gotten a chuckle.	That sucks. Did you try to make it more funny?"
"My wife went to Germany to attend a language course at the end of June.  I've been mostly spending time with my dogs while she's been gone since we recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	That sucks.  Did you try to find anyone to hang out with?"
"That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me, I should look into that.	That's good that you have dogs."
"Something I did not expect from a neighbor, this morning he gave me some beautiful flowers	That's so nice of your neighbor. What did he give?"
"It was a nice gesture on his part. But I do not know	Yeah, that's nice. I hope it's not a sign of things to come"
"But beyond that. Small gestures make others' lives happier	My neighbor has a really annoying little dog that she always brings outside when she's smoking.  It barks constantly at everything and she doesn't try to keep it quiet.	Yeah, I don't even know how to get rid of dogs that bark.  They're like dogs in a box.  They're just not right for the house."
"A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically, but this one is just terrible.	It sounds like you're not a fan of dogs."
"This morning my husband received a call, he got nervous, I think it was a woman ... difficult	Oh that's so bad! I'm sorry. What did he do?"
"I think so ... I'm a little worried, because of the situation	That's so weird! I hope it wasn't anything serious. Did he call you back?"
"Thank you for your solidarity	I have a great picture from my wedding where my friends and I are in a circle having a shot, makes me want to go hang out with them again.	It's nice to remember those days, when we were young and carefree"
"Yeah, we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to Graduate school.	I bet you guys are having some fun now?"
"Yesterday, a difficult day, the anniversary of the death of my mother	I am sorry to hear about that.  I hope you are able to find peace and comfort."
"Thank you for your solidarity	I'm sorry to hear that. How did she pass away?"
"seven years .... I miss her	I went for an interview for a job I really wanted and ended up waiting a long time before I heard anything.  I managed to keep my spirits up for a good long while.	That's terrible, but you can always apply for other jobs."
"I did actually!  It's a good job, especially since the market where I am isn't great for my field.	That is great news.  I hope you got the job!"
"My daughter is angry with me, she says she does not need me, because I scolded her	That is terrible! What did she do that you scolded her for?"
"She is 9 years old but she is a very focused girl	I know the feeling, my 5 year old son can be very hard on me"
"that's right ... but I think I've surpassed	Hello, tomorrow I have the cooking test and I feel safe. I am sure that I will approve with an excellent rating	That's great. I bet you'll do well."
"have my own restaurant	I hope so too. I am sure you will do well!"
"with work, effort and clarity in the goal ... I will surely arrive	I'm so happy i made enough money yesterday to pay my bills!	That's good! How much did you make?"
"yes, such a relieve!	I'm happy for you!"
"Sometimes we have angels, called friends, I'm happy because God sent me mine	It's nice to have some good friends in life"
"We are 12 years old, but we have had difficult moments, but we have overcome it	That's great, what kind of friends are you talking about?"
"That's right ... I'm happy	my son behaved badly with his friend, I treat him badly, I had to punish him	I would have been angry too!  Why did your son behave so poorly?"
"He is 12 years old, but he must understand that friendship is something sacred	I'm sure you were just trying to teach him a lesson."
"he hit him and said a bad word	When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. It was so fucking annoying	That is a shame.  You have to do something with your life.  It is hard to find the motivation to do anything.  I am sorry."
"I do my best but sometimes that's super hard. I guess that's just one of those things everyone got to deal with.	I understand how you feel. I'm sure it is frustrating."
"You too, thank you!	I went to a job interview a few days ago, and I feel like I totally rocked it!	It was good. I'm glad you got the job."
"Thanks a bunch! It pays much better than my current job, so I really hope I do, but I think I got it in the bag.	Yeah, I would hope that you got it!"
"I went through some of my old stuff yesterday, and I found my security blanket that I used when I was a kid!	I bet that was fun!"
"It really did. It kinda made me sad, because it was all tattered and dirty. I ended up washing it.	That's nice you have it."
"You know, I see all the back to school shopping and I think parents have their priorities mixed up.	Yeah, I think so too."
"Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor.	I completely agree. I think parents should focus on their child's educational well-being, rather than trying to look good for themselves."
"I found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road, and I nursed him back to full health. Poor thing.	I bet that kitten was happy to have a loving owner!"
"I did! His name is Alphy.	Oh that is so sweet! I love kittens. Did you find out where the kitten was originally?"
"It's hard as a parent, when your kids are teenagers and have to handle their own problems	It's hard when they are so young, I feel for you!"
"I know, they mommy in me wants to just jump in and fix it all like I used to	It's hard. I'm in a similar situation with my daughter and son."
"My wife called me this morning and told me she scored a new job with Microsoft!	Yeah, that's awesome. What kind of job does she have?"
"She is so excited. She's even making more than I am.	Wow that's great news. What job did she get?"
"I felt bad my dogs ears have been bothering him. We had to finally take him to the vet yesterday.	I hope he is ok."
"Yeah, it was ear mites and he got medicine for it. You can tell he isn't feeling good from side effects so I've been babying him.	That's terrible. I hope he is okay."
"I bought a chocolate bar for my wife at the store, and I was going to give it to her, but I ended up eating it...I feel bad.	That's okay! It happens to everyone."
"lol I didn't tell her...Should i?	I bet she was mad at you."
"Don't you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn't do? My boss got mad at me for someone else's mistake.	That sucks. Did you tell your boss what actually happened?"
"Yeah, that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.	That is terrible. I hope you got the job back and got your money back"
"I'm taking a vacation and going on a cruise to Alaska next week!	That's a fun vacation, I've always wanted to see the Northern Lights!  How long is the cruise going on?"
"I've never been, so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.	That sounds like a great time, I've never been either.  What are you planning on doing on the cruise?"
"Hello, I think I will not forget the beauty of her hair, the sweetness of her lips and the clarity of her eyes	That sounds lovely. What is her name?"
"she died ... my mother	I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm really sorry to hear that."
"It is true...	Hello, I never imagined the violence that can unleash a dog attacking a bird ... I was impressed	That sounds very terrifying. Did you manage to get your bird out of there safely?"
"in a big dog ... in the park	I was in the park and I saw it happen."
"I did not have the strength to control it	My poor neighboor is suffeing a lot without her husband	That's so sad! What is she doing to cope?"
"He passed away from cancer.	That is so sad.  I hope that she is okay."
"I enjoyed my day the other day, found out something good! Newphew may come to live with us for ayear.	That is awesome. I hope he is well taken care of."
"11, he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.	Yeah that is awesome. I would love that!  Are you guys divorced?"
"I lost something of my mother in laws the other day, I feel so bad.	Oh no! What happened?"
"I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear, it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!	That's so sweet of you. I bet she's really upset about it."
"I may do that!	I was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award	I am sorry, what was that award for?"
"Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for	that is awesome, good luck"
"I appreciate that. Thank you	Wow! Congrats on your new job! I can understand why you are apprehensive, but it sounds like a good opportunity.	I am not sure I understand what you are saying."
"No problem! Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.	I am very excited for my new job! It will be a challenge, but I'm ready to take it on!"
"I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!	I know, right? It's like, you're just so anxious and you can't stop thinking about it, but at the end of the day, you just know you did everything you could to be prepared, and that's all you can do. I was pretty calm, and I think my nerves were more from just my anxiety about the interview itself, and how I was going to come off in front of all those people."
"I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?	I've had them! It's usually nice, though. I was a bit worried, but I'm glad I went."
"It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!	I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.	Yeah, parenting is a lot of work. It's hard to be patient when things aren't going right."
"It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.	I would have been so upset! I know my kids can be a handful sometimes, and sometimes it's not even the little things."
"I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.	I understand how that feels. I'm always a little nervous when I speak, because I don't want to say something wrong or say something stupid."
"Well, for the most part it's my family. My husband, kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!	I am so sorry to hear that."
"My daughter is a teenager now so we don't spend as much time together as we used to.	That's sad. What is she into now?"
"Yeah, luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.	I'm glad you had fun with your daughter! I have a daughter too and sometimes we don't get together. I wish we did more together though."
"I'm really looking forward to this trip I have planned next week.	Oh, nice! Where are you going?"
"I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.	That sounds like a lot of fun! I hope you have a great time!"
"I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend, and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.	I bet that was disgusting!  What did you do?"
"It WAS. Since she was wet, the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.	I can imagine. I'm sure she was very uncomfortable too! I would have just let her out of the house to go find a better spot to clean herself."
"Been having a good day, relaxing on my couch watching Netflix. I got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap.	That's great! You have a nice cat too. What is your cat's name?"
"Yeah, it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.	You should do that. You're so lazy."
"I had a job interview yesterday. I was really nervous before it started.	That's good. What happened?"
"It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room, then we took a lab tour afterwards.	That's cool. Did you get the job?"
"i am very faithful	I'm sure it's a good feeling to be that way."
"yes my behavior refereed to people	That's great, how many people do you have in your life?"
"thank you	I am glad you said thank you"
"nothing	That is nice of you to thank someone."
"thank you	i appreciate that."
"nothing	Oh, that's so sweet. What's going on?"
"i am going to garden	That's cool! I have a garden."
"thank you	I bet that will be a lot of work."
"It was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake	Oh, what happened? Did they say sorry?"
"placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it, so they gave me something else without telling me	I am so angry right?  What kind of appliance was it?"
"Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen	That's not good. Did they give you the new one?"
"I really was distraught	I know the feeling! What happened?"
"yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok	I feel you, it's hard when you are alone."
"it made me proud he was my rep	That is awesome! I bet he felt proud of himself."
"the president represented us at this association	I am glad he was your rep! What was he doing there?"
"International Ceramic trading	It has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation. No one to talk to.	That's good, it's nice when everyone gets some time to themselves"
"I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.	That can be a real bummer. Do you have any plans for your vacation?"
"I can't wait to travel south to get my favorite take out. Can't find it here.	I love take out too. I love the food."
"About an hour. But it'll be worth it.	That is so good! I love take out too. What's your favorite?"
"I'm quite happy with where I live. I have 3 swimming pools to use anytime I want and also a gym.	I like swimming pools! I've never been swimming. What kind of pools do you have?"
"Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.	That's awesome!  You have a good view of the ocean?"
"I have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing.	Oh my god. What happened?"
"It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up, go to work, etc. but I was wrong about that!	Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was so happy that I was going to be surprised!"
"Yes, last week. Thank you!	It was a long 3 weeks but I'm so happy it's over and she's back now	That's nice! I'm glad you guys were able to get back to normal."
"She went to visit her family	That's great to hear. How long were you apart?"
"It was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother	I'm sorry, what happened to your mom?"
"Thank you for your solidarity	I'm sorry to hear that. Losing someone is hard. I hope you can heal."
"thanks	We knew she was pregnant, but didn't know the gender yet. Imagine my shock when I saw the ultrasound for the gender!	That must have been so exciting!"
"Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met	That's great! I bet you are excited!"
"Even though there are plenty of flirts around, I remain loyal to my wife.	That is a very good thing to do."
"It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one, which was 5 years ago now.	I understand, but I don't think you are being too hard on yourself.  It's a lot to keep a long term relationship going, and I know you love her."
"My friend got a new truck, I'm really envious of him.	That is awesome!"
"I agree, if I work hard I could buy that truck.	I know how you feel. I'm trying to get a truck, but my money's not going to it."
"I should, I just need the drive to get out there and do it. I need to stop wasting money.	Hello, I feel that today is going to be a wonderful day .... I will enjoy it	I love your enthusiasm!  What are you doing today?"
"If I really like to be positive, despite the difficulties	That's true, it's always better than feeling down."
"so it is ... a big hug	I have been looking after my wife this week. She has the flu	That sounds awful! I hope she recovers."
"It seems so. Sleeping all day today lol	That's great that you are looking after her."
"This morning and I saw a tree, I never detailed it, but this time I saw it beautiful ... I realized God exists	Oh that is really nice."
"I gave thanks in spite of the difficulties	That's really cool. I'm glad to see that people have a positive outlook on the world."
"thank you for your comments	Today I realized that my daughter sings wonderful, I enjoy it a lot ... I was impressed	I love to watch my son sing.  He's a good singer."
"she is 9 years old ... she is a nice girl	Oh I see. She is 9 years old? That's a lot of years for a kid to learn to sing."
"that's right ... thanks for your comment	Hi, I feel bad because I've realized that I do not love my husband, but I do not have the courage to tell him	I would tell him, but he may not take you seriously."
"You're right	Oh wow, I am so glad you have realized. What happened that made you feel this way?"
"thanks	I'm looking for a new job, and I'm feeling pretty good about my options.	Oh no! What are your options?"
"There's a lot of openings for tech jobs lately, especially technical support.	I have a friend who works for a tech company."
"My wife just went out of town for school for 2 months.  I don't really know anyone here, so I don't know what I'm going to do while she's gone.	Yeah that sucks. You can try to make friends."
"I'm sure it is great for her, but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.	Yeah, it can be a little stressful.  But I'm sure she's going to have a great experience.  I hope she does!"
"Hello, I made a serious mistake. I made a comment without bad intentions of the elders. I related them to the dinosaurs, and my father heard it ... he looked me in the eyes ... and he told me that you too could be one of them ... I felt bad	That is a terrible thing to hear. I would have told them to go and get a new teacher."
"yes, but I feel like a cockroach	That's terrible. Did he not understand the context?"
"thanks	I'm supposed to be on a diet, but I couldn't help myself and I ate three chocolate bars.	That's bad. What kind of chocolates are they?"
"But I'm supposed to be on a diet! I can't lose weight if I have no self control :(	Oh no.  I hope you can control your self-control.  I've been there.  I had to get a new stomach stapled because I was eating so much.  It was painful but worth it to get off the diet and get healthy.  Good luck!"
"my husband lost his job a couple of months ago and yesterday he finally got a new job!!	That's great news!  What kind of job is it?"
"He is such a hard working man! He works so much so i could stay home with our baby	That's so awesome! I bet you're so proud of him! I'm sure he's going to make it big soon!"
"I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.	That is so rude."
"Ugh, that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.	It can be so annoying. Did you get to take a nap?"
"I lost my favorite hoodie somewhere. I'm so upset. Like how could i lose a hoodie? it's so big, did i just leave it somewhere?	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you lose it in a store?"
"I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it	That's crazy."
"I'm going to see my parents in 3 weeks!! I didn't see them since 2014! I'm so excited	That is exciting!  What are you going to do with them?"
"no, with my little baby. they've never met my son, they can't wait	Oh wow, that's great! What are your parents like?"
"My wife had been out of the country for 2 months for school.  I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.	That's so sweet of you!"
"Yeah, it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	That's so nice of you.  Did you have fun?"
"I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.	That sucks. Do you think they're just having a bad day?"
"No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.	Yeah, they're always a pain.  I've never been to their house but they've been to mine.  They're not very considerate."
"Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!	my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing	Oh man. Did everyone catch it?"
"she did, she didn't say anything but i know she heard it	That was so embarrassing. I would have said something."
"My girlfriend went on a week trip with her friends, and left me alone to fend for myself.	That's awful. Did she have to work or something?"
"Mostly been playing video games, but it's so boring without her.	That is sad. I hope you can get through this and make some new friends."
"Hello ... I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not, the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth	I can relate! Sometimes I just want to say thank you for the good things and let the bad things go!"
"For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it	I am glad that you are able to assimilate your struggles and grow from them."
"for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible	I know that feeling.  I had a similar experience.  I had a friend of mine who was in prison for armed robbery and he had to serve time.  He told me that he had to be responsible and not do anything stupid.  He had to be in control of himself.  I learned it from him.  I realized that I was responsible and I had to do things the right way.  I had no money, no car and no friends.  He had everything"
"condition the mind and spirit	Yeah, it's all about the mind, you know?"
"I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.	That must have been tough."
"yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort	I'm so sorry to hear that. It's a very tough time. I'm glad you have your mother with you."
"I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some.	I had plans to move from Florida to California, but I'm starting to get cold feet...	That sounds like it would be a long move!"
"Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.	It's not going to be better.  You're going to be cold.  You're going to be bored.  I'm starting to get cold feet too."
"today I think today is a day to learn, to hug, to smile, to make someone happy	Oh, yes! I think that is true too! I had a friend that was going through a tough time, but we were going on vacation. I just went up to visit her and we had a great day."
"that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that, to my children I kiss them, my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something	Yeah I know how it feels to be the one being the parent."
"It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile	I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends, no husband, no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life	Oh, that is terrible. What are you doing to try to meet new people?"
"not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward	I feel you, but you are not alone.  There are a lot of people out there.  If you don't have friends, then maybe it's not a problem.  You might need to look for someone to hang out with.  You might need to get a job or a way to pay for things.  You could just need a break or something to do.  Maybe you should try to meet new people.  Maybe you should try to get a job or a way"
"My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.  I can't wait to go pick her up at the airport!	That's a good idea.  You can't go to the airport without a good wife!"
"I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.	I'm glad you got cut off. You're welcome. I hope you get to see her soon!"
"Germany for a language immersion course.	I am so thrilled to be able to go on a short but long overdue vacation	That is awesome! What are you going to do?"
"A short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water.	That sounds like so much fun!"
"Down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks. It is around the current river	I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.	That's a bit rude, I guess. I would have just gone online and found a caterer."
"Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.	Yeah that's a sexist thing, and it's weird because I've never heard of that kind of reaction before."
"I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.	That's not a big deal, you can still enjoy it and not feel bad about it!"
"The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.	That's so cool. I'm glad you were honest."
"Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.	how was your day?	That is a good one. How was it?"
"yeah good. whats your name?	i am good. i am happy to be alive."
"oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend	hello how was your day?	I am having a great day."
"yeah fine great day	i had a good day."
"yeah nice to talk to you.	I wore wrong pair of socks to the college. But, no was there to spot it. But, when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes. At, that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes. They made a fun of me. That was very awkward situation.	I know, I feel so bad!"
"My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.	Yeah, I'm glad it's over."
"ohh	I went for a job interview, and it seemed to go pretty well.	Oh, what kind of job were you interviewing for?"
"It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.	Oh, I'm so sorry! You must be very excited!"
"I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.	I know, it's hard, but it's worth it in the end.  You'll be glad when you see your friends again!"
"Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.	Oh no. I am sorry to hear that. I am sure it is not easy for you to meet new friends. I hope you will be able to meet new people."
"I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.	It's okay.  She's going for work and you're just worried about the distance?"
"Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.  We just moved recently and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	Oh no!  That's a bummer.  Did you make it to the airport?"
"Germany for a language course.	I almost got in a fight in a drive-thru lineup.	That's crazy. What happened?"
"No, the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.	I bet he was shocked when you called him out"
"Yes, afterwards I regretted the confrontation.  I thought I could have easily been shot.	I got on a stranger's boat by accident at the marina.	That is so crazy. What did you do?"
"Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off, but I sure felt stupid about it.	Oh that is pretty bad. Did you have to pay to go back on the boat?"
"Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.	I was looking at old pictures from my first ""adult"" apartment, and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates.	Oh, what did you do there?"
"It can, but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore, but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.	Yeah, I've had that feeling before too. It's like, you can't go back, but it's also like, ""Hey, I remember how good that was, and I wish I could be there again."""
"Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to. I was in a house full of people screaming and yelling.	That is crazy.  What did you do?  Did you go home?  Did you go back to work?  I'm curious, what happened?  I hope you are fine."
"My friend and her mom were fighting about money, and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.	Oh, that is so sad.  I hope it gets better.  I hate when that happens in my house."
"I hope so too. I plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this.	I had a job interview today and i think it really well.	That is great, how did it go?"
"The interviewer told me that I was his favorite interview so far. And I think my qualifications are a really good match for the company.	That is good news.  What is the job?"
"I saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so I called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog, but it turned out I was wrong.  Whoops.	That's a funny story. What dog was it?"
"Yeah, I don't like calling people out in general, don't know what made me think to do it this time.	Yeah, I know, but it just happened, and I didn't want to mess it up further."
"I'm surprised the police are going to let they get away with it.	That's terrible. I would have called the FBI if I had to."
"I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.	That's pretty weird. Did you report the mailman?"
"My test results come back today. I do hope everythings ok.	That's great! I hope you get good results!"
"I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.	I'm glad you got a chance to talk to them and get your results. Hopefully everything is alright."
"Absolutely! I'm just over-worrying because I've always been so healthy. Just a little stressed out.	I went back to my home where I grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me. I had so many fun times with my best friends when I was a child.	That is awesome. What kind of memories did you have?"
"Playing outside in the summer time. Many fun summer times. Swimming holes, icecream, catching fireflies.	I love the summer time. I have a pool that is always a blast to hang out in."
"Me too!	My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.	Oh, nice. I'm glad they did that for you."
"Thanks, now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.	That's awesome. I'm glad they could help you out like that."
"The more problems I have to deal with, the more faith, and faithful I become. I am stronger in my faith when bad things happen in my life and around me.	That is really true. When I was in the military, we were going through a really tough time and things were very bad, but when we arrived at the base we were all so happy and at peace that everything worked out."
"I was told once by a dear departed friend that ""what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt.	It is so hard to deal with bad stuff. I just take a deep breath and try to stay positive."
"yeh to that	I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well, but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.	That's a bummer! I hope they didn't think you were uninterested or unprepared."
"I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.	I can't imagine being embarrassed about that, especially if the job is something that would make you happy! What were you doing before the interview?"
"I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.	I agree with you. I have been jealous of my coworker for years."
"You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.	I am jealous of him because I am not."
"Okay, I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.	I just got a puppy, but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.	Oh, I'm so sure you'll be able to get by fine. You're not going to leave him alone!"
"Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.	Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I hope he gets bored and gets out of there!"
"Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.	I understand that."
"If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.	I am sorry, I was thinking about a different context. It's a situation that is very hard to deal with."
"My dog disappeared while I was away at college.	I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a long time ago?"
"My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.	That's terrible. What did you do to try to find her?"
"Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.	I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!	That is awesome! I have 2 nieces, 1 is 4 and the other 1 is 6!"
"Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby.	That sounds so exciting. I'm sure you can't wait!"
"Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors!	I can understand why you'd want to leave that to them! I hope everything works out for you."
"Oh cool! What kind of doctor?	Yeah! They're going to put me in the hospital."
"Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.	I know.  She is a very smart and athletic young woman."
"My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.	That is amazing. I am so proud of her too! She has worked hard to get where she is. I hope she will be the first of her family to go to college."
"I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.	Oh, I see what happened.  How did that make you think?"
"Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.	I am sorry to hear about your situation, but I would like to remind you that life is short.  If you are unhappy in life, it is only temporary.  It's not always about the job you have, it's about what you do with it.  If you are happy in life, that means you are doing what makes you happy and what you're passionate about.  You can make your own happiness.  If it's hard for you, maybe you should look into"
"A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.	It was so scary! What did the tree do after that?"
"No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.	That is very kind of him. I hope the rest of the tree is okay!"
"I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.	That's a nice memory.  What happened to that person?"
"She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.	Yeah I feel you.  She's always talking about herself and her music.  It's so annoying."
"Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.	Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!	That sounds like a great time. I'm glad to hear that you have some good memories from the past."
"Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!	That's so true. I miss it all so much now that I'm older and have more responsibilities and bills and stuff."
"That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.	Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time, but now I worry that they will come back.	Oh no! That must have been scary! Are they looking to steal something?"
"Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.	It's so sad, I'm sorry. Did you report it to the police?"
"I woke up this morning, and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.	oh no that is so sad"
"I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.	That is terrible! I hope the mailman is not hurt."
"I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well, but I guess not.	I am sorry, but that is the way it is sometimes.  What kind of job did you interview for?"
"Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.	That is unfortunate. I hope you get the chance you deserve in the future."
"Last week, my pants fell down in gym class. The elastic strap holding them up broke.	I bet that was embarrassing!"
"I ran out of the gym crying, and the whole class pointed and laughed.	That is terrible! I bet everyone was laughing at you. Did you run away?"
"I love my cat, but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.	Oh wow, I have a cat too, and she is so cute."
"She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles.	I know right, she can be so annoying."
"I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!	Oh yea? What are you planning?"
"We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to, and we will be seeing the ocean as well!	That's cool! Where in Somalia are you going to go?"
"I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.	That is a bummer.  Did you tell them about it?"
"Yes, it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.	That must have been frustrating. Did you tell them after you had cleaned it up?"
"I won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy, proud	It's good to see people taking pride in themselves"
"It was for a chess competition.	That's cool, did you play chess in college?"
"They gave a cash money of 200$. Isn't that cool? Have you won any?	I have a coworker that will not stop talking. He mostly talks about himself	That's terrible. How often does he talk about himself?"
"Yes, it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people, but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.	I have had that problem with coworkers too.  I would just try to be friendly and not give him a hard time.  Sometimes people need a little space to talk about themselves.  I'm sure you can be friendly without giving him too much space.  Maybe try to have a talk with him to see if you can find out why he talks so much.  Sometimes people talk a lot because they have a lot to say.  Maybe you can talk about work and see if he"
"I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.	That is so cool! What is it?"
"Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be, so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting, I guess.	That's frustrating."
"I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around, and people laughed at me.	That's pretty embarrassing! Did you get hurt badly?"
"That is good advice. I feel better about this.	Yeah, I was pretty embarrassed at the time. But I've been walking around since then with a bit of confidence."
"I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.	I bet that was fun to see! How long has it been since you all met?"
"It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week, not 20 years ago.	I am glad you were happy about seeing that friend!"
"I just saw the craziest thing! A baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!	That is quite crazy!  What was it doing?"
"She couldn't have been older than one!	I am not sure what to think, it is quite an unusual thing to see."
"I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly, it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do, even though I put my best work and most effort into it.	Oh no! That's terrible. What did you do to fix things?"
"It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.	It is. I am sure it was not easy to do, especially since you put your best work in."
"That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!	I'm worried that if my Aunt doesn't answer her phone, I won't be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend.	That's a good plan. I bet she's going to answer it."
"Yes, I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.	That's terrible."
"I am always suffering due to lack of money and I wish I could be rich someday	Oh, you are not happy with what you have?"
"That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks	I agree, but we are not going to be rich.  We are lucky to be here."
"ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair	That's right."
"That is so true. But to lead a happy life, money is necessary to some extent.	I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.	Oh I am sorry. Did you move to another city or state?"
"Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere.	Oh man. That's terrible. I hope you get out of there eventually."
"I feel sorry for me too!	Oh, that sucks! I'm sorry you have to live in a mine site. I don't think I could live in a mine site. I don't know if I would want to even be honest. I'm just glad you're alive!"
"They are very helpful and I always will be faithful to them	I'm glad they're good for you!"
"Yes, what about you? Do you feel likewise?	I am a very loyal guy, I will do everything in my power to be that way"
"Do you follow any particular denomination?	I'm so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend. I was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up	Oh, that's great! I have a few good friends who are always there for me. What kind of friend are you?"
"yes, and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money	That's great! What a nice friend she is. I bet that made you feel better."
"I saw this kid on a skateboard the other day.  I thought he was gonna wipe out hard, but he pulled off some kind of multi-flip jump thing that really shocked me.	Oh my, that's so cool.  How old is the kid?"
"I know, right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid, made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line, never managed to do anything else.	That's cool, I used to love watching skateboarding videos online and it always amazed me how talented they are"
"I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!	I am so angry!  Why do people do that?"
"I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them	I agree.  I have seen that.  It's not always easy to be kind to people you don't know."
"I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(	That is a tough time for you."
"I know he will, i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky	Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hope he is not too cranky. Is he okay?"
"I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.	Oh my, I would have been very angry."
"Yeah, I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one, but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.	That's crazy.  I'm glad that they weren't hurt.  I'm glad that the dog was not.  I'm glad that the dog was not."
"I just recently finished potty training my dog, that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.	Yeah, I can imagine.  It was a lot of work, but worth it to have a dog."
"I can imagine a rescue, generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get, can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!	I am sure it was.  It's always a little stressful.  But it's good that it's over and he's finally done."
"My dog started looking really sick and in pain, but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet, so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.	Oh that's terrible. What kind of dog did you have?"
"Yeah, he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing, but he got medicine and rest and is good now.	I hope he's fine now."
"I was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life. It was great . You ever have any of those moments?	I do, it's a great feeling to be in the right place at the right time."
"I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?	I've had a few of those moments in my life. It is a very peaceful thing, to be in nature. I'm glad you had that experience."
"Oh I can agree with that completely!	I interviewed for a job a while back that I was waiting on hearing about.  I felt like it went well.	That is good! What kind of job is it?"
"A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!	That's great! I'm sure you did great! What was the position for?"
"Have you ever had to file for disability?	I have, it was very difficult and stressful, I was in the military and was injured in a car accident, had to go to the VA and file."
"I've had to recently. Its been really tough.	It can be very tough."
"Do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?	I think I do, but I don't have kids yet so I don't know."
"My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first, but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.	I know what you mean! I love when kids do that. I have two and they love to talk about the latest video games they play."
"I've had to help take care of others before as well.	That must be hard, how did you do?"
"Yeah, I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.	That's tough, but you should be proud. It's not easy."
"I failed my driving test twice, but I was really encouraged and did better the next time.	It sounds like you are a determined person."
"I agree, I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.	It is good you were persistent, I am sure it will work out for you"
"I once went a restaurant, and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen!	Oh wow! That must've been scary."
"I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out, how can a place like that operate!?	Oh my god! That must have been disgusting to see! How long had the restaurant been in business?"
"Do any of your kids play any sports?	I do not know what you are talking about!"
"My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.	I have a son who plays baseball. He is 12. I was worried that he would break his arm. But nope not that day.  I'm so glad she's not interested in that."
"I was so late for work one day, I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!	I can relate, it's like the worst."
"I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on, I was so in shock, even the neighbors saw. It was bad.	I would have been so embarrassed!"
"I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.	oh that sounds so frustrating"
"The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.	That's so rude of them.  I would have been mad.  I would have yelled at them.  I'm glad you didn't get mad.  I would be a little mad if I had been in their shoes.  I would be a little angry, but I'm not sure I would do anything more than call the store to see if they are hiring more people.  Maybe they will get the hint and start to change their behavior!"
"I was so excited when I got my new puppy, it was awesome!	Oh that sounds so cute! What kind of breed is he/she?"
"I agree with you, the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions, positive ones of course!	It's so wonderful when you see your puppy grow and be the best version it can be."
"Those were simpler times, I wish I could go back and relive those days!	I agree. I remember when I was a kid, my father would take me to the movies."
"Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.	I agree, I would love to be a kid again"
"It was great, so much time running around outside without a care in the world.	I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child.	I'm glad you had that experience. I had to work really hard for it too, and it was a great motivator for me to keep working hard."
"My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest, was the one that released the most gas.	That sounds like fun! Did you get any awards for it?"
"I'm sleep training my toddler, he never slept in his crib before. He is crying and it makes me feel so bad	Oh wow, that's a tough thing to do. Did you try anything to get him back into the crib?"
"how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry	Oh, that is so hard to cope. I had a hard time with my older one. It's like your brain just gets used to it and you forget about the pain. It takes a long time to adjust to."
"I just got back from my vacation. We stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there, it was so much fun! We really had a blast!	Oh wow, I love the beach! Did you do anything exciting?"
"It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years, due to personal reasons, so you can imagine how we felt when we went!	Oh wow, that's great! Where did you go?"
"As I look at my 21 year old son, I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!	I know what you mean.  It's hard to believe how fast kids go."
"Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.	That is true. I am sure that is how a lot of people feel about their children."
"I want to go on a vacation next month but now I cant.	That sucks.  Is it a vacation from work?"
"Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.	I am sure you will get to go on that vacation!"
"My son is in his last year of college! We are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!	That's great, how many years of college is that for him?"
"He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.	That's awesome. I hope you all have a lot of time together and enjoy it."
"We took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!	That's great! What is wrong with him?"
"I hope so. Do you have any kids?	Oh that's good, I do have a kid, but he has a serious medical condition. I'm so worried about him!"
"I went to the flea market last weekend!	I love flea markets. What did you buy?"
"Well, kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies, haha.	That's fun. I've never had one before. I've had a few of Beanie Pusheu's."
"I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s.	I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.	Oh my!  That is a lot of work.  What age is she?"
"haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol	It's good that she has some responsibility!"
"My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!	I am so mad!  That sounds so scary!"
"It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.	I hope the baby rat is okay."
"She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!	My mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital. I was so concerned, but she became better after a few days. Such a huge relief!	I'm sorry you had to deal with that, but it's great that your mom is now recovering. It can be tough on the family, but it's great that she's feeling better."
"Thanks, she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it, so it could have been much, much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!	Oh, my goodness, that's so terrible. I'm sorry to hear about your mother."
"I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.	That sounds very nice.  How was it?  Did you have to clean out your yard?"
"The cat appeared very relaxed, but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.	That's great that you helped the cat."
"One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.	Yeah I would've been scared!  How long was you out?"
"If that wasn't frightening enough, I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!	I can only imagine how scared that must have been."
"I didn't force her into anything. She seemed to know what she was doing anyway	That's good. You're a good person!"
"I wish it never happened now.	Yeah it's so hard when you know you should've done something about it."
"she was 8	That's terrible. Did you guys have any problems?"
"A little while ago, my friend went on another beach vacation. It was her 3rd one for the year. My family and I hadn't been on vacation for several years, due to issues beyond our control, so I begrudged her trip a bit.	That's too bad, but I'm sure you're glad she got to have some fun time with you!"
"Yes, true, I know they tend to let bills go for things like that, which I don't do.	That is so sad."
"I am so happy it's a boy	It's always a girl!"
"He'll be here in about 3 months	That's exciting. Do you have any plans for the holidays this year?"
"Hey, I just started the keto diet!	I'm trying keto myself. It is quite difficult, but it seems to work."
"It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first, but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.	That's awesome. How long are you planning to stay on the diet for?"
"Thank you, I wanted to be completely ready, so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.	Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy	That's great. I bet you're excited?"
"I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha	Yeah, I'm happy for you. You must have been so excited."
"I just had my Sweet 16 party...	That's awesome. What was it like?"
"Well, about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...	I bet you had a great time! What kind of car did you get?"
"A BLUE one! I'm so devastated. I don't know what to do.	I recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out 6 years ago.	That's great. What made you want to go back?"
"I was scared about it at first, but so far I have all A's. I must say, I'm proud of myself!	Oh wow, I bet you're really proud of yourself! I'm sure you're not the only one, though."
"Over the past year I've been on a weight loss journey of over 100 pounds.	That's amazing! How did you do it?"
"As well as exercise and diet, by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.	That's awesome, I've struggled with that myself. What was the hardest part for you?"
"I never liked milk growing up, because my family drank skim.	That makes sense. I used to drink skim milk."
"Well, first I tried whole milk, and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk, and I like it!	I used to hate milk growing up as well. I think it's okay for kids, but for adults it can be gross"
"I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.	Yeah I like 2% too"
"No, but I am satisfied with my choice.	I can understand that."
"I just got back from our vacation, but the drive there was so nerve wracking. There was heavy rain and traffic, and some nighttime driving. Had me on edge	Oh no! Did you get there in one piece?"
"Yes, well, it was just one of those things I know, but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.	It was so frustrating, but also so necessary to make sure we got to our destination on time."
"Recently, I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.	That is very sad. What did he do?"
"It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.	I am so sorry to hear that."
"On my recent vacation to Florida, there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving! It was such a hassle!	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have to pay for the time?"
"I wanted to pull my hair out lol. But, knew once we were past it, there was the beautiful ocean on the other side...finally!	That's crazy. I would be so frustrated. 45 minutes is an eternity."
"Robby got me flowers today.	That's nice. I have to get flowers for my mom."
"Yes, how could you forget? It was a nice surprise, but then he said.. ""happy anniversary.""	That's so sweet.  I would love a bouquet of flowers."
"Thanks, but I'm so embarrassed that I forgot!! D;	dad caught me kissing my half aunt	That's so gross. I would never even think to do that. Did you get in trouble?"
"I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her	That's a terrible thing for your dad to do. I'm so sorry you had to experience that."
"Me found cave.	yea thats pretty rare to find one. what was inside?"
"Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.	That's awesome.  How did she paint it?"
"Me miss BC. Me miss wife.	One of the scariest, yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that I was going to have a baby.	Yeah I know that feeling. I had a miscarriage, and it was very hard to get through."
"Oh, we were totally unprepared. In fact, my partner and I were working out of state in a compromising environment. We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!	I am so happy for you. That's such a big change"
"When I was pregnant, I felt ill until it was over. The doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby.	That's so terrible. Did you have a miscarce?"
"Usually the sickness stops within the first few months, so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all, I had a healthy, bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.	That is amazing. I hope you and your baby are both doing great."
"When my dog passed away, I felt so helpless. She was old and suffering and I felt angry that there was nothing I could do other than put her down.	That's so sad. I lost a dog too, and it's so hard to deal with."
"She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough, I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.	I feel for you. My dogs are getting older too. I'm trying not to put her down. I want to spend more time with her and make sure she's comfortable."
"I had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him	That's so weird. Why was he in the back?"
"I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted	I know right?  It really makes you mad when people are not respectful."
"My son is in college and about to return for his Junior year. We have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs.	That's awesome. You must be really happy for him."
"We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!	I feel you. I am not able to save much, so I don't have any financial resources. I just try to be as responsible as I can with what I do have."
"After a long few months of being a hermit, I went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!	I can see why you would do that, it's great you got out and had fun."
"It was definitely exciting for me! I haven't been able to play with a dog since my own passed away.	Yeah, I've had dogs since I was a kid."
"I've been feeling a bit blue and overwhelmed lately.	That's a bit of a downer. Do you have any plans to deal with your feelings?"
"I could definitely use one! However, I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!	That's a great reason."
"These days my skin has never looked better. My diet is good, my family life is good, I've got good grades. Life is good!	Yeah, I am pretty happy too, life is great right now!"
"Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water. It's amazing how much the little changes can impact.	That's a good point. I'm trying to make more time to eat more water and maybe cut down on some of those junk foods that are so easy to eat."
"I flew all the way to New York City to buy a designer dress for the prom.	That's awesome! Where did you go to buy the dress?"
"I am, thanks, but I wouldn't go there... Becky STILL managed to get the same dress as me! I am so mad!	I know how you feel, I've been there too! I'm so mad too!"
"I just love playing retro games. Takes me back	That is great! What is your favorite game?"
"Oh yeah? Cool. I like the old Sega Mega Drive games. The music is just classic on those games	I agree. I have played a lot of classic games."
"One night, I was home alone, when suddenly, I heard a loud BANG!	oh my god what happened?"
"It was a ghost! I ran into the kitchen to investigate, and I saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window.	Oh my gosh! That's creepy!"
"Recently my daughter was voted 'Most Artistic' by her peers! She is so talented and we feel lucky to be her parents.	That's awesome!  What kind of art does she make?"
"Yes, she has a natural talent, but really puts much practice and time into it.	I am sure she is a super talented kid.  What are her hobbies?"
"what does that mean?	I'm a little confused. You're saying what does it mean?"
"this has obviously gone all wrong somewhere	I know that feeling. It was my sister's wedding and it was a disaster."
"5	A year ago, I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.	That is so nice of you. What did you do with it?"
"I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat, Muffin.	That's really sweet of you."
"I'm proud that she traveled across the world all by herself. 2 big suitcases and all	Yeah, I can only imagine that.  How did she manage that?"
"Wife. And she was 6 months pregnant to boot!	That's so brave of her, I bet."
"There was a storm the other day, close to our home. There was a tornado warning near it, so I was afraid and nervous!	That is crazy, I bet you felt so safe."
"Yes, it luckily passed our home, but you just never know!	I was scared too! I hope you're okay!"
"My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend, I'm really happy for him. :)	That's really sweet.  What did you say?"
"Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money, but still wanted her to have something nice.	Yeah, he gave her my grandmother's rings, since I had them available.  He was really happy.  I'm happy for him."
"I can't wait to get a new car soon	That is exciting. Are you buying a new car or are you looking for one?"
"I want a compact SUV, like maybe something like a Toyota RAV4	I have never had the desire to get a car. I am too lazy."
"not yet ready for the baby, need fix up his room	That's so sad. Do you have a little one of your own?"
"Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!	I am so sorry!  I hope the baby goes well for you!"
"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	That is awful! What did he need?"
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	I know how you feel.  That was my brother's gift from the same company.  They also didn't deliver it on time either."
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	I hate people like that."
"It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it	That's terrible. Did you report her to the police?"
"Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired	I'm sure you missed out a lot of fun and social time"
"It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again	I am sorry to hear that.  Did you find a good job?"
"For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies	What was it that you thought they were leading you to?"
"Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!	That is terrible.  What a horrible situation.  I am sorry you had to deal with that."
"At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently	That's a good thing to learn.  What was she not liking about it?"
"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special	That's so sweet.  What was it?"
"I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant	It's a very brave thing to do."
"Yes. It's a boy	That's awesome.  How old are you?"
"My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business.	Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that!"
"I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.	That's terrible. What was your child sick with?"
"I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him	Oh that's a tough spot! I'm not sure how to deal with it."
"In the club	That's so rude of him!"
"I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to	That is good to hear."
"She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew	That's nice. What did she want to do?"
"I know I will save the money I need for the baby	That's great! I'm sure you will be a great parent!"
"Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday	I know that feeling. I had my second baby 2 years ago and it was so hard working and paying bills all the time. I feel like it's hard work but so worth it!"
"I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out	I know what you mean. It can be hard to deal with it when it does."
"Kinda. I thought it was a secret	I know what you mean. I was in a relationship and I was cheating. I didn't want to do it anymore. But I ended the relationship because I felt like I was cheating. I wish it never happened."
"it was brutal	I hate when the weather is so unpredictable"
"i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.	I can understand why you were worried about that."
"yes. homeless for a bit	I'm sorry. Did you find the meeting okay?"
"i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye	I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm not sure what to say."
"it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her	I'm sure she will forgive you."
"i was heartbroken when my dad passed away.. still not over it.	yea that is really hard"
"5 years..	That sucks. I am sorry to hear that.  I lost my father a few years ago.  It was very tough for me.  I hope you can find some comfort.  It takes a while.  It will get better.  I hope you can get through it.  It is a long road."
"i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition.. she seems like a born artist	I'm not much of a painter, but I have always been fascinated by art. What was the theme of the competition?"
"yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her	That is great! I love painting, but I never have the chance to do anything like that. I'm glad you are able to do it."
"i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents	That's a pretty common feeling for a lot of us I guess. What did you do?"
"yeah, but still.. that feeling never went away	i do the same. I just try to be honest as much as possible. I hope you can find peace with it."
"i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere	That sounds like a very relaxing feeling.  I am a little anxious when traveling but I have learned to take it in stride."
"well, i guess women are more detail oriented	I think it's a matter of having confidence, I've never found that to be the problem."
"i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her	I know right? I feel the same way about my husband. We're not even in a long-term relationship."
"yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me, i escaped from there right awat	Yeah she's really cute, i bet."
"my dog passed away earlier this year	I'm sorry to hear that, that's really tough. I lost my dog a few years ago and I miss her so much."
"yeah.. but its too soon i feel	Yeah, I know. It is. It was a week or so. He was a 5 year old."
"some guy drove past me so fast last week.. i was furious	Oh no!  That is so annoying!  I hate when that happens."
"yeah.. i barely escaped!	That's pretty crazy! Did you get a ticket for him?"
"1	I love the sound of the 1!"
"soory it was mistakenly typed.	That is so frustrating, did they fix it?"
"how was your day?	I'm taking the California Bar exam to become an attorney in February and I'm sooo nervous!	That's a big deal!  What are the most difficult subjects you're studying?"
"I played a video game when I was younger, called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and it made me want to become one!	I've heard that one before.  It's a fun game."
"once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life	Oh I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"yeah that really sucks.	Yeah I can relate to that.  How did you deal with it?"
"I fell down at work, and my khaki pants ripped open.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! Did you get a replacement?"
"I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.	That must have been a shocker. Did you have to go to work anyway?"
"My grandpa is coming to visit!,5|5|5_5|5|5,	I'm glad you are getting to spend time with him.  How old is he?"
"He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!	That sounds like fun! I love playing Bingo! What kind of Bingo is it?"
"I ate a gas station burrito for lunch. It was not very appetizing. Actually, it was absolutely horrible.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	I have never had a burrito that was that bad. What kind was it?"
"Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.	Oh no, I hope you're okay. Did she have to go?"
"how was your day?	I had a great day! I had the best lunch and the best coffee."
"yeah its an another good day	I had a good day, too! I went to the gym with my wife. We did some exercise and played a game of basketball with our son."
"oh how was the climate there/	That is so cool"
"I managed to accidently flash a dozen people	That is terrible. I can imagine people would be mortified"
"it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like ""oops!	Yeah that's a pretty bad thing to do.  What were you doing?"
"Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive	i have always more trust on my girlfriend	I do too. I am sure that she would never do anything that would hurt me."
"yeah i do. i love her a lot	That's great! I'm sure you're both very happy together."
"what about you?	I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.	Oh no. Are you studying for it?"
"Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.	That sounds like a lot of work. I'm sure you'll do great!"
"I get to go the the zoo tomorrow! They opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal, the sloth!	Oh, that's so cool. I love animals, but my favorite is sloths. I have never been to the zoo before, but I'm sure it's going to be a fun time!"
"They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!	That sounds so much fun. I bet you are really excited!"
"I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!	That is a pretty rude thing to say to someone! Did you tell them to go back to the room?"
"Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?	Oh that sounds like a nasty problem! I think I should tell them that they are going to get some treatment for that!"
"i have been more happy	That's good to hear. How are things?"
"happier now beacuse i have been built a new house	I am so happy for you!  That is a big move!  I would be so nervous about moving!"
"Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.	I know exactly what you're talking about."
"I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal	That's a good thing, I hope you guys have a good time this year."
"i have watched races in tv	I bet that was exciting!"
"nope iam a street racer	That is so cool. I've always wanted to get my hands on a street car."
"i feels happy	That's good. What is it about that you are feeling happy?"
"because i built a new house	I bet that was a great feeling. What house did you build?"
"i have been more happy that i have bought a car	It is great that you got a new car. I'm still waiting for mine to be ready."
"audi q7	i am glad you bought a car"
"My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.	That's great! I bet you were excited about it!"
"She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version.	That's awesome! I love watches!"
"I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.	It's a great feeling to have achieved your goals, what's next for you?"
"I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.	I am glad you graduated. What are your hopes?"
"I am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that I just finished. I took the final exam yesterday, and I am not sure what score I will receive.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	I bet you are worried about that."
"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.	I hope you get a good score in that class."
"I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.	I hate when that happens.  Did you do anything to stop it?"
"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.	Yeah, that can be very hard on you. I hate when that happens."
"My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away.	That's a bummer. I hope she's in good condition now."
"The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off	That is terrible! What happened to her?"
"I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you call the restaurant and let them know about the issues you found?"
"I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.	It's always good to be honest with the restaurant."
"I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.	It's always good to have a connection to your childhood home."
"Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?	I was, and I still have a lot of memories of them. I'm glad you are too."
"I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone	That's great. Did you look back and see what they looked like?"
"Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.	Yeah, sometimes that brings up some good memories."
"We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave.	Yeah I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?	That's good that it didn't damage your home."
"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	That's understandable, what happened?"
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	That's scary. Did they say anything about the results of the tests?"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	That is awesome!  How did they build it so quickly?  Did they hire a team of contractors?"
"Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?	I haven't, but I'm sure I will one day!"
"I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.	I'm sorry to hear that.  What was the cause of death?"
"Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.	That was a tough day for you."
"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	That's crazy. What was wrong?"
"I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	I agree, I've had that happen to me before, I was waiting for an appointment to see my doctor and they kept delaying the start time and when they finally did, they just sat at the doctor's office for a while, talking and laughing. I was so frustrated."
"Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	Yeah, that's the kind of attitude I'm not looking for!"
"I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious.	That's good! Are you studying for the test? What's the test about?"
"Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.	That sounds like a lot of work. I hope you do well."
"I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it!	I love going to the beach! What is Orange Beach like?"
"We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?	That sounds so nice, where is Orange Beach?"
"One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!	That sounds like so much fun.  I'm sure you have some great memories of that."
"We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!	That sounds so nice! I bet you were very happy!"
"It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?	That is nice to know."
"Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top	Oh man, I know what you mean. I had one of those keys a long time ago. I was so excited and sad at the same time."
"I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.	That's terrible. Did they give you any trouble?"
"I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.	That's terrible! I'm sorry to hear. I've had that happen to me before and it's so frustrating."
"I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone	That's a good feeling to see him excited about something! Did he get a date?"
"I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution	Oh, that sounds like a pretty awkward situation!"
"sure ... thanks	My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.	That's weird.  Do they talk to each other?"
"I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?	That is not something you should do. It is a waste of your time. If they are going to notice it's too late."
"My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.	I bet!  That's always great to hear.  I'm glad you get recognition for all your hard work!"
"Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!	Oh no. That must be so annoying. What did you do?"
"Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.	I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me.	I'm sure it was not right to be upset."
"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.	I'm sorry.  I'm not sure why I was being so upset.  I'm not sure if it was the baby or the person crying.  It's hard to tell without a way to measure it.  I'm not sure I would do anything to make the situation worse.  I'm just trying to be rational."
"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	That's good to hear. Do you have to stay with the company?"
"Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.	That is good for you. I am glad you are staying."
"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	That's so sweet! I love it!"
"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.	That is nice of her, I hope you are happy with her. She is the only grandparent you have left."
"A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.	That sounds scary! I bet you were relieved when the storm shelter opened and you could get out."
"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.	I am so sorry to hear you were through it.  I am so glad you are all alright.  You are so fortunate!  I am so sorry you were through it too.  I am so sorry you were through it.  I am so sorry you were through it.  You are so fortunate!"
"Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy	That's a nice idea.  I don't really have a garden.  I just have a few plants on the porch.  But I like to think about the plants and how much effort it takes to keep them happy and healthy."
"Especially when you feel something special by nature	That is true, it is very nice to have plants."
"I hope this feeling increases	My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.	That sounds great. What's your wife like?"
"We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.	Yeah, that's cool, but I bet you're really excited.  How long has she been gone?"
"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.	It is great that you are planning a surprise party."
"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	Yeah, that was a stupid thing to tell him. I feel the way you did too, but you were probably trying to be a good friend. I hope he didn't get too upset!"
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	Yeah, you know that feeling when something is wrong? Yeah, I know you should tell him the truth. I mean, if you're really interested in him, it's better to be honest. It's just better for your mental health to be honest. You can say something like ""I'm not really feeling it right now, but I really want to get to know you better"" and just see where it goes from there. I'm sorry you had to do that."
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	I'm sorry to hear that, but it sounds like it was a bit of an unfortunate coincidence.  I hope you were okay in the end."
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	I can understand how that would be a problem. Did you end up getting a stomach bug or was it just something else?"
"I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!	That is so gross!"
"I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!	I know that feeling! I was so disgusted."
"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	That's a good point. I'm sure the owner will be happy to see it."
"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?	I would probably just return it. I would also try to figure out why you wanted it so badly."
"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	That is the worst.  I have a wife who is a complete mind reader.  She will be ""oh, I want to go to Starbucks, but I don't want to go to Starbucks."""
"Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.	I can understand why you would.  I don't like the place we went either.  It is hard to get a good meal at the place we ended up.  We ended up going to a different restaurant.  I think we will go to the place we wanted to eat next.  I don't like to go anywhere else."
"I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.	Oh wow! How was it?"
"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.	That sounds great! I've been busy too!"
"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	That is awesome! What are the classes for?"
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	That's so awesome. I love that you got through those two courses and can now take a breath."
"Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.	Yeah I feel like we have gotten more financially free over the years."
"Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!	That's great to hear. I've always been a bit frugal."
"My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness	Yeah! I feel like they really care about me, I'm glad they are my friends"
"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering	That's very kind of them to do that, I'm sure they're happy they could help you."
"Thanks for your comprehension	Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.	I'm so glad you're safe!  What was the worst part?"
"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.	I would have liked that! I hate storms. They are always so scary."
"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	Oh, I'm sorry.  I hope that you can still enjoy the time you have with friends.  Do you have any family that you can stay with?"
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  I hope you can get through it.  It's not easy but it will get better"
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	That is terrible. Are you looking for someone to talk to?"
"one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel	It sounds like you have a tough road ahead.  I hope you can get through it and come out the other side."
"is that he loved her	This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.	That sounds awful. I hope they were able to get it figured out."
"Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.	It's always something with the plumbing!"
"I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.	Oh no! I'm sorry. What did happen?"
"We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.	I am sorry. I know that things are better now but sometimes we have to wait a little longer. I hope you are happy and not lonely."
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	I know what you mean!  I have to get my kids ready for school in the middle of the night!"
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	I agree with you. I would never want my neighbor to wake me at night."
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	I'm not sure I would have thought of yelling.  I'd just be a bit of a jerk and tell them to go to hell.  I don't think I'd be a jerk like that in the first place.  I just don't like the noise of yelling and yelling and yelling.  I think that's just a natural part of life, but I think I'd just try to find a more constructive way to deal with the situation.  I think that's a lot"
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	It is always good to have some backup plan, and to know that you have the means to move on."
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Hopefully he will be able to do it.  What kind of surgery?"
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	That's terrible! I hope he can do something to help!"
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	I am so sorry to hear about that."
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	You are right. I've heard some doctors do that. It's not good, I agree."
"The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.	That's crazy!  I live in a place that's way too hot in August, so I don't know what to expect.  Do you live in the Midwest or East Coast?  I live in the Midwest, and it's way too hot there in August!  I don't think it's even possible to be 80s in the Midwest!"
"I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.	That is good news. I am happy for it."
"Writing speeches makes me nervous	It does?  why?"
"Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience	I agree, it's a learning curve, but it's worth it! It's a great way to practice your speech skills and get ready to be on stage!"
"True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say	I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days, but they always bring back fond memories	That's true. I used to watch a lot when I was younger."
"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!	That's a good movie. I haven't seen it in ages."
"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	That's true.  I have seen that movie many times and still think that Harry Potter is the best movie.  Harry Potter is more realistic than the other movies, I mean you have to deal with the fact that Harry didn't have a father and was left to be raised on his own."
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	It's true, kids are smart, but they're also stupid. I've had some good friends over and I've had some bad friends over. I don't know what's going on."
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	I am glad you have your first job."
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	That's cool. I have never been to Dairy World."
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	Yeah, but they are really bad for you."
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	That is good. You worked at that place?"
"Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day	You must be a good person yourself."
"Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!	I love seeing that."
"Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing	Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking	Yeah, I love downhill streets."
"I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill	That was so fun! Did you ride it to the bottom?"
"Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed	When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks	That's not cool."
"Yeah, I'm not good with confrontations	That's disgusting. I don't understand why people would do that."
"I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong	I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!	That is awesome! Congratulations!"
"Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!	That's awesome! Congrats! I hope you get some good recognition."
"How long have you been there?	I have been there before. I was so surprised that she broke the news.  I was surprised that I got the news first!"
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	I am new here and I have been here for about 2 weeks. I'm not sure if I can get my application approved. I'm hoping I can get a job soon so I can start to get my life back on track."
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	That is really nice of them.  I bet you were so relieved."
"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.	I know that feeling when something goes wrong. It can be stressful."
"If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*	I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!	That's great! What did you do to earn such a great recognition?"
"I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*	That's awesome! Congrats! What restaurant was it?"
"I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.	That's nice! I hope you guys enjoy it!"
"I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.	So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.	Oh no! I'm sorry you forgot. I've done that too."
"He kinda gave me the ""Mom, really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*	Oh man! I would have been really mad at you for not getting the chips for him!  I have 2 kids myself so I know how hard it can be to get things done when you forget the most important ones.  Maybe next time you can ask him what he really wants and he can help you out!"
"I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].	Yeah, I can imagine that.  It's hard when you forget things, especially when you're a mom.  I remember the times when my kids forgot stuff.  It's like they forget everything except for the one thing you forgot!"
"It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD	That is the worst.  I'm glad you are okay though.  Do you have any kids?"
"I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.	It happens to me sometimes."
"No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.	That is so lucky. I would forget something like that too."
"Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*	That sounds like fun!  What did you make for dinner?"
"Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!	My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.	That is very kind of her.  I have a very hard time paying rent on time, but she is the only place I have ever lived.  I am going through some really tough times right now, and I am not able to afford to pay rent.  I was able to talk her down on the amount and she was very understanding about it."
"I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.	That is very kind of her, it is very hard to have a landlord who is understanding and empathetic. I hope you get a great deal on your rent this month."
"Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.	I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!	I'm sure you did. You must be very good at your job. What kind of job it is?"
"I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.	Oh, I love that.  What did they think of it?"
"Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.	I broke up with my boyfriend last week.	Oh, how did you break up?"
"Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.	I know how you feel, it's tough. But I think you should be happy that you're taking a chance on life."
"Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.	I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!	That is great news!  Congratulations!"
"I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL	That's amazing, you should be proud of yourself!"
"This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!	I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!	That is great!  What were their names?"
"15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?	I hope so. I'm a little worried that it'll be too late though."
"Ah, make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)	Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is, it	Yeah, bills can be such a headache."
"Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!	It happens to me too, I hate it when that happens! I'm glad you got to cancel it though, hope you didn't pay it!"
"The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!	Oh wow! Are they excited?"
"It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks.	That must be exciting!"
"The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.	It's okay. What happened on that day?"
"It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving.	That's a bummer.  Maybe you can try to get your mind in the game for tomorrow."
"really didnt want to anything for days	Oh no! Did something happen?"
"I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it"".	Yeah I can understand that. What was the exam for?"

"thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town	Oh wow, that's awesome. Did you have a lot of work to do?"
"I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this	I'm sorry that you have to go through this.  I'm sure you're a very nice person, and that's why you have no girlfriend."
"Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym	That's great that you were able to work it out and now you're in a relationship."
"I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change	I like routine too.  It's so relaxing!"
"Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.	That is great, what does it consist of?"

"I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing	Oh yeah, I've been trying to eat more carbs, and I've been doing a lot of cardio. I think I'm starting to see a change.  I've lost about 10 pounds in the last 3 weeks. I'm going for the 3 month goal, and I think I'm going to start doing a little bit of strength training too."
"the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls	That's terrible. Did you get any money from your insurance?"
"Last week. we're in temporary housing now	Oh no.  That must be really stressful.  Did you try contacting the insurance company again?  Maybe they will be able to help with your temporary housing."
"I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!	I'm so glad you're okay. That's the worst part about being young."
"I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.	That's awful! Did he survive the rain?"
"I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.	Did you get to talk with her?"
"Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.	I love when people surprise me.  I'm glad she did."

"I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now	Oh wow. I'm glad you're excited about the baby boy, I hope everything goes well!"
"You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap	Yeah, that is a big deal for me too. I'm glad you have a new baby.  I hope you get a lot of sleep soon."
"I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials	That's great, I hope everything goes well!"
"I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back	I can imagine how hard that is, I am a little worried about you.  I hope everything works out and that the baby goes well!"
"She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.	Oh that's cute. Did you guys get back together?"
"Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors	That's so rude of them."
"I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding	Oh I see, you were upset because she refused to do something for you?"
"I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again	I understand how you would be upset, but it sounds like you're a very understanding person, that's good"
"I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.	That is a big milestone!"
"She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.	I am sure she will be a pro at that in no time."
"I did so much practice running in preparation for my 50 metre sprint race at my school!	That's cool! What did you do to practice?"

"I am going to get us a new car!	It is always good to get new car."
"I'm not sure yet. Maybe a Toyota	That sounds like a great idea! Are you looking for something specific?"
"I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.	It was pretty intense. I was worried she might get upset with me for showing it."
"She loved it.  She's 17, I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.	That's awesome. What was it about the movie that you liked?"

"I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.	Oh my goodness!  That is disgusting!  I'm sure you were upset about that.  I've had my fair share of hair in my food.  I just wish that wasn't a part of the meal that I ordered.  I'm so glad you got your money back.  I think I'm going to order a salad at the next meal I have at that restaurant!"
"I finally got a new bike! I've been wanting one for so long!	I'm happy for you.  What's the bike?"
"I hope so, my new bike has so many gears. Such an upgrade from my last one! I can't wait to take it out.	I hope you enjoy your new bike!"

"I'm the only one who cares about paying bills. It's very frustrating	I'm the opposite! I pay all bills on time!"
"Unfortunately no. It's very hard on me because I have to be disciplined with spending. Makes life very boring	I feel you, I'm the only one who pays all of our bills."
"I have a beautiful gray cat named Stormy.  Unfortunately she's contracted feline AIDS.	I am so sorry to hear that."
"Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.	That's terrible. Did she die quickly or slowly?"
"I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid.	I am sure it will be fine.  You will be paid."
"I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.	Oh, that's terrible. Did you talk to the professor about it?"
"I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.	That's a cool find, I bet it was really interesting to see old family pictures"

"I got a letter from my parents this past Friday with a wonderul surprise in it.	That's great, what did they surprise you with?"
"Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous, but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with.	That's nice, what did they do?"
"Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town, I was a bit scared.	That is terrible. Are you okay?"
"I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.	That's a good idea, but it's hard to avoid areas of high crime in some neighborhoods. You're right to be careful."
"When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything.	I am sorry. That must have been hard."
"No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now.	That is very sad.  You are lucky you got away with it.  Did he eventually find out?"
"I was one percent off from passing my math test, I was devastated.	That is awful. I hope you got a good grade."
"I agree, I should of studied harder too. Practice makes perfect!	That's true. It's always better to be over-prepared, rather than to be under-prepared and then trying to cram all night before the test."
"Last night I was minding my own business walking down a street in a not so good area of town when someone started to chase me!	That is so scary. Were you able to run?"
"I managed to get away after a few smart quick turns, but I was shaking and in fear at the end of the chase. It was wild.	That is scary, did they try to follow you home?"
"I was looking through old stuff in my basement and found my old baseball cards! Finding those was like being a kid all over again!	It is fun to dig up old things."
"I used to collect so many when I was younger, it was such an awesome feeling to see them again!	I love collecting sports memorabilia!"

"I went to the beach other day.. such an awesome feeling standing there	Yeah that's always a great experience, especially if you are in the water."
"I most certainly did.. There is something about looking at the calm and glory of the ocean.	That is the best part of summer for me."
"I felt so bad about cheating on my science exam, it was terrible	That is terrible.  Did you pass it?"
"I know, I am disgusted at myself for doing it. I just wanted to pass.	That's a horrible feeling. Did you do well on other subjects?"
"I'm taking my wife out this coming weekend to dance.	That's a fun time to have with your wife, you should be having a lot of fun."
"We haven't been able to go out in quite a long time.  Family and life stuff just gets in the way sometimes.	That sounds like a great time! What kind of dance is she going?"
"My dog passed away couple months back.. i was heartbroken	I am sorry to hear.  I lost a cat a few months back, and it was really hard."
"She got run by a truck.. I felt guilty and blue	That sucks.  It's hard to lose someone you love."
"I always get sad thinking about my dad.	It's normal to feel sad."
"Yeah.. he did. He had cancer.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you have some time to grieve and reflect on your father's life."
"I went to the beach other day	That is always fun. Did you have fun?"
"I sure did! the ocean and the breeze gives me such a sense of joy and calm	I'm glad you went to the beach. Did you go to the ocean side or the beach side?"
"I was so happy that i got to see Hamilton the other day	Oh, that's awesome! I've seen it a few times. What was your favorite part?"
"Yeah, the same. Lin Manuel is a genius to say the least!	That's amazing! What was your favorite part?"
"I went to visit my family the other day	I love when people can spend the day with their family."
"It was such a joyful experience. They always warm my heart	That's good. I hope you have fun."
"A dog chased me through a street the other day	That is not good. Did it get away?"
"No i somehow managed to escape.. it was so scary	Yeah that would be terrifying. Did you hit anything?"
"I feel so caring of my little sister	Yeah that is very caring of you."
"Yeah.. I always look out for her no matter what the problem is	That's very nice of you!  What are your sisters' hobbies?"
"I was really nervous when i went to meet my girl's parents	Did everything go well?"
"It turned out well actually, we had a nice time	I bet you were. What was it like?"
"A dog chased me through our street last night	That's so creepy. What did the dog do to you?"
"I think so.. it looked like that. I was shivering when i finally managed to escape	I would not have been that brave."
"I really envy people who can sing	That's a great quality. I can't sing, but I'm a great singer of the guitar!"
"Yeah.. i did. i never got the chance to pursue that	I have been trying to learn singing for years but i just can't get it down."
"I had to leave the house for a bit, before I left I gave my kids instructions on what I wanted them to do around the house.	That sounds like it was a lot of responsibility! I'm sorry you were gone for so long. What did you do when you came back?"
"I figured they would just goof off.  However; when I returned all chores were comples.  I was pretty impressed.	That's good.  They should have been able to figure it out.  I'm glad you didn't have to do anything for them."
"i found a bunch of dead mice the other day	oh no! that's disgusting! did they have been dead for a long time?"
"it was! i felt sick seeing that	That must have made you very uneasy."
"how sweet. bless you!	I know, right? It's a lovely day."
"5	That is a good one. I have never heard it before."
"5	My Mother came into town unannounced.  She hardly ever does that.	It's nice to have her visit sometimes."
"No.  Thankfully it was just a visit.  She took us all to dinner, it was nice.	I love that. What did they order?"
"i was so furious when i found out that my best friend and girl friend had made out	That is so bad. Did they have sex?"
"I have not confronted them. I am still thinking over it.	That is so rude of them to do that. Did you confront them?"
"A big brown roach crawled across the floor in my direction last night.	That's so annoying.  Is it a male or female?"
"Yes, but this one didn't fly.  He just decided to go under the chair I was sitting in.	That is a pretty scary thing! Did you call an exterminator?"
"My bills and mortgage payment is coming up soon.  I not sure if I can cover them all.	That's the problem. You can't afford anything anymore."
"I am working hard to make sure I can cover them.  Hope fully this month of work is better than last month.	That's a good attitude to have. You're going to do great. You're going to make sure that you cover those bills. I'm sure you can do that."
"I made sure everything was set and proper before i went abroad	That's great! I bet you were a bit worried."
"5	When I got my first car I thought I'd finally be able to have a cool social life.  But I was dissapointed quickly.	Oh, that sucks. I bet. Did you not get a lot of friends for your money?"
"I spent my first night out at a Whataburger, eating alone.	Oh no! I am sorry to hear about that."
"i felt so guilty after lying to my girlfriend	That is a terrible thing to do.  How could you do such a thing?"
"I kissed a mutual friend of ours. I lied when she checked up on me. It was a one time thing, i did not wanted to hurt her.	That's no good.  What happened with her?"
"I once lied about kissing the most popular girl at my school. and my friend found out about it	That's pretty bad, I'm sure she was upset."
"I was, so very much! I avoided my friends for a whole week thenafter	That's a good thing you did, I'm sure it made your friend happy."
"My four year old daughter came up and told me she thought I needed a big hug and kiss.	That is so sweet. I am so proud of her."
"She jumped in my lap and peppered my cheek with kisses.  It was pretty cute.	Yeah, that's so sweet of her! I bet she's a sweet girl. I love that she's so affectionate."

"I have always wanted to join a college faculty.  I went to school to study philosophy for that reason.	Oh wow. I think you should do that. You have a very interesting perspective."
"Unfortunately not.  In the end I ran out of money and had to leave that dream behind.	That is too bad. Did you go back to school later?"
"I feel so sad this time of the year. My dad passed away this time last year	I'm so sorry, I know how much you must be missing him."

"It is ok.. She passed away few months ago	My son and I went to the track yesterday to run.	That is fun! I bet you were really fast."
"No, but he did end up puking all over the parking lot afterwards.	That is gross.  I hate when my dogs go potty on the carpet."
"That is really cool. i bet it felt nice watching those	That's great. I have never watched anything like that before."
"I envy people who can dance really well	I agree.  I am not good at dancing.  I am more of a singer."
"I was stunned with fear to find a rattlesnake right where i was about to step into last week	That's terrifying! Did you run away?"
"I stood there speechless for a moment, turned back and ran for my life!	That is crazy. Did you get bitten?"
"Needing some extra money, I used the spare change in my car to buy a scratch off ticket.	Oh, you got lucky!"
"It was Blackjack.  I didn't win anything though.	It's fun to dream about winning."
"I once ate a piece of cake, it was old.  After the first bite I noticed spots of mold on it.	Oh no.  What did you do?"
"No I spit it out and listerined my mouth.	I would have spat it out and thrown the cake out. I would have never eaten it. I would have never eaten it if I saw that spot."

"thank you. I'm sure it will get easier with time. It was just so tragic, he was so young	I know, he was. I hope it will get better."
"I am so angry to see so much fake news floating around in the media	That's terrible.  I don't know if I would trust the news anymore if I had my choice.  It's all just a bunch of fake information."
"Very true! Why does news have to be so hyped up?	I agree with you, I think it's so hard to find good information out there"
"My little girl loves to wake up at night and ask for chocolate milk.	It's nice that she is so excited to see you. It's good to have a good relationship."
"I have an 18 year old doing the same.  What my 4 year old doesn't know is I giver her the sugar free version.	That is sweet of you to do that. I would probably do the same thing with my kids if they were older."
"I lost a good job a few years back	That's too bad. What did you do to lose it?"
"The company got bought by someone else and we all got laid off.  Lost my family home and all.  But things are slowly improving.	That's really bad. I'm sorry you went through that. I hope you're doing better now."
"So i used to shop in walmart and i thought it was the cheapest place to shop at but yesterday i went grocery shopping at aldi's and i was so surprised to see how much cheaper it is to shop there	Oh wow! I would have thought that!  I love shopping at Walmart!"

"My friends are saying my girlfriend is cheating behind my back, but i trust her	That can be a problem.  How did you know?  Was she telling you anything about it?"
"May be. But i have known her all my life, she would die before going behind my back	That sounds like a lot of pressure."
"I have a lot of stuff coming up due this month.  I also have a lot of purchasing goals as well.  I am confident I will be able to meet all of them.	That is great, what are your goals?"
"That's the plan, I've signed up for a bunch of double shifts.  Fingers crossed.	That sounds like a lot of work, but if you have to, it's better than not. What's your plan for how you're going to get through all of it?"

"I was really close to running away, but i somehow managed to pull it off	That's awesome! I bet they were impressed!"
"my friend bought a big house and i'm happy for her but at the same time i'm a little bit jealous	Oh no, you're feeling jealous? Why is that? Did she buy a house for you?"
"true, but there is so much space for her kid to run and play at and I live in a tiny apartment with my son	I am sure you can have your son run around."
"I was so mad when i found out my cousin asked out my girlfriend once	That's so rude. What did you do?"
"Sort of, yes. He did it anyways. I yelled at him.	That's pretty gross. Did she say no?"
"I feel happy when I am outside in nature	That is a great feeling! What is your favorite place in nature?"
"I love to garden. Organic gardening, I plant peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and a bunch of other goodies.	That is great. I like to garden as well."
"Just get outside and started playing / digging  in the dirt, You will soon catch on to what works for you.	i was so in awe when i saw hamilton	I know right? I loved it! What was the reason why you were so in awe?"
"It was really awesome dude, the full show covers it all up	i love musicals, have you ever been to a musical show?"

"It really bothers me when people come into where we live at night and ride their dirt bikes	That's not a good thing."
"There is many paths leading to faith	I agree.  It's like they think they are above the law or something.  I would be more concerned about the kids that are around them."
"It takes a path to find ones faith	Are you a parent.	I am a parent."
"When you become one, you will never forget the day it happens. You'll weep of happiness.	That sounds so special.  How did you get to this stage?"

"I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating.	Oh, that is interesting, I bet you were a little jealous. Did you get over it?"
"Yes, but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly, it was more about my own insecurities than about him, you know? As I grew more into myself, the jealousy loosened its hold.	That makes sense."
"My daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us.	That must be exciting. What are they doing?"
"I prepared for weeks. I could not wait for them to get here. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen them and they have a new baby.	That is awesome!  What kind of baby are they?"
"I cosigned a loan with my son, expecting he would make the payments and he has let me down by being late every month.	I'm sorry to hear that.  How long have you been cosigning for?  I would have to talk to a financial advisor to figure out what to do."
"I've helped me create a repayment plan where I have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me. I just really feel frustrated because he has the money, but he wastes it.	That is a lot to deal with, I hope you are able to get him to pay you on his own."
"I was anticipating a great weight loss after my first week on my diet!	That sounds great!  What diet did you follow?"
"I lost 7 pounds! I am SO thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long.	It's great that you are following your diet."
"I have felt some of the best moments of pure happiness seeing someone I love getting something they've worked hard for -- like my daughter's acceptance into her college and major of choice!	Oh that's so cool, I had my son accepted into college this year and he's a computer science major."
"Absolutely! Of course, now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah, so happy for her!	That's great! I'm glad to hear it."
"I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were.	That is terrible. Who was it?"
"Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own ""vision"" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know?	Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.  It's hard to accept when you were so close to them."
"I've definitely worked through that! Happily, it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)	I recently met up with a friend I had not seen in a while. I want to see him again soon and I think I will!	That is great! How long did you last together?"
"I agree. We went to high school and middle school together.	Oh that is nice! I love seeing old friends."
"In college I studied very hard for an upcoming exam that I was very interested in getting a very high score. I was confident that I did so.	That's awesome! Did you get the high score?"
"I was very excited with my result. I am very competitive. Sometimes I wish I were not so competitive.	That is great that you worked so hard. You should be very proud of yourself."
"You are completely right. It is very important to not lose sight of what is important in life.	A have a friend that is going to be visiting me this week! I cannot wait!	Oh that sounds like fun!  What is your friend going to be doing?"
"She was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south.	I am sure you guys have a great time together."
"I am currently dealing with epilepsy unfortunately, and the doctors have not found a treatment yet.	That's awful, I'm so sorry."
"Thanks. I have to go to a Monitoring Unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location. Not going to be fun.	Oh no, I hope they can find a treatment!"
"Thanks again. I have lots of support so I am fortunate	I've felt so incredibly sad whenever we've had to say goodbye to any of our dogs.	That is so sad, I'm sorry. I love my dog so much, I don't want to say goodbye!"
"I know -- I needed to just come out and say ""when we had to put them down"". Always age or illness related -- but man, SO tough.	I'm so sorry. That must be so painful to go through. I know I will go through the same thing. It's hard to say good bye."
"My friend has been on the couch for a few weeks. He is getting under my skin now.	I hate when people get lazy."
"No, he is a friend that recently got fired and needs some help.	That sucks, but I hope he gets back to his old ways."
"I have been trying to lose weight in a group and while i made it to 4 lbs, my friends made it to 15. :(	Oh, that's sad. I hope they all do well."
"i guess they worked harder but	That is not fair! You are a better person and you should not be ashamed of your body."
"I went on a road trip with some friends. We had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping, too!	I bet you had some great times."
"Yes, sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more.	It sounds like you guys had a lot of fun. I'm sure you're all friends."
"We paid 600$ for a cruise, but they canceled it with not refunds one week before. so mad	That's terrible! Did you have any money left?"
"we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company, so they dont know what they're in for	That sucks, what are they doing?"
"I had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago. I wonder if I will see her again any time soon.	It's good to have some friends. What happened?"
"We went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends.	That sounds like a lot of fun!  What happened after that?"
"I live alone. Sometimes it can be hard with nobody around.	I know, sometimes you need someone to talk to. But it can be hard when you're alone all the time."
"I think that's a great idea. I will try to go out this weekend.	That is great! I live alone too and I love it!"
"I saw a huge spider in my car yesterday. I scared me so!	That sounds so scary. I would have to go back and kill it!"
"I stopped the car and got out and ushered it out of the car.	Oh wow!  I bet you were so scared to get out of the car!"
"I hope that this summer I can go to Florida with my family	That's awesome. I've never been to Florida."
"Summer is not over until Labor Day! We still have the whole month of August!!	That's the best time to get a good vacation, I hope it goes well for you."
"Summer can be over in July for teachers sometimes. Are you a teacher?	My roommate eats my food sometimes. This makes me so angry!	Oh that is so annoying.  Do you try to talk to them about it?"
"I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.	I know, right. It makes me mad."
"I recently lost my sister to breast cancer. She was very young and has left three little girls. I have been devastated.	That must have been so hard on you."
"My parents health has deteriorated rapidly, and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.	That's so sad. I hope she is okay and that you are able to get some counseling soon."
"It's why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own.	I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can't always get what you want.	I know right. I feel like I'm always trying to get what I want, but sometimes I just have to accept that I won't get it."
"Life is not fair, but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with	That is true, but I think we all have to accept what is in our control. I don't think it is fair for the other person to be rejected. I hope they will come around."
"I'm a little anxious about an upcoming move. It's to a *very* different state with a *very* different climate and way of life!	That is scary.  I am sorry.  Are you moving to work or to school?"
"We've been great with change, including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot, and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man, those looooong winters!	I am excited to move! I love the cold."
"Ha! Not likely in the city....but hey...who knows! I WILL use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski.	That sounds amazing!  Are you a beginner?"
"The economy has been doing well. The future looks bright.	I agree!  I have a lot of savings and a nice house."
"Hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations.	That's good to hear."
"My sister unfortunately will not seek help for her alcohol problems, and she will not even admit to them. I am extremely sad apprehensive about what might happen to her.	Yeah, that's terrible, but it's not your problem, and you're not the one who is going to get her help."
"I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention, but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.	It's so heartbreaking that she's not seeking help.  I'm sure it's hard to deal with when someone you care about is struggling.  Maybe you could talk to her about how you feel and try to see things from her perspective.  But if that doesn't work, maybe you should start making plans for her, like getting her into a rehab or whatever.  Maybe that could be the best thing to do."
"It was still so unexpected when my husband and I -- who were open to getting pregnant -- found out that we actually were!	Oh wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you both ready?"
"Oh, that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day, Halloween, visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.	That's awesome."
"The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful, in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!	It's great to hear that you remember that experience so well. I've never been able to visit Chicago."
"The horror film I saw last night can cause nightmares. It was so scary!	I'm so glad you didn't have a nightmare!"
"I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.	I have been there. I was so scared."
"My daughter was accepted into Harvard. She starts in the fall.	I'm so proud of her!  That's a great school.  Congratulations!"
"She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!	That is amazing! I am so happy for you and her."
"My friend purchased a new car. The ride is sweet!	Oh wow! What did he buy?"
"They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.	oh nice. I've been wanting to buy one of those myself."
"I graduated college recently. I'm so glad!	That's so exciting! Congratulations!"
"I majored in environmental engineering!	I love that major. I'm not really sure what I want to study but I'm sure I'll figure it out."
"I cheated on my girlfriend recently. I feel horrible about myself right now.	It's not good.  What did you do?"
"I plan on coming clean at some point, but I'm not sure how to break the news.	I would have to say that you need to be honest with her. It's hard to keep lying, and you don't want to be in a situation like this."
"I can not wait until some of my family come in to town. They will be coming in to town in two weeks.	I have a family coming in to town too."
"I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.	It sounds like a lot of excitement and anticipation!"
"I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.	That's cool. What was your major?"
"Yes, I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.	That's great that you still stay in touch with them."
"I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!	That's awesome! Horror movies are so much fun!"
"A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.	It's always scary when watching horror movies! I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. Do you watch them often?"
"I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary	That sounds so nice! What place?"
"Yes, it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.	I am happy for you.  How long have you been together?"
"I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.	I am so sorry to hear that. I know how you must be feeling.  I have had my dogs pass away too. I am sure it was very painful. I hope you are doing okay."
"Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much	That's terrible. I'm sorry."
"I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.	It's not that hard to do in the US."
"We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.	I agree with you. I was shocked that he was elected. I am not sure how he was able to get that many votes."
"Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!	I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully they can still have fun together without you."
"Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.	Yeah, it's not healing at all. I'm not even thinking about it anymore. I'm going to the doctor and they will figure it out."
"Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions	That is a great place, what did you guys do?"
"No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance	That sounds like fun! I love going to the South!"
"I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight.	That is terrible. Did you get the project back?"
"Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad!	Oh no. What happened to your teammate?"
"I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.	Oh my goodness, that's scary! I hate those bugs!"
"I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.	It can be very annoying. I've never had any in my yard."
"Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing.	That was so scary.  I am so sorry.  Did you get the packet?"
"It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!	Oh man, that's scary! I hope that's not a possibility."
"Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.	I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times	I bet you were nostalgic!"
"A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse	It must have been a great feeling.  Did you have a lot of horses there?"
"Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work.	The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.	That's pretty handy! I always keep a spare tire and tools in my car."
"I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.	Oh wow.  You have some experience.  I had my first flat last year and it was a real bummer.  I ended up having to call for a replacement.  I had to wait 2 weeks to get the new tires.  But it was a great experience.  I've gotten so used to it now."
"One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.	I can't imagine doing that! Did you do it?"
"Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.	That was scary. I'm sorry you got hurt."
"My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!	I'm so jealous! What is it like there?"
"I am, but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here, bored stupid! I know, I'm being selfish.	That's too bad, it's good you have good friends to talk to."
"I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.	I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!	Oh wow! I love moving! What's the move to?"
"Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!	That's awesome!  What's the move to the new place for?"
"I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate	That is great!  Do you meditate daily?"
"No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy.	That's awesome, I've always been a bit of a meditating nerd.  What's the best part of meditating?"
"My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis	Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.	I hate it when that happens!  Did you call the police?"
"Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.	That sounds scary. I'm glad it turned out okay."
"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	Oh, that's terrible. What did you do to try to get back on their good side?"
"Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.	That sucks. I'm sorry. Did it happen to you before?"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.	That's terrible. Do you have any tips on how to prepare?"
"Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.	That sucks. I hate presentations too. But it is good that you are prepared for it."
"I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!	That is very nice of him"
"Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.	It's nice that there are people like that around here."
"Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!	That is a great way to describe it! I'm glad you have such a good time here!"
"I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.	I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.	Oh wow. I hope you got some antihist to help you out."
"Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck	I'm sorry to hear that. I would have done the same thing next time."
"Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!	So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.	That's terrible! I hope he wasn't too upset."
"Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.	Oh wow, I would be very embarrassed!"
"I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.	I can relate to that. I remember being a kid when I was young and my parents would take me to the zoo. I loved that place."
"Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha	That's a good thing, I think."
"I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.	I love that! What do you do?"
"I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.	Yeah, that is great that you have the opportunity to work in that way."
"I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.	Yeah I have had some of that in the past."
"I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!	It's a shame when people don't make the time to call and visit friends, but sometimes life just goes on and things just get busy. I hope he'll get back on the phone and make it right."
"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	I know, I feel the same way! I was hoping he would be a little more considerate. I think I'll just keep him to myself."
"Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!	I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.	That's pretty cool.  Did you end up winning?"
"She won $5,000 and never offered to share.	That is a nice prize, did she use it to buy something she really needed?"
"I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.	I love it when people can solve complex math problems"
"I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.	That's cool. Did you get the job?"
"I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.	I bet you are excited about that"
"Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on	I love when you can just clean the dirt out and get on with the day.  How long have you lived there?"
"I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!	That is creepy. Did they attack you?"
"Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.	I am sorry to be the one to tell you but it was a woman!"
"Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!	My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	Yeah, that's really cool.  How old is she?"
"Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?	That's so cool!"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.	That is bad. What happened?"
"There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.	I'm sorry to hear that!"
"Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!	That can be frustrating.  Are you a truck driver?"
"Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe	It's always a bit of a worry."
"I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.	I hope you do well in it."
"I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?	It depends, but I'm happy for me. I don't think anyone else should go to school for electrical engineering."
"I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.	That's crazy! I bet it was pretty terrifying."
"Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!	That is terrible.  What happened?"
"I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.	I agree. He was a very unique individual."
"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	I agree, he was a good guy. I hope he was able to find some peace in heaven."
"It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.	My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.	That's really sweet of your supervisor. Did anything interesting happen?"
"I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.	That's good to hear. What was the supervisor looking for?"
"I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!	That is exciting. What amusement park is it?"
"I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?	I love amusement parks! I have been to a few and have always enjoyed them!"
"I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.	That's really smart of you!"
"That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.	That is good."
"We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.	It's always nice to get to spend the holiday with loved ones!"
"Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.	Yeah I love that.  I always think about Santa.  I was so excited for my sister to come home."
"I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.	That's terrible. Did you get it fixed?"
"That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!	I know, I feel so sorry to the dog. I would never have let her get away with it."
"I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.	I agree. I used to love watching TV but now I watch it for a long time. I don't know why!"
"Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.	I know what you mean. I have been crying for hours after seeing some sad show. I just want to go home and be happy again"
"Nah, I don't get to to bad.	I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!	Oh that sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa?	That's a great place to go!  I have never been.  I've never been there."
"Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.	I agree!  They are just too young to understand.  I remember when my kids were young and I used to tell them that I was going to the bathroom and they didn't even care.  I thought they were just curious!  But I would tell them again because it's good for them to learn about the world and to not take everything for granted.  I used to tell them to pick up after themselves, too, and I didn't want them to make a mess on"
"This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.	That is pretty gross. I would be sick to my stomach if I had dropped a candy bar and then eaten it."
"Not even a little.	I would have eaten it too!"
"I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.	That is really nice of them."
"Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems	Oh that's so sweet of them, I hope they get better"
"I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house	Yeah, that's terrible.  Did you have insurance?"
"It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.	oh no!  that's terrible.  are you okay?"
"Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.	I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.	That sounds like fun! I bet you enjoyed it.  What were the plans for the day?"
"Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.	That must have made you happy."
"I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.	That's great! I bet you're going to have a blast! What's the best family vacation?"
"No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?	Oh, I understand. I have a few family members who are not as close to me as others, but I do try to make sure they know they're important to me."
"I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.	I'm so jealous. I wish I could dance."
"She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.	That sounds like fun! I've never been to a dance recital before."
"You know you could still do it. I know you can.	That is so awesome.  What did she do to stand out?"
"My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.	That is nice of him!  What did you guys do together?"
"He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!	It's always nice to have help when you need it most."
"You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.	That is great.  Are you going to the interview?"
"It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.	I am glad I could help you out"
"I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.	That is gross! Did you wash it?"
"Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.	I hate when that happens, I always make sure to check every single thing before putting it out!"
"Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.	Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.	That is awesome! I would love going to see it."
"It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.	I love the quirky things. I have to admit that some things I don't really know about."
"I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her.	I love going to those stores too. They're always so fun to browse."
"I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!	That is really cool.  Did you move for work?"
"It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!	That must have been nice.  I would love to travel and meet new people."
"Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!	That's so cool! I love moving around a bit! What city are you in?"
"I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.	It is always better to be safe than sorry, but it is nice to have a great family that takes care of you"
"Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.	It's always nice to have a family that takes care of you when you need it the most"
"I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.	That is so true, some people have no concept of right and wrong."
"We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!	I agree. I think it's a shame."
"Me too! <fist bump> ;-)	So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.	That's so unfair. What do you think you're supposed to do?"
"He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.	I can't believe that. How long has he been dating?"
"I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.	Oh no.  How did you get cut off in traffic?"
"I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?	I feel you, I was in a hurry and didn't even even look at the guy who cut me off."
"You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.	That is so sad.  I am so sorry.  What happened to your sister?"
"She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that they lost their child. That must be very hard for them."
"I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.	I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.	I hope you get the job you are looking for!"
"Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too.	It can be really tough to be in a job market like this, where there is no job market to go to. I hope things turn around soon for you."
"One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.	That's awesome! How old is she?"
"She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year.	Oh that's great, I bet you are excited for her! I am sure she will do great."
"June and July are very busy, June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.	That is a lot! What is the company for?"
"So much for relaxing during the summer?	I'm sorry to hear that, but you have to get ready. You can't let the busyness of summer keep you from enjoying the sunshine."
"Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.	That's awesome. I've never done it, but I would be a lot more likely to try it."
"It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.	That is so awesome! I've always been interested in it.  I would love to go one day!"
"You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.	That's true. It's good for mental well-being."
"I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food	That's awesome. I'm a vegan myself. What are some of your favorite vegan foods?"
"I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all	That's great. Do you eat plant-based every day?"
"I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.	I know how that goes.  Do you take them regularly?  Do you find they help at all?"
"oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great	When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.	That is a very selfless thing you did."
"I was and she was had a full recovery.	That is so nice.  I am so happy that she is healthy again."
"Me neither, my mom means so much to me.	That's really cool. I bet you feel really lucky to have such a good mom!"
"Do you get to see your mom often?	Yeah, but it is hard when she is sick."
"I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!	I have a Dodge Charger, it's a beast!"
"It was blue with white racing stripes.	That is an amazing car."
"Same here, they are pretty expensive.	My dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day. Now I have to throw them out.	Yeah that would be so annoying."
"This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.	That's terrible! I hope she doesn't chew up any of my other shoes. She has a bad habit of chewing up anything she can."
"My wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner.	That is so nice of her! What did she make for you?"
"She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert.	oh that's awesome. what did you do for birthday?"
"Thank you! What is your favorite meal?	Yeah, my favorite meal is a good burger and fries!"
"Me too, do you have a favorite flavor?	My long term boyfriend and I broke up recently. I'm so lost right now.	I'm so sorry to hear that.  How long were you together?"
"I know, it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together.	That sucks. Did he cheat?"
"My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry.	Oh wow! I love when people show you love and care for!"
"He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.	I love pot roast!"
"I got a promotion in work. I am so excited for the raise and added responsibility.	I'm so happy for you! Congratulations!"
"Thank you, I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.	That's awesome! Congrats on the promotion and the raise."
"I work in the military	My daughter can say so many new words, love to see her thrive!	Oh wow! I am so happy for you.  What words has she learned lately?"
"Yes, thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?	It is indeed. I have two kids and a wife."
"I've got all of my bags packed, passport ready, and i'm not even leaving for vacation until next week.	I love when people are so prepared for their trip."
"I'm going to Japan. I'm so excited, I've never been.	That sounds amazing. I've always wanted to visit Japan."
"So my parents took me out to dinner for my birthday tonight.	That is so nice of them. What did you order?"
"Thanks! I had an awesome time. I went to a sushi place and it was delicious.	Yeah, I love sushi.  I had a good time.  How about you?"
"I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had, haha.	That's awesome!  I'm a sushi guy myself.  What kind was it?"
"So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!	That is so nice! What park?"
"It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?	It's so nice to go for a ride and get some exercise. I'm a bit worried about the heat though, I'm going to try to go for a walk tomorrow."
"It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.	I can imagine! It's great you have a house to yourself."
"That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!	I am sorry to hear that. I am glad you have family close to you.  How long are your husband away from home?  I am in the military too and it is hard to be away. I hope your husband is home soon and you can spend a lot of time together.  I am in the military too.  It is so hard when you are so far apart.  I am sure it is not the same in Alaska as it is in other states. It's"
"Whenever we moved abroad, I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.	That's really cool! What made you move?"
"Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.	That makes sense. I'm glad you have a good sense of adventure. I've always wanted to go to Japan. Have you ever gone there?"
"Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive! We've lived in Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Zurich -- Alaska may be next. (And Italy is awesome, by the way!)	It's my brother's 16th birthday in a couple days and he's probably getting a nicer car than I currently have. I'm 24.	That sounds nice. What kind of car?"
"I certainly am! Of course, I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.	I'm happy for your brother.  I've never been able to afford a car."
"So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore. Score!	I can't wait for my kids to be older. I'm 40 now and they are 8 and 10."
"Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?	That's awesome, I have a 15 year old brother. I'm going to have to start driving him around again!"
"I saw somebody I hadn't in years. It was a nice meeting.	I am sure it was nice to see them. What did they do?"
"Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.	That sounds like a great reunion! What did you two talk about?"
"I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!	Yeah, I miss the place where I grew up, and the people I grew up with, but it's a good experience to have."
"Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?	You have to go visit me!"
"I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman.	That is pretty rude."
"I respectfully told her I was not interested, I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.	It's good to be committed to someone."
"I recently attended a play. My friend's acting was significant!	That's so cool! What type of play was it?"
"I am very glad that I went and supported him.	Oh, wow, I hope it was a great play! Did you enjoy it?"
"Sometimes when I'm driving home after a holiday, such as christmas, I get an overwhelming sense of being alone.	I know the feeling! Sometimes it's nice to be home with your family"
"No I haven't, but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!	It's good to be alone sometimes."
"So I recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe I found and it turned out great!	That sounds like a great recipe!"
"Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.	Yeah, I love buffalo wing sauce."
"I recently completed some additional training at my job. Perhaps a promotion is on its' way?	I am jealous of you"
"Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.	That's awesome! I'm always looking for opportunities to advance. I'm a big believer in hard work being rewarded."
"I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!	It is exciting to hear, but also a lot of stress and worry."
"I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.	That sounds like a good plan.  I hope it all works out for you!"
"So last night I was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone.	I bet that was scary! What kind of videos were they?"
"Yes, I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?	I can, I think it's just a feeling of curiosity or boredom. But I think sometimes curiosity is just a way of trying to escape boredom or boredom of boredom!"
"I'm ready for football season to start, NFL preseason started this week, and I can't wait for regular season and I'm really looking forward to the NCAA kickoff!	Oh, nice! Are you a football fan?"
"In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama	I am a Packers fan too. I am so ready!"
"I visited the BMX park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike, it was insane!	It is so cool!"
"I agree, years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV	I have never been to a BMX park but I have seen videos of them."
"My car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop. I think I'm going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks.	Oh no! That's terrible! Did your friend have to go out of his way to pick you up?"
"It was just the carburetor, which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.	I'm glad it was just a simple fix. I would've been stranded."
"I was so set on getting an A on my math test that I studied so hard to do good on it. I studied for days!	That sounds like you put in some effort."
"I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.	Oh that is cool. I hope you got the A you wanted."
"My friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago, I'm still in shock.	That sucks. I'm sorry.  I know it can be really tough.  Did you talk about it with him?"
"They've been really closed up about the whole thing, I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time, I could not imagine.	It is very hard to deal with, but I'm trying to be strong."
"I realized yesterday I was pregnant, I was in shock!	That's so exciting! Congratulations!"
"I am still in awe, I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.	Oh wow. That is amazing. Congratulations!"
"When the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area, I was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood.	Oh that is so bad, I am so sorry!"
"I had an emergency generator, extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.	Oh, you were prepared! That's a good thing. I bet the rain didn't flood as badly as you thought it would"
"I stole a candy and drink from the gas station once, I felt terrible about the whole ordeal.	It is always better to tell the manager or just leave. I would never steal."
"I was 17, at that age I should of known better.	That's good that you didn't get caught."
"My friend has had the flu, and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.	I hope they get better."
"Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well, just whiny.	It's good that you're taking care of him, that's the kind of friend he should be grateful to have."
"I managed to get on the A honor roll at my school, I was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing.	That's awesome! You must be very proud of yourself!"
"I'm just happy that I got it, it took a lot of hard work.	I'm glad you got on the honor roll. That's a big accomplishment. What's the secret to getting on the honor roll?"
"The last time I hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie.	Yeah, that's a great way to break up with friends."
"Yeah, it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it, making fun of the movie while it was on.	I have never heard of that movie. I'm curious about it."
"I remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview.  I was sweating and couldn't stop my leg from shaking.	That is funny.  What did you end up getting the job for?"
"The interview went well and I ended up getting the job, so I guess I worried for nothing :)	Oh, that's awesome! Congratulations! What kind of job did you get?"
"The other day I had to take my dogs out before work, but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so I couldn't get out.	That's horrible. What kind of dog?"
"She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work, but not this time.	Oh my, I hope you didn't have to go to work! I would hate to have something happen like that. Did you have to wait until they went out for a while before you went in and took them out?"
"I was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and I fell to the floor. Everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor. My face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up.	I would have been a bit upset about it as well"
"Now I can laugh, but when I was on the floor I was not laughing, I just wanted to leave.	Oh wow that is so embarrassing! I would be so ashamed"
"My son is 16 months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork. I've been trying to teach him for a couple of months!	That's a pretty accomplishment!  How long has it been?"
"He is still very messy but he really enjoys eating like a big boy	That's great! I bet you feel proud of him!"
"When my wife and I started dating, our second date ended up lasting like 12 hours.	That is too long! Did you guys get along well?"
"Lunch, a zoo, my apartment for a while, and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P	Yeah, that's not uncommon.  I'm sure she was happy with that."
"Years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure.  I found him in the kitchen in the morning, he did not go easily :(	I'm sorry about that. I've lost my own dog to cancer. It was really sad. I wish I had a pet right now."
"Yeah, he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.	It sounds like he was a good dog.  I hope he didn't go that quickly."
"I remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail	I remember that. I worked my butt out for my first week. I was so excited."
"Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one	Yeah that is what made me so nervous"
"I realized that my bus that I ride to work in every day is a revamped school bus	That's so cool.  What did they do to it?"
"Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is!	That's good. What kind of bus is that?"
"I broke up with my girlfriend last week and it was really hard	That's awful. I'm sorry."
"Yeah we where together for about 2 years but im getting over it now	I understand.  It can be tough when things end.  But you will get through it, and you will be better off for it."
"I was out at dinner with my family, and when coming back to the table from the bathroom I somehow accidentally sat down with a different family.	I'm sure it was a bit of a shock! Did anyone notice?"
"Yeah, it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P	That's funny, I've had that happen before, it's always good to laugh at yourself"
"We are getting our son to go back to college in a few days and it really made me stop and think back to him when he was smaller, and how time flies by so fast!	Oh wow, how old is he now?"
"I know, that's about how I felt too! I think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!	I love kids! I'm so excited for your son's college adventure."
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped and fell. There were so many people around that saw me hit the ground. You can imagine how I felt!	That's terrible! What happened?"
"I scuffed my knees a bit, but I was okay. I was also with a person that I really liked, so that made it even worse. But, I jumped up super quick lol	Yeah I know that feeling, it's like your body just goes, ""No, no, no!"""
"i stold some spare change from my parents	That would be a terrible thing to do."
"maybe like 19, but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner	I bet you were glad to be able to share with them."
"Yeah i told them as well	My sister passed away several years ago. I really had a hard time with the grief and couldn't really relate to anyone that tried to help me with it.	I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.  What did happen?"
"Yes, I'm sure you can relate as well. Ironically, that was the same age that my sister passed away. She took her own life, which my mother and I found her, and it was very hard for us all. But, I couldn't burden my parents with my pain, I felt.	I understand how hard it must have been. I lost a sibling myself, and it's not easy to talk about. I hope that it helps you to remember the good times and not get too caught up in the pain."
"Having a good job is something to thank	That's true, but you know what's even better? Having a good job and a good family!"
"to life God to that higher energy	I know right! I feel like I've been working hard for my life."
"Nobody ... that's why I'm grateful	That is nice. What do you do to keep yourself energized?"
"I'm an administrative assistant for a construction company	That's a great job. You are very grateful."
"I was devastated when I lost my phone	I have never lost my phone"
"I did but it took a while	That must have been frustrating, did you get a new phone?"
"I was surprised when my family threw me a surprise party	That's so sweet of them, what made it so unexpected"
"I turned 34	I'm sorry, but you are 34, not 34"
"i didn't see my parents since 2014! I miss them so much. it's so sad that i live in a different country	I feel that, I have a very hard time connecting with people from other countries, and it makes me feel like I am living in a bubble"
"actually in 2 weeks! I'm so excited about it. I'm going there with my son! They've never met him	I bet.  That is really cool.  What are you and your son going there for?"
"I was annoyed when my favorite show wasn't on	Oh no, what show is it?"
"I ended up watching Impractical Jokers	That is a fun show, I have seen it on my TV a few times"
"I love when I need to show someone how to do something and everything goes off without a hitch.	Oh yeah. That is very helpful to have that in you."
"Fortunately it's usually just not having the best answer for what they ask. I've learned and prepared a lot more this time.	I have been there before. I was trying to help a friend and I had to explain something to them, and they didn't understand it at all!"
"I tend to know a thing or two on occasion.	I am taking a long overdue and much needed vacation this week. I wish i didnt have to fly.	That is nice. I wish I had that time to myself."
"I usually do pretty good on short flights. Longer ones make me a little nervous.	I understand. I have never flown before."
"I hate turbulence too.	I didnt think to invite my sister to a party I recently helped put on.	That's not very consider of of you"
"No she wasnt. In all fairness it was a group of people I never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with.	Oh no, I am sorry to hear that."
"you are right. Guess I know better for next time.	My sunday was great. All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.	Oh that's great! What did you do on Sunday?"
"I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.	I am sorry, but you can't be happy all the time. You will have to deal with some stress and frustration."
"ouch! I would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way.	That's a lot of weeds! I'm sorry that it happens."
"My husband has to travel a lot for work. It can be hard on a marriage, but after almost 23 years of marriage, I have faith he is loyal and faithful when he does.	That must be tough. I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm sure it will get better."
"He is an iron worker, so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings.	I can imagine that would be stressful for you and the kids."
"I've been married almost 23 years, but many years ago, my husband was acting a bit too ""chivalrous"" to a female acquaintance of ours. He said he was only being nice, but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice', which made me feel a bit upset.	That is so bad! Did it end up being a problem or was it not a major issue?"
"Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.	That's terrible."
"My niece is super talented lately.	That is awesome. I bet she's very proud of herself."
"Art, she was accepted into a special program for high school.	That's awesome. She must be pretty talented."
"Mostly drawing. And she's in advanced level classes in most subjects.	One day my 10 year old daughter came home crying after she got off the bus. A teenage boy purposely tripped her as she was getting off and she got hurt. Needless to say, I was very, very upset!	That must have hurt.  Did he get in trouble?"
"I actually knew his father, so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.	I would have told him that if he didn't teach her to stay out of his business, she would be in trouble."
"I really dont like my husbands job right now.	That's too bad. What do you do?"
"Retail, but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks	Yeah, I don't know if it is worth it."
"We are hoping with in a few months.	Each year my husband usually gets a bonus this month or next. It's not promised, but it has happened for several years now. I am really wishing it will be this year too!	That sounds great! I'm a bit jealous. What does he do for a job?"
"Well, we have college tuition, just got back from an expensive beach vacation, etc. So, if anything replenish some savings, right!	It's great that you are looking forward to it. I hope it will happen this time! I'm a little nervous though because I don't know if my husband will be able to do anything this time around. I've been looking for months. Maybe I should just start saving my money for college instead. That's a good idea though!"
"I hate watching movies that are full of gore! I just saw one today and so gross!	That can be so disturbing. What did the movie have to do?"
"Yes, I was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off. yuck!	I agree, I just don't like watching that type of content, but at least it is a movie, right?"
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	That is so frustrating.  I hope it works out for him!"
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	That is very exciting and scary at the same time"
"He is a welder and iron worker, so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel. He has earned it!	I've been married a long time, but my husband is gone quite a bit for work. I feel a bit by myself at times because of this :(	That is very tough. It's like having a best friend who is no longer around."
"Luckily, my children still live at home, but it's not quite the same. Plus, it won't be too long before they are ready to move out	I can relate, it's not the same, but it's good to have them around."
"My youngest child started high school this year. It really made me think back to her starting kindergarten, and how time really goes by. I can just see her learning to read!	It's amazing how fast kids grow."
"Yes, it really is bittersweet. But, the older they get, the easier it is to think back to the younger days!	Oh wow. You have a lot of experience now. I have only just started. I think I have to be happy that I'm not the one starting kindergarten. I'm so excited to see my kids go off into their own little worlds."
"I was so scared when i heard a gunshot sound while i was walking through the streets the other day	I'm glad you made it!"
"No, i felt it would be better if i dont go looking for it. i managed to get the hell out of there	Yeah, you should always stay away from places where gunsshots can happen."
"I feel so sad whenever thoughts about my dad come to me, he passed away last year	I'm sorry for your loss.  How did he die?"
"He had terminal stage brain cancer.. we did all we could, but..	I am so sorry to hear that. I hope he was at peace."
"i felt really good about myself when i got a new job at a reputed firm	I am glad you are happy.  What did you do for the new job?  Did you get a promotion?"
"i was so angry when i found out my girlfriend kissed a friend of mine	That's so rude!"
"i have not confronted them. still thinking about it	That is terrible.  Why did you do that?"
"I went to the beach last week	I love the beach! Did you have fun?"
"yeah. so much memories of me and family spending time in beach came to me	I love beach trips too.  What did you do?"
"I was so furious when i found out a coworker badmouthed me to my boss	That is terrible. What did you do to deal with that situation?"
"Yeah. i outperform this person, and he started throwing shade on me out of pure jealousy	That's terrible! How long have you worked with your coworker?"
"I went to see Hamilton last month in NYC	I've heard a lot of good things about it!"
"It was such a stunning show. Lin manuel should get a grammy for this	I'm not familiar with that, but I've heard great things! I'll definitely look up his work!"
"I was so ashamed when i threw up in public the other day	Oh my god. Did anyone know?"
"Yeah, i felt like i was coming down with something. i rushed to get a cab, but i couldn't help it	oh no.  what kind of thing did you throw up?"
"My girlfriend asked me to meet her parents next week	Wow. What happened?"
"I am not sure to be honest. i am feeling so nervous about it	That must be a bit nerve racking, especially if you are not used to meeting new parents."
"i felt betrayed when my girlfriend kissed another guy at a party	That's not cool. What did she do?"
"Nothing. She was drunk, so i let it go. I still feel disappointed	That is a tough situation to deal with. Did she say anything to you about how she felt?"
"I was really upset when my daughter went into labor and I couldn't be there.	That is terrible. What did happen to her?"
"She lives in another state and wasn't due for several more months. Everyone is fine now though, so it has turned out to be very joyous.	Oh wow, that's nice. I've had to be there for my own."
"I was in total shock the night my fiance proposed to me at a concert.	That is awesome! Congratulations on the proposal!  What made it so shocky?  Was it a surprise?"
"They started playing one of our special songs and the next think I knew he was down on one knee. I said yes, of course!	That is so sweet."
"I admire my boss because he does not act like a boss. He acts more like a friend and he is so down to earth.	That sounds really nice. I wish I could be like that."
"He is not just friendly, he is a good leader and knows how to treat his workers.	I really like that about him, he seems like he really cares about his people."
"I remember when I was a kid and in the summertime I used to catch fireflies and place them in a jar by my bedside at night.	I remember that too! It was such a fun time."
"The fireflies would blink in the jar all night long.	I remember that. I used to be scared of them."
"I'm so tired this morning, I went to bed early, but it seems when I go to bed early I wake up more tired. It aggravates me!	That is frustrating. Do you get tired easily?"
"I hate it! I feel more energized when I get 4 hours of sleep than I do when I get 8!	That is terrible! I am so tired all the time!"
"I'm in contract to buy my first house, fingers crossed closing goes well and I close next Friday!	That's exciting!  Are you planning on buying a new home?"
"I'm definitely excited. The house just now got built and I saw it for the first time last Monday.	Oh, that's great! I'm glad you got to see the house. What's your first house going to be?"
"My Mother and I made plans to hang out and do lunch this past week.	I love hanging out with my mom too!  What did you guys plan on doing?"
"Unfortunately she was unable to make it because her diabetes is wreking her health.	That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that."
"I am feeling bad because my grandchild wants me to play all the time but I have to work a lot.	I know that I understand. I have a little brother too and he wants to be with his sister but he's always getting into trouble. He's 12."
"She doesn't understand why I always have so many other things to do, but she would literally play 24/7 if I had the time.	That is so sad.  You need to be able to take care of her."
"My four year old daughter came to me beaming with pride and showing me a drawing she did of me.	That is so sweet. I am so glad that you are so proud of your child."
"I was really surpised.  I expected a stick figure, but she drew a lot of features including my beard and mustache.	Yeah, she is very talented."
"I had to run some errands.  While gone I instructed my older daughters to complete some math assignments.	Oh no. Did they do well?"
"When I returned I found them playing video games, the math work was not even attempted.  I tunred their stuff off and we did it together.	I would do that to my daughters too"
"A recruiter contacted me the other day about potential job openings, so I'm hoping I may have a job soon!	That is great to hear."
"Me too. I've been dying to get out of my current job, but having a recruiter makes me feel at ease.	That's good news!  I hope you get it!"
"I found a box of old photos in my closet yesterday.	Oh, did you look through them?"
"A lot of them where photos of my sister and I when we were toddlers.  It was a good trip down memory lane.	Oh my, I love looking at old photos.  Are you looking back on your childhood or your parents' childhoods?"
"I was disgusted when my dad left me	I hate my dad. I'm sorry to hear that."
"I'm not sure. I guess he just didn't want anything to do with me.	That can be really tough. Did he have a reason?"
"I have been rehearsing for a job interview for a couple of weeks now, and I am so ready!	Oh, you're going to crush it! I've been preparing for that interview too, and I'm sure you will do great."
"I don't normally prepare for interviews, but I really want this job, so I put in a lot of practice.	That's great. I hope you get it."
"I went to the fride and was surprised to find what I thought was an ice cream cake.	That is a good one!  What was the surprise?"
"It turned out to not even be an ice cream cake.  It was some kind of pinapple cake.  I still had a piece but it was disappointing.	Oh no, I hope you were happy with the cake you got!"
"I was surprised when my wife left me	That is terrible. Did she leave you for someone else?"
"We were married for 10 years	That's terrible.  I would have been devastated if I was her."
"I was annoyed when my family missed my birthday	Oh no.  What happened?"
"Yeah that's very true. Doesn't mean we aren't important though	That's a good point.  I think it's just that sometimes we don't get a chance to do things like that.  I just hope they make up for it in the future."
"Interestingly, I also had a job interview recently, although I've already heard back and I got it!	Oh that is good! What job was it?"
"A lab manager for a Physics department at a University.	It sounds like you are doing well"
"I had a terrifying experience what using the restroom yesterday.	Oh no! Did you go outside?"
"As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise.  When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.	That sounds terrifying! Did you try to get it out?"
"When I was younger, my dad got into a motor cycle accident. It made me not want to learn how to drive for almost 2 years.	Oh no! That is terrible! I hope you are okay!"
"I did learn, but it took a long time to overcome my fear. I'm glad I eventually did!	That's so sad, what happened exactly?"
"I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience, and not altogether pleasant.	I have had some problems with them in the past.  What did the problem be?  Was it the clog or something else?  I had issues with the clog in the pipes in my house."
"Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard, but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident.	Yeah, it was a bit of an adventure. I'm glad it's over."
"In college I was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper.	I'm so sorry that you had to go through that."
"It's ok.  I'm basically over it now, but it was really angering then.	It's good that you are over it now."
"I was grateful when I married my wife	That's great!  Marriage is such a wonderful thing.  I hope you both have a wonderful life together."
"We met at a store	That's so cool! What kind of store was it?"
"When I was in college an older woman in a class of mine stole my ideas for a paper.	That is terrible.  I hate when that happens."
"Well, ranted about it to my girlfriend for a while then talked to the professor to make it clear what she did.	That is horrible. I would have been very upset about that."
"My family and I are close to aquiring a new home.	Oh that's great! I've never been able to afford a house, I'm a single parent. What kind of house are you looking for?"
"IIt is an older home in need of some repairs.  We can't wait to get started on renovations.	It sounds like you are very excited about this.  I hope your family is too.  I am sure that house will be worth a pretty penny in a few years!"
"I was excited when I bought my car	I am glad you have your car. What kind is it?"
"It was a mustang. I saved up enough money and purchased it outright	That is awesome!"
"I was fast asleep this morning when my cat pounced on me and jolted me awake.	i hate when my cat jumps on me."
"It came out of nowhere. I almost fell out of bed!	ali, thats crazy! what kind of animal is your cat?"
"I'm feeling a little down right now. The weather is perfect, but I miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset. Those were great times!	I know right? I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yeah, we would take a bottle of wine with us, watch the surfers and just kick back. Wish those days would return.	I feel you. I have been feeling down lately too. I hope things get better."
"Maybe one day. That was when I lived in Northern California - the best place on the planet, imho!	I am confident that I will win that spelling bee tomorrow	That's awesome! What are you going to spell?"
"I have. I've studied for 3 week now	Oh wow. I'm sure you will win. What is the spelling bee?"
"I've been trying lately to potty train my youngest daughter.	It is a challenging task."
"It's been a challenge.  Yesterday she got on the toilet herself though.  She said she didn't want to be a baby anymore.	It's a big step, and it's going to be hard work and patience! But she'll get it! She's a smart girl. You did great!"
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a while.  Dropping her off at the airport was really hard.	That's really hard.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Is there something you can do to get through this?"
"Yeah, we talk by text all the time and call every day.  It's still hard though, we haven't been apart longer than a couple days since we met.	I know how you feel. I've never been apart from a girl that I really cared about for a week.  It's hard to keep the connection alive.  But you'll get through this."
"I was sad when my dog died	That's really sad. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have a favorite memory with your dog?"
"Its ok. It's just been rough without him. I miss him	That's so sad. I had lost my dog last summer."
"My wife is coming home after being out of the country for 2 months.  I can't wait!	I bet! I bet.  That is so exciting!  How excited?  What will you do?"
"I am!  We've never been apart this long, so it's been tough.	Oh wow!  That's amazing.  What did you do while you were away?"
"I was afraid when I watched a horror film	That's always fun, I like to see the scary movie too."
"Some have pop ups and they are creepy	I hate that kind of movies! I don't get why people watch them."
"I'm going on vacation for the first time in several years!	That sounds great. Where are you going?"
"I'm taking a cruise to Alaska. I'm soooo excited.	I bet it's going to be a great time"
"My wife is coming back into the country at the end of the weeks after 2 months away.  I can't wait!	That's awesome! I bet it was hard to wait that long for her."
"Germany for a language course.	That's great. What language are you learning?"
"I was prepared for tonights big dinner	That is great. What did you have?"
"It's going to be at my house. We are going to have a lot of food	I love having big meals at my house too!"
"I was terrified when I watched that horror movie	That sounds so bad! What movie?"
"It was Scream	I have heard of that one, but I have never seen it. I'll have to check it out."
"I was digging through some old stuff I had and I found letters that my wife wrote me when we were still dating. They were so sweet.	That's nice. Did she still write to you?"
"Yeah! It gave me all of the feels. I read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again.	Yeah I love reading old letters."
"I managed to spook myself really bad once watching too many horror movies and being in a house alone by the woods.	I know what you mean! I have a fear of being alone in the dark too."
"Yeah.  I kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods.	I have done that too.  I was at the woods and saw some people walking.  I thought they were monsters!"
"I'm so proud of my wife	I'm proud of my wife too!  What is she doing?"
"She really is	Oh, really? I bet she is! What made you so proud of her?"
"I was angry when my son destroyed my car	I'm sure it's an expensive car."
"no not salvagable. i had to buy a new one.	That is terrible. What a pain. I would have been very angry."
"its okay. gave me an opportunity for a new adventure	I'm starting a new job next week, and while I am excited, I am also very nervous!	That can be nerve wracking. What is your new job?"
"That's true, but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous.	Oh that's good, you will be fine"
"I had to go out of town and leave my dogs with a friend, I was worried about them.	It was a bit scary but my dogs are really well cared for."
"Yeah.  They annoyed my friend some, but overall it was fine.	Oh that sounds scary. I hope everything was fine with them. Did you have a good friend that was going to take care of them?"
"My wife has been in Germany for 2 months.  I can't wait till she gets home.	Oh, I bet you miss her a whole lot?"
"It sucks, but it's best to keep busy with whatever you can.  Videogames helped a lot :P	That's a long time, how long has she been there?"
"My wife has been out of the country for 2 months.  She's coming back soon, but it's been tough without her.	That sucks, but you will be happy to have her home."
"I'm looking forward to it :)	I know the feeling. I was away from home for 2 months. It is hard to deal with it, but you will get over it."
"I'm planning on moving to a new city, but I'm starting to get cold feet.	That can be scary. What city are you moving to?"
"I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there?	That is normal.  You can't just move to a new city without being prepared for anything.  I would suggest that you go to the city and get out and get a feel for it.  You might find that you really like it, and you can't think about the negative side of it.  I hope you get out and get a feel for the city, because that's the best you can do."
"One of the things I had to do when I started my job was be in charge of moving a department.  When we were doing it, one of my coworkers bailed on me.	That is so rude. Did you have to find another person?"
"There were others, but we needed all the help we could get.	It is very frustrating when that happens. I hate when people don't help out when you're trying to get a job done!"
"Everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! That movie was so amazing, I feel like i was holding my breath the whole time	That is so true, it was a thriller movie."
"omg, you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it, it's about aliens	I love that movie! I have been to a movie show in Paris where they showed it. It was so good!"
"it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff, and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it.	i know what you're talking about.  it can be so nice to not have to work so much and have a lot more free time."
"Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice.	That is a nice thing to be able to have those friends, and it is good they are sharing it."
"I was disgusted when I noticed the food on the table	I'm sorry to hear that, did you yell at the person who was serving it?"
"It was brussel sprouts and Liver	I hate eating liver."
"I have a lab mix and he is so well behaved and listens to commands so well. I'm glad I got him as a puppy.	That is so cool. What breed is he?"
"oh yea. Basically started the day we got him. That definitely helped.	I love labrador retriever mix."
"Yes. I couldnt' handle a dog I have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff.	Yeah, dogs are really hard work."
"My friend just recently moved to California...It makes me sad because I have always wanted to live there.	That sucks. I have a friend who is a nurse in California. I've always wanted to live there but never could."
"Yeah...I really am. I've wanted to live there since I was a little girl. Someday I will!	Yeah, I've always wanted to move there too, but my parents are too old to move."
"When I was planning my wedding, the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication.	That is horrible. I'm sure you were very upset."
"Yeah, we dropped them with enough time to find someone else, but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.	I can understand that.  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to look around.  I was not prepared for the fact that I would be paying a lot of money for a caterer that was not going to do anything.  It was stressful."
"It is so frustrating having to deal with difficult customers that don't want to pay their bills/	I know right! Sometimes they are just so upset about something they think they did."
"Normally I would agree. It only seems to be a few here and there. Most of the time I dont have problems.	I hate dealing with difficult customers too."
"We are a retail outfit. So we have some big customers that pay on established terms.	I'm going overseas in 2 weeks! I will be on vacaion for 1 months and I just CAN NOT wait@	It sounds fun! I've always wanted to see the world!"
"Where did you go?	That's cool, I'm going to Japan for the first time."
"I just about had a figurative heart attack the other night.	That's crazy!  I'm sorry you had that.  What happened?"
"I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door.	That's creepy. Did you call the police?"
"I'm very annoyed because my friend didn't give me my money back	Oh, that's not very nice of him."
"Yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back	Oh no. Did you try to get him to pay you back?"
"I typically procrastinate when needing to pack for a trip. But this time I got my butt in gear and it's all done several days early.	That's good, what trip are you going on?"
"Thanks. I usually get somewhere and realize I forgot a bunch of stuff I need cause I packed in a rush 30 minutes before leaving.	I can imagine how that feels, but it sounds like you are doing better than I was last time."
"Fortunately, my wife usually comes to the rescue on me.	I bet that was frustrating."
"My wife was working yesterday, but she ended up taking the rest of the day off to spend time with me! I was shocked.	That is great! I am happy for you."
"We did! We went out for lunch and hung out on the beach. It was very relaxing and a nice change.	That's awesome! I wish I had that kind of time."
"I went to a restaurant my wife really likes with some friends while she was at work.  It's not a big thing, but I felt a little bad about it :P	I bet she was happy to see you.  What did you order?"
"Not like really bad, just kind of bad that I went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn't go.  It's not a big deal, but I feel bad when I do things like that.	Yeah, it's not like you can just go somewhere else and do whatever.  It's like, you're hurting her feelings and making her feel like you're not really hers."
"That horror movie made me terrified	I have seen that movie before. I think it was a really scary movie."
"Scream	It is one of my favorites. I'm a horror movie fan"
"I really want to have another baby. Baby fever is real lol I don't want to be all crazy about it, don't wanna track ovulation and do all this but i really wanna get pregnant asap	Oh wow, that's a lot of work.  But I'm sure it will be worth it in the end if it's what you really want.  I've had 2 kids and I would do it all over again if I could."
"thank you :) oh yeah, you can track ovulation, measure basal body temperature, etc. I'm not gonna go into details	I have a friend who is trying. She is a nurse and is so excited."
"My mom bought be a book online.  It should be here today I'm just waiting on the delivery man.	I'm sure it will arrive on time. It is a book."
"Yes it is.  She wanted two options so I wouldn't know which she'd pick.  She picked the right one so now it's just a waiting game.	That's great! I'm sure it's worth it to have a good book to read."
"It is nice to have in-laws that are accepting and loving. So many people don't have a good relationship with their in-laws.	That's so true. I had in-laws who didn't accept my partner and would not even let us have a family of our own. I felt so lonely and isolated"
"Aw I'm sorry. Mine is only a few years old but it's been smooth sailing so far.	It sounds like you have a good in-laws."
"I have been trying to get my oldest son to be more responsible.  I started out small by asking him to adopt a good sleep schedule.  After several weeks he still hasn't.	I am sure it will come around, it takes time."
"He does well enough in school.  I think that might make him think he doesn't need any disciple in everyday life.  Make me worry a bit.	That's a good point.  I'm starting to think that he might need to learn some discipline.  I hope he will."
"My wife usually sniffs out anything going on, but I was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing.	That's awesome! How did you plan it?"
"Yes. Friends, family, cake, all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.	Yeah, that is a pretty good surprise party."
"Thank you. Probably wont be able to do it again, but happy it worked this time.	I am so grateful for my wife	That's awesome!  I hope she is a good one!"
"She really is! I couldn't be where I am without her	That's so sweet!  I'm glad you're happy with your wife.  I've got to be with my wife for a few more weeks.  She's going to be back home with my parents soon."
"I can handle, bees, scorpions, wasps, crickets, and spiders.  But for some reason I lose my mind around roaches.	I hate roaches! They are the worst. I have to get rid of my dog from them every time he comes back from outside."
"I take some conselation in that, however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.	I'm not a fan of them either. I have a pet roach that I like to feed them."
"I feel guilty because I couldn't go to my friends party	That's no big deal, you can still go to another friends party"
"I was working and I couldn't leave early	That's okay. I'm sure you can make up with your friends."
"As a momma's boy I always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time.	Yeah, I can't wait for the next time she comes home"
"Fortunately, she rarely was gone for long periods of time, but I always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do.	That's a great story."
"Oh it's great.	I am so excited about going to the movies	Oh yeah, I love going to the movies. I'm going next Friday with my family."
"I'm going to see the purge. I have been waiting to see it for a while	That's awesome, I haven't been in that situation before but I'm sure it was fun."
"I saw a homeless lady and i felt so bad for her because it was so hot outside so went to five guys and bought her some food and cold drinks	Oh wow, I bet she appreciated that.  That must have been a kind thing to do of you!"
"blessing bags?? what are those?	Yeah they are great! They are so useful and can make someone's day a little brighter."
"wow that's a great idea! I will do the same! thanks for sharing	The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.	Oh, that's really cool, what puzzle is it from?"
"Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it, so I don't really know which one, but you can find a bunch on there.	I love that, I would have been so happy to have a piece of art that was made just for me and my wife.  I think we should go to Etsy and buy some more of it"
"Well, what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems, and I was right.	Oh wow, that is a long road trip!"
"Six days in all, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.	I'm so glad you had such a good trip. Where did you go?"
"It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas, some with free coffee!	That is a good way to travel, not rushing and just enjoying the view!"
"Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!	It's not so bad, but I don't like the feeling of not knowing if I'm safe."
"I have big renovation plans for my house.  I've made a money plan and have kept to it so far.	Oh wow, what kind of renovation plans?"
"Yes, hopefully it will all go as planned.  So far so good.	I am glad you are keeping it organized, that's a good way to go!"
"I was so anxious for my kid to graduate	That's cool, how did they graduate?"
"It did. I'm very proud of him	That's great! What is your child graduating in?"
"I didn't really try to use weight but i started going to the pool and i actually lost a couple of lbs	That is a great accomplishment! I've been trying to get healthier for a while now. What kind of pool do you have?"
"it's really fun and it's also a great exercise! Plus water is so relaxing	That's cool. I've been going to the pool a few times too."
"I hope when I get older, Im not lonely as I am now	That is a good thing. You can always meet new people."
"I was engaged but my woman left me	I understand.  I was in a relationship for about 10 years and my girlfriend left."
"I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.	I have heard that one before. What was your impression of it?"
"Yeah, for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.	That's cool. I've never really listened to that song before, but I've heard the title song. It's a classic, though. I'm glad you enjoy it."
"I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.	I feel the same way.  I don't want him to feel like he's not a part of the family."
"True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.	That's good that you're thinking about how to help him, though.  You can't expect a 10-year-old to do anything on his own.  Maybe you can find some things for him to do to help get him more motivated."
"K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there, but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.	I hate that. I don't like it when that happens either."
"It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.	That is scary."
"Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified, but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.	I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.	I feel you. I have had my fair share of frustrations."
"Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie, and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.	I feel you, sometimes I just want to watch a movie without any extras, but they want to make it a little more complicated than that."
"My eldest niece, who helps take care of her younger disabled sister, graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.	Yeah, she really is the best. She's so good and smart, and always puts others first."
"Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.	Yeah, she's really smart, but also really nice. I'm happy to have her in our family"
"I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.	I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.	That's understandable, but just be yourself, you'll get a yes or no."
"Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.	I can see why you're nervous. But you can't let fear stop you from asking her out.  I'd do the same thing.  You never know!"
"I really wanted to try bison meet and I went all the way to that whole foods store like 57 miles away and they didn't have it, what a waste of time	Oh no! I would have felt so bad! Did you try another store?"
"thank you! I hope i can find it somewhere locally. i've heard bison meat is very lean and good	I bet it's good. I'm not a big meat eater myself. But I do like the taste of bison. It's so lean, I like it when people say that."
"My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.	That is a bit gross. Is it a problem?"
"Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.	That sounds like the worst. I bet it's a bit embarrassing for you!"
"It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.	It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler"
"I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(	It's good to know he's safe."
"I once walkd around the grocery store without knowing my fly was down.	That is so weird, did you get embarrassed?"
"I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.	That must have been very awkward"
"It's been a hard day today, its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.	Oh no.  I'm sorry.  Did he go on vacation?"
"In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!	I understand, I have been in similar situations with my husband, he is always off to a deployment or a mission, but he always comes back to us with a big smile on his face."
"My young niece, who is disabled, was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! What was wrong with her?"
"Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.	It's good that it turned out okay. I'm sure you are proud of her!"
"It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too, but they live in Scotland.	I have this cat that loves to cause issues	That's a cat. Cats are very particular about their space."
"Like last night. She decided that she wanted to jump on the table	That's crazy, what happened?"
"I have tried to complete a work assigment three times now without sucuess.	I know that feeling. What is the task?"
"Doubtful.  I will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull.	That is not good. You might want to try some new software to help you."
"I couldn't go to movies to watch The greatest showman when it came out so my husband bought this movie when it came out. he is sweet	I love The Greatest showman."
"it's called The Greatest Showman. it's a musical! So good!! I watched it so many times already	That's so cool of him, I'm glad you got to see it!"
"A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would.	I bet that sucked.  Did you have to work overtime to make up for it?"
"It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker.	Oh no, I'm sure that was frustrating! Did you have to do anything special to get over it?"
"That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover.	My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.	Oh, I'm sure you're not the first to misread that calendar. I bet you are not the first to do that."
"Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.	Yeah, I feel bad too. I just hope she is home safe and sound."
"It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.	That's nice! You must be excited about that."
"After such a long time we certainly will.  I can't wait to start making the house into our home.	I'm so happy for you guys!"
"Our pet cat will need to be put down soon.	That's so sad. I'm so sorry for your pet."
"Yes we've had her since the begining.  She is older now and has suffered with feline AIDS for awhile.	That is so sad. I am so sorry. I will pray for your family."
"It really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street	I agree, it's heartbreaking to see them like that. I think we all need a little more compassion and understanding for those in need, and maybe a little less for those that are struggling."
"I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity	That is very kind of you.  I would do the same if I could.  I have been trying to get more involved.  I just wish there was more support."
"My husband shocked me the other day	That is so sweet! What happened?"
"He threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death!	That is awesome! What made him do it?"
"I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.	That is the way I feel."
"No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?	I am glad you have not done it. I am very committed to my wife."
"I was planning to view the stars last night, but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.	Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that, but that's a pretty cool thing! I've always been fascinated by astronomy."
"It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.	That's so cool. I bet you were really hoping to see the stars."
"A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.	I have been with my wife for 30 years now. I think we are at the peak of our relationship. We are getting older and it is hard to find the time to just relax and be ourselves."
"Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.	It is a big responsibility for her.  I hope she is able to balance that out."
"My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!	Yeah that's true, she's a great mom. I don't know what I'd do without her."
"I'm sure that's hard at times. I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.	I know how you feel! My mom is always there for me."
"I am dreading the two hour trip to the grocery store this week.	That's awful. I'm going to miss you"
"Me too!! Being so far out, it takes forever to get anywhere. I miss civilization lol.	Oh yeah, I have been there so many times.  It is a long time since I've been.  It's like the longest drive."
"We are workcamping in the mountains of NM. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours to get anywhere lol. We havent seen new faces around here in months lol.	im really exited to go to disneyland on vacation next summer	That's awesome, are you going with family or on your own?"
"yes im staying at the hotel for the first time i am really happy	i love disneyland too, what are you going to do?"
"I finished a class and most of my classmates got an A! It took a lot of work.	I'm glad you got an A! That must have been hard work. What was it?"
"It sure does! I am so proud of the hard work that everyone put in!	That's great! What class is that?"
"I have the best kids in the world.	That's great! What are they like?"
"Lots of little stuff.  They love to draw me pictures, crack jokes, and give lots of kisses.	Yeah that's nice! I have kids too."
"My husband has been putting in so many extra hours at work	That sucks, how long has he been doing so much?"
"Oh I am pampering the heck out of him! It got him a promotion!	That's great!  I hope he appreciates it.  I would too!"
"I just got laid off from my job. I need the paycheck so this is not a good situation.	That is unfortunate. What is going on at the job?"
"I am going to apply for new positions. Hopefully I will get something soon.	I am sorry to hear that. What will you do now?"
"I work in I.T.! Thanks for asking!	I just applied for a new job! It is a job that I have always wanted.	Oh that's great! Are you excited about the job?"
"Thank you! Have you ever applied to your dream job?	I have, I applied for a job at a big corporation a long time ago, but I never ended up applying. It was a long time ago, though."
"i ahte when my Girlfriend goes to the club alone	I hate going to the club."
"Yeah it makes me really jelous when guys talk to her	I understand. It can be really frustrating when guys are talking to your girlfriend."
"When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!	That is really sweet, I love it when you have that kind of surprise at work!"
"It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!	I am glad that you were able to be so open with him, and that he came to visit you."
"We certainly did. Where I was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs, restaurants etc. so we'd go to the beach and then party at night. Brilliant fun!	My Keurig just died. This is the third coffee pot in less than a year!	That is terrible. Did you buy it new or second hand?"
"I agree! I am so disgusted right now!!! We drink a lot of coffee lol. Its a 2 hour drive to the closest town to get another one too.	It's really frustrating when that happens!"
"We travel fill-time in our RV so I don't really have room to carry a back up. I hope our next location is more accessible to civilization.	I just had to move across country to a new job.	It sounds like a tough time, but it is a good job, right?"
"I am actually! I was so ready for it. I basically studied moving so that everything would be easy	That's great!  What kind of job are you?"
"One day my daughter got off the bus and was crying. An older boy intentionally tripped her as she got off the bus and she got hurt. This made me very upset and mad!	Yeah that would be so mean of him."
"He just thought it would be funny! He was also several years older than her and a teenager. Too old to know better!	I would have been mad too.  I would tell him to apologize to his sister."
"We recently found out that our 15 year old son has a rare, degenerative neurological disease.	That's terrible, what's his name?  Is he going into treatment?"
"No, the doctors tell us there is no cure. They are trying to treat the symptoms but thus far its been unsuccessful.	It's hard not knowing the diagnosis of the disease, it is very hard."
"Thank you, its been scary. He has good days and bad.	The door bell rang last month. I wasn't expecting anyone, but it was my daughter and her family from way up north.	That's pretty cool. Did they stay for a while?"
"I couldn't believe it. It had been almost a year since I saw them and she never even gave me a hint they were coming.	That sounds so nice. I hope she was able to catch up with you."
"I've studied hard all night in order to make myself ready for tomorrow's test	That's great! What's the subject of your test?"
"Repititions and exposure are my strategies.  Sumer semesters really ramp things up.	I am glad you have been studying hard, and I hope it goes well."
"Going through an unused drawer I found old drawing from when my kids were little	That is nice! What was your kids drawing of?"
"While the actual incidents of each drawing are lost in time it did make me think back to when they were younger.	Yeah that can be very nostalgic.  What kind of drawings were they?"
"I just had my husband remind me of when I fainted when he proposed!	I bet that was a fun memory!"
"I was so happy when I saw him get down on one knee that I just blacked out lmao	That's so cute! I love the way men think about proposing."
"The news announced a tornado warning. I ignored it at first, but then the city tornado siren went off.	That's crazy! What happened?"
"I almost panicked as the winds started to gust, but thankfully it missed us. A few miles up the road weren't so lucky though. Always listen to those warnings	It is always a good idea to listen. I am glad that the people up there were okay."
"I got a new puppy for my birthday! She is a cutie!	I love puppies! Do you have one at home?"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	That is so cute!  What breed is she?"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	It's cute! What is she doing now?"
"My neighbor ran into my car! They didn't even leave a note!	Oh my, that is awful.  I would be so angry.  Did you call the police?"
"I could tell by the color of the paint left on my car, and their car now has a scrape with the color of my car. I don't know what to do.	It's like when they ran into a tree and left a note."
"A thunderstorm raged all of last night! It kept me awake all night!	That's so cool. What kind of storm was it?"
"It is quite frightening! I wish that I could overcome my fear.	Oh, I am so glad you are alright! Thunderstorms can be scary!  I hope you are alright too!"
"I just applied for graduate school! I feel good about my chances!	That is exciting! What field of study are you looking into?"
"Thank you! I am very excited! It is quite unsettling though.	Oh no, you'll be okay! I hope you get in!"
"I remember just taking a deep breath the other day in the garden and just feeling happy	That's a good feeling.  What kind of plants did you have in the garden?"
"I have a garden so fully packed that I can't see my neighbors at all!	I love a garden!  I have a few in my yard and a few in my garden."
"My neighbor really helped me out recently after a big windstorm.	That is very kind of your neighbor.  How did you thank him?"
"No, they generously helped me clean up my yard and cut up a tree with their chainsaw, and they asked for nothing in return.	That's really nice of your neighbor, they must be a good one."
"My son just graduated from high school! He has worked so hard, and he even earned a scholarship.	That's so cool! Congrats! I'm sure he is very proud."
"Thank you! He is going to study Computer Science!	I'm so proud of him! I'm sure he's going to do great things. What are his plans?"
"I am taking a trip to Disney World next month! My wife is going for the first time!	That is awesome! What are you planning on doing on your vacation?"
"I have been a couple of times before, and it is such a magical place! Where are you planning on taking a trip to?	It is a wonderful place! Where you are planning on going is not important to me. I am sure you'll have a great time!"
"I slipped and fell in the restroom last week. The floors desperately needed cleaned.	That's terrible. Did you get hurt?"
"The only thing to get injured was my pride. It was quite the gross experience.	I would have been so angry."
"The other day Comcast customer service kept me waiting for 20 minutes just to speak with someone. What a disgrace!	I am so angry. They have to get that service down."
"They're awful. If they'd just employ enough cs people to handle the volume you could just about bear it!	I've been a customer for over 10 years and they've never been able to help me with a single thing."
"Mind you, their product is useless too. Ok, rant over!	Queue jumping is something which irks me no end. I was at the deli counter of my local store recently and some guy came up and started ordering. The employee served him, too.	That's so annoying! I hate people who jump into line first. It's like, you're not really even there yet."
"Yes. And I'm disabled and it's hard to stand for a long time while some idiot gets his lunch. I hope it was horrible!	It's so rude! I hate when the person who's paying gets to go before everyone else."
"Perhaps salmonella poisoning? One can only hope, lol!	I am very glad we headed the warnings and evacuated prior to Hurricane Harvey.	That was a disaster. I hope everyone was okay."
"Yes it was a scary time. We stocked up on food and bottled water and moved our RV about an hour and a half inland. Luckily the storn went to the north of us.	It was a scary experience."
"Our Rv is our home, we are full-time Rvers! Thank you so much! Have you ever been through an evactuation? Did you feel prepared?	This past Mother's Day my husband gave me some wonderful unexpected gifts! He even got me a gorgeous diamond ring.	I love when that happens, it is so nice of him!  Did you like it?"
"I was! It was so thoughtful and sweet, and I was very touched by it.	I love when the people around you show you care and appreciate you!"
"My parents are going to a tea room for their anniversary.	That's nice. Are you going to go with them?"
"No that is where they decided to go but the thing is I called the place and they can't accommodate my special diet I am on.  I am so sad b/c that means I can't go with the.	I am sure they can make an exception."
"I am very excited for the arrival of our 7th grandbaby!	I'm glad you are excited. Are you expecting a boy or girl?"
"Thank you, I try to be the best Nana I can be. We are hoping she comes while we are visiting for Christmas!	It is great to have a big family. I hope you all have lots of fun!"
"Thank you so much! I surely will.	My dad has early onset dementia	That sucks. I am sorry for your family."
"Yes, I try my hardest to be caring and patient with him b/c I know he doesn't mean to be harsh or hard to deal with at times.	That is terrible.  I am sorry you have to deal with that.  Hopefully he is getting better.  It is so sad.  It seems like it is something that can affect anyone at any time.  It must be really frustrating for you.  I am sure you care deeply for him.  I hope it gets easier for him in the future.  It is really sad for families.  I am sure he will always cherish the memories he has of you.  I"
"At work today, all my coworkers sang me happy birthday. It was so nice of them!	Oh, that was a kind gesture. Did they sing it in a karaoke kind of way, or just in a group?"
"It was so thoughtful of them. I didn't even mention it was my birthday.	That is nice. What did they sing?"
"I don't know. But they sure wen't above and beyond!	I took a huge test today and man it made me so nervous. I really hope I did well on it.	I hate when that happens"
"I did, I studied every day for week! I almost wore myself out studying.	I hope you did well on the test!"
"I really hope so, I am so nervous while I wait for my results.	I am so proud of my son	I am too, what's his age?  What's he into?  I am so proud of my son as well.  What is he into?"
"He got the highest score on a test	That's awesome! I hope he continues to do well!"
"My husband usually gets a big bonus around this time of the year. We are eagerly waiting, hoping, and waiting for it!	I'm sure you're looking forward to it!"
"It is! It's not a guarantee though, so it's just a waiting game, and not easy.	Yeah, that's the worst part. You just hope and hope that everything goes right."
"I am so angry that my brother didnt come to my party	I am sure it wasn't the brother's fault.  What did he do?"
"I am not sure. I just don't know why he didn't show	It can happen, maybe he was busy. I would ask him if he can make it."
"I am confident that I will have a great day tomorrow	That sounds good! Do you have anything planned for it?"
"That is so true. Getting to know you also makes it seem like a great day already leading to tomorrow.	It is a great day to go out and enjoy the world."
"I have trusting issues because my fiance left  me	That's a terrible thing to do."
"I know but it's so hard because no one wants to be with me	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Have you tried counseling?"
"Flying typically doesn't bother me too much, because I love travel. However I was a bit concerned on a flight once right after a travel advisory had been issued.	That is a good thing. Travel advisories are usually just a warning."
"Well i did have a few of those. It went fine. I was still nervous even after we landed in a foreign country. I just watched my surroundings. Everything went great.	Yeah, it was a bit stressful, but nothing that would stop you from flying!"
"I am so lonely right now because no one wants to be with me	Oh, that's terrible, what happened?"
"Yeah, but no luck	That is terrible, I hope things improve for you."
"when i was younger I was really getting into graphic design and really wanted a new Apple computer. I knew my parents couldnt afford it, but they somehow made it happen and surprised me on Christmas..	Oh, I'm sorry, you had to go through that?"
"yea my parents are pretty great. Pretty maddening at times, but I wouldn't trade them.	That's really cool. I've always been really interested in design and art."
"I hope to be there one day and see it from that side.	i felt really good when i won a poker tournament last week	That's great! What did you win?"
"yes it was, it took a long time to do but at the end it was worth it	That's cool. What was the prize for winning the tournament?"
"Spiders is one of my gratest fear they make me so scared	I hate spiders!"
"i have tried to overcome my fear but i just cant they make my skin temble	I'm sure you can overcome it. I've had spider phobias for as long as I can remember."
"i am impressed that video games grow so much every year	I agree."
"that is a great game the growth on video games has been amazing this past few years	That's true! I have been playing a lot of Fortnite lately, so it's great to see how it's been doing so well!"
"We went out to dinner for our first anniversary and they got our order all wrong.	That is terrible!  Did you order the food you wanted or the other?"
"Thank you. The restaurant came highly rated by a lot of people so I guess my expectations were high. I tried not to let it bother me.	I hate when things like that happen. I would have been so upset!"
"My wife flew home to see family. It is very quite at home now.	That's good. You have to have family to make it worth it."
"I know, that would of been nice! Instead I was all alone for the last few weeks.	Yeah, that is what I was thinking.  I was lonely and I didn't get to see my family.  My wife said she would be back soon."
"Me too, a home doesn't feel like a home without a woman.	i am really impressed everytime i see my nephew on how fast he is growing	That's really cool. I have a nephew myself. How fast is he growing?"
"yeah but i dont see him very often maybe that is why i always get shocked when i see him	That sounds so exciting!  What kind of growth is he talking about?"
"When I got the phone call that my mom had cancer I was so upset.	Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that.  What kind was it?"
"It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.	I am sorry to hear that. I hope they can find it soon."
"one of the best days of my life was when i graduated from high school	That is a great experience, what high school did you graduate from from?  I graduated from high school a year later than you.  Was it a tough time for you?"
"i know right time goes really fast and you dont even noticed, for me it was 13 years ago	That's great. I graduated from high school 20 years ago. I'm 40."
"The other night I was driving home in the rain and slid into the guard rail. It is going to cost so much to get my car fixed!	I bet. That's not good."
"I know, I will have to be more careful next time. I shouldn't eat ice-cream while driving,	Oh my god, what were you eating?"
"It will still move, but I can't steer very well with the front tires missing.	There is a tornado coming. But I have the pantry full and am ready this time.	Oh wow. What kind tornado?"
"You never know how long the power might be out for!	I hope that the pantry holds up."
"It could take a while for any sort of rescue to come!	I had a pretty large loan, with a bit of a high interest rate, and a high monthly payment. My mother decided to pay it off for me, out of the blue!	I bet that was nice of her."
"Yes, I couldn't believe it. She's so sweet and giving, but I sure didn't expect her to do that!	That's awesome! I hope you're able to keep it."
"My husband is the most faithful man I know	Wow, that's a rare trait. What makes him that way?"
"I have so many health problems and he is always there for many no matter what being loving and caring	That is wonderful.  What kind of health problems do you have?"
"I left the front door unlocked and the mailman robbed me. I couldn't believe I would do that.	I'm sorry you had that happen. Did you report it?"
"Only my pride! I wasn't at home when he robbed me. He took a lot of valuables.	I know, I feel like I should have been home.  I don't know what's wrong with people.  They are so careless!"
"I hope so! A federal worker like that should have more integrity!	I have always been afraid of snakes i dont know what to do to control my fear for them	i would be scared of them as well"
"yes, i one time i was taking a hike and 3 meters to my left was a rattle snake i jumped like a rabbit and ran back to my friends	I hate snakes. They are so scary and venomous. I'm glad you are not a snake hunter."
"I was annoyed when my wife left me	That's unfortunate. What happened?"
"Yeah its been a rough 2 weeks for me	Oh no, I'm sorry. I hope things work out for you."
"I was afraid when I went into the movies alone	oh no that's not good"
"Because I have always been with someone, so going in alone just frightened me	I am sure it was fine."
"I've been married almost 23 years. My husband travel so much, but we both have trust in each other to be true and loyal.	That's really nice. It's always good to have a partner to have someone to be with."
"for his job. So, it can be hard, but we trust each other.	It can be hard, but I think it's the best."
"I am hopeful that my friend will be able to make it to my party	I'm sure you're all friends"
"It is to me because he is my best friend	That's great! What's your friend's name?"
"I have been exercising and taking care of myself more lately.	I know the feeling. It's great that you are doing that."
"I think many do, but man does it feel good.	That sounds like a great attitude to have."
"I am joyful that I am with my wife	Oh yeah! How old are you two?"
"We have been together for 10 years	That's awesome. I'm happy for you both."
"I felt pretty luck the other day! I won $100 on a scratch off ticket! I never win!	That's the best feeling in the world!"
"Not usually, I never win. so, it was very unexpected.	I have never won a scratch off.  What kind did you win it on?  Was it a lottery ticket or something?"
"My sister was given $1,000 by my grandma as a graduation present. She did not give me a penny.	I am sorry. Is your grandma very old?"
"Perhaps, I just don't understand why I was left out. Seems unfair.	That is a pretty good gift."
"We went on our vacation about a week ago to the beach and it rained several days while we were there. We wanted to go to the beach every day!	I know. I'm so jealous.  I love going to the beach.  I hope you guys can have another vacation soon"
"Yes, and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront! But, we still had a good time, just wished we could have had less rain!	That is too bad, I would have loved to go to the beach with you. I hope you had fun despite the rain."
"I was given the opportunity to work at a new job that I was hoping to get! I never thought it would be possible!	That's great! I'm sure you will do great work there!"
"Thank you! I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity.	I feel the way!"
"I fell down in a mud puddle today while walking to lunch. I was covered in mud for the rest of the work day.	It must have been gross."
"No kidding! It was hard to keep a good attitude for the rest of the day.	That's no fun at all!"
"My husband works nights a lot right now.	Oh, that must be very tiring."
"It really is, i hate being alone at night.	I understand, it can be tough."
"A few, but he still has to sleep all day, makes doing things hard.	I'm anxious (if excited!) about an upcoming move -- we've lived overseas before, but this is such a different state and climate, I'm not sure what to expect!	I'm sure it will be okay.  Are you moving to a city that you know you will enjoy?"
"Alaska! We've got some transition time, but I've been doing deep research on Anchorage -- and the more I see, the more I like!	That's great. I'm sure you'll do fine."
"I hate that people hit on others they know are married.	Oh, I see.  That's not cool.  Why do you feel like that?"
"Right? Happens to my husband all the time and it's just frustrating.	Oh, yes. I hate when they do that too. It's like, why would you want to do that to someone who is already with someone else."
"No, since it's his associates at work!!	i cannot wait for the next star wars movie to come out	I am excited!"
"he is, i really like the new ones but always will like the old ones better	I love the old ones. They are so much better than the new ones."
"i hate when i fart in public it is so embarrasing	That is embarrassing. I hope it never happens again"
"i can hold them but some of them are just accidental and it is the worst, depends on what i eat haha	I have had that happen to me, but not as often as people farting."
"My husband recently got me a great gift. He got me a beautiful 14 kt diamond ring! I had no idea he was.	Wow that is awesome!  How did he do that?"
"Yes, it was so sweet and unexpected. We've been married almost 23 years so I guess I deserve it lol	It's a nice surprise."
"i hate that people dont care and they just throw their trash on the street	I agree, people are so lazy."
"if im walking i pick up as much as i can	That's terrible.  I hate it too.  What do you do?"
"i am extremely afraid of going near hiights	I know how you feel. What are you afraid of?"
"Yeah last year i went to disneyland and got on the elevator game and i almost cried hahaha	That sounds like a fun time, I hate going near hightights too.  What happened when you got on the elevator game?"
"The last job interview I went on also went well, but it took a long time to hear back from them.	That's a bummer, but I'm sure you'll find a job soon. You've got the right skills, and you'll be fine."
"Oh, I did eventually, it just took like a month.  I ended up getting the job!	I'm glad that went well.  I've been having some bad days lately and needed to hear back."
"i cant wait for my disneyland vacation next summer	That is so exciting! What are your plans?"
"i think me and my family is going there for 1 week it is going to be wonderfull	I'm a fan of Disney too, I've been to Disney World and Disneyland."
"i am getting my new car next week and cant wait for it.	I bet.  What kind is it?"
"it is a 2017 bmw, i traded in my old car to get an awesome deal	That sounds great! What kind of car is it?"
"My in-laws are helping us pay for school clothes for our kids this year.	I love that.  What kind of school clothes are they getting?"
"Yeah, it helps take some of the burden off of us. I will have to check out Goodwill and see if I can find anything.	I love Goodwill!"
"Wow, those prices are great. I'll be going by there for sure. Yeah, the best part about them helping, is that they do it, not expecting anything in return. They just all of us and want to help.	Yeah, it's great to have that kind of kindness from the community. I know how hard it is for people to be able to give, so that's great to help."
"Yes, they are great.	I was in a college class once with an older woman.  She took a paper idea I had talked about and presented it as her own, stealing all the work I had done.	That's horrible. Did you tell her you felt that way?"
"I did.  There wasn't much she could do, but at least I could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work.	Yeah that would be really bad to do.  What did you do?"
"i really hate when people make me wait for no reason	That's terrible, do you get upset?"
"my girlfriend allways makes me wait, it makes me really anxious ahhahah	Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. Is she busy?"
"One of my best friends is moving far away and i dont know when i will be able to see him again	Oh that's sad. Are you going to visit him?"
"yeah i can call him and email him, it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again	I know what that's like.  I've been there too.  It can be tough."
"I think having goals is important. My mother in law has managed to lose weight and walked daily.	Yeah I can see that, you need to set goals for yourself and make sure you're doing the right exercises."
"Very similar ones, but I like focusing on others success	Yeah, goals are great, but it's also good to have a little bit of humility, right?"
"It really does, hope any you have works out!	i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it	i feel the same way"
"i know right, it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me	i agree i hate to see them"
"the day i gratuaded from college is my favorite day	That's awesome! I'm so proud of you!"
"the fact that it took so much work and time	That's really awesome. What was the major?"
"i cant wait for my new tv that i ordered online and will recive this weekend	That sounds like fun! I'm not really into electronics but I know a few people who are."
"yeah it is twice the size as the tv that i have at the moment	That's really cool! I've always wanted to get one of those!"
"I have an older friend who I try to help out.  She lost her husband a couple years ago.	That is so nice of you. What did she lose?"
"We go out to lunch regularly.  She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.	Oh that sounds tough.  I hope she is okay.  I'm sure you are trying to help her out."
"Thanks.  Yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now.	We need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues, no matter your views.	I agree, I don't care about the politicians, just the country"
"Exactly, let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!	It's always easy when you're a fanboy."
"I spent my first Christmas away from home in a computer lab, working by myself.	That's cool. Did you have a computer or did you have to buy one?"
"Yes, it wasn't very fun.  But I had to do it because my project for work was due the next day.	Yeah, that's a real bummer.  You're not alone in that, though - I've been there."
"I miss my dog Kat	That is sad. Do you miss her?"
"Yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year.  She was a great dog	Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I have a dog named Luna, and I'm so attached to her. She's such a sweet girl. I'm sure she's watching over you right now."
"Thanks.  I do miss coming home to her.  My cat is just not the same.	It's great to see my husband doing so well.	It's always good to have a good partner"
"He's become the top manager in his division in just two years.	That's amazing, I'm glad to hear that."
"Hello, I am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets ... it is unacceptable	That is very sad. How are you handling the situation?"
"I feel that pain ... as if I had been hit	That sounds terrible!  Did you ever report it to the police?"
"it's something since I was born ... I'm like that	That reminds me of the time I went to LA for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark.	That is crazy, what happened?"
"Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also.	I'm sorry I couldn't help, but you can't meet new people when it's dark and you are hiking."
"I really miss my puppy, we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always.	That is so nice of you. I bet it will bring back good memories for you."
"Yes, she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.	Oh, that is so sweet!  I'm sure it was a great way to keep her memory alive.  How old was your puppy?"
"my son is teething and he is so cranky! I gave him tylenol and got some teething toys. I don	That's good. He will get through it."
"it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! Doesn't sleep good, doesn't want to eat. poor little boy	That sucks.  I hope he doesn't have any issues.  Is it a boy or girl?"
"i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed. i didn't it's gonna be that hard. I think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college	Oh, I understand. That is very tough. I have two little boys. I don't know what to do."
"I hope so, i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face	Yeah, I know that feeling. I used to sleep train my daughter as well. It's tough, but it'll take time!"
"I have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around Italy.	I've always wanted to see the world, but I've never been."
"I wish I were with them.  I love Italy	I have traveled there and it is amazing"
"Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.	I agree.  I've been there twice.  It is a beautiful place.  But I am sure you will go there one of these days.  You deserve it.  It is so beautiful.  I know you will fall in love.  You will be so in love.  I am sure of it.  I know you will be with them.  I know you will.  It's just that you need to be in the right place at the right time."
"That is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures	My friend bought me lunch today	That sounds nice. I'm always a bit jealous when my friends get to eat free. Did you eat at a restaurant or something you bought on your way?"
"I had a nice burger and fries	That is awesome!  What restaurant?"
"Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch	I hate when people pull in front of you, especially when it's clear behidn you.	Yeah I know.  I hate it too!"
"Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.	Oh I know that feeling. I was driving last week and there was this guy who was in front of me. I was so annoyed. I had to pull over and take a deep breath. I'm just not going to be able to stop."
"yes, sadly I easily can.	I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy	That's okay.  It's normal to be a little scared of the dark.  You are not alone in this.  There are plenty of people that are afraid of the dark as well."
"That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on	That's not normal."
"I like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs. They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.	Oh, I see.  That's very kind of you.  What kind of dogs do you see at the shelter?"
"They do. They get to smell the grass, they play they get their exercise, they get to have fun, they get to be a dog!	Oh, I can see why you would be excited about that."
"Last night at like midnight the power cut out completely on my street	oh that sounds scary, was it a storm?"
"We luckily had candles around! I was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power	That's crazy! Did you have candles around to help?"
"A while back my cat knocked over and broke my mothers urn.	That is so bad, what happened?"
"I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it	I am sorry that happened to you. It is a very bad thing to do. Did it happen when you were not around to see?"
"I made a bowl of cereal for breakfast and when i started eating i realized milk was spoiled!! I started gagging. it was so gross!	I can only imagine.  Did you call a store?"
"don't you hate that? gosh, i didn't eat anything the whole day because i don't have an appetite anymore	I hate the smell of spoiled milk. I don't know how to get rid of it!"
"I was so calm and happy the other night just listening to rain hitting the kitchen windows	I know how you feel! I was so happy that day."
"It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too!	Yeah I do love it too! It is like a soothing white noise."
"i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere	that's a terrible thing, how did you do?"
"not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up	Oh wow, that must be so stressful. I can imagine that would make you nervous every time you drive."
"Though the odds are against you, I understand why people gamble. I remember a particular time I was playing video poker at a local dive bar.	I've played a few times."
"Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!	You are crazy man."
"I honestly think New Orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the US. You never know what you are going to find around the corner.	It really is, I've lived here my whole life and I can't imagine living anywhere else. I love the music, the food, the architecture..."
"Mardi Gras is great, but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town, and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole, and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!	That sounds like a blast! I love New Orleans. I've never been, but I've been to the French Quarter at night."
"I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?	Oh man, you mean when you go out and do a good deed and the other person turns around and does something awful to you? I think you mean that. I don't know what you mean."
"You can say that again. One time, I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.	Yeah, that is a terrible way to make a living."
"1	I am so jealous. I have not been able to get a job for months."
"sorry that was sent by an mistake	i know, i was so upset"
"I don't think I am a judgmental person, but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day, and I can still smell it.	Oh wow! I'm glad you didn't judge her friend!  That is a really cool experience.  I love trying new foods and drinks, but there are some foods that I just don't know if I can stomach.  I'm sure she would be happy to know that you did that and that you did it with her friend's consent."
"Trust me, this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off, they had running clean water, but no toilet indoors!	That is a bit gross. I would have left if I saw it."
"I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.	I hate presentations."
"I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.	That's good! You're going to do great!"
"I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at, the possibility looks good!	Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?	i know, i was in that situation with my best friend."
"That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!	That's a good story! What happened to her? Did you ever see her again?"
"Not too long ago, my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it!	That is so nice of her.  What was the interest rate on the loan?"
"Yes, I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought, I am blessed.	I love my mom."
"I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible	That is horrible. I bet your dishes are still there."
"I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me!	Oh that sucks! I've broken my finger before and it's a total pain."
"So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!	Oh that sounds nice. What kind of school supplies do you kids need?"
"I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.	I am glad to hear that! I'm a bit more organized than you."
"And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!	I know!  It's like you have to have everything ready in advance.  I hate that.  And it's hard to get the right stuff.  It makes you feel like the person who has the best time of the year is not even the person with the best stuff."
"I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!	I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong	That's so frustrating. What happened?"
"The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to	Oh, I'm sorry.  Did you get it back?"
"I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!	I would have felt terrible."
"YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!	I can imagine that! I hate crowds like that. I'm usually at the store around 10A too!"
"I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!	I can imagine.  I have a lot of friends who work in retail, they're always the ones in the checkout lines."
"Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!	I love the idea of ordering online! I have been thinking about it a lot lately. What do you like to buy online?"
"The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider	I am sorry.  That is a bit gross.  What kind of spider?"
"I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that!	Yeah I hate spiders."
"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	Oh, that's okay. I've never been to theater myself."
"Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!	I can understand why you would feel uneasy about the situation, I've seen some weird stuff in the theater before"
"Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!	I understand that. It can be frustrating."
"It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!	I understand. It's frustrating. I wish you guys luck."
"When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.	I would do that for my best friend."
"He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!	I can imagine. I'm not that good with money and I'm not very good at making smart investments. How long have you been doing this?"
"Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.	I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure it was a traumatic event for you."
"I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!	Oh wow, that is so gross. I can't even imagine."
"I don't know how you are with Calc, but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.	Yeah, I am pretty good with math, but it's not my strongest subject."
"Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!	That's great! I'm glad you were able to pass the exam."
"My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night	I hate waking people up, especially when they are in a bad mood."
"She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her!	Yeah that's the best way to get a cat to play."
"I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27, I would have thought you were crazy.	Oh that is crazy. What kind of school did you go to?"
"I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer, but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra, and was accepted to a state university two years ago!	Oh my! I can't believe that! That's amazing. You're going to change the world!"
"i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college	That is terrible! Did you apply to other schools?"
"yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha	That's terrible. Did you have to look for another college?"
"My boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend...	That's terrible! Did you call him back?"
"Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her.	That's terrible. Did he have any good movies lined up?"
"i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years	I agree.  I was playing games for years before I started playing games for the first time."
"gaming has blown up this past couple of years	That's true. I've been playing a lot more games than ever. I have no idea why I am so into them. I think I like the social aspect."
"I love roller coasters, but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter.	I know right? It's so hard to find places to go to. I wish it was better in the winter."
"Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around, all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.	I have never been to a roller coaster, I'm not really into thrill rides."
"I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.	I'm excited too!"
"I'm an Engineering major, electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?	That sounds awesome! What major do you study in Electrical Engineering?"
"i really am thankful for everything that i have and had	That's great! It sounds like you are a very grateful person."
"it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little	That is a nice memory.  Did you get a job to go buy it?"
"he gave it to me beafore he went to the army, and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional	My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!	I love bowling! I've been playing for years. What is your son's name?"
"Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?	I do! I have been since I was a kid!"
"I keep hearing strange noises in my house. My husband is out of town and I'm all alone. There has been reports of break ins on my street.	I would make sure to tell the police about it."
"No I don't, I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!	That's a bit unsettling. I hope there aren't any. Are you sure it's just your dogs?"
"So I suck hard at bowling, but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.	Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you going to try to practice more to be a pro bowler?"
"Yeah, my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.	I'm sorry to hear that, I hope it didn't ruin your evening"
"I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend, for various reasons, but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.	I'm sorry.  What happened?"
"I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.	I'm sorry that happened. I hope you can reconnect with your old friends and that life works out for the best."
"No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.	It's hard to be a single person in a big city, but I'm trying to find my way."
"So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.	Yeah, it's hard when you have to go through that and then not be able to do it again"
"I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.	That's a lot of work. Maybe you should look for a job that's easier to do part time."
"So college is starting up soon and I feel more ready than ever to do well this year!	Yeah I feel you!  College is so hard!"
"Thanks, I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.	That's good to hear. I'm sure you'll do well."
"So I just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room. I feel very at ease.	That's great. How did you have such an amazing dinner?"
"Surprisingly enough, a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!	Oh man, that is so good of them! What kind of pizza is it?"
"my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart. i can't wait till these molars cut thru	Yeah, it is so annoying, but he will be okay. I have had a few of my own and it is so hard."
"I do but he doesn't like them. he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad	That sucks. I have two kids and they both have teething issues."
"I think I will be very busy Monday night playing my new game.	Oh wow, what game?"
"World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.	That's cool. I'm not a big gamer myself. What game is it?"
"I come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing. It's very frustrating.	I feel bad for them. I would try to stay away from them"
"Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.	That's a bit frustrating, but at least you are the most responsible one."
"I think storms are wonderful, except when the power goes out.	I agree!  I love storms, but only when I can be inside with my TV"
"It was extra loud and my husband was at work, bit scary.	That is terrible. I hope you and your husband are alright."
"O it sure seemed like it did, dogs were scared too.	College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!	That sounds like it. Do you have a lot to do?"
"It probably will be, as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!	That's good to have confidence."
"I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.	That's awesome! Which artist is it?"
"It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.	That's really cool. I love hearing music from when I was a kid."
"So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.	That is awesome.  What kind of bowler is he?"
"For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!	Oh, that's great!  I bet it is a bit frustrating when you're playing with someone and they are doing better.  I hope you can still have fun playing with him."
"I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.	That's great! What's your job?"
"it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.	That's great you are so ready to go.  What are your plans for tomorrow?"
"So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.	Oh well.  I guess you will have to go back to the drawing board and try again."
"For sure, that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose, can't expect to be perfect!	I can relate to that.  I've made a few mistakes in the past that I'm sure will come back to haunt me."
"So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.	That is so cool! Where did you go?"
"No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself, would do again!	Yeah that's great that you got to see them. I hope you get to do more of that."
"So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!	That is so awesome! Did you guys have a contest?"
"I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!	That's cool! I bet he was happy. What kind of vehicle was it?"
"So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.	That is normal.  What are you worried about?"
"Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.	That is crazy. You should get the money and go!"
"PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!	I bet that was frustrating!"
"It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.	That is so sad.  Did they get away with it?"
"So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!	That sucks, did you try jumpstarting it?"
"Oh yes, very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now, I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.	I'm sorry that your car is not starting, but maybe it's not time to replace it yet."
"I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.	That's okay.  I'm sure you'll do great.  Just take it easy and be yourself"
"I know! Like, mentally, I don't care, but my body just responds by making my legs shake, my heart pound, and speaking too quickly.	It's normal to have that anxiety, but I think it's a sign of confidence in your work. I'd be worried if you didn't have confidence in yourself."
"I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times, it was awful.	That's gross, how many dogs did you clean up for?"
"Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.	Yeah I hate it."
"So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.	Oh, I see.  What happened after that?"
"Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.	I can see why you might feel awkward."
"I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester.	It is a problem for many students.  How did you afford it?"
"Yes, everything's taken care of, thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!	That's nice of your boyfriend."
"i was really glad i finished my service for the military	That's so awesome. What was it for?"
"it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country	That's great. I am proud of you too, you must feel like you did your job right?"
"i did not expect my car to be soo good for the price i paid	Oh that's good! What car was it?"
"yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well	That is awesome, did you find the car online or did you find it used from a dealership?"
"i don't like to see my parents smoke it makes me really sad	yea it makes me sad to see"
"yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now	I know right.  I hate when they smoke it.  It is just not healthy."
"i hate when ash from my cigarette drops in my work pants	That's the worst. I've had that problem for years."
"yeah, i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off, it is really embarrasing	i hate that too! i always get the ash on my work clothes, it makes me so embarass"
"When katrina hit texas my family lost like half of their belongings	I am so sorry.  That was such a disaster!"
"Well when it hit we left but now we are ok and we recovered well	That's terrible! Did you lose anything?"
"i cant stand people that dont flush the toilet	That is the worst thing.  I have never had to flush the toilet.  It's the worst.  I don't understand how some people do not do that.  I flush the toilet every time I go to the bathroom.  I think some people do it once in a month or something."
"Oh, so where do you go to do your personal buisness	I hate that too"
"I guess i will be the next team leader	That sounds pretty cool. I'm sure you'll do a great job. What team leader?"
"Yes. I was expecting that very much.	I know that feeling.  Are you going to be able to handle the pressure?"
"My kids and I went to Six Flags and they wanted me to ride the roller coaster but I had so many reservations about getting on it.	That sounds like a lot of anxiety.  Did you get on it?"
"The high speeds. It had been so long since i had been on one. I finally did get on and we had a blast!	It's good to get back to something old again! I love that. It's great for kids and adults alike. I hope you guys had a good time at the park!"
"When I turned 40 last year, my kids planned a birthday party for me that I had no idea about.	That is nice! How old are they?"
"It really was and just what I need as I wasn't really happy about turning that corner into my 40's.	That's great news! I am 40 too and it is nice to know my kids are thinking of me in that way."
"A few weeks ago we were at a wedding. Everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my 3 year old niece started to choke on a carrot. So scary!	Oh my goodness, that is so scary."
"Yes, someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.	That's terrible. Did you get her to the hospital?"
"So an online payment distributor company won't instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct. Feels bad man.	I feel bad for that person. What is their name?"
"Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope they fix it for you soon."
"Today is my off day and I wanted to sleep in, yet here I am awake early.	I'm so glad for you! I love off days"
"It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.	Oh well, maybe you can take the day off to sleep in?"
"I was dog sitting at my dad's house last week and I heard strange noises in his house.	That is creepy. What kind of noises?"
"I don't know, it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.	That's weird. Did you ever figure out what was going on?"
"Last semester, I had to give a class presentation. My stomach was full of butterflies from the nerves.	That is terrible!  What happened?"
"All things considered, pretty well. I definitely had some anxiety about it though. Presentations are my least favorite thing in the world.	That is understandable, I would be nervous too if I had to present in front of a lot of people!"
"My aunt recently passed away after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.	I am so sorry for your loss.  My aunt passed away a year ago and it was a very sad experience."
"Thanks. It's been especially hard because she was almost like a mother to me.	It's a tough time.  I hope they found a good solution for her."
"So I asked out a girl in my class and she said yes. Was a big morale boost.	That's great. Did you go out with her?"
"Thanks! We are getting coffee this weekend. Hopefully something comes of it!	I'm glad that happened. I've been having trouble asking out."
"I always carry a multi-tool and a small 4-1 screwdriver on me. I feel like I can fix almost anything with that.	That is so cool. I don't even have a multi tool. I'm a bit old and my hands aren't what they used to be. I don't know what to do when things are broke"
"I'd like to think so. I just like to be ready for anything.	That is so cool. I like to have tools on me at all times."
"I'm starting a new position at my job soon.	That's exciting! What's your new job?"
"I'll be managing consumer relations at a law firm. I'm really looking forward to it!	That is great! I'm sure you will do well in that position."
"My car is on it's last legs. I think I see a new car in my future very soon.	Oh that's great! I'm sure you're excited!"
"I would love to get an X-Terra! I'm a big fan of the SUV platform.	That's awesome.  I'm a truck driver.  I've been looking for a new SUV.  I've got a truck for work, so I don't need a car for driving."
"After dropping out of college 6 years ago, I decided to go back this year.	That's great. You must be really excited."
"I have high hopes for myself, as I have all A's so far. I hope I can keep up the momentum!	That's awesome! You must be so excited."
"I just had a delicious breakfast and now I'm casually relaxing in my room. Life is good!	Oh, that is great! I'm glad to hear that life is good. What kind of breakfast do you like?"
"Pancakes and sausage! How can you go wrong?	I can't wait for my next breakfast!"
"So I have been saving money for about a month now and should have enough for any kind of emergency that may happen. Feels good man.	It's always good to be prepared! I'm glad you're thinking ahead."
"Thanks so much! It definitely relieves some stress knowing that I have a safety cushion. Hoping I don't have any emergencies though!	I feel you, I've been trying to be prepared too. I hope you don't need it."
"Having a baby 3 months ago really changed my view on life for the better.	I know right?  It really makes you appreciate everything and the little things."
"I was a heavy drinker, and looking back now, I know I was in a downward spiral, I just couldn't tell at the time. Now I'm pursuing my education and have become much more healthy and responsible.	That's great to hear about the changes you've made."
"My husband and I are going a  cruise with a couple that we have been friends with for a long time,	That sounds like fun! Where are you going?"
"We kind of all came up with it together. They booked it and we just pay them a certain amount of money each week, until our part is paid for.	That sounds like a good time! Are you two excited?"
"I hope you can too. If its ok, I would like to pray for you, just to maybe help you find someone special.	I am so proud of my sister	It's good to see someone supporting a family."
"She bought me a car	Oh, that's awesome! What kind is it?"
"We are basically best friends. It is my birthday and she worked really hard to get a car for me	That is so cool, how much did it cost?"
"I am sad that my parents didn't attend my birthday	I'm sorry to hear that. Did they not have a good reason?"
"No, they just are not wanting to come to it	That is very unfortunate, why don't they come to your birthday?"
"Last week at the end of the week I got home from work and was pretty tired.  I ended up just sitting on the couch with my wife and dogs watching tv.  It was nice.	I'm glad to hear that it was a nice time for you and your wife to relax.  What were you watching tv for?"
"Quite a lot, actually.  It was a nice way to spend the evening.	That's a nice way to spend the evening.  What did you do after that?"
"I was going to a wedding outside of my city, and had arranged to have my dogs watched while I was gone, but the person backed out really soon before I had to leave.	That is terrible! I would have been so mad! Did you get to leave?"
"Something like that, they were vague.  It was through a company so I couldn't really get much out of them.  Luckily a friend stepped up and watched them for me.	Oh man that sucks, I'm sorry you had to deal with that.  That sounds like it could have gone either way.  I'm glad you had someone who was able to step in and help out."
"I was tired last night and my wife was out of town, so I went to bed early.  I ended up lying with my dogs in bed for a while watching TV before falling asleep.	That sounds like a good night's rest, I'm glad you got to do that!"
"A wire haired dacshund and a shephard mix thing	Yeah that sounds nice. I bet they kept you awake!"
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a month and a half.  She gets back in a couple weeks, and it's getting tougher to wait.	That's really hard to do without her. I'm sure it's not easy to do alone."
"I do, every night.  It's still hard going from having someone around every day to never, but I'll get through.	I know how you feel.  I've been waiting on my girlfriend for 4 months.  It's hard not having anyone around, but it's worth it to have a girlfriend.  I just miss her a lot."
"My dad was cleaning out his attic when he found a box of my old stuff from childhood	That's pretty cool.  I bet he was happy to have found that."
"I did! He found my favorite childhood book of mine and I just sat there thinking about all the memories	That's really sweet. I'm glad he found it. Did you guys have a good time reminiscing about old times?"
"My wife is out of the country for school, and the other day she was having a really bad day.  I couldn't really do anything to help, and it made me feel bad.	That's nice of you.  How long were they away?"
"Thanks, that's actually really helpful.  It's been tough being apart for so long, we haven't been apart more than a couple days since we started dating.	That is a good point.  I'm glad you were able to help.  It's always hard being apart.  I hope she has a good trip.  I hope it is not too stressful.  I hope she doesn't have any bad health problems."
"I almost got into a fight the other day at a store.	Oh no, that sounds really scary! What happened exactly?"
"A guy budged in front of some other people, I confronted him about it, and we got into an extremely heated exchange.	Oh man that sounds so bad."
"No, the guy eventually backed off and left, albeit not before he flipped me off a few times and called me numerous names.	For a while my husband was really sick with the flu	That's no good. Did he get better?"
"He is but I just felt so much love for him because there wasn't anything he could do	That is so nice. How long did he have it?"
"When people make me wait, i get really anxious	That's a common feeling! What happens when you do wait?"
"Not really, i just look at the clock and wait for the time to come and when they dont arrive in time i start getting anxious	I know what you mean. I'm a little anxious about that too."
"I love dogs very much they are always great companions	Yeah, I love dogs too. I have a dog."
"I got a puppy not to long ago and love him with all my heart	I love dogs, I have a couple. I'm a dog owner and I love them!"
"My cat broke her leg not too long ago and had to have surgery one it	That is terrible! Did you take her to a vet?"
"I was lucky cause I know my vet personally so I only paid 175 usd I was so scared for her	Oh that's so nice of you. I wish I had a vet like you. I'm not sure I could afford it either. I have two cats, Luna and Miko. I have to take them to a vet in the city that I don't really like. I wish I could afford to have them take them in for surgery. I hope they make it through the rest of the surgery okay."
"there was a shooting in a gas station near me i was really devastated	It's really bad. Did it happen recently?"
"im not sure but there was 2 victims i was devastated	I hope everyone is okay.  That is terrible.  I am sorry for your loss."
"I was sad when my dog died	That is sad, did you find out why?"
"I had him for 10 years. It's just so hard because he was my whole world	That sucks! What happened?"
"I am so lonely because I am all by myself	Oh, well, you should consider joining a club.  There are many clubs for people who like to do things on their own."
"I appreciate that. It's just tough because I go daily without talking to anyone. It's nice to talk to someone	I feel you. It's like I am the only person in the world. I am so glad to have you to talk to!"
"i was really jelous when i say my  neighboor had a new 2018 Bmw convertible	i love my car!  what is it?"
"yeah it is i wish i could have a car like that	that's cool"
"I am sad that my friends dont visit me	I know what that is like. It is hard to have friends who dont visit you."
"I don't have a car and they live far away	I feel you. I wish I lived closer. I've been living in a small town and my friends are in the city and I don't have any friends in the city."
"I am disgusted that my food didn't come out the way I wanted it	I am so sorry!  What happened?"
"It was burnt and not appealing	It's always a shame when food is burnt, but I hope the food was still edible."
"when i was young i hit a car on the parking lot and did not say anything'	That would have been very scary.  Did you hit a person?"
"i did not see any marks on the other car and was running late	i know what you mean.  I once hit a car in a parking lot and i was so scared.  I ran and i didn't see anyone"
"My sister is so caring, she took care of me when I was sick	I love my sister! She always looks out for us and makes sure we're okay!"
"That is so true. I am so very thankful	That's nice. I'm sorry to hear you're sick."
"I heard this god awful howling the other night at like 2am right outside my window	I would have been so scared!"
"It was! I was so scared to be honest with you! The worst part is that I don't own a dog either	Oh that's terrible, I hope no problems. Did you call the police?"
"I was surprised when my mom bought me a car	That's nice. What kind of car?"
"Its a ford mustang	That is a pretty cool car!"
"I am very ashamed in my family	I am sorry to hear that!"
"Because they never invite me to go places, and they never call me	I feel your pain.  I'm ashamed of my parents because I don't feel they call or text me as often as they should.  I feel like they're always so busy with their own problems that they forget about me!"
"I am disgusted because of my friends pulling pranks on me	It is always better to have a good laugh and not have to deal with someone being mean."
"I dont know. They have been my friends for so long but these pranks are just making me mad	I bet they are sorry.  Did they do anything to hurt you?"
"I was afraid when I got out of the movie theater	That is not a common reaction. What was wrong?"
"I was watching a horror film and then I had to walk home alone in the dark	That's not good! I hate walking in the dark!"
"I am very faithful that my family will make it home in time	I love to hear that. What is the reason you are so faithful?"
"They are in Cuba	That sounds like a really long trip. Are you sure you're ready for that?"
"I am terrified that my wife is going to leave me	Oh no!  What is wrong?"
"Because she is talking to other men behind my back	That is terrible. I hope she is not having an affair."
"I am sad that I won't get to see the movie I want to see	It is always disappointing to miss a movie you want to see.  I hope they release it soon."
"I wanted to see the First Purge	That is a pretty good movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy it"
"Because I didn't have a ride to the movies	We just got back from the beach two weeks ago. It was such a lovely vacation. We loved relaxing on the beach and just taking it easy.	That is so nice!"
"It was very nice. There was a day or two of rain, but mostly perfect weather!	Yeah that is great! I love the beach."
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December.	Oh wow! That sounds amazing. What cruise are you going on?"
"To the Caribbean Islands. We are going with another couple that we have been friends with for a very long time.	That sounds fun. What's the itinerary like?"
"Thanks, me too.	The other night I was just craving candy. I ate up all that we had!	Yeah that is a pretty common feeling, especially when it's a hot summer month!"
"Sometimes you just have to! It felt so great then but I hated it the next morning!	I understand. It can be hard to deal with when you have cravings that you don't want to satisfy."
"My husbands cancer free now!	I'm glad to hear. How long has he had it?"
"Congrats! We are hoping right now that nothing comes back but It's so happy	That is amazing! I am so happy for you guys!"
"I'm so frustrated with my husband. He dismantled the bathroom to do repairs and still hasn't completed them six months later!	I would be mad! What did he do?"
"He promised he would complete it within a month and since it's been so long, I called a contractor today!	That's terrible. What did he do with the bathroom?"
"I've got a job interview set up for next week and I'm really nervous!	I'm sure you'll be great, just be yourself."
"I hope so! I bought a couple books on preparing for interviews and I've done a couple mock interviews with a friend.	I hope you do well."
"My parents always argue and it pisses me off!	That sucks. Do they ever get along?"
"I have but they rarely listen. They act like children and it can get frustrating. What can you do?	I think you just have to roll your eyes and not pay attention to it."
"Sometimes life just gives you lemons. At an old job of mine, I had what will probably remain the worst performance review of my life.	That is terrible. I am so sorry to hear that."
"I'm not sure it was really about my performance at all. I was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there, and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved, and I would be answering phones.	I'm sorry that happened to you. What did you do next?"
"That's must be a relief for you.  I am assuming you have children?	I have 2 kids. They were in school for the first time. I was nervous about it."
"So I guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  Do you attend school?	Yes, my son is going to 9th. He's going to be in 8th now."
"Do you have something you are looking forward to?	My father passed away about 2 1/2 years ago. It was totally unexpected and really was very traumatic and hurtful to me. He was still quite young and my family and I had no idea he had a life threatening health issue.	It is sad to hear that he passed away."
"I was pretty close to my father and always lived close by. But, you always wish you had more time. But, the last words I said to him was that I loved him, and I'm grateful for that.	You must be so sad. I hope he is in a better place."
"Once when I was younger I went to a friends 16th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen	Oh no! That sounds so scary! What happened?"
"we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but I didn't see it.  It was a very clean door.  LOL.  Later on that night I won a door prize.  which was pretty funny]	That sounds pretty crazy. I've been lucky in my life too. But sometimes you don't realize how lucky you are until it happens.  I hope you win again!"
"My daughter caught me in a bad mood the other day and was being a bit argumentative. I lost my temper, yelled and really hurt her feelings. I felt bad that it happened.	That's terrible. I hope you can work things out with her."
"Yes, I was already not in a good mood, and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button. But, I knew I shouldn't have done it as soon as I saw the look in her eyes, I felt very bad.	It is good that you did not let it happen."
"You never know what someone else is going through, and looks can be deceiving. Like this old man that seemed like any other drunk.	That is true, people have a tendency to look like they are better than they really are."
"It was hard to tell honestly, but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic. He had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home, so I hailed him a cab and paid the driver $20.	That was kind of nice of you. You are a good person."
"We hadn't been to the beach and years and really wanting to go back for vacation. We were able to a few weeks ago and it was awesome. I was thrilled!	That's so cool. Did you go swimming?"
"It's was great. The weather was perfect most of the time, and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much. We were really hyped to go!	It was nice to relax and have some fun."
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped over a big cord. This led to me having one of those running falls, that seem to last forever! I wanted to disappear at that moment!	I know, it was so scary.  I felt like I was going to fall in a lake."
"Oh no, there were tons of people that noticed lol. I can laugh now, but not at that moment.	Oh man, I can imagine that was a scary experience."
"I lost a puppy recently and I'm still broken up about it.	I have never lost a pet before. How long did you have the puppy?"
"it's never going to be ok, but it will be a little less painful in time.	That is so sad. I lost a pet of mine too recently and it is very difficult."
"I'm sorry youve been there too.,	It's not fun when a 4 year old does something he shouldnt.	It can be. What happened?"
"Took a small toy, put it in his pocket. took it back to the store and made him return it.	That is so annoying.  He should be able to return it."
"Yea, he seems to get it now.	As a mom I sometimes sneak a sweet treat when I make it out alone.	I love that. What do you like to eat?"
"Still feel bad when I got an ice cream the other day	That's a nice treat!"
"I've had a rough week! The house has been a mess from my dogs and toddler. My husband hasn't been helping out much, its fustrating!	That is terrible, I hope you guys get it back on track soon."
"I'm not sure! He has been busy with work but also has been going out with friends a lot :(	I am sorry to hear that, I would have to do more to help out. I would start cleaning and organizing and help out more with your husband."
"My niece made me proud today, graduated from her nursing school.	That is a big accomplishment!"
"YEa, she's over come a lot for it.	That's awesome. I bet you're very proud."
"Since it was my birthday today, when I came home there was a big pink cake and flowers waiting for me :)	I'm glad it was your birthday. What did you do?"
"My husband! I did not see it coming at all, thought we were going to wait till the weekend to celebrate.	Oh wow, you are so lucky! I would be happy if my husband did that for me."
"We had to clean out our storage building because of roof damage. I found an old box of pictures!	That sounds like it was a lot of work! Did you have to go through the boxes?"
"My family and all kinds of old memories, birthdays, festivals, swimming, and other stuff	I can imagine how happy that must have made you feel!"
"It's so hot and our AC just broke. We had to open the windows to be able to sleep!	I'm sure it's not that hot in your area."
"The icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you	I am sorry to hear that, that's terrible.  I would have been scared.  I would have just gone outside and called an electrician and had them fix the AC.  That would have been a waste of my money.  I would have been scared of getting bitten.  I would not have gone back in until it was fixed.  I would not go to an electrician.  I would go to a hardware store and get some ice to fix it.  I"
"I'm so excited! My family and I are moving to a new state at the end of this year!	Oh wow, that's so cool! Where are you moving to?"
"That is nice. Having a better paying job is always good.	I can't wait for my family to get to this new place. It's going to be a lot different than the old one."
"I've got back in to running this week, I missed it! It's a great stress reliever!	That is really awesome! What's your goal?"
"I love to run, did Track and Field in High School! Right now I'm only running 3 miles till I build my stamina back up! What do you do for excersise?	Yeah I do a lot of yoga.  I'm a yoga teacher.  I love to run, but it's not my favorite thing to do anymore.  I'm trying to get back into it though.  It's good to get my heart rate back up and my blood flow back up!"
"You won't believe the day I've had! I got to sleep in this morning, I haven't done that in months!	It's nice to be able to do that!"
"Yes, my husband even cooked dinner for me today, and helped clean the house! He has been very helpful today.	Oh my gosh, I am so jealous. What is the plan for you?"
"This has been a great week! Well actually a great year for my family.	That is great to have a great year.  What have been the most great weeks you have had?"
"Thank you, my husband got two great job offers!	That is amazing. Congratulations to your husband."
"My daughter is growing up so fast!	That is so sad to hear."
"She is 4 and in Pre-school! She is doing so well learning how to share and also knows her colors!	That's awesome! What is her favorite thing?"
"I live in Central Texas, it rained and lightening stuck a house here and caused it to burn down!	Did anyone survive?"
"Yes, I hope the family is okay! No word yet if anyone got hurt.	That's terrible. It must have been terrifying."
"my baby is sleeping, my house is clean... it's just so nice and peaceful right now	Oh that sounds wonderful! I'm glad it's your baby and you're taking care of them!"
"i just hope tonight won't be that night when my baby wakes up every 30 minutes	I know what you're saying.  Sometimes I feel the same way, but I have to remind myself that I'm a mom and that's what I was put on this earth for, to be a mother and to take care of my child!"
"I feel like a failure, Im suppose to be on a diet but ate too much today!	I feel for you. What did you eat today?"
"Thanks, I keep telling myself to stick with it but its hard!	That's a great attitude to have. I know I did the same with my weight loss."
"I'm thinking about quitting my day job!	That's a bit of a scary decision. What do you do?"
"My boss has been unreasonable and a pain. He dosen't understand how much time I put into the company!	That's terrible.  You might want to look into other job opportunities."
"Tuesday I got to take my kids to the beach for the first time.	That sounds fun! What was it like?"
"We had a blast! I could barely contain myself on the trip there!	Oh, I love the beach!  How many kids did you take?"
"My new dog is doing so great, she was potty trained in a week!	Oh, wow.  I bet you're so proud of him!  I have two dogs, Luna and Jasper.  They're about 4 and 3 years old, so I'm pretty new to dog training.  I'm pretty happy with Luna's progress - she's a bit of a handful.  I'm trying to get Jasper to potty in the yard."
"She is a Jack Russell, she loves to cuddle in my lap.	Yeah, I have a dog too!  He's a little scamp.  He's a little bit of trouble, but he's my little buddy.  He's been potty training for a week now, but I still have to keep an eye on him.  He's a little scallywag!"
"i moved to a new house recently and miss my old one	That can be really tough! Did you move for work?"
"10 years, i hope i get to feel the same way i did in my old house	That's so sad! Did you move away from your old house?"
"i feel like i am the best player on my soccer team	That is great, what position?"
"yeah i do i am always the one that steps up in the game	i bet you are.  what position do you play?"
"I've been having anxiety attacks lately. Everything is great and suddenly i start thinking about something bad happening and i have a full blown anxiety attack over something that didn't even happen	I'm sorry you're having to go through this. Is this something you've been worried about lately?"
"no, it just started happening. I would say it started a couple of months ago. i will see a doctor in 2 weeks	That's awful. You are going to have a rough 2 weeks."
"We recently went on vacation and it made me feel reminiscent. It made me think of the last vacation I was able to spend with my father before he unexpectedly passed away.	I am sorry for your loss."
"Thank you. I don't think it matters how old you are when a parent passes away, it's very painful. The vacation did bring back great memories with him though.	That's a good point, I think it's a good thing to have a vacation to look back on. I hope you had a good trip."
"my friend can literally eat junk food all day long and stay skinny! She doesn't even work out. and here i am, eating healthy, working out and still loking fat	That is amazing. I have never been able to do that. I can barely eat healthy and then I end up eating junk food and eating it again the next day. I just feel like I'm a failure."
"that's true too! But i just wish i looked like her	I am sure she is not doing anything wrong."
"It was my birthday and My friend sent me a birthday card with a gift card in a mail... i never got it, somebody stole it! and we actually have a cluster mailbox so only i can open it. it means that usps worker stole it	Yeah, I would have felt bad."
"i did, the lady told me they can't do anything about it because it didn't have a tracking number.	That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what you must feel like. Did you get the card?"
"My cat was playing last nigh and brought it to me.	I love my cat. I have 2. They always play with me."
"Well, it wasn't one of his toys like I thought. It was a dead mouse	That is disgusting. I am so glad you were not hurt."
"my son just used a potty for the first time! he is only 16 months. i'm so proud of him	Oh wow. I bet you feel proud of him! That is a big step for him"
"I know! they  grow up so fast! I feel like i just gave a birth to him and look at him now	That's awesome! I'm so proud of you and your son too!"
"Sometimes things don't work out like you planned. It can be a real let down though.	I'm sure it is a bummer when that happens.  What did happen?"
"I got two tickets for a friend and I for a concert. The day of the show, it poured and no one got a refund.	I can understand that. I've been there."
"My family went on a road trip this week and had to stop at a gas station for the bathroom.	It must have been a bit uncomfortable."
"Well the bathroom seemed cleaned but the roaches told me otherwise.	I would be so grossed out by that!  Do you think the roaches had a special deal with the gas station?"
"It sounds crazy to say, but even though I was hit by a car on my bicycle, it could have been much worse.	That's crazy! I hope you're okay."
"I'm quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws). I am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!	I'm so sorry you were hurt! I can't even imagine being hurt that way!"
"It might be, but considering I'm 29 with an artificial hip as well, I've gotten used to being half metal.	Last semester was probably the largest challenge of my life. I go to school for electrical engineering, and I took 6 courses.	I am sorry. I am sorry for that."
"Oh my gosh then you know! I have to say though, it all came out in the wash - 4 As and 2 Bs!	I know right!  I am in school for the same thing.  I'm hoping to get good grades so that I can move forward.  I am a bit nervous though.  It's scary to think that you're in a new situation."
"Waiting for something to come in the mail can send me in to a tizzy. It's even worse when it's parts I need to finish a computer repair job.	I love when that happens, it's like the mail has come to the door."
"I did get it done in the end. It was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came.	It can be a little stressful, especially when it's something that could have gone wrong, but it usually turns out okay in the end."
"Have you ever lost control of your bowels as an adult?	That is a terrible feeling."
"Phew! I'm glad I am not the only one. Although for me, it happened in the middle of dinner at a small Vietnamese restaurant, and an employee walked in on me cleaning my pants in the sink!	That is so funny. I bet it was embarrassing."
"I went to a heavy metal music festival in Las Vegas a few years ago! I had fun, but to be honest it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster.	It sounds like fun, what kind of metal were you listening to?"
"I think it's because everybody can relate when it comes to live music. My girlfriend broke up with me the second day, but we had to stay in the same room.	Oh wow! That sounds really hard!"
"You know how sometimes things don't go as planned, but it feels like they turn out better in the end?	That is true, I had that experience with my kids. They are now in college and I am back home."
"You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event, but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend.	I know what you mean. I was supposed to go to a concert but it rained on the way there and I ended up having a great time."
"My father was having abdominal pain, so he went to the hospital and they discovered a tumor.	That's terrible! What kind of tumor is it?"
"It was cancerous, but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well. A few days later he passed away suddenly, with no exact cause of death.	That is terrible, I hope you are doing okay, my brother was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago and he is doing okay.  I hope your father is doing okay."
"I love it when the new star wars movies come out, seeing all those kids (and adults) dress up for the theater really takes me back!	That's cool. I love it too."
"I don't anymore, but when I was a kid, a friend and I dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of Episode I.	I have been thinking about it too! I have to get my kid to go to it with me."
"On our second date, my girlfriend and I stopped in a dive bar on our way back from the beach.	That is pretty sweet!  Did you get drunk?"
"Like a hole in the wall. Cheap drinks, sometimes a little dirty, but altogether relaxed - the opposite of snoody. They had a pool table and I showed her some tricks.	I'm glad you had a fun time, that sounds like a great spot!  Did you guys hit it up a few more nights?"
"Yeah, I should have just said that. Honestly though, my favorite places to drink.	Oh, I understand.  What kind of drink were it?"
"My father passed away a few years ago, but I still have my grandfather's watch that he gave to me.	That is nice!  I love the sentimental value of those kinds of things."
"I honestly hope to. Every time I look at it I remember the good times we had together.	Yeah, that's really cool, I bet you feel a lot of nostalgia from it"
"Hanging out with old flames can be tricky when you are in a committed exclusive relationship.	I know right, but sometimes I like to do the ""I love you's"" and ""I miss you""s."
"Actually, an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink. She made a pass at me, but I told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend.	I'm sure she was disappointed. But what about you?"
"going near hights really makes me scared	It's normal to feel scared when you are going up high."
"just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights	That's understandable. What are you afraid of?"
"During carnival season, there is a big rave at an undisclosed location in the middle of the night.	I'm a party animal. I'd be there too."
"They are a lot of fun! I must admit though, I was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down.	Oh no! That is terrible. I hope they didn't arrest anyone."
"Well, there were only two officers and a couple hundred of us. By the time we were all walking away from the warehouse, I was actually laughing.	my girl friend broke up with me about a month ago	That's terrible. Did she say why?"
"we where just not getting along, and did not h ave enough time to see each other	Yeah that is terrible. What was the reason?"
"yes we are	I was always terrified of haunted houses when I was little.	That is too bad. I have never heard of a haunted house."
"Glad I'm not the only one! My friend has a birthday in October and she wanted us to go to one as a group. I'm still not sure if I'll go,	It was scary for me too."
"My sister snores really hard every night it is getting really anoying	I'm sorry to hear that."
"well it is not really her fault it just makes me angry hahah	Oh yeah, I know that feeling.  She snores so loud it is like thunder.  It is so bad that it wakes me up.  It makes me feel like the house is going to collapse."
"My friend and I spotted a mini-gold course when we were coming back from the next state over.	Oh wow, what kind was it?"
"I know! We played a round and they let us play a second round for free!	That sounds like so much fun! What kind of course is it?"
"I feel excited about our upcoming baby shower	That is great news!  What is the baby's name?"
"I'm having a baby boy!	That sounds fun! Congratulations!"
"i am really exited for my vacation next summer	That's awesome! What are you going to do?"
"california, i really hope i get to go to universal studios	I love going to Universal Studios!"
"when she left for 3 weeks i was alone	Oh wow, that's a long time to be by yourself?"
"nothing at all. I was kinda depressed	That's not good. How did you find yourself alone?"
"My Calculus final was no joke! I started studying hard two weeks before the test.	I'm sorry, what did you get on that test?"
"Trust me it all paid off. When I went in to take the test, I was absolutely solid on the material.	That is awesome. You must be so proud of yourself!"
"Felt sad when she left for 3 weeks	It's a pity she has to leave."
"To see her family. It sucked though because my car had broken down.	That is sad. I hope you get your car fixed soon."
"I am happy with where we are now living	That's great! I'm so happy for you."
"A very nice complex with 3 pools!	I love it! What is the complex like?"
"I interviewed for a new job and the interview went really well.	That's good! What kind of job is it?"
"The interviewer made all the comments you'd expect from a good interview and seemed to respond well to my answers.	I would have been a bit surprised if the interview went well, but I'm glad it did!"
"Some people are just naturals. The first time I played pool with a friend of mine, she had to beat the guy running the table.	Yeah, I bet you were impressed by her skills."
"I shot so-so, but my friend ended up winning the table and beating 5 guys in a row.	Yeah, I love when that happens. I've been playing a little bit lately but I'm still a total novice."
"I didn't receive a scholarship in college that I really wanted despite being qualified for it.	I'm sorry that happened to you. What happened?"
"Yes, I'll still attend but the extra help would've been nice.	Yeah, scholarships can be tough to get and it's frustrating."
"I know things will work out in God's perfect timing	I am very optimistic, I believe everything will work out for the best."
"Yes I am. For everything we want for the baby to be gifted to us lol	Yeah that's true. I am excited for it to be done"
"My sister graduated from college after a long road of persistence and determination.	Yeah that's pretty cool! What did they study?"
"Yes, she is. My family and I are very happy with her accomplishments.	That is really nice."
"I like being alone, but not feeling bad when no one is around to talk to	That's good, I like being able to be alone, but not being lonely"
"It's true I do need my alone time	That's great. Do you like to go to the park or something?"
"Dog ate grass and then threw up	Oh no! That's not good!  Did you take it to the vet?"
"Well she was ok. Shouldn't have been so silly	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you take her to the vet?"
"I am so happy to be having a boy	That's great! What's the big surprise?"
"Thanks. Yes it is. I already got a crib and baby bath.	I have a baby shower coming up.  Do you think you're going?"
"When I was younger, I worked really hard to save up money for a car, but needed a bit more. But on my birthday, my parents paid the rest for me.	Oh my god that's nice of them, that's really cool."
"I agree. I really wanted to do it myself, but it's something I'll never forget.	I can see how that's a good memory."
"I recently went on my first international trip by myself.	That's a lot of courage to take. Where did you go?"
"To visit my family for about 3 weeks, I got married a few years ago and my husband and I live pretty far from them now.	I bet that was an exciting trip! Did you have a great time?"
"Yes, just very nerve racking dealing with the international flights and passport checks and security checks. Definitely an experience.	I was very proud of her for flying all by herself	That's awesome! What kind of flying is she?"
"Especially with 2 full suitcases	It's not easy to fly alone, especially if you are traveling with a lot of luggage."
"I don't generally trust people.	I don't trust people either. I'm not sure why, but I just don't trust them."
"Upbringing. Dad use to say never trust anyone before I left for school every morning	Oh that's terrible. What did you do?"
"You just can't trust people any more. My mechanic told me it was going to be $1000 to fix my Jeep.	Oh man, that's terrible!"
"Turns out, nothing much at all. A guy down the street got it running for $100.	Yeah that sounds like the kind of scam I would fall for."
"I am so happy that we're having a baby boy	That is so exciting!  Are you ready for motherhood?"
"Yes it is. I am over the moon	That's great news! Congratulations! How long until the baby is born?"
"I've just successfully completed my first international flight/trip by myself.	That's really cool. Where did you go?"
"Yes, I got to see my family so it was great! I had to be very organized. The flights and layovers were kind of intense.	It must have been a big stress. But you did it!"
"I was so sad to find out what she had done. Found it on her facebook message history..	That's awful, what did it happen?"
"She met up with her ex to return his t-shirt..	Oh no. Did she cheat on him?"
"I am currently expecting my first baby, it's a boy!	That's exciting. What are your plans?"
"October, right around the corner!	Oh, that's great! Congratulations! How long are you expecting to wait before meeting the baby?"
"I recently went tubing on a river with my girlfriend and her friends from college.	Yeah, it sounds like a lot of fun.  Did you guys have fun?"
"I had a blast! It's supposedly a four hour float but we were out there for eight!	I have never gone on one of those floats before. How did you feel about it?"
"My girlfriend's dog was a 17 year old Chihuahua who emerged from a bathroom at a party in 1999.	Oh wow. That's really interesting. Did she get a collar?"
"He just sort of showed up and no one knew where he came from. He passed away recently after running away from our friends farm and being struck by a car.	Yeah that's sad, but that's not surprising, dogs are old and can get sick or old too."
"I can't believe my girlfriend was still interested in me after she saw the slum I was living in.	Yeah it is hard when people don't understand you and you're still interested."
"Something like that. My room was in shambles and the house was falling apart! I was mortified when she asked to come inside.	Oh my, I would have been too.  That is horrible.  How did you deal with that?"
"Once after a night on the town, I came home and my room had been ransacked.	Oh wow. Did you call the police?"
"The thing is, my alcoholic room mate was the culprit. He had even thrown some of my belongings in the bathtub!	Oh wow. That's a terrible thing. I'm sorry he did that."
"I am expecting my first child. It is going to be a boy! We are preparing the nursery and getting everything in order for his arrival!	That's so exciting! Are you sure it will be a boy?"
"Yes, it is!	Oh, I hope you have a boy too, but if he's a girl, I don't mind!"
"A few months back, one of my girlfriend's close friends died from a heroin overdose.	Oh no. I'm so sorry.  How are she doing?"
"I only met him a few times, but he touched a lot of people's lives.	That's really sad. What happened?"
"An extremely timid girl in my physics class invited the class to see her band play at a bar downtown.	That's cool, I've been in the band myself."
"I actually went last Friday night. Turns out she is an incredible guitarist - a real shredder!	Oh my, I would have been terrified!"
"I am pretty sure everyone is scared of being trapped in an elevator, and I can confirm it's quite a shock.	I'm not a big elevator fan either."
"Yes just a couple weeks ago. The elevator screeched to a halt and the lights went out, and I have to confess I screamed.	That is pretty wild."
"I thank God every day for the many blessings. Especially our new home	It is always a blessing to have a place of our own. I wish I could afford it, but unfortunately I'm a bit short on the cash."
"5 months ago now. It's really nice here, there are 3 swimming pools	I'm sure that's wonderful. I'm glad you're happy."
"Right after I had my baby, my husband worked second shift, so he didn't get home until around 2am.	That must have been really stressful."
"Yeah, but it wasn't really a problem, until one night around 11pm. I was changing her diaper. The changing table was in front of a window, and I could hear people running up and down the porch in front of the window and they were banging on the house.	I can imagine! Did you call 911?"
"I'm not sure. Doors and windows were locked, but I was so relieved when my husband got home.	I'm a youth leader, and just the other day a teen from the group was asked to speak at a local church.	That's awesome. What did he say?"
"He was nervous, he has to prepare an original message. He did really good, and he really showed and understanding of the bible.	I am sure he did great.  I am sure you are a great leader too."
"Thank you.	I get so mad when I have to repeat myself	I know the feeling. Sometimes it's hard to find the right words!"
"I know. But it makes me stressed out	I'm sure it does."
"Hello ... today I am happy, we go with my children to the movies and then to eat pizza	That is so nice! What movies are they watching?"
"The incredible ... they love ... it's going to be fun	That's a fun family activity!"
"Thank you very much and you too..	Graduating from college was a load off my shoulders.	Yeah I am glad you are so happy"
"Thanks, it was a long journey.	That is awesome, what are you planning to do now?"
"I was turned down for a job I really thought I'd be a good fit at.	I know. I was really upset."
"Someone else interviewed who had much more experience than I did.	Oh well, that's okay. You should try to find another job."
"I went to a sketchy part of town once. Just being there put me on edge.	That is so terrible!"
"It was for work so I had to do it, but I typically avoid those places as well	That's good. You must have had a bad experience."
"We went to a friend's house the other day for dinner. I was helping her cook. I was following the directions of a recipe and accidentally cracked her baking dish.	I'm sure it was not a big deal."
"Yes, I did, but she wouldn't even hear of it. She told me it was fine.	I would be upset.  Did she not hear?  She should be.  That dish is very expensive."
"I am looking forward to moving into a easy place to take care of.	That is great! Where you moving?"
"No, not moving soon, only wanting to and looking around to see what is affordable.	That sounds like you are looking forward to it.  What are you looking to move into?"
"So I had an emergency come up for my family and I had enough money to cover it. I feel great for preparing!	That's great. What was the emergency?"
"Definitely! And they are paying me back, so it isn't like I'm losing money either.	I love that! I wish I could be that prepared for emergencies."
"I drank a lot of alcohol at my friend's BBQ party, and I ended up puking and passing out. Not my finest moment.	I'm sure it was a bad moment."
"Hahahaha! Well, I guess we can make light of even our worst moments.	That's funny, but what was it that you did at that party?"
"My eldest son just graduated High School I was so proud.	I'm glad he graduated. How did he do?"
"It's kind of a surreal feeling tho, hard to accept that he is grown.  Now college is about to start.	That's awesome. What is your son studying for?"
"The time just flys by doesn't it?  It hard to imagine that they dont need you so much anymore.	So a customer just came into my work and started yelling at me for something that wasn't my fault. I hate when people do that!	Oh, I know. I hate when they do that too."
"No, I didn't yell back haha. I would get fired.	I would have. That's not how you handle it."
"Retail, yep.	It makes me angry when people never notice me	Oh, I'm sorry. What makes it angry?"
"Everything. I don't have friends so it's nice to get noticed	That is true, people often think they have more friends than they actually do."
"I get excited when I go swimming	That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of swimming?"
"The fact of relaxing in a large pool of water. It just grabs my attention	Oh, that sounds fun! I love swimming too, but it's a lot of getting in and out. I don't get excited like you do."
"My wife wasn't feeling so well, so I took care of her and made her some soup <3	That is very sweet of you, I am sure she appreciated that"
"She is much better now! I love her so much, so I try to take good care of her.	It's nice to be able to help your wife."
"I am so grateful to my family	That's nice. How many?"
"They help me with whatever I need and they are always their for me.	I know how that feels! I'm a bit jealous, but at least they're good for you. How old are they?"
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a party	Oh yeah? What kind of party?"
"It really was. I am pretty thankful for them	I am sure you were. What kind of party was it?"
"A big wind storm blew through town and uprooted one of the trees in my yard.	It sounds like a lot of damage was done. Did you have any damage to your home as a result?"
"No, but that was my fear. I kept waiting to hear the sound of a branch or tree hitting my roof, or breaking glass.	I'm glad it didn't happen.  I don't think I could handle it."
"I took my dog to an agility competition and she ended up winning first place!	It sounds like she was very good! How old is she?"
"Thanks so much! It did, but she's so hard-working and I couldn't have done it without her.	That's so cool! How old was she?"
"I was sad when my parents left me	It's okay. You're not alone."
"I stay with my older sister now	Yeah I have done that. It's hard."
"My brother got a really high-paying job and now spends all his time flaunting his money.	That is sad. Is he not happy with his new job?"
"Not very well! I mostly just stew and complain about it and wish I had his money and lifestyle.	I am sorry to hear. I think you have every right to be upset. You are his sibling after all."
"I was disgusted when my food had a hair in it	I hate when food has something in it that I don't know where it came from!"
"Yeah I got a refund. They were very sorry about it and I forgave them	Oh wow! That's pretty disgusting! What kind of food was it?"
"I was anxious when I went to the theme park	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have fun?"
"The roller coasters	That's a fun experience! What was your favorite one to ride?"
"I was furious when my friend made fun of me in front of random strangers.	That's terrible. Did you tell him how to feel about making fun of others?"
"I am not sure. He told me he was sorry afterwards but I didn't listen to him	That's not very good of a friend to do that, but I guess he was trying to apologize."
"I feel so lonely because I have no friends	Oh, I know how you feel."
"I haven't. Im too shy and I am scared of what people will say	I understand.  Do you have to go to any parties?  If so, you should try to be more outgoing.  You might find it easier for others to talk to if you do so."
"I was jealous when my girlfriend was talking to other guys	Oh that? What did they do?"
"I do not. I have trust issues	Oh, that's not good.  Why do you feel that?"
"I was terrified when I watched that horror film in the theaters	That's a good movie, I'm sorry to hear that you were afraid."
"I did but it was really a challenge for me.	Yeah, I'm not sure what I would have done if I was in the same situation as you."
"I was sad when my dad died	It was sad for you too. I'm so sorry you had to go through that."
"It happened 3 weeks ago	That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.  I know it can be hard."
"I was sad when my wife left me	I'm sorry to hear that.  Did she leave for a trip or something?"
"I just dont know why she would marry me then.	That's terrible. Did she leave because you were not good enough?"
"My family and I went to the beach on Tues and spent the whole day there.	That's a great time to spend with the family."
"One small thunderstorm but other than that great! I'm amazed I didn't really get burnt!	I bet! I've never been."
"When someone talks down to me, it makes me sad	That is terrible.  What happens when people talk down to you?"
"I am just too shy to say anything. I dont know how	I feel you, I'm a shy person too.  What do you think you could say?"
"I am super joyful when my family comes together to eat dinner	It's great when family members come together, it's always nice to have a time together"
"Usually once a week. Its a great feeling	That is so nice. It is always a good time when you are with your family."
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a big party	I love parties! What did you get for your birthday?"
"It was. I had a great time	Oh wow, what happened?  Did they not know you were going to be so happy?"
"I am so annoyed that people are so mean to other people	Oh, I know.  I hate it when people are mean."
"That is so true! I dont know where this world is heading.	I agree.  I have never seen people being mean to others.  They should just be kind and respectful."
"I get so jealous when my parents don't pay me any attention.	That is understandable, but you could try talking to them about it"
"I haven't because I don't know how to start that conversation.	Oh, yeah, I've been there.  How do you start?"
"I was furious when my dog ate the wires to my Television	That is horrible."
"Yeah but it will take a few days because I have to wait for my paycheck	That is horrible.  What is wrong with your dog?"
"So what happens in the middle of the night? I got woken, again, by my upstairs neighbor thumping around. Does she have to be so rude?!	I would have told her to keep quiet. I would have asked her if she was okay. If not, then I would call the police. I wouldn't let it disturb me. I am not sure how long she has been doing this, and it's been at least 2 or more nights."
"No, they don't. Well, this time I've had enough. I've told management I want into another apartment and explained exactly why!	I know right, that's crazy! I'm sorry to hear that you're having to deal with this."
"Not really, but the alternative is to go slowly mad. These blessed individuals stomp around day and night, screeching into their cellphones - they're horrible.	I am a very trusting person. It gets me in trouble sometimes.	That is good, you are not afraid to let someone in your life that you don't trust."
"People take advantage of me	Oh man. I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of stuff do you mean?"
"I'm only 6 months away from having my AA in Healthcare Administration.	That's a big achievement. You should be proud of yourself."
"I really am, I can't wait to start my new career!	It's great that you're working towards your goal. I'm sure you'll be successful."
"Going to the dentist always has me on edge. I hate it!	Oh yeah. What's the problem with the teeth?"
"I know...it's a necessary evil. But it hurts so much!	That is so true! It is like, you know it's coming, but you don't want it to come."
"One of my very dear friends got his dream job recently. He was so diligent in finding information and contacts. I so respect what he's achieved.	Oh that's great!  How did he end up there?"
"Well, it takes perseverance and a bit of luck, but you can do it!	I can see why he's got a job."
"Lol, you and me both. You could always marry a Kardashian!	Yeah, I know right. They're all super rich and famous. I just don't really care about that part of life, I'd rather be doing my own thing."
"Or someone not quite so objectionable :) Seriously though, I'm so happy for K with his new job.	We started watching a Red Sox game near the end and they were losing. Next thing you know, they were ahead four runs.	That sounds like fun! What happened?"
"Yes, usually I think so too. But this was really fun to watch and we were so happy because it did not look good at first.	Oh that sounds fun! What happened after?"
"My car that I hate is going to die soon and I'll be able to get a new one. Score!	That's awesome. What kind of car is it?"
"I'm thinking something reliable. Maybe a toyota or mazda.	That's awesome!  I've always been a Toyota fan.  I've got a 1993 Toyota Camry.  It's been with me for 15 years.  It just broke down on me last week.  It's a real pain to fix!  I'm thinking of trading it in for something new.  What car are you going with?"
"Yesterday my husband opened a window and a HUGE black bug flew in!! I almost died!!	That is so gross. I don't know what to do with bugs. I would freak out if I saw one like that!"
"heck no, i told my husband to deal with it. i ran in my bedroom and locked the door	That is disgusting, what kind of bug was it?"
"Well, don't you know, one of my neighbors who works for AA was in San Francisco recently and saw some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). So she bought some and brought it to me. How nice of her to do that!	That is so sweet!  What kind of cheese was it?"
"This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.	That's really nice of her! I'm glad you got to try the cheese!"
"Ooh, I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?	That's cool! I've never had a cheddar from Tillamook before."
"I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me. I'm in NC, where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!	It's a good idea to check out the website for more information."
"my brother would've turned 34 today. he died 2 years ago and It still hurts so much	I am sorry about your loss. I hope you are able to move on."
"yes we were. He moved to the different country but we spoke pretty often	I am so sorry for your loss."
"I had planned to go to the beach with friends, but it looks like it's going to rain.	Oh no, I hate when the weather doesn't cooperate."
"Nah, it said there's be thunder and lightning, so looks like we're stuck inside :(	That is a shame, you should have checked before you went"
"I spent last weekend with most of my family, they live out of state and i don't see them often.	Oh, that sounds like fun. Did you all have fun together?"
"I did, Yes. Work has been hectic lately so i was really looking forward to unwinding with them.	Yeah that's cool. I'm sure it was fun for you."
"We ate good food, drank wine and went swimming.	I am sure it was good."
"It was, kind of hot but not enough to complain about.	That sounds like a great time.  How long have you guys been together?"
"I hate how our country is so divided right now	I agree. It's hard to see the good in some people's attitudes."
"True. I hope we can become less divided in the future and solve things	Yeah I agree.  I think we need to focus on the things we have in common and not so much on the differences."
"My father passed away about 2 years ago. It was so very difficult for me and very unexpected. We didn't know he had a life-threatening illness and weren't prepared in any way for his sudden departure from us.	Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm so sorry that you have to go through that. I know it's hard to even say the word."
"Yes, my family and I are close and we were there for each other. But, my sister had passed away around 6 years before, by committed suicide. The last few years have been very difficult.	Oh my. I am sorry to hear that. I am glad that you have each other to support each other through this difficult time."
"I feel like a terrible sibling right now.	I am sure you were a great sibling."
"My sister, who lives out of state and i don't see often, was recently in town visiting our dad. I didn't visit with them.	Oh, I bet she was really sad about that. Did you call and apologize for not visiting?"
"I am going to a concert very soon.	I love live music.  Is this one of your favorites?"
"Imagine Dragon and Grace Vanderwhall, do you know them?	I do not. I will have to look up their music. I am not familiar with either of these bands."
"Yes she was.	Our new property management person is remarkably efficient. She emailed me details of a conversation we had yesterday. The others promise the earth and don't deliver!	It sounds like your property management is doing a pretty great job."
"It is. I've been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it.	I hope you find a place you can call home soon! I hope you can get your issues with the management company resolved soon."
"Absolutely! I move September 1st. No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!	School for my kids started again this past Thursday.	It is a lot of work, but it is a lot of fun."
"It was good. I am dealing with a mixture of both emotions about them being back in school. I was happy I had all the supplies, clothes, shoes, and other odds and ends in time.	It is good for them to go back to school.  I know how that can feel."
"I had planned a beach trip about a month before we actually went.	I bet it was fun."
"We went to Virginia Beach earlier this week. I was so giddy up that whole month I could barely contain myself.	That is so exciting! What did you do?"
"My husband, 2 kids and my mother. My kids had never been to the beach.	That sounds like a lot of fun! What did you do there?"
"I bought a ticket last week for the lottery, when it was over 100 million dollars.	That is crazy! I bet on it."
"I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn, but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.	That's awesome, but I'm still waiting to hear if I'll win."
"True, but it would be fun spending that money.	My husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! This was unexpected and great news	That's so awesome!  Congratulations!  How long will it be for?"
"It sure does. It came as a shock, but a pleasant one.	It's always nice to see that the hardworking people in our world get to have a little bit of a reward"
"I just went today to visit my son in his new house.	It sounds like you have a son.  That's a big accomplishment."
"It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it.	That sounds great! How long has your son been looking to buy the house?"
"So tonight we are suppose to go eat out as a family but I cant get a single one of my family members to agree on a place.  So frustrating!	That is terrible. What kind of places do you eat?"
"That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.	I can't understand why you guys can't agree on anything. I've tried to be patient, but it's getting so frustrating."
"Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.	I'm not sure what you mean by that.  You want to sue for making PB&J.  That is a pretty silly idea."
"I guess that way the wallet wins every once and awhile too!  lol	I'm so happy that it is Friday!	Oh yeah. I'm happy it's Friday too, I don't know why we don't have a day off more often."
"Somewhat, I work 4 10 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. Yesterday was my off day. What about you?	That is great news!  I am also off today.  I work a lot and have no one around me.  I am a little happy.  Friday is a good time.  Friday, I'm a little sad."
"feels disappointed because my friend fights with me	Yeah, that's a pretty common problem with friends.  What did they fight about?"
"no i can't because i love him a lot	That's understandable, it is hard to deal with someone you care about, but you should try to find ways to make your relationship work."
"I have Lupus and it is getting worse.  I asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet I found that is suppose to help me with it.	I have lupus as well and I am trying to get my diet to be more healthy."
"yes, but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun	I hope it works for you! I'm sorry to hear that."
"Some time ago, there was a terrible tornado that came through my city. It destroyed many homes, a school and some people died. I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it, or harm my familY!	Oh wow that must have been so terrifying.  I'm glad you are safe.  What city was it in?"
"No, they are so awful! They can destroy so much.	Yeah, I've seen some terrible tornadoes. I hope you're okay."
"My husband took me to get a new wedding band recently	That's awesome! I'm in a similar situation."
"I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.	It sounds like you are very happy."
"I love the holidays. Driving around looking at decoration is my favorite.	That is so fun. I love decorating the house with the family."
"Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.	That's nice. I love the holiday too, especially Christmas."
"I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her	That's great! What do you do with your sister-in-law?"
"I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.	That is great. What kind of person is she?"
"A few weeks ago, we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But, it rained several days, so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted, which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.	It's always a bummer when the weather doesn't cooperate.  I'm sorry that happened.  I hope you get to go back soon.  It's always better when it's sunny."
"Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So, a long time since we first went.	It's a good thing that it rained. I'm sure you'll go again soon!"
"My husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting	I hope you both get what you want!"
"I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.	I am glad he got the promotion."
"We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man, so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.	That is nice! It is good to be kind to people.  I would never do something like that."
"We didn't have much choice, as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat, so if we didn't, we'd come back to not having pets. But, I wouldn't just let anybody, that's for sure!	Oh, that's a little creepy.  I'm sorry you had to go through that.  I can understand why you would be a little uncomfortable."
"My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell	That must have made you feel bad.  Did you tell her?"
"I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things	That is really bad. What did she tell you?"
"One night when my children and I came home, I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!	That's terrifying. What was inside?"
"It was so scary! Luckily, it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up, but it first appeared to be an intruder!	That is a funny story. Did you call the police?"
"Last weekend, my family and I enjoyed a nice meal together, and then watched a movie. It was a relaxing time at home, just enjoying each other's company.	That sounds like a great time!"
"Yes, it was drama free and a relaxing time.	I'm sorry that happened to you.  Did you guys watch a movie about drama?"
"My dog, riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure	Oh no, that is so sad. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I know how much you love your pet."
"It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps	That must have been hard for you, I know how much you love your dogs."
"I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me. She was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support, and that's why I didn't tell her. But, I still felt so bad about it.	That is very kind of you, it would have been nice if she knew."
"Well, she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job, plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.	That was very kind of you."
"I am trying a new diet to treat my Lupus.	I have lupus, it's a real pain in the neck!"
"I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take	I hope it works out for you."
"There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments, so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating, since it causes others more work.	That's terrible. You need to tell him to stop."
"Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over, but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!	It's like she thinks it's an accident or she's doing it on purpose."
"My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning, and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.	That is awful! I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yes, she was only about 9, and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!	That's terrible!"
"I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.	Oh wow, that's awesome! How much did you win?"
"Not normally, so I was quite surprised.	Did you win the jackpot?"
"$1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.	That's awesome, how much did it cost you to get the money?"
"Thank you, that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out.	I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day.	That's a bad experience. Did you get your money back?"
"Someone backed into my new car.	Oh my gosh that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. I would have gotten so upset."
"Yes, they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it.	Many years ago, we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her, but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!	I bet. Did you tell him that it was wrong?"
"Well, she was attractive and at the time, I thought he was thinking that too. But, I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, since she was falling down. But, it was hard to see it at that time lol	I know that feeling well! It can be hard to see the bigger picture, but you should never let your emotions get you into a situation where it's bad. You should be the voice that helps her!"
"I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.	Oh, I hope it wasn't anything bad! Did you check if it was a scam?"
"Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night.	I'm sorry to hear that, did anyone get your mail?"
"Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.	That's terrible, I hope the person who did that is held accountable."
"That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.	That is true, but you never know."
"My aunt came to visit today, we went out for mexican food!	I love mexican food, it's one of my favorite foods. What was your favorite part?"
"Yes, kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours, she is on a road trip!	That is nice of her to come visit. I hope she had a great time and a safe trip."
"I have a big exam for college coming up, I have been studying day and night.	I am sure you are going to crush it."
"It is for my molecular biology class, I feel pretty good that I am going to Ace it.	It is a great feeling to know you are prepared!"
"I went and saw a hockey game today, It was really exciting.	That sounds like fun. Did you like it?"
"No, I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool.	That was fun! Did you get to meet any hockey players?"
"I was on a run today, and saw a loose dog but couldn't catch it before it ran off!	That is terrible! I hate when that happens!"
"Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!	I would've been worried about it too, I hate seeing animals running around without a leash.  It was a nice run and I would've wanted to see the dog but it was too fast and it ran off!  I'm sure the dog is now running around the city!"
"I got some bad news today, my dad passed away.	It's tough, but it will get better.  You can't stay down for long."
"Thank you, I am a mess. It is still hasn't hit me that he passed away.	That is terrible news, I am sorry for your loss."
"Its so quiet in my house, my husband is out of town for work.	I bet it gets a little lonely.  Is he gone for long periods of time?"
"True, I'm trying but keep hearing creepy noises. Guess I need to turn the TV up louder haha	That is not a good sign. I would get out of your house as fast as you can!"
"I got some great news today! My husband got a better paying job offer!	That's great! I'm so happy for you!"
"Not sure yet, but itll help us life more comforatbly! We move to his hometown in November when he gets out of Army!	Well that's good for him and for you!"
"My daughter is in highschool but took a college course this summer and got an A!	That's really nice of you, what course was it?"
"That is very good. You should be proud of her.	I ate way too many sweets today!	I know the feeling. What kind?"
"Thanks! Being on a diet is hard, espically with family in town!	I know, I feel the same way, but I have a lot of family around."
"I was running today and felt like this car was following me..	I bet you felt that way.  Did you see anyone else?"
"Yes it was, I think I need to start carrying pepper spray or something	I hate when people do that. I hope you didn't get into an accident!"
"Im watching the show The Bold Type, my favourtie characters dad died :(	I am so sorry to hear that.  I have never seen it but I have seen some of the episodes.  It's a very good show."
"Yes, it's a great girly drama! Reminds me of Sex in the City but Modern.	I haven't seen the show yet but I've heard it's a good one. I'll definitely watch it."
"It's been a great night! I'm just relaxing with a cold drink and my favourite show!	That is the best. What is the show?"
"Yes defenitly, It dosen't get better then this! My daughter has been fast asleep since 8pm.	Yeah that sounds good. I hope you guys are both happy!"
"My family is moving from Texas to Arkansas in a few months, Im worried for the change.	Oh no. Are you moving to the south?"
"My husband is getting out of the Army and moving back to his hometown where he has a few job offers! Big changes coming..	Oh no, I hope everything goes well for you and your family."
"I recently moved into a new home.	I'm sorry to hear that. I bet it's not fun!"
"Yes, there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with.	That's great! What kind of kids are there?"
"We had been saving for 4 years to buy a bigger house. We had outgrown our other home.	I had a doctors appointment today.	It was necessary?"
"I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back.	That's terrible, did you get to see them?"
"I agree! Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever.	I had just moved in to my new apartment, and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door.	That's so cute! I bet you had to feed him a lot!"
"At first I tried to resist, but I ended up adopting him!	I love animals. I'm sure he was lonely."
"I received a wrong number call last night at 2 in the morning.	That is so creepy. Did you answer it?"
"Yes! It was so aggravating. They would not believe me when I kept telling them it was the wrong number.	That's not good. Did you try to call back?"
"She did twice before she finally believe me that there was no Bret there.	I recently found out that I am having baby number 4.	That's so exciting! What's your name?"
"Wow! That is great. We were thrilled because we didn't know if we were going to have anymore and nature just decided for us.	That is great! Congratulations!"
"Yes they are. They make life worth living.	Halloween is quite a big holiday where I live. People get really in to their costumes!	It's always fun to dress up in costume. I like to dress up in a costume for Halloween, but my costume for Halloween was the only thing my kids were excited to wear."
"It's peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining. Last year I went as a plague doctor, and everyone agreed it was terrifying!	I have a great sense of humor, so I love Halloween costumes."
"Last year we lost our home of 20 years to a house fire.	Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I've lost my home twice in my lifetime, and it was my home. It's so hard to see your home go up in smoke and ashes."
"Yes, thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened.	That is terrible. I am so sorry that happened to you."
"No, we just bought another house closer to town. It was sad losing everything that we had.	When me and my friend got lost in the desert, I thought we were done for.	Oh no, how did you escape?"
"Only a couple of hours. We flagged down an old Chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out.	I am glad you were okay!"
"I went tonight to meet my daughters teacher.	It's always a little nerve-wracking when you meet the teacher of a child."
"Yes, I think she will be a great teacher. She showed us her plan for the year and I think it was great.	That's great.  I hope you all have a good year.  I am sure you will."
"Thanks so much. I completely agree.	I just finished watching the Saw movie.	I've heard that one was pretty bad."
"I hated it! I didn't want to watch it but my husband did. The gore is just too much!	That's too bad, I've been in the same situation. I didn't like it, but I was a kid and I loved horror movies."
"Yep! I feel kind of sick to my stomach now from watching it.	I recently went down memory lane was looked at all my high school yearbooks.	I love high school year books. What was your favorite year?"
"Well.... maybe not as awesome. lol But I do try to keep in shape. It was good seeing all my old friends.	I am sorry you were not happy with the memories of your school days."
"I do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch.	That sucks. I've lost a few friends over time too. I'm not as good of a dancer as I used to be."
"That's a good idea!	Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how it is when you lose touch. I hope they stay in touch."
"I had this guy flag me down today after leaving the store.	That is pretty cool. What did he do?"
"I was scared at first and then he hollered and pointed to the top of my car and I had left my purse on it. Boy, did my face get red.	That sounds scary. Did you get it back?"
"My daughter just bought her first car on her own.	It sounds like she is growing up to be a great person!"
"It's a 2008 Mustang. She worked the last two summers to buy it.	That is awesome! I'm so proud of you for her hard work!"
"She is super excited to start school now and show it off.	I'm leaving tomorrow to go on vacation!	That's exciting.  What are you doing on vacation?"
"We are going to Daytona and Orlando for 10 days.	It's going to be a great time! I've never been to Daytona."
"I sure hope so! We've been planning this trip for a year.	I love Daytona!"
"My husband and I have a fun weekend trip planned soon. We are going to go to the casino for the weekend, just the two of us. We are really looking forward to it.	That's fun! I'm sure you will have a good time! What kind of casino will you be going to?"
"Yes, it's been awhile since we had just some time for us. Plus, we love Blackjack!	I love Blackjack as well, I'm glad you guys are going to have some fun!"
"I have a very good friend and her live-in boyfriend of 5 years hit on me! I'm married, and he didn't care. He sickens me!	That sucks. I would not have reacted that way."
"Yes, I was really surprised and I find it terrible behavior.	That sounds terrible. Did you try talking to them about it?"
"We went on a vacation a few weeks ago, and it really made me think back to our last vacation. It was with my father, the last one before he passed away.	I am sorry about your father. What kind of vacation were you on?"
"I did, but of course, wished I had more time. He passed away unexpectedly, so I was going over that vacation in my mind too. I miss him.	That sounds sad, but it sounds like it was a good trip."
"I was pleasantly shocked the other day when I won on a lottery ticket! I hardly ever win and I won $200!	That's awesome! I love winning lottery."
"I just tucked it back for a rainy day. But, I may splurge with it this weekend, since it was unexpected.	I'm so happy for you, you must be so relieved. I have a lottery ticket too and I haven't won anything yet."
"My husband sure did surprise me with his handiness and hard work around the house last week. He was able to accomplish so much work in a few days!	That's awesome! What did he do?"
"Ok	I was the first person to receive a pretigious award at my college after years of the award being on offer.	That sounds amazing, what award was it?"
"At the department office back at the school.	I hope you got to enjoy your prize."
"One of my coworkers really ticked me off one day. She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!	I hate when that happens, it makes you mad and want to do it yourself."
"Yes, she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her, and it was her work! I let her know it too.	That sounds like she was trying to get away with something she didn't."
"One year my cousin wasn't going to get her young son anything for Christmas. It broke my heart so my husband and I bought his Santa gifts that year.	That's nice of you guys! I'm sure your son appreciated the gift."
"The little guy deserved a Christmas and we really loved him.	Oh, that's so sweet. What was he little for?"
"When I went to the fair last year, I tripped on a large cord they had going across the walkway. It was a long, running fall! I wanted to hide!	It must have been scary. Did you get hurt?"
"Scuffed knees, but mainly my pride. I was also in front an attractive guy I knew so it was even worse.	Oh, that is a funny story.  Did he ever find out?"
"My husband and I are at a point in our lives, we are able to save, afford all that we need and save for retirement. I'm so appreciate we can, as I know many aren't able to do that.	I can only dream of that!"
"Yes, we have been working hard, as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times. But, it's worth having some financial freedom!	I am glad to hear that you guys have that financial stability"
"One day at work while I was pregnant, I fell! Luckily, the baby and I weren't hurt, but I wanted to waddle away so fast!	That's crazy!  I've never fallen like that!"
"Yes, it really was quite so!	That's crazy! I'm sure the baby was so excited to meet you!"
"There are times I feel a bit alone and down. My husband has to travel out of town for work quite often.	It can be lonely when you are married to one person. I'm sure you miss him!"
"Well, yes, of course. But, that isn't quite the same, is it.	I am sure it's not the same as having someone with whom you share life."
"My children recently started school again and it made me feel a bit apprehensive. They are growing up so quick, and I know it won't be long before they sadly move out of the house :(	I can't wait for them to be older and move out, but it's hard to let go of them as they grow older.  I hope they stay close.  How old are they?  Are they in elementary, middle, or high school?  How old are they?"
"For sure! But, it flies by before you know it. I get my nerves on edge when I think about them all moved out of the house.	I am glad they are moving out of the house."
"Despite working until a few hours before, I scored highly on the ACT the first time I took it back in high school years ago.	That's awesome! Did you take it at least twice more?"
"Thanks. I thought I'd do poorly because I was tired.	It's good that you were tired. I'm not a fan of taking exams, but I guess that's what you have to do."
"Not that long ago, my husband planned a secret trip for us! I didn't have a clue he was doing it and was pleasantly shocked. It was so much fun!	It was so sweet! Did you go on a cruise or something?"
"We just took a weekend trip to Tunica, MS. We stayed at a really nice casino hotel and just played some Blackjack, enjoyed good food and each other's company!	That is nice. What was your favorite part of the trip?"
"I lied to my mother one day about where I was going. It made me feel pretty bad and have a bad conscience.	I would feel the same way.  Did you apologize to her?"
"She didn't want me going with that friend, but I wanted to go, so I lied to her. I was much younger then.	I'm so sorry that you had to deal with that. I know that it's a hard lesson to learn but sometimes it's necessary to do what you think is right even if it's hard."
"I won a free trip to Florida. It's not the best vacation, but I'll take it for free.	That sounds like a good deal"
"I've been to Florida many times before so it wears on you.	I'm jealous.  Where in Florida do you plan on going?"
"I won a lottery for a small amount of money.	I love lottery tickets!  What kind of lottery was it?"
"No, I wish. It was only a few hundred dollars.	That would be nice, but it was only a few dollars."
"A good friend of mine moved away recently and we lost contact. I really wish we would still speak.	That sucks.  I have a good friend from college who moved away last year."
"That's a good idea. Maybe I'll try that soon.	I hope your friend calls you back."
"Someone was speeding on the road and I got into an accident with them. My car was totalled because of their carelessness.	That's horrible.  Did you get the person's license?"
"Yes, but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn't an enjoyable situation.	Oh, my god.  That is horrible.  I'm sorry to say this, but it's a miracle you are okay.  You must be so relieved.  I'm not even sure if I can ever go back to driving."
"I let a friend watch my dog for a week while I was out of town. I would've been devastated if anything happened to him.	That's a pretty bad situation.  How long were they watching?"
"I hope so. I've only had my dog for a short time and this is my first time away from him.	Oh that's so sad.  I hope everything was alright."
"I have been feeling great about life recently. My relationships have been going very well	That's great to hear. It's good to feel good about life. What kind of relationships?"
"I am not, but I have a person I am very fond of. Are you?	Yeah I am. I have been feeling great about life recently. My relationships have been going very well I am not, I just got out of a relationship that lasted for 6 years. I am looking forward to this new chapter of my life. I have a lot to be grateful for."
"I got a surprise gift in the mail yesterday.	I am happy for you, that's awesome!"
"A gorgeous vase. It's so pretty. I have no idea who sent it.	It was my sister! I was so happy. I was expecting something from my boyfriend, but it was my sister."
"Yes, I love flowers. I can't wait to fill it up.	My sister broke my vase. I was pretty enraged!	That is terrible. Did you talk to her?"
"I scolded her but then told her it was okay, but it's not the biggest deal!	Yeah, it's the little things that can be really annoying."
"I'm am upset today because my daughter who lives really far away called and said her baby was admitted to the hospital.	That's sad! How old was the baby?"
"He was premature so he's been having some breathing issues. I hate not being there.	Oh no! That's so sad, I hope everything turns out well!"
"I'm so taken by the talents of contestants on the show Face Off -- have you ever seen it?	That's a great show. I haven't seen it in a while."
"Their abilities to both imagine and create their characters is incredible!	I've seen it! I love it! I'm always looking for something new to watch!"
"A lot people know Toys-R-Us has completely shut down not long ago.	That's right. I was sad to see them close."
"Yeah, a lot of my friends and I got to thinking of all our memories there. Really makes you think back.	It really does. It's a shame they shut down the stores."
"I feel so bad, I forgot my sisters birthday...	Oh that's terrible.  I hope she didn't mind as much as I do."
"Yes I plan on it, its just been stressful time at home with a toddler, it slipped my mind	Yeah, that's what happens when you get busy with work and kids."
"I love my husband so much I could never cheat on him.	That is so true, you should be with the person you love."
"Yea, I wouldnt want to hurt him, i cant understand anyone who does.	Yeah, I think that's right. I don't think cheating is a good thing to do."
"It can be really tough when your husband and teenagers have electronics.	I'm sure that is not fun.  What do they do?"
"I do for family time but sometimes I can sit in a full room and still feel no one is there	That is a lot of time to sit in a room. I wish they could have some more time together."
"Tomorrow is my husbands Birthday!	That's nice! How old is he?"
"Yes, we are going out for a nice dinner. We haven't been on a date in months!	I hope he enjoys it!"
"I love the holidays, that make think back to being a kid.	That's great. What is your favorite holiday?"
"Yea, that would really be great. Or maybe we'd get bored.	Yeah, that is the thing. You get so used to the holidays, you forget what it's all about. I think the best part is that you get to see all the family you haven't seen in a long while."
"There is a big storm going on in my town right now!	I have seen that before, it can be scary."
"I don't, it makes me nervous with the strong winds and rain!	That is bad news. Are you safe?"
"My favorite game has an expansion on Monday, I can't wait.	I'm not much of video games, but I love playing them."
"World of Warcraft, It's been my favorite for years.	I've been a huge World of Warcraft fan too. What's your favorite expansion?"
"I just got a promotion at my job!	That's awesome!  Congratulations!"
"I work in Human Resources for a big company, I wasn't expecting the promotion! Feel Blessed :)	It's good for you to get that promotion!"
"I really like every shelf in my house to be arranged just so.	I know! It's like a work of art."
"I do, everything is in it's place. It thoroughly bothers me when someone puts random stuff on them, like cups or papers.	I understand why you like that. It is nice to be able to find what you are looking for easily."
"I just found out my husband is cheating on me..	Oh no.  That is awful.  Why didn't he tell you?"
"A few months, I'm not sure what my next move is. Staying in a hotel for a few days to think.	I can't imagine what you're going through right now, but at least you have your time to think about things you want to do in the future."
"My daughter is finally fully potty trained!	That's so cool! I've been trying to get her to potty for hours!"
"Yes, I am very happy as well! No more buying diapers haha	That's awesome! How many?"
"So, my new puppy is adorable though maybe not as amazing yet as yours.	Oh I see!  What's her name?"
"She's so cute and fun, i love her already.	I bet you do! I have two and they are both such sweethearts."
"I started doing more research on salaries for the degree I'll have in 6 months.	Oh that's interesting.  What degree is it?"
"It seems to be about 60,000 per year just out of college. I am eager to see if the statistics are correct.	It's great that you are so enthusiastic about your future."
"I know it's silly, but my friend got something I wanted in a game the other day, bit sad.	Oh that is sad. What was it?"
"I guess, little things at times right?	That can be tough, I'm sure you were feeling a little jealous."
"I watched The Lion King today with my daughter, reminded me of my childhood.	I love The Lion King.  I haven't seen it in a while.  It's so much fun to watch."
"Yes! I'm excited for that as well. I watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!	It's great you have a connection with your daughter."
"5	I don't know what you are talking about."
"Opps. Ok, i mean that I was sad the other day because a friend is moving.	That is too bad.  What happened?"
"not to far, but it's still sad to see her go.	Oh no. I have been there before."
"I have been having a rough week!	It can be tough when it comes to the week, I hope you get back on track soon!"
"Yes but I am afraid I might loose my job..	That is terrible, how long have you been working for the company?"
"I hate how our country is right now.	That's awful. What happened?"
"People just can't seem to get along, makes me sad.	It is sad too. We need to work together as one nation and not be so divided. I don't know how we get there though."
"I spent all weekend alone, wish my family lived closer.	That sucks, do you like having them around?"
"My family is over 2,000 miles away in Alaska, its tough!	That is a long way to go. I have a family member in the same city but they live far away in another part of the state. I know how it feels."
"My husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache	Oh no! Did he get it from eating something?"
"Not yet, but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.	That is terrible! I hope he gets it checked out."
"Ah, it's been rough. My dog passed away two nights ago.	That's terrible. What was his name?"
"Thank you, she was 12 years old so I knew it was coming but still shook up about it.	Yeah, that's a terrible way to start the week"
"I hate when it storms so bad the power goes out	I know the feeling!  I was in the middle of a storm last year and the power went out."
"I agree.	I know!  I hate the thunderstorm, and it always makes me feel like the world is ending."
"I found a hundred dollar bill when cleaning my closet!	Oh my! I bet that was fun!"
"No! I'm not sure where it came from! and I live alone :O	That is so cool, I love finding those kinds of things. What was it used for?"
"There was a huge spider on my wall, it ran away before I could kill it..	Oh wow!  I would have been so upset!  I hate spiders."
"Me too, I think it was a wolf spider. I hope I can sleep tonight	Oh wow. Did it leave a mark on you?"
"I'm so nervous, have a final exam on Tuesday!	That's so exciting! What are you studying for?"
"Yes, I have been studying a lot but still worried. I need to get a good grade!	That's a lot of pressure! I hope you do well!"
"I have to give a speech on Thursday.	That's awesome! Are you going to give it on a specific topic?"
"Yes. But mentally I am never ready to give a speech if im being honest.	I am sure you'll do great.  You'll be nervous, but you'll do your job!"
"It's on local politics. Not a fun subject either!	I sold some stuff I didnt need last week.	I am sure it was for good reasons!"
"Yea, enought to have great weekened anyway.	I love selling stuff. I used to do it all the time when I was young"
"I think that my husband and me have so much faith in each other.	I am sure you do, you have been married for 20 years."
"I know, I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.	I know what you mean. I think that's what makes it easier to keep things going when you're having trouble."
"Ten years ago now, a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate. I didn't know if there would be anything to come back to.	That is terrible. I am sure it was a very scary experience."
"Pretty messed up, but the house was still standing.	I've never had a house in a hurricane, that's scary."
"was travelling 14 hours internationally. First flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative	Yeah that's so frustrating. I've had flights like that happen before and they just ignore you. I'm so tired and irate."
"British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting, they could not	That is so rude of them. I would not fly them."
"I've felt excited when I found out I had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course, taught by someone who I knew could help me in ways that I would I not be able to through self-study alone.	That sounds amazing. What is it that you want to do?"
"Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special!	That's really cool. I'm glad that it worked out well for you."
"I think it was :)	I like going fishing, it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.	That's cool, I love fishing."
"I do, I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?	Yeah I love fishing. I've never been very good at it though, but I enjoy it."
"I dropped all my food in the cafeteria the other day. Everybody was staring at me.	That sucks. Did anyone laugh?"
"No, it was at work.	Oh my goodness!  That is terrible."
"I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it!	That's really nice of them to do that for you."
"Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!	Oh, yeah, I've had those moments too where I'm thinking about the battery running out and it's too late."
"I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!	That's awesome! What team are you rooting for?"
"Auburn Tigers	I'm a football fan!"
"I did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday.	Oh no, I hope you were not hurt."
"I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.	I would have been very mad!"
"I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.	That was cool. Did he go there?"
"Oh yeah, definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!	That is awesome! Congrats to your brother."
"I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!	That is really nice of them!"
"It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.	Yeah that is the kind of thing I like to hear about, the kind of kindness that makes life a little bit better"
"I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.	Oh that is a horrible thing to see. Did you yell at the dog?"
"Yes, I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!	I know right! I was so mad! I was like ""what the heck! You're a dog, not a petting zoo! Why are you jumping over there and knocking people over?"" I hope they are responsible and they will be more careful in the future."
"My transmission in my car went out the other day, maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.	That is terrible. I have had that happen to my car."
"Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too, so my money is tied up.	That sucks, hope you don't get into too much trouble with it."
"I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.	That is terrible. Did they steal anything else?"
"No, I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.	That's terrible.  Did they leave?"
"Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!	It is very exciting, I am a little jealous, I have not been trekking for so long."
"I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary	I'm glad you had a good time.  Did it go well?"
"Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech, and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!	That's so cool. I love rock music."
"I'm sorry if I was unclear, I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).	That is awesome. What was their music?"
"So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!	That is so cool! I love bowling!"
"Yes, very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.	That is really cool!  I have never been good at anything, but I have learned to bowl.  It's a great way to be able to play with friends.  What's your favorite part about it?"
"So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!	That is disgusting. I hate it when that happens."
"We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess	That's so sad. Did you call your dog?"
"I am starting a new phase in my life. Completed all debt and off to a new start	That's awesome. What kind of debt are we talking about?"
"yes very. but I know that it will be good.	I'm glad for your good luck"
"Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress	That's great! I'm sure you'll learn from your mistakes."
"I try to be. it can be difficult on some days, but I think I have a good attitude towards most things	Yeah, I know what you mean. It's tough sometimes. But you have to keep going."
"I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.	That's great! What's your major?"
"Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.	That's great! I'm sure you will do great!"
"My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck	That is great!"
"Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!	I can imagine. I have had to sell a house for a lot of money. I'm glad you got the good luck you needed!"
"So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.	Oh no! That's not fun, what did you do?"
"No, but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.	I love the humor."
"My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.	Yeah that is a nice car. I bet you were happy for him though?"
"No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!	That's a pretty sweet car! I'm sure he will. I have a 2000 Honda Civic and it has held me together for a long time. I'm not sure I could afford another car right now, though."
"I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!	I have never had to upgrade before. I am glad you got a good one."
"I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.	That's awesome! I have been wanting to get a new car."
"I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.	I love that! Throwback hits. I like that too."
"It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado, 2pac, etc.	It's always good to reminisce about the past."
"My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.	That's terrible! How old was he?"
"They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.	I know it can't be good..."
"I am so excited - after a year of misery due to my loud, inconsiderate upstairs neighbors I'm finally moving into a new apartment!	That's great! I'm sure you'll love it! I've moved a few apartments recently, it's a lot of work."
"I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!	That's great, you're lucky to get away from them!"
"Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)	I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!	That must've been frustrating, I'm sure it was!"
"It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.	I bet that made you feel terrible.  I've done that before too and I felt awful."
"We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone, especially my brother and sister.	I love family reunions! I haven't had one in a while, but I'm excited! What kind of family reunion are you having?"
"It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.	That is great! I hope everyone has fun!"
"I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.	I'm happy for you! What's your personal record?"
"Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it, but consistency does seem to pay off.	That is awesome. I love working out. It's so great to be able to do it and see the results. I have been wanting to start working out more."
"I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.	That sounds great! What are you going to do?"
"I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though, I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future	I love that you've been working out for a while now. I have to do the same thing to feel good about the future."
"My brother got a custom-made bowling ball, and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.	I love bowling, and I bet that's a really cool custom ball.  Did your brother buy it?"
"He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.	It's really cool to see people improving over time, and it's good for them to have the opportunity to do so."
"Ok, so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!	Yeah, I would not have done that either."
"Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)	Yeah, that is what I would do too. I would also consider putting earplugs in, I know it sounds silly, but some people can't sleep with ears plugged. I hope you get some good sleep tonight"
"Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.	That's terrible.  Did they ever calm down and go away?  Or did you just have to move on?"
"Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.	That is funny.  I think you should try to relax a bit.  It's not like you're going to start singing and playing the piano."
"I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.	I bet it was pretty spooky. What did you hear?"
"No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.	Oh that's creepy. I would be so freaked out. Did you tell your dad about it?"
"I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!	That's so exciting! I've never traveled abroad. What city are they in?"
"I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him	That is so cool. I wish you the best of luck."
"I can't help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time.	Oh that was nice.  Did you go to church?"
"I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.	That's a bummer. Christmas was always my favorite time of year."
"The last time I went into a job interview, I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.	Oh wow, that's great! Did you end up getting a job offer?"
"Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.	That's great! I hope you got the job!"
"Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!	I have never been in that kind of situation. How did you react?"
"I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!	Oh my."
"It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my ""attacker"" off with!	I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself	I stress eat a lot too.  I had to get a gastric surgery a few years ago."
"I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese	That is good news, but also good that you are aware of your body and want to control it."
"My co-worker just bought a brand new car.	I hate when people get a new car and they don't tell anyone about it. I would be so jealous!"
"I know, me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.	I bet you feel bad about yourself when you're driving your beat up Chevy. I mean it."
"i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i'm so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are	i understand, i hope i get to meet a good one"
"I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone	I understand. I'm a little jealous. But you will be safe."
"I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!	That sounds like a great move. What are the pros and cons of the move?"
"Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!	Oh, I hope it is quiet!"
"They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.	Someone stole my identity.	Oh that's a bad one.  How did they do that?"
"I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.	I have never heard of that before. How do you deal with such a thing?"
"i have food on my table, a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful	That is very fortunate. I have never been in your shoes."
"yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted	I can relate. I'm always thinking about my parents, how they've been so generous and supportive. I feel so thankful to them."
"so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets	Oh, I'm so glad you did! I'm not exactly crafty like you, but I love to make things! I love sewing and embroidery!"
"thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies	That sounds so fun!  I would love a new blanket.  Did your friends like them?"
"I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!	Oh, what was the trip like?"
"Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.	I've been there, it's beautiful!  What was your favorite part of the trip?"
"Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!	When I spend time with my family, it reminds me how lucky I really am.	That's a great reason to appreciate your family.  How many family members do you have?"
"Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.	I know what you're talking about. I used to always think about the things I had, but now I think about the things I'm thankful for. It's a good realization to make."
"My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much	I love dogs too!  What kind is it?"
"She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?	It does! I have two dogs!"
"School starts a week from tomorrow and I am getting fairly nervous for it!	It is normal, it is a big step for a child to move out of the house and start school."
"Oh yes, I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?	I know the feeling! I've got a lot of friends from last year and they all go to the same school! I'm worried that I'll miss them too much. I've never been away from my parents for a week before!"
"I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it	That's a good thing, it's good to have self-awareness!"
"yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad	That is good news! You are a good person."
"I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.	I bet you do! I hope you do great."
"I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.	That's awesome. You must be excited. What are you going to be studying?"
"My brother just turned 16 and he's about to get his first car! I'm so excited for him.	That's so awesome!  How much did he want?"
"Probably some kind of SUV, maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!	It's great that you're excited about his future."
"I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!	That sounds great. I am so happy for you!"
"I want an SUV, like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!	I would love to get one of those. I don't know how you are doing it but I hope you are going for it!"
"Recently my husband and I were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off	That's so sad, did you guys hit?"
"I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary	Oh no! Did the other people involved in the accident stop?"
"My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.	That is nice, do you have any kids of your own?"
"She will be 30. It makes me feel so old, but also how fun it was when they were little.	I can relate, my kids all go to college next week.  It is hard to believe they will be gone for 3 years."
"I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I	That's good! It can be scary sometimes. I am glad you feel better about yourself."
"Sorry, I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!	That's great!  You should keep working out.  How many pounds did you lose?"
"I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.	I like grocery shopping!"
"Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!	Oh, that sounds great!  I love Indian food, especially curry!"
"They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.	I love trying out different foods. What did you eat?"
"What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!	That's a nice way to look at it.  I'm not a fan of green beans myself, but they're okay in a casserole or something like that."
"I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!	Oh, that's terrible! What happened?"
"Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!	That's not good, did he scare you?"
"My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.	That must have been very scary. Did you feel bad?"
"Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.	That is so gross. I hope you didn't get sick."
"When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.	Oh man, that's a tragic thing. I'm so sorry."
"It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!	It's a shame that he was not able to find peace, I hope he was at peace.  I am not a fan of his work, but it's hard to be against something that has such positive impact on society.  I think we need to be more compassionate towards people who are struggling with their mental health and just need a little more help and understanding."
"Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.	That is a good point."
"There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.	I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away	That's too bad. Did you try calling her and she said she was busy?"
"Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!	That's awesome. I'm glad you got to experience it with her. It's always nice to be around the family again."
"I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!	I'm not sure what you're trying to say, I think you're just having some trouble with the text format?"
"Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!	I'm glad that you guys won."
"I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.	That is so unfair!"
"That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.	I can understand that, but I think that's what kids are supposed to learn, and they are! I just wish I could have learned in a different way when I was. I was a bit of a trouble maker, and my grades reflected that."
"That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.	When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.	"
"It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!	That is a very good point."
"I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.	i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please	I love hearing kids learn new things.  I remember my first words being ""mama"" and ""dada"" when I was little.  It's fun to hear my grandkids say words like that now."
"he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian	That is so awesome!  I have a few friends who speak two languages."
"A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.	Oh no. Did they move in another house?"
"Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.	It is funny how life works out sometimes."
"No, moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband, but we split up.	I found a cat in my attic yesterday!	Oh no! Did you take the cat to the vet?"
"My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!	I am sure it was a good cat though."
"My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.	I can imagine that. I have had friends like that, but they are very rare."
"Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!	Yeah, it's amazing what people can accomplish when pushed to the limit. I know how you mean. My sister is a bit more of a mess, but she's still the same person she was before. I don't know what makes me better. I just try to help her."
"She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!	I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!	That is so awesome! I love watching TV too, I haven't been to a movie theater in years."
"I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!	I've never used Hulu Live before but I think it's time to try it out! I love to watch TV too!"
"My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident, I'm so upset.	oh that's terrible"
"Yes, we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.	That's horrible. I hope the cat is okay."
"I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.	Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.  I can only imagine how difficult it would be.  I have had to lose my two daughters in the car in an accident, and I have lost my son in a drunk driver in a drunk driver in an accident.  It is a never-ending list of people who have taken my children from me."
"Yes, I heard about it. Such a sad story.	Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, my heart goes out to you. I hope you are okay"
"My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..	That's really kind of them.  I bet that was fun."
"I did! It was a very nice gesture.	That's so nice. I would do the same thing."
"We are waiting on military orders right now, I'm so hoping they come through next week.	Oh, I bet you're nervous about that! What's going on?"
"Yes, we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.	Oh no, that's terrible!  What are you and where you headed to go to?"
"I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.	I agree. I hate when people are mean to animals."
"Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.	That's so true, people are always being mean to animals. I have never been mean to animals either, they are my pets, my dog and my cat."
"For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.	I love Christmas too.  I think it's a great time to look back and remember the good times.  Do you think you'll be able to get back to Christmas next year?"
"It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!	That's nice, I'm sure you'll always look back on those days with a smile. I'm sure you'll always look back on those days with a smile. I think I'll always look back on them with a smile.  I'm sure you'll always look back with a smile."
"It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in!	Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.	That is crazy. I have never been to a restaurant."
"Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries.	I know someone like that."
"We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.	I bet you are! What city are you moving to?"
"Texas, there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change.	That is great! What are you moving to?"
"Awesome, my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.	I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.	That's good that you prepared."
"So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.	that is good to know"
"My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her, one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!	That must have been a lot to take in.  How long have you known them?  Did they live in a different state?"
"Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!	I'm happy for you."
"Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.	My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards	I bet.  How sick was she last time?  Did she have a tooth absitively or was it a dental problem?"
"She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess	That's a good point.  You're right, it's not just about the procedure itself but the stress that comes with it."
"Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us	I am sorry for your loss."
"Yes, it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult, so it was really hard when she passed.	Oh wow, that is very nice of you to be so kind.  Did you live in the same house as her?"
"We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.	It's always good to have a plan for emergencies."
"I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.	It's great that they were able to help."
"I've been so busy packing, packing and more packing.	It's good that you're preparing for your move!"
"Yes, don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.	That's crazy! Are you going anywhere exciting or exciting?"
"I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.	That's nice.  I'm glad you found each other."
"I do feel very lucky, especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.	Yeah that's a great feeling, I'm so happy for you!  What made you choose each other over someone younger?"
"I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.	That is so cool! I don't usually listen to that station either. Did you like it?"
"Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back	That's awesome! What kind of music do you like?"
"I took a test for college the other day, it was basically our midterm.	That's awesome. What did you do well on it?"
"I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.	That sucks. Are you studying for the final exam as well?"
"Discrete mathematics	I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago. I know a guy who was playing in it. Guess what? He won! Fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!	I love golf! I'm not the best player but I love watching it!"
"He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to, lol!	That's great! I love golf."
"You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!	That is awesome!  I've been a big golf fan for years.  What's your name?  I love watching the guys compete!"
"Thank you - he'd appreciate it. It makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved.	I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.	That's cool.  How often do you skydive yourself?"
"There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.	That's really cool. I have never been sky diving, but my brother is and he says it is so much fun."
"There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!	Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life	That is a good thing!"
"Exactly!  I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is ""Always be prepared""	That's awesome. What do you like to do in your free time?"
"You know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? That happened to me recently - the owners rented it out the night before I was to see it :(	I can imagine how that feels."
"Yes, but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!	That is so frustrating!"
"I'm sure I will so long as I have good neighbors. I'm over the first place now, but it wasn't pleasant to be pipped at the post!	my horse died last week i was devastated when i found out	i am sorry to hear that. I hope you are doing better now"
"yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad	That's really tough, I'm sorry you lost your horse.  Did you find out about the cancer in time to do anything about it?"
"i am always outside my house beafore my friend gets here	That must be so exciting. Did you have fun waiting?"
"i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives	I am sure you are excited to see him."
"i was really happy the day i finished my doctorate	Oh really? Why is that?"
"yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end	that is awesome. i wish i had the courage to do the same."
"in science of medicine it was really a fun exppirience	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, and is getting back in a week.  I'm super pumped!	That is nice of her.  Is she going to visit you?"
"No, taking a language course to help her graduate studies.  Good guess though :P	Oh, that's great!  I love taking language courses.  I'm sure she will do great!"
"My wife is coming back into the country after being away for 2 months.  I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P	That's a lot to do. I hope she's home before the weather gets too bad!"
"Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad, but it's nice to come home to a clean house.	Yeah, I'm not worried either, but I'm a bit worried that she won't come back to me in a clean house. I'm not going to make her do it. I'll do it myself, and she can just come in and be all clean and stuff.  But I'm sure she'll come back to me in the end."
"i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public	That's a pretty big mistake!  Do you know why you did it?"
"yeah it is the worst, i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing	i know how you feel."
"I had a bad experience out to eat the other day.  I don't do it too often, so it was a bummer.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.	That's terrible. I hate when that happens."
"I was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn't watching where I was going and knocked over an entire display.	oh no, did you hurt anyone?"
"It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it. My face was bright red.	Oh my, that must have been frustrating."
"My wife has been out of the country for two months and is getting back in a week.	That's so cool. I'm sure you're excited to have your wife back!"
"Definitely :)  It's been a long and lonely summer :)	I know that is a long time away.  Are you guys having a good time while she is away?"
"I recently moved from California to North Carolina and suddenly realized I knew absolutely nobody. It was a horrible feeling.	That's terrible. How long did you live there before moving?"
"My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway, a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly, huh?!	I've moved around a lot. It can be scary. But you have friends to help you out."
"The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.	That sounds really hard. Did you have to move somewhere new?"
"The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?	Oh wow, where are you living? I am from the north. What kind of places were rents and gas?"
"A while ago I drove from Florida to Northern California. It's a long trip, but I knew I could do it just fine.	That's a long drive. Did you enjoy it?"
"It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East, so kind of knew what I was doing.	I am glad you made it safely."
"Oh no - I'm not a race car driver, lol. And anyway, it's kind of fun seeing different parts of the country, so rushing would (to me) be a waste.	My wife was really sick the other day, she was stuck in bed for most of the day.	Oh no, I hope you both are okay."
"Not completely sure, maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now, though her appetite took a bit to come back.	Oh wow, that is unfortunate. I hope she feels better soon."
"summer was so boring for me, im really happy school is starting again	That is true, I'm going to school for a year now. I'm a teacher."
"not really, i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did	That is understandable, how long did you stay home?"
"My mom is having weight loss surgery next week, I'm nervous.	It's not every day you get to say that, I'm sure it's a big deal!"
"She is having gastric bypass surgery, I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!	That is scary! I hope she gets through with it."
"there is nothing i hate more than losing in something	I'm sure it's not fun."
"not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me	I'm not a big racing fan, I'm a big soccer fan. I hate losing in any sport."
"It has been a wonderful Monday!	It's always a good Monday."
"I found out a got a pay raise at my job, we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in November!	That's great! What a wonderful surprise! I would be so excited!"
"I read in the news about a family who lost all six of their animals in a house fire :(	That is so sad.  I have had some pets die before me.  They were my pets."
"I know, it made me upset! My two dogs are my babies couldn't imagine loosing them.	That's terrible. I hope the family is okay and that the fire was not too bad."
"my dog is over at the vet for 4 days and makes the house feel so alone'	It's so hard when our dog gets sick."
"yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back	I know that feeling!  My dog is going in for a surgery in 2 days.  He's a little old boy so I'm a little worried."
"My wife went out of the country for a couple months at the beginning of the summer, dropping her off at the airport was really tough.	That's really tough. Did you stay in the house with her?"
"Not for more than a few days.  It's been a rough couple months, but it's almost over!	That's a long time. I hope you both are happy now that she's back."
"When my wife and I had to move for her to go to school, we had a lot of trouble finding a place to live until my parents were nice enough to cosign on a loan.	That sounds really tough. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I would have been so stressed out!"
"We are.  They've helped a lot during my life, but this might have been the biggest one.	That's a lot to take in, especially with a child to raise. It must have been tough on you both."
"i cant wait to visit my family back home they are so far away i dont get to see them a lo	Oh, that's great! I love traveling! What's the most exciting part about visiting them?"
"in a couple of weeks i am really happy to see them it has been 5 years	That's so cool! I've been away for so long too. What are you looking for from them?"
"i cant get near spiders, even if i see them in pictures they freak me out	That's weird. Do you have a pet spider?"
"not really i was just born afraid of them hahah	I think I understand.  It's not a disease right.  I have a friend who is very allergic to spiders.  She will die if they touch her."
"A few years ago, before we got married, my wife planned a party for me for my birthday completely without me knowing.	That must've been pretty cool! I'm sure you were excited."
"It really was!  I walked into my apartment to like 15 more people than I expected.	That is so nice! Did you feel like you were the only person there?"
"i hate when my little brother throws food on the table just to annoy m e	That's not very considerate of him.  I think you should talk to your parents about it!"
"he is like 11 but he does it when my parents are not home it is really anoying	That is so annoying.  Why do kids throw food like that?"
"I was stopped at a traffic light when a woman in a truck scraped slowly along the side of my car.	That's really scary, what did you do?"
"Yeah, we both stopped and pulled over.  I think she was high or something, she was really off.	That's awful, I hope she's okay. Did you get a picture of her car so I can post it on social media?"
"i found a little ball of hair when i was eating at a fancy restaurant	That's a fun find! Did it come from the chef or the restaurant?"
"yeah i did, they gave us a refund and we did not come back to that place again	That's good. I would have been a little upset. Did you get the refund back?"
"I had made plans for dinner and had set everything out and I found out my husband ate all the bread!	oh that is awful"
"It wasn't even garlic bread! It was generic bread to dip in soup!	It's the bread of life!"
"i feels surprised	I'm glad you feel that way. I'm feeling a mix of emotions right now."
"my boy friend gives me a birthday gift surprisingly	That's so sweet of him."
"My neighbor used to have an old beagle - a lovely pooch. He died of cancer just before Thanksgiving. I looked for him for weeks - I miss him.	I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sure you will get over it."
"Yeah. I used to see him when I was out on my porch and he'd come out for a sniff around or a tinkle. He was so sweet and gentle.	That's so sad.  I have had a lot of pets in my life.  I have lost 4 in the past 2 decades.  I wish you well."
"They sure are. I actually prefer them to some humans I know! Do you have a dog at the moment?	Yeah, I have a dog. I just love them!"
"That's wonderful, that you were able to take her in. Good for you! More people should act like that.	It's just a dog. I'm just a dog owner."
"I'm not a very good cook but sometimes my husband scares me with it!	That is a good thing. I like to be scared sometimes. It makes me stronger."
"He was putting chocolate right into the chilli the other night!	That's a good one! I'm a little jealous, I've never had to cook anything other than a microwaveable meal."
"My son came home today and was working on his homework.	I love kids!  How did he do?"
"In 7th and they're doing pre algebra. He said he didn't know it, then proceeded to get every question right!	Oh that's great! I'm glad he is learning. Pre-algebra is so much fun, but I can see him struggling."
"I've been training hard for a marathon next week, and I am beating my record time!	That's great! I hope you have fun!"
"For a few months now, but I've been training pretty hard just these past few months.	That's great.  How long has it been since you last ran?"
"I'm very socially awkward and tomorrow i'm going to have a playdate with some local moms and i'm so anxious	That's understandable. Are you planning to be the center of attention?"
"that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice.	Yeah, I know how you feel!"
"I recently went to ruby falls, an underground cavern with a waterfall.	Oh, that's so cool. I haven't been there yet, but I've heard it's really nice. Did you enjoy yourself?"
"Not that particular one, no. I had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down 23 stories.	That's crazy! I've never been there. Did you enjoy it?"
"Overall it was a good time, but i was nervous being that far underground, i need to learn to relax and enjoy things.	I had some hesitations when I was at the gym today, thought I wouldn't be able to handle the weights	Oh I know how you feel! I always feel that I'm going to have to do a lot of push ups to get through my gym session. But you know what? I didn't even think about it. I just went for it!"
"I decided to focus on the music that was blasting, just tried switching up what I play in the gym, it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle	That's cool. What kind music do you like?"
"Have you ever been in a car crash before?	It is a terrible feeling. I have been in one a few times. It's a terrible experience."
"I got T-boned once, I'll never forget spinning around in that car, hearing the tires squalling. It was really scary.	That must have been terrifying.  Did you get out of the car?"
"My wife has been really sad here recently, I've had to hold her while she cries herself to sleep at night.	I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried talking to her?"
"Shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer. We've been to 4 funerals, and the most recent one was really hard on her.	That sucks.  I hope she feels better soon."
"My bank, which I've had a savings account with for over 10 years has been deducting $15/month from me for ""inactivity"". How about that?	I am so mad about that!  I would have to tell them that I am not active anymore."
"Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.	That's awful! I'm sorry to hear. Did you call them and ask them why?"
"Yes. They said that they'd been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money. What rubbish. It just amazes me!	Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.	Oh yes. It is a sad thing. I lost a friend a few years back. I still miss them."
"Yes, my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.	I'm so sorry to hear that.  It's so hard to process and understand how someone can feel that they have no other choice.  How is he doing now?  Is he okay?"
"Have you ever had a new puppy?	I have! I have two!  They are the cutest things. I am the luckiest person in the world!"
"Yeah, he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside, but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!	I have never had a dog. I think it's a lot of work. But I think I would be willing to do the work. I have never had a dog. I have had a few cats. I think it's a lot of work. I would never have a dog. I don't want a dog! I think I would have a very hard time taking care of a dog. I think I would get so stressed out! I think I would be a nervous wreck!"
"I store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid. I was storing my last piece in there	I like chocolate too, but I don't store it in the fridge. I like it room temperature."
"Last night I wasn't in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone!	Oh no! Did you have to go shopping for another one?"
"I ran into my neighbor's mailbox with my car but didn't stop and leave a note.	That's not very considerate."
"I agree, I felt so bad about it. When I saw him replacing it, I went out and confessed.	That is so nice of you to admit to it.  I would feel the same way if someone found something in my car."
"i'm so stressed. we are struggling financially and i don't even know how are we going to pay rent this month	That is a terrible thing to go through, I am sorry.  What is your situation?"
"thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it's expensive	I can relate. I've been broke my whole life. I just lost my job."
"My mom made a pretty awesome scrapbook and gave it to me for christmas several years ago. I recently dug it out and went through it.	I'm glad you have such a good relationship with your mom!"
"Photos from my whole life growing up, with sections about my relationships with each sibling. pretty awesome.	That is nice! I bet you are proud of your family. What's your mom's name?"
"I once was taking a big trip I had been looking forward to and the day before we leave for an international flight a high level travel advisory was issued for the area we were going.	That's terrible!  I hope everything works out for you.  Are you flying to a foreign country?"
"No. We went ahead and went on. It actually turned out to be a great trip with zero incidents.	That's really cool. I've never had that happen to me. I'm glad you didn't let it stop you."
"Yeah. Glad we didnt bail.	Yeah, it's always better to go ahead and do it. It's always better to have the money and not the problem."
"No. Best I can remember it didnt even rain.	I hate it when plans fall through. I really wanted to spend my time on the water this last weekend.	I'm sure you'll be back on the water this weekend."
"I was going to Florida to go on a multi-day canoeing and camping trip. At the last minute, the two people I was going with backed out, and I simply couldn't afford to go alone.	That's awful. I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you try to find another way to go?"
"My grandpa always said he was a rockstar back in his day, but I never believed him.	Oh, what happened? Did he have a band?"
"I don't know if he was famous, but the other day, he got on stage, bit the head off of a bat, then belted the words to Crazy Train. It was unbelievable!	I can imagine! That sounds like it was a wild show. Did he play the whole set?"
"I used to do flooring work, we had to deal with some pretty strange situations sometimes.	That's a little scary.  What kind of situations?"
"well, one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him. was revolting.	That's pretty gross. Did you guys have to do any special cleaning?"
"It really bothers me that my son sticks his dirty socks in the toy box	That is so annoying. I have never been able to get rid of my dirty socks either. I am always getting them and then putting them back in. I think I should have a special box for them."
"I guess so haha but no matter what I try to keep him from doing it, it still happens	It can be frustrating when kids stick their dirty socks in a place you want to keep them"
"I recently had my hip-length hair cut for the first time in years.	Wow, that's a big change. What color did you choose?"
"It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut, but it looks much thicker and healthier now.	That's awesome! You should get a trim!"
"I went around work all day today with a hole in my pants, right on my bottom.	That is pretty bad. What happened?"
"Yep! No one told me. :( I have no idea how many people noticed or saw it.	That's awful! Did they laugh?"
"I paid $1000 for one of those mystery boxes on eBay. It said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items.	That is quite an expensive thing!"
"I would've happily taken that! Instead, it was filled with literal garbage, like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.	That is horrible. I hate that people can just sell things like that."
"I had my final exam for Chemistry today!	It's a hard class!"
"I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.	Oh wow that's great. I'm sure you did well."
"It can be rough when I have a problem and need to vent to someone	I can relate. I have to vent to my therapist about some of my issues. I don't know if I would want therapy though, it is not my thing"
"You are sweet because part of the problem is when I realize there really is no one to talk to. Thank you	That is true.  I can understand that you would feel that way.  Do you have a friend that you can talk to about it?  I am not really sure if I would be able to help you."
"I've been training a new girl at work this week!	Oh wow. What are you training her in?"
"She's doing great, especially for her second week on the job!	That's awesome! How old is she?"
"I've already been shopping for christmas, I'm excited!	Oh, that's so exciting! Do you think you'll get what you want?"
"I know, it's my favourite time of year! Makes me happy :)	It's always a great time."
"I was just at the casino, spent almost 100 dollars on a single machine. I didn't will anything.	Oh no, I hate when people do that."
"Haha, yeah I got a little sauced. The worst part though was as soon as I got up, someone sat down and  rolled triple 7s.	Oh no!  That is terrible.  Did you call the casino to report the theft of your money?"
"I used to get supremely scared when I wanted to go up stairs when the lights were off	That's a scary feeling. What made you feel so scared?"
"Yeah, so I would book it up the stairs as fast as possible	Oh yeah? How did you get over it?"
"I just got matched up with someone online. It will be my first date in a while.	That's so exciting! Where are you both going to meet up?"
"Yeah, I'm really hoping to make a good impression. Other wise that would feel pretty bad.	That's exciting.  Are you going to a restaurant or somewhere else?"
"Tomorrow is the big day, I have to deliver my proposal to the client.	I hope you do good."
"I have been preparing for weeks, but in the back of my mind I still have doubts.	I am sure it will go well."
"My boyfriend's cat wakes me up every morning at 4 AM.	Oh, I'm sorry.  What's wrong with that?"
"I love him, too, a lot. But I don't know why he just stands in the hallway and meows nonstop, even when he's been fed.	That is a bit creepy. I guess it's just trying to wake you up."
"Ashe. He's cute :)	I'm finally almost done with my associate's degree! I technically started wayyyy back in 2011, but I just got serious in 2016.	I'm glad you made progress. I've been there too."
"Thank you. :) I only have three classes left to take. I'm so excited.	I'm so glad you're excited!"
"Thanks a lot ;)	Playing hookey can be really fun. But sometimes it backfires...	I know.  I used to play video games with friends.  We would play together and then go out together afterwards.  I think it was the best thing."
"When I was a teenager, I called in to the restaurant and told them I had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away. Wouldn't you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!	That is hilarious!  I would never do that to my family.  I am glad you are having fun though!"
"Sometimes I enjoy being alone, but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home.	I can understand that."
"This was a while back, but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally, he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.	That is so sad, you could have called the hotel to see if they would let you stay for the rest of the trip."
"I have a beautiful girl friend. But I met someone else.	That can be tough, but sometimes you should just let go of it and focus on the person you really care about."
"I'm trying to figure out how to kick her out of my place.	Yeah, it can get complicated.  What did you do so far?"
"I just watched the ring movie for the first time.	It's a classic, I think I've seen it at least 10 times!"
"I can't even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days.	That's crazy! I love the ring movies."
"Once I took a sip of iced tea while I was driving and it went down the wrong pipe. I had to pull over so I could try to breathe again.	That was a bad experience. I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yeah it is. I thought I was about to die lol	That's crazy! What was in it?"
"My cashier gave me extra change back and I didn't say anything.	Oh, I think that's a nice person to do"
"Because I had also stolen some candy and wanted to get out as soon as possible.	Oh that's a good point.  I would say something then."
"A man came to my door with a gun, asking for money.	I'm so angry! What happened?"
"I did not know him. He took some items from the house as I didn't have any money on me	That is terrible, did you have to call police?"
"I like finding little resources or tips that change old habits I've been coping with in what seems like ""1 easy step""	It sounds like you have been working hard to change your habits! What have you been working hard on?"
"Exactly, I started taping my mouth closed at night, finally woke up before noon, mission accomplished	I love how we've gotten so much more efficient at taking care of ourselves over time"
"I started taping my mouth closed before bed, and now I'm no longer tired when I wake up, feels like I am born again	Oh wow.  What are the reasons for that?  Is it the sleep?"
"Yeah, it	I am sure it was just a habit you developed."
"I use band aid tape cuz it's okay on the skin	Sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time. Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.	That sounds fun! What kind of activities did you do?"
"It was, but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived, there was a festival with games, performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!	That sounds like fun, what a great time!"
"I was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud, and I had a hard time focusing	That's no good, you should talk to them about it"
"No, I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible	That's understandable, especially in a quiet environment.  It's hard when you have to try to focus and be productive, but you also don't want to deal with people bothering you or making a disturbance."
"I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!	I am sorry to hear that. Have you talked to someone at your new bank?"
"That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card, and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!	Yeah, it's a bit crazy. I've heard of tellers messing up before, but I didn't think that was going to happen to me. They're supposed to know their head from their head. I think they're just lazy. I'm going to have to start over with my current card and get a new one."
"I went to a bar I used to go to in college, and I was surprised to see an arcade machine I built with a dear friend of mine!	That's cool! I bet that was fun to watch!"
"Yes, playing the machine we built together reminded me of all the good times we used to have.	That is awesome, what kind of games did you build?"
"I hadn't been to the dentist in five years but made an appointment recently because of a toothache	That's good. Have you been to one recently?"
"I just started to feel a sharp pain in one of my teeth. It might be a cavity or something worse	I'm sorry you are experiencing that.  I hope the dentist can figure out what is wrong and get you fixed up soon."
"I can't believe I am telling you this, but I actually camped out to buy tickets for the new star wars movie.	I've never camped out for a movie. I'm not a fan of the series. What movie are you watching?"
"I'm glad you don't think so. The kicker is, when I got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!	I would have been mad."
"My girlfriend and I were going to a big parade with some friends. As we were leaving, she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.	That is horrible. What did you do?"
"Unfortunately, it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead, I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.	Yeah, that is a bummer. I am so sorry that happened. I am sure you were very happy for her, but I hate that she can't go out with friends anymore."
"My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking, but ultimately underwhelming thing	That sounds so scary.  Did you get a new one?"
"I guess because furry things don't really scare me, I was like well that was a waste of a reaction	I have never had a cat jump through a window. I'm sure that would be a shock!"
"I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift	That's awesome. Did you lift as much as you could lift?"
"No not really, just seeing how much energy I could summon from within	Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.  That's a great workout!"
"There's too many things to think about	I'm not really sure what you mean."
"Yeah, what am I getting myself into	I'm glad you have some thoughts to consider."
"I just finally won some money playing scratch lotto tickets.	I have never done that before. What is the odds like?"
"Close to $20,000, I think I'm going to spend it on traveling.	That's great news, good for you.  How long will you be traveling for?"
"I went to a play recently that was unconventional in a really fun way. It actually took place at a pool.	I've heard of those before!  They're fun!"
"It was an adaptation of ""The Last Unicorn"". It had parts that took place in the water, and parts that took place on a giant trapeze!	That sounds like fun!"
"I got a new puppy. She's really cute and playful	That's so cool. How's she doing?"
"I named her Layla.	That's so sweet! I love animals. I have a dog too. I named him Max."
"I recently went to a Steely Dan concert with my lady.	That sounds like fun! Steely Dan is a great band."
"Yeah, it was awesome reminiscing about those times when we used to get in trouble back in the day... times were so much simpler then.	Yeah, I'm glad they still play their music today."
"I just got a new puppy, names fido.	Oh, I love the name fido. What kind is it?"
"It is a german shepherd. It takes a lot of work caring for it, definitely needs a lot of attention	That is so cool! I've never been around a puppy before but I love dogs! I have two cats. What breed?"
"On my way to work, a goose stole the toupee I needed to impress the new secretary, Christy.	That is so funny!  Did Christy take the toupee?"
"No! I am so furious with that goose, that I could wring his neck! I can't get any ladiez with this chrome dome of mine.	I am sorry to hear that. What a goose!"
"I was doing the dishes and a huge roach crawled out from underneath the dishwasher.	It sounds like a nasty situation.  What did you do?"
"I almost fell over trying to crush it, i forgot I wasn't wearing shoes and stepped on in with my bare feet.	I would have done the dishes!"
"I was walking down the street at night, I felt like I was surrounded by something unseen.	That's creepy, what was it?"
"Every time I turned around to try and catch something there was nothng there. Just the feeling of something watching me....	I would have been terrified!"
"I had a job interview that I didn't really feel prepared for.	That's okay, it's okay if you don't feel ready for a job interview."
"I did not get it unfortunately.	It can happen.  What happened?"
"One time, I smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car.	Oh no. That can be a sign of a fire, can it happen?"
"Well, when I went to lift the engine cover, I noticed a dead, rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.	Oh my goodness! That's disgusting. I would've been terrified."
"I went to the store, just trying to get some milk and bread, and I got rear ended by a driver.	I'm sorry to hear that. Were you okay?"
"Yeah, it was more of a shock than anything, was not expecting someone to hit you when you are just crossing the street.	I would have hit you too, that is not good"
"I have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech.	Oh, you are preparing for an award?"
"I can only dream. No it's more on par with Lord of the RIng's final battle.	Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you working on something for work?  I don't know what it is."
"Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.	That's so cool!  What store were it at?"
"Yeah, I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.	I am sure the person was nice to you"
"I thought I bombed my math test but I got a 103 on it.	I'm sure that's a good grade."
"I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.	Yeah, sometimes you just need to go back and re-read the problems to understand how you did them."
"I just found a photo book of me and my family growing up.	That's really cool! What did you do when you found it?"
"It was pretty nostalgic , how young we all looked growing up.	It is always great to have a look back at our lives"
"I finally got to see a baseball game live this last week.	That sounds like fun.  What team did you go see?"
"It was the Rockies, no home-run though, it was pretty high up there I felt like I could see the world.	That's awesome. What game were you watching?"
"When my buddy asked me to help him clean out his grandmother's house who had recently passed, I was not prepared for what we found.	That's really bad, did he end up cleaning it out?"
"You hit it right on the money. She was not only a hoarder but a cat lady, and the mix of paper, bugs and cat feces was an affront to the senses.	That's disgusting. I'm sorry she passed away."
"I let my dad borrow my car and he got in a minor accident.	Yeah, that's a bummer. Did you guys get insurance?"
"Yeah he is fine and my car was not damaged. My insurance premium is probably going to go up though.	That sucks!  What did you do to fix it?"
"He said he would cover the extra costs so I'm not too upset	When I bought my new car, I couldn't believe how smooth the ride was.	That is awesome. How long was it?"
"It's a Chevrolet Camaro.	I have a similar car. I love the smooth ride it has."
"I studied for 7 months to take the GRE exam, it was stressful.	That's cool. What subject was it in?"
"I did, and I was accepted to my number 1 program, which meant that I was going to be paid to learn!	That's great, what are you studying for?"
"I have a feeling the really hard work might just be beginning, but I feel exceptionally lucky.	I studied all night for my final exams. I needed to pass them to graduate from college.	It's a good thing you studied hard."
"I did. I was able to sneak in a few hours here and there.	I know that feeling, but you did great!  Congrats!"
"I left my wallet in a movie theater, and didn't notice till I was half way home!	That's terrible. Did you try to return it?"
"I was able to get back in and find it, it was pretty well hidden in between the seats. No harm no foul.	I hate when people leave things in public places. I would have felt bad for leaving it there."
"Some people are just so generous. Really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there.	That's true.  People that are really nice can change your day and help you see a different side of things."
"That's incredible if true, but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast!	I agree, but sometimes it's hard to know what to believe."
"I was so proud of my daughter over the weekend.	That is great. How old is she?"
"She performed her first solo dance in competition, but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.	That is awesome! I have never seen that before."
"It was, very much so, I will cherish it forever.	I'm grateful for the work hours, but bummed that I can't get time off.	I know what you mean.  I work a full time job and sometimes have a few hours to myself.  It's not always a good use of time."
"Well, I've worked without a break for the last 3 years, I just want to get away abit.	I know the feeling. I'm so jealous."
"Right! I'd like to go lay on a beach, or even just the next town over at this point.	I have been extremely diligent in my studies so far, and am participating in two clubs this upcoming year. The future is looking bright!	I am so happy for you! You sound like a very smart and hard working person!"
"I am an electrical engineering student, and I am interested in quite a few things at this point. I think after this year, I will be able to get a paid internship next summer!	It sounds like you're really working hard!"
"I am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump.	It is hard to do, but it is a necessary thing to do."
"The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents, so the dump has a line every day.	That sucks, I've had to do that for years. I've been thinking about switching to a different city, but I don't know where."
"We have, and we called a city meeting. I'm just beyond words,it has to be corrected.	's all too common these days. |||| NEW CONVERSATION ||| I recently went to a dinner where we were served something unconventional to say the least.	That sounds like a weird meal."
"I should have known better, as these friends are on the ""crunchier side"". They had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!	That sounds disgusting!"
"I lost my appetite completely! I will be sure to get takeout before hand if we ever go to another one of their dinners.	my mom is supposed to call me regarding her test results.	That is good news. Is she in good health?"
"She had stage 3 cancer, but she was clear last screening a year ago.	I am sorry to hear about that."
"Thank you, I have a good feeling about it.	I went to a wedding recently, and something happened that put a damper on it. I felt bad for my buddy, but at least he knows he can trust me.	That's good that he has your back. Did you know what happened?"
"Yeah, his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up, and let him know what had happened.	Oh wow, that's terrible! Did you guys end up hanging out after the wedding?"
"I am highly upset that I'm the only one concerned with earning money for our bills	It is a problem of the society"
"Not much. It's all on me. It sucks	It's so unfair. I'm sure someone else has bills."
"I love playing old school video games. The music is amazing	That's cool. What is it that you like most about them?"
"For me it's happy emotions	That's really cool! I've played some old school games. Do you have a favorite one?"
"The micro brewery explosion in America has been awesome for my girlfriend and I, as we love craft beer. Until recently, our town didn't have one though.	That's really unfortunate.  I've heard about that explosion in Chicago."
"We actually don't brew our own, and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!	Oh my, that sounds amazing! What kind of brewery is it?"
"I hate it when other guys look at my girl	That is bad. What is wrong with them?"
"She's for my eyes only. At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!	Oh, that's so sweet of you to care about your girlfriend! It's so nice you want to be so careful around her!"
"Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read ""Kitchen Confidential"", or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year.	It's hard when you have people around you that are so close, you want them to be okay."
"He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food, and we all still look up to him.	I've always loved cooking, but I'm not sure how to make it taste like food. Maybe I need to get more of an appreciation for the hard work that goes in."
"My husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing.	Oh that must've been a surprise. How did you feel about that?"
"Yes, it was a lot of fun and it caught me off guard. It meant a lot that they did it for me.	Oh, I am so glad that they did!"
"I gave twin fawns in our yard some fresh peaches and they loved them.	I love peaches!  What are fawns?"
"I enjoy helping the wildlife in our area. It is alway a good feeling to give a helping hand.	I am so jealous. How do you give them peaches?"
"In a week my wife will finally be back from being out of the country for 2 months!	That is great, how long were they away for?"
"She was taking a language course in Germany for her graduate studies.	I hope you have a nice reunion!  Did you guys talk about anything interesting?"
"I'm moving into another apartment and just told my neighbor I was leaving. He said he was sorry I'm going!	I bet you were happy about it, you're moving on!"
"About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.	I would have been upset. I hate when people say that without even asking."
"Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!	Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday, so I had to work overtime, but I didn't even get paid for it!	That's terrible.  Did you get paid for it?"
"I'm technically salaried, so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating.	That is terrible.  You should speak to your boss about it."
"I went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it	That's terrible. I bet they got in big trouble."
"Sadly, no.  There's no actual proof of who it was, but we've seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place.  He did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once, so I'll take that as a victory.	I hate when people are stupid, especially when it is at a convenience store or restaurant."
"My husband went to a job fair and got a lot of job offers!	That is so awesome! What kind of job was it for?"
"He is currently Active Duty Army, but is wanting to go into transportation/logistics.	Yeah, it is great."
"It's been a great day so far! The sun is out and I'm on my second cup of coffee!	That sounds good, what is your second cup for?"
"Yes I am, about to make some soup for lunch. This day has been just what I needed!	That sounds great!  I'm sure you're right.  You're just happy to be alive and have everything you want.  That's great!"
"When I applied for the job I have now it took them like a month to get back to me with a final answer.  It was pretty stressful.	I know the feeling.  It is stressful.  But you should get that job.  I think they will be great.  I am sure they will be."
"Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end, but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.	That's so annoying! I hope you got what you needed in the end."
"A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.	That is nice.  I have never taken retirement.  Is he happy?"
"I know - I wish I could do that. They've been to France, Italy, Croatia and Chile so far - I'm sitting in NC!	Oh wow, I've never been there. I wish I could go there one day"
"I would just like to be able to drive to Raleigh without hurting! I fell and broke my hip a while back and can't walk properly.	That's terrible!"
"One more operation and I should be good. In the meantime, I have to live vicariously through Joe and Helen :)	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, she gets back in a week.  I can't wait!	I hope you have a great time with your wife when she gets back."
"I really did.  It'll be great to have her back :)	I'm jealous, I'm not married and I have no one to go on vacation with."
"When I interviewed for the job I have now, they didn't give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview.	That sucks. What did they say?"
"It worked out ok, but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.	Yeah I've been in that situation before, but I don't mind. I just keep going back and asking them more and more questions."
"My wife has been out of the country for the last 2 months for school.	That is a long time. I'm sure you were missing her."
"I do.  She's getting back soon, but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.	Yeah, I feel you.  My husband is away for work for 3 weeks.  We have two dogs that need to be walked.  It's a lot of work.  I hope your wife is back soon!"
"When I interviewed for my current job, I felt like it went well but all I could do was wait.	Oh, what was it that you were interviewing for?"
"A lab technician at a university.	Oh, I'm sorry. What kind of job is it?"
"My parents brought my brother a brand new iPhone. He always gets the newest stuff and I get stuck with nothing.	That is really frustrating."
"I have no idea. He's the ""golden child."" It's super unfair.	That is terrible."
"My wife has been out of the country for two months, which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can't help the other.	I understand.  What are you guys going to do?"
"She gets back in a week, so it's almost over.	I hope you guys have a wonderful time together!"
"my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! I hate insects. they are so nasty	That's crazy. Did it sting you?"
"heck yes i did! I locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work	Oh my god! That must have been so scary! I hate when that happens. Did it bite you?"
"i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season	That sounds like a real pain in the butt. Do you use bug spray or do you try to avoid them at all costs?"
"yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them	I have never heard of that. Are they poisonous?"
"Both me and my girlfriend are super scared of spiders, but she made me kill a huge one yesterday.	That is so scary!"
"Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!	Oh yeah, it's just the fear of the unknown that makes you afraid of them, not just the physical fear."
"I'm going skydiving for the first time with some friends!	I would love to do that! What's the rush?"
"A little bit, but I love doing extreme stuff like this.	That is awesome! I bet it is exciting. What is skydiving?"
"The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night!	It was a bit of an embarrassment.  Did you have to call a plumber to come out and fix it?"
"It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs!	Oh no! That's disgusting! Did you have a good laugh about it?"
"On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.	That is terrible. I hope you are okay."
"Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.	That must be nerve wrecking. I hope it goes well"
"You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still, I fret about it. I should just get on with it!	I'm about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack	It was good to have a friend help you out."
"she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her	That sounds like a lot to do! I hope you are ready!"
"Cell phones are great, but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable.	That is true.  I have been to a lot of places where people are staring at their phones.  It is like they are waiting for their phone to call them.  It can be very uncomfortable."
"Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline, and it was not an appropriate topic!	Oh wow, that sounds so uncomfortable! I hope that you were not embarrassed."
"Of course they did, some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where. I was humiliated,lol.	My dog died today :(	That is so sad. I have lost my dogs too many times."
"Yes, she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.	That sucks.  I am sorry.  I am sure you will be through with it."
"my daughter went on vacation with her friends and the house feels so lonely	That is sad.  How old is she?"
"they went to the beach for 1 week	That is sad, did she have a good time?"
"I'm moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can't wait! No more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!	That's exciting! I'm looking to move to a new apartment too.  What are you moving to?"
"Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?	I know that feeling! I'm moving in 2 weeks and I'm so ready for this."
"Eww. Yes, it is loud. Who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? That's nuts!	My wife has been out of the country for two months, and is coming back in a week!	Oh no. How did that happen?"
"It sure is.  It's just been me and the dogs all summer, I've gotten super bored :P	That's awesome! You guys are lucky! What do you do for entertainment while she's away?"
"I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!	Yeah! I'm really excited to apply."
"I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom. I am so grossed out by all the bugs here!	I can relate! I have had a bunch of spiders crawl all over me. I just can't stand them!"
"Spiders could bite me, which could really hurt!	i feel that with my training lately im going to win my next week soccer game	That's great! How many games have you played?"
"for this specific game for about 3 months	That is awesome, are you playing soccer?"
"After my wife and I moved I went through a while of unemployment.  It was really tough not being able to support us.	I understand.  It is hard.  I am glad to hear that you are doing better now.  What job are you doing?"
"It's gotten better now, but it could still get even better.  Just got to keep on moving.	That is a tough situation.  Do you have any plans to move?"
"i am really happy for next year i have a trip planned to go to india	Oh wow! Where are you going to go there?"
"yeah i have been planning this trip for over 2 years	Oh, that's a great trip! I've always wanted to visit India. What city are you going to?"
"I had the most wonderful week recently. My neighbors weren't here and I could do whatever I wanted without them stomping on my head!	That sounds so nice! Did anything exciting happen?"
"It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.	That's a nice thing for them to do."
"That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!	That's a little annoying."
"Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.	That is great. I hope they like the neighborhood."
"I went to work with my pants inside out, and I didn't notice until my secretary pointed it out.	oh no, did they get in trouble?"
"It was very embarrassing! At least I didn't go the whole day like that.	Yeah, that is embarrassing, but it's not like you can change the pants right in front of everyone!"
"The airport was completely empty the other day.	That's weird. Did you get a seat?"
"Home, but I thought LA would be crowded even at 4am, it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy.	That's not good. Did you get in anyway?"
"Made getting my connection super easy, and trust me I was in a hurry to get there. Odd how being alone can make you paranoid.	i cant wait to see my dog back home it has been 2 years since i see him	I am sure he is happy to see you too!"
"college, but i will be seeing him very soon i think	That's awesome. What breed is he?"
"So my youngest went to his first day of kindergarten today.  So proud of him.  Silly I know.	Oh wow! What did he wear?"
"I hope so should be home really soon.  Can't wait to hear all about it.  IT goes by to fast!	Oh my, I am sure you will be back soon!"
"I know my oldest just graduated,  It was like it was over in an instant!	A few months ago we were planning our wedding and I couldn't wait until the actual day finally arrived.	That's so exciting!  I'm sure it's going to be amazing.  Congratulations!"
"It was even better then expected. It was very small, but so happy how it turned out.	That sounds like a lovely wedding. I'm glad it was so small and special."
"i hate when my neighboors dog poops on my yard and she does nothing, i dont care if he poops if she picks it up	I know that feeling.  It's like they're not even human."
"hahaha i mean he does not do it often but it is not a bad idea	I bet, that's pretty gross"
"After studying and preaching for a few years, my husband was ordained to be a minister.	That's nice! I'm sure he's happy."
"Yes it is and he is so devoted to God and living for Him. I was so happy for him.	i love the church. I think it's so good to help out those in need and spread hope to people."
"Thank you.	This morning, my dog knocked down a while box of cereal and it spilled everywhere.	Oh, that is so gross.  What happened next?"
"Yes, and to make it worse, when I tried to clean it, she tried to eat, so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.	Oh no! I would have been so upset!"
"No, she only ate a little bit. I cleaned it up pretty quickly.	There was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it	That sounds great! I've been wanting to try out a new restaurant. What kind of food do they have?"
"I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive, small, and bland!	That is the worst! I hate when that happens."
"In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.	That's a bummer.  I'm sorry you didn't get to have a more cohesive team.  Did you end up leaving?"
"If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.	Yeah, that can be tough to deal with, especially in the workplace."
"I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol. I'm all for earnest discussion, but not at work!	My husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber. He was able to carry so much at once!	That is a great thing to have!"
"He is! I was so shocked but super attracted to him too!	Oh wow, that is amazing! I bet you were happy."
"i was really sad when my dog died last year	Oh no! I'm so sorry. What happened?"
"yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about	i understand, i lost my dog last year too, it was a really sad day for sure"
"A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer, but he got a job and had to cancel.	Oh well, that's a bummer.  Is he going to visit you soon?"
"Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.	It's always tough when you don't see your favorite people.  It's hard to understand why things happen.  I hope they catch that soon.  I'm sure they will.  It's just hard when you really really want to see them."
"I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.	My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday, we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe, have fun, and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call, we found out that she had a heart attack and died.	I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.  It's so sad that she didn't get to spend more time with you and your husband."
"Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.	Yeah I can imagine.  That is really sad.  I hope you were able to get through it.  I am sorry.  That is really sad.  I can only imagine how you must feel.  You must have been devastated.  I can only imagine how hard that must have been for you."
"Thank you.	My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her.	That's really sad. Did they get a description of her?"
"I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad	Oh my, that is terrible. Did you try to find her?"
"I love to play golf, but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again.	I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you're able to get back to playing."
"It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!	Yeah it's not easy to keep it up. I have to be so careful not to hurt it anymore. But it's worth it.  I'm a little bit lazy and I like to just sit and watch people play. But it's a great way to get exercise and be active at the same time. I don't think I could just walk anymore!"
"Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.	Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!	That is true, I have never gone skydiving before, I was a little nervous."
"I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.	That's so brave of him!"
"I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.	I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!	That's really cool! I love watching TV with my family and we always have to buy a new one every 2 months. What kind of tv do you have?"
"I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies.	That's great! I've been thinking about buying one. What kind is it?"
"I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies.	I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face!	That is so gross!  I don't think I'll ever go to a hotel again."
"I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled!	I would be so mad at that bug, I would be trying to kill it right now"
"I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything	That is okay. You will do great.  You will do just fine.  Remember that you are prepared for the interview and you can handle it.  It is not about being nervous, it is about being ready.  So, take it as a challenge and you can overcome the fear and do it well."
"a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job, they pay really good money	That is good, you are going to do well!"
"I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.	That sounds so cool! What did they do in high school?"
"I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.	I love high school memories, they are always fun to reminisce about. What a nice memory!"
"I actually sent her a message through facebook.	Yeah. I feel like we've lost that."
"I guess that's a good word for it.	I came home from work today and my wife had a new puppy waiting for me.	That's so adorable! I love puppies! How old is your puppy?"
"Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day.	That is nice.  What breed?"
"It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back.	I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled.	It's so frustrating when that happens, and when it happens on Ebay specifically, you feel even worse."
"I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.	Oh, man that's frustrating. I'm sure it was frustrating too."
"I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.	I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!	That's not good! Did you have a glass of milk to balance it out?"
"It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.	Yeah, self control is something to work on. I bet it was a bit embarrassing."
"It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!	my son is sick, he got this hand foot and mouth desease, nothing serious but he has a fever	That's no good, I hope he gets better soon.  Do you have any other remedies?  I always try to use herbal remedies to help with the illness.  I have heard of them being helpful in treating this type of illness."
"i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow	I'm sorry that your son is sick. Hopefully he feels better soon!"
"i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions	That's really cool. I bet you were really good. What was your name?"
"honestly, no, it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again	That is awesome.  Do you still dance?"
"I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.	That's awesome. Are you a fan?"
"I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!	I agree. I've been around golf since I was a kid too. I've played a lot over the years and have a good feeling about it."
"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	Oh my goodness.  Did she tell you about it?  I would have been upset.  Did you talk about it?"
"Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.	That is so cool that your mama bear side came out.  I wish people like that existed more."
"Yes, they did.	I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!	Oh wow! I'm so sorry. What kind of bones were it?"
"I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden!	That must have been gross. I would have called the police."
"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	I agree. Animals are very intelligent and loving creatures."
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	That is disgusting. They should be put on trial."
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	I'm sorry you were scared. What was it?"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	I hate raccoons. They are so mean and annoying. I hate them so much. I wish they would just disappear."
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	That is good of your friend.  I'm sure he will pay you back."
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	It's always good to have a friend who is willing to lend."
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	That's so sweet. Did you do okay?"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	Yeah that is cool.  I like blindfolds, I love it when they are blindfolds.  It is fun!  I like to blind myself with them too!"
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	I have seen them, but they don't usually fly at night."
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	I've been looking around my neighborhood for years and I'm pretty sure I've seen a drone flying around. I've got a feeling it's not from around here."
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	Yeah I can see how you would be."
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	Oh man that's pretty annoying! What's she like? Is she a friend of yours?"
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	I'm sorry to hear that. Pets are a part of our lives."
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	It was so hard for you.  I know how much we love our pets."
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	That sounds really scary, what did the doctor say?"
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	That must have been so scary!  I'm sorry he had to go through it.  I would have been so scared too.  I can imagine how worried you must have been.  I would have been too.  Hopefully he was okay."
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	That's terrible!  Did you call the hotel?"
"I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.	i hate salmon."
"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	Oh that's a great idea. I would have been so scared."
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	I would be too! I would be so worried about getting to work on time."
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	That's great! You're so smart!"
"Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.	That is great, I bet you have to work very hard to get where you are today."
"Criminal and social justice.	I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.	That was pretty scary. What happened?"
"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	Oh that is a great story.  I have never been on that roller coaster.  I don't know what it would be like.  I am a nervous person.  I am afraid of heights.  I think that would be a good idea for me."
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	That's so unfair. Why did they get to go?"
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	That is a bummer. Maybe you will get to see them this weekend."
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	I know, it really gets me. I have had my fair share of losing pets as well, but I've never lost a dog. They were my best friends."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	Yeah, that is a terrible loss."
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	It is going to be so much fun!"
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	I know what you mean, I was counting down my own trip."
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	Oh no.  That is horrible!  How did she do?"
"She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade	Yeah, she has a pretty good head on her shoulders."
"I finally had a day of, but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.	That is a bummer.  Do you have to do something that you wanted to do?  Or did you just have to wait till the weather cleared up?"
"I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.	It's a bummer, but maybe tomorrow will be better?"
"I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious	That was a great movie. I love horror movies."
"Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.	Yeah, that was pretty scary. I was really scared for my life."
"I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes	That sounds like you're trying to find the best deal for your insurance."
"a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is	I know right. It's crazy how expensive it is these days."
"I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!	oh no, did you have to do that?"
"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	I know, I just can't resist.  It's hard for me when I'm on the diet, but it's hard to resist when my mom is making cake!"
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	I am sorry to hear that.  What happened?"
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	I'm sorry to hear that. Panic attacks can be scary. Did you have to go to the hospital?"
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	That is terrible! I hate when people do that."
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	That is awful. I hope you find him soon."
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	That is horrible.  Did they leave without explanation?"
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	I feel sorry for you.  It is tough to go through a breakup like that.  Did you talk to a therapist?"
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	That is so nice of you!"
"I will, you never know when someone else is in need!	I know right! People are so nice these days."
"It is, I have been so blessed in my life!	My husband started college this week!	That's great. How long is the college?"
"Yes, he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!	That's great! What field is he in?"
"I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.	It's okay, I've had my share of picky eaters."
"No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.	It's always hard to find a place that can make food that is not contaminated."
"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	That's a pretty silly thing to happen."
"I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards	Oh, wow.  Did you spill it on someone else?"
"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	I know right? I was watching this movie and the camera kept following this girl, I thought for a second it was following her into a bathroom."
"I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.	That's so scary. Did you call the police?"
"I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.	My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!	I am sure they will not mind."
"People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying!	That is so annoying, you should tell them."
"I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.	It's okay, it's a great pizza! I've eaten an entire pizza by myself before."
"I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.	I bet you are going to have to work out a lot to eat that much!"
"When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!	That's great, what kind of job do you work at?"
"Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.	I am glad for you! You deserve it."
"Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!	Oh, I bet you are excited to start."
"I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous.	That's great! What age is the class you're going to teach?"
"It really is, you are molding their future!	I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce	That sucks. What kind of dog is it?"
"No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.	Oh no. I'm so sorry. That is awful.  I hope you find him."
"Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.	That is a hassle. Do you have one now?"
"They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	That sucks! I've had to deal with that too, and it's so frustrating. It's like they're trying to make it more difficult for you."
"It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.	My sister got a promotion at work last week!	I bet that was exciting for her. What did she get the promotion for?"
"She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)	That is awesome! I hope she keeps going!"
"My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.	That's awesome. Did she do it alone or with your help?"
"Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.	That's so cool! I bet you were thrilled!"
"My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!	I know how you feel!  He will do fine though.  He's going to be so busy and will have to be very smart and responsible.  It's good for him to be out there.  It's hard for him to go to college because he didn't have a choice otherwise.  He was forced into it because his parents were so worried about his future."
"I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.	I can understand. I am going through the same thing with my younger kids.  They are so different and they have their own personalities.  I am sure it is stressful for you.  But you will get through this too.  It's a new phase of life and you will get used to it eventually.  Just be there for your son, even if you're not in the house.  That will make the experience less stressful for him and for you too.  It's"
"Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?	I understand what you are going through. I have had a child of my own and it was hard. But you will get over it. You are going to have to let him go. I know you want him to succeed and that he is capable of it himself now."
"Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!	Yeah, he is 5 and I am pretty much his mother, but I can see him getting into the whole crazy world.  Its a lot of fun though.  Its nice"
"I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.	That's so cool!  Did you get a new one?"
"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	It is always fun to look back on old times. I hope you have many more fun times with your Nintendo 64"
"I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.	It's not easy. What major is it?"
"I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.	I'm glad you did well on the test. I've been there too, and it's hard to get back on track.  I'm sure you'll get back on track.  I'm sorry you're struggling in your major.  Maybe you could look at it as an opportunity to get more involved.  I know it's tough, but you're not a failure."
"Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.	I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made!	Oh, wow! Did he cook?"
"Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.	That's great. I wish I had that much free time."
"Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!	That's the worst."
"Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.	I would never forget to pick up the coffee filters."
"4	It's nice to have a good friend to talk to."
"Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.	I'm so sorry to hear that. I've had a few of those for years."
"My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.	I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday	Oh wow, I am sorry to hear that.  What do you do for work?"
"Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic	That's good. You're not going to end up in prison, right?"
"I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am	I know right? I'm glad you're happy."
"Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life!	That's awesome. What made you so happy?"
"I had such a bad cold last week, I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.	That is terrible! What did you do to help it go away?"
"No, thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still, I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.	I can imagine."
"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	Oh no. What did you do?"
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	Yeah, I can't believe she would do that! I would've eaten her ice cream!"
"She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.	Oh that's awful."
"Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!	I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.	I'm sorry, but you can't expect to be perfect all the time, especially when you have a baby on the way! You're going to have to work at least a little bit to provide for your family."
"I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.	It's normal to be nervous, but you'll do your best for the child and you'll be okay.  It's just a matter of time before you get used to it."
"I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome	That sounds like so much fun. Did you try to pet it?"
"I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing	That's awesome! Did you have a cat?"
"I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!	Oh, that's good. You must be nervous."
"That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.	Oh man, that is a lot of pressure on you."
"I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.	Yeah, that was really frustrating for me, but I knew I was moving out of the country. I just wish she would have gotten all of it."
"Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?	I'm glad you did that. You need to be honest with yourself and your feelings. You don't have to hold onto the past."
"Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.	That is true. They are very dangerous and can cause serious harm to people."
"I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!	I hope you didn't have to wait a long time for them to arrive. I'm sure you were in a lot of pain after."
"I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.	I can understand, it's scary when you are on the bridge."
"Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.	That is a terrible situation. I hope no one was hurt."
"2	I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!	I'm so scared of scorpions."
"Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.	I know right? I hope it goes back to the kitchen!"
"I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.	I am not sure what to do with that!"
"Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.	That sounds really good, I would be amazed too."
"I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise.	That is awesome. I'm sure you're lucky."
"I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.	I am so happy for you Kayla!"
"I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.	It's bad. I've heard that. I'm sorry to hear that."
"It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.	I'm sorry to hear.  Hopefully it will go well for you.  I'm a cancer survivor myself, and I know how you feel, it's hard to deal with but you will get through it."
"Thank you so much for being supportive. :)	I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.	That's scary! Did anyone see what was happening?"
"Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.	That is so scary! I'm glad you are safe!"
"Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.	I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.	That sucks! Did it work out okay?"
"Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.	That sounds pretty awful, but I hope he is feeling better and you're happy."
"Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.	I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	That is awful, how did you contract it?"
"I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.	I am sorry. I hope you get better."
"Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly	That does remind me of the good times."
"Super smash bros is a classic, never gets old, but yeah you're right	That's so cool, I'm a gamer too!"
"I had a job interview recently	I have too. What was it about?"
"Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.	That's not good. Did you try to prepare for it?"
"Speaking of co-workers, one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes, and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.	That's awesome! What kind of diabetes?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.	It's just life, right?"
"I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me	That's cool. What kind of movie?"
"Jurassic World. It was okay.	That is cool! I have been there too."
"I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.	I am so jealous of you.  Did you buy it for a special occasion or just because?"
"Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge.	I bet. He must be very good at that"
"I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones	That is ridiculous. I have been trying to get him banned for a while now."
"I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms	That is a good point, I think it is unfair that people are being banned."
"I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom, but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain	Oh wow, did you find them?"
"Yeah, nobody said anything	Yeah, I was so mad at that kid, I wanted to kick him in the face, but then he was laughing and saying something like ""I didn't even know there was anyone behind you!"""
"My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!	That is a terrible thing to say. What made you do that?"
"Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!	I am sorry to hear. I would have been angry too."
"Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.	I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.	"
"I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.	That's really nice of you.  What was the reason for him fleeing?"
"Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.	That's great!  You must be very proud of your son."
"No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(	Oh my, that's a good one!"
"He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.	So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?	I bet that's amazing!  How does he do that?"
"I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.	I'm sure he will."
"I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.	That's so cool. I'm not really into eating."
"Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!	That's a good point.  I can't say I'm the greatest eater in the world, but I'm certainly a contender."
"Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.	I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though	That's so nice of them! You should appreciate their kindness."
"Yes, I feel much better now.	Yeah, that is a nice boyfriend."
"I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.	I love looking back through old pictures of my kids."
"Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!	That sounds like a tough situation. I'm sorry she had to leave."
"I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.	My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.	It is a good thing she was not in a room with the furniture."
"I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.	Oh, that is a bummer. Did you have to clean it up?"
"Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.	I have a nephew that just started college. I am so excited."
"Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.	I am sorry but that is not a good thing."
"I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.	Yeah I'm sorry to hear that."
"My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions, probably a bad idea.	It is hard when the people in charge are not good to question their decisions. It makes me feel bad for trying to question them."
"My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.	That is sad. I have had to lose a few pets myself. It was a hard time."
"Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected.	I'm sorry, that is terrible. Did you call the shelter?"
"I broke up with my boyfriend last week, and nothing is the same without him.	That's tough, what happened?"
"Yeah, I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.	Oh my god, that's really sad, but I'm so sorry to hear you.  I know it's tough to deal with.  But I hope you find someone else that loves you.  I'm sure you will.  I'm just praying for you."
"I just made the most delicious pie	That's really great. What kind of pie?"
"It was apple pit,  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.	I love that kind of pie. What kind was it?"
"I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.	That's great! What are your favorite things?"
"I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's	That's true, but sometimes you gotta have some things to make you happy!"
"I just went camping and build the warmest fire.	That sounds like so much fun! What kind of fire did you use?"
"Yeah, I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.	That's cool, did you cook anything?"
"I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.	That is crazy, I would have stayed with friends or family."
"I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.	Oh wow, that's a pretty scary situation!"
"I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai	Oh no!  Are you going for vacation?"
"These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic	I agree, I've been to India.  It's a very different experience."
"I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.	That's a bummer. Did you find a way to get it back?"
"Of course, I'm not worried no one would steal from me.	I would be worried about that.  What are you going to do?"
"I can't help feel stressed about money	I feel you. I am stressed about my mortgage too"
"Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700	Yeah, that's terrible."
"I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family	That sucks, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"lol I played xbox games	Oh no! How long did she go?"
"I usually don't feel the greatest because of health problems.	I am sorry to hear that, I hope you are okay."
"Blood pressure and crohns disease, as well as, a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well, woke up happy and energized	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you take any meds for the blood pressure or crohns?"
"You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions, and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.	I bought one too!"
"Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.	I'm sure you have thought about that plan, you're smart! You're not worried?"
"Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?	I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.	It's okay. I would be nervous too!"
"I'm hoping for the best, but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!	That is good to know. I am sure you will do great."
"This is going to sound really pathetic, but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!	That's awesome! I'm a bit jealous."
"Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.	It is a nice thing to have a clean house."
"Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.	My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.	It must have been tough to adjust, I had my first child 2 years later. I think you must have had a lot of time on your hands."
"She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha	It's great that she's doing well."
"I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.	That's good. What's the location of the apartment?"
"Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!	I can understand that. It's hard to move to a new place, especially if you like the neighbors."
"Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.	Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.	That is quite a move. Did you have to sell anything in particular?"
"It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do.	That is amazing, I would love to travel full time."
"Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.	Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?	I do! I have a bunch of old photos from my college days, and my parents, and my grandparents. It makes me miss them. I wish I could go back to when I was younger and be able to relive those good times"
"It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean, I love my life right now, but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.	I do sometimes.  It's good to have a little perspective."
"I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.	That is very sad, what happened to you?"
"As much as I can, but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.	That's the life of an adult. It can be hard to relive those days."
"Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently, one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me, without my saying anything!	I love when people do nice for you. It's so sweet."
"It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.	That is so nice of him, he should be rewarded with a medal or something."
"The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!	My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh, i miss her so much	I know how you feel."
"yes but she lives in a different country, different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer	Yeah that's true, I know how that feels. I had a friend who lived in the same city, and we'd meet up every week. But then he moved away and we've only been able to see each other a few times a year."
"For me, one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.	It's one of my favorites too!  It's such a great way to relax and just unwind!"
"Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?	I love to read and I have a huge collection!  I'm a huge fan of historical novels and I also love the legal dramas!"
"There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.	My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!	That sounds awful. Did she send it as a joke?"
"In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place, and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!	That's so sad. I'm sure it really brings back memories for you."
"Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day, but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.	It's always sad to see a place go down."
"Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.	I am glad to hear that. I have moved around a few times and have been in some bad places. I think it would be nice to have a place where I know people."
"i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need	That's nice. How long have you had him?"
"he is a french puddle and i love him very much	That is very nice of you to take care of your little dog.  Do you live in a big house or is this your home?"
"One time as a surprise for my birthday, my college friends ""kidnapped me""	That's quite cool, how did they do that?"
"Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).	That sounds like a pretty funny experience.  Did you end up getting rescued?"
"Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.	i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street, i get really angry and sad at the same time	Yeah, I feel the same way. I think we should help out more with social welfare and get more people into the service system."
"yes i go to my local charity every weekend	That is so sad. What is your charity?"
"I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.	I've never won a scratch off before. How did you do?"
"I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much.	It's a nice surprise!"
"I'll try not to. I'll probably just save it :)	That's great. I bet that will come in handy. What did you win it for?"
"I was really lonely and depressed at one point, and I had a dinner date with a potato I put googly eyes on.	That is hilarious!  Did you eat it?"
"Much better, thanks :)  Yeah, I was really just doing anything to feel a connection.	It is good that you put googly eyes on your potato.  I would do that."
"I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!	Oh no! Did you get your shoes back?"
"I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him	That's so cute! Did you get them out of there?"
"I was confident that I was going to win that prize	That's great! What prize?"
"It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok	Yeah, I'm glad it was a gift card. I would have been so disappointed if I won"
"We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap	That is awesome!  What did they have?"
"It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was	That's good, I'm glad it worked out. What kind of sausage did you buy?"
"it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother	That's terrible, why are they not visiting?"
"yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital	That is really hard. I am sorry you have to go through that. I hope she gets better."
"I'm going to my home country next tuesday and i'm so excited i can't sleep!! It's been 4 years since i've seen my parents	Oh, that's awesome! Where do you live now?"
"Kazakhstan. I miss it and i miss my parents and friends so much	Oh wow! That's awesome! I'm sure you'll have an amazing trip!"
"not bruno but borat lol such a stupid movie. I honestly can't stand that actor and his toilet humor	I am super proud of my parents for graduating college	That is great.  How old are they?"
"Yeah, they are truly an inspiration that anyone can go to college no matter the age	I am glad to hear that"
"I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods	I am a camper too! What kind of camp?"
"aren't you afraid of the wild animals that will be roaming the area?	I came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag, gotten a sandwich I had forgotten I brought home from lunch, and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it.	I would be upset.  That is a lot of stuff in a bag."
"He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.	Oh, I'm sure that was a fun day for you. I hope he's not getting any of those things."
"I am impressed in my sisters camping skills. They are very good	That's awesome!  I've never been camping in my life, but I'm sure they're very experienced.  How long did they camp for?"
"We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents	That is really impressive. She must have been a good camper."
"I am confident that I will win the gaming tournament in Chicago	That's cool. What game are you playing?"
"Shooting game	It's a great tournament. What kind shooting game is it?"
"When I go up with my skydiving students I feel proud when they do well	That sounds like a lot of fun!  Are you both beginners or experienced?"
"I have been instructing for 12 years but skydiving for 25	That's cool! Are you an experienced skydiver yourself?"
"You shoudl definitely try it!	Well, recently at physical therapy I walked the length of the treatment room with the help of a cane. I'm feeling quite good about that!	That's good, you're doing great."
"Considering I've been using a walker for the past two years, yes it is. Thanks!	I bet!  That's a great accomplishment!  What was the treatment room?"
"Every day I practice - I'll be back on the golf course in no time, lol.	I am so upset that a public road in front of my house closed because of a limestone mine.	That's terrible.  What kind of limestone is it?"
"It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.	I bet that was a hassle for you. Did you get in a car?"
"I just have to wait for the city to fix the collapsed road and reopen the road again.	I am hopeful that I will win my ebay bid	Oh wow. What are you bidding for?"
"I am bidding on a rare comic book	That sounds exciting! I've never been to eBay before, but I've heard it is a really fun site. What comic book is it?"
"I was walking home one time and a really big dog came charging out from a house at me barking really loudly.	Oh no! That sounds scary! Did you run?"
"Thankfully not really, it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it, but it was really frightening until it was retrieved.	Oh my goodness! That sounds so scary. I'm glad it was just a dog. I would have been really scared!"
"it is incredible to see how technology has advanced these past days	That is true. I have seen so much improvement in technology."
"well the phones are basically a 1990's computer	That is true! I have an old phone and it's so much slower than my computer!"
"I ate an entire cake last night	Oh no! Did you feel guilty?"
"It was! I just couldn't stop! It was so good that I just had to keep eating	I can relate to that, my sister did that last week and it was so bad."
"I am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it	That is very kind of you!"
"Ehh, its not the best but it's not bad either\	Yeah, that is good to know, it's good that you are prepared for that"
"I was afraid when I saw that horror film in the theater	Oh yeah?  Was it a good one?"
"It was the First Purge	That was a scary movie, I love horror. What made you afraid?"
"Wandering around my little area of the world I am quite pleased with the variety of stores and restaurants here. I didn't expect it.	I love shopping!"
"Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well, I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.	It's good for the economy and for the environment."
"I find it hard to believe, myself! This is the rural south, yet there are fine dining restaurants, the aforementioned store, really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff.	i hate when i do dishes and touch food that was on the plate1! so gross. makes me wanna throw up	I hate that too. It's like I don't even know what I'm eating."
"because the food is all soggy and mushy. i don't know, such a yucky feeling	Yeah, it makes my stomach turn, but it's just the fact that it was my food and it's been sitting around"
"i really hate when my kids leave their dirty clothes on the floor	I am the same way.  I have a 2 year old and a 10 year old.  I am so mad every time they put their dirty socks and pants on the floor.  I have to pick them up off the floor every day.  I have been looking at those little vacuum cleaners that are for little kids.  I am sure it would save me a lot of time and work"
"yeah they even have a bin specially for that	That sucks.  My kids are always leaving things on the floor.  I have to pick it up and put it back every day.  I wish they would leave their dirty clothes on the floor like I did when I was a kid."
"i hate people that cut lane in traffic without signaling it	I agree!  I hate those people.  They have no idea what they're doing."
"yeah it really makes me mad to see that people dont care about these types of things	i agree, it makes me so mad."
"I found a rabbit that had been shot by someone in my yard	That is terrible! Did you find out who shot him?"
"Thank goodness it was dead, poor thing is not suffering, but some people can be so cruel.	I'm glad it wasn't a human."
"We had been holding off trying a new restaurant in town.	I bet you were excited about it?  Did it live up to expectations?"
"It's a little pricey and I'm worried I won't like the food and waste all that money. It has good reviews though	I've been to a lot of good restaurants, but I'm always looking to try new ones.  I'm not sure how to make the decision, but I think I'll try this one."
"Our local organic store now stocks Indian food made by a local Indian lady - heaven, heaven, heaven!	It's good that you have a local organic store in your area, they are a great resource for healthy food."
"About once a week. Her husband works in the store, so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!	I can understand why you miss that food!"
"Well, my uncle's Indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook, and she taught me. But I'm disabled right now so can't cook much. This is such a find!	I have been working on  my jump shot all month.	It is good to work on your skills"
"I hope so I have a big horse tournament against my buddies I want to win the 100 bucks prize.	That's awesome! You're a winner in my book! What position do you play?"
"One of my neighbors (next building and two floors up) plays talk radio every morning Very Loudly.	Oh wow!  What does that sound like?"
"Not until about 8am, but it's so loud I can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed. Idiot man!	You should probably call the police and report him as he's probably doing that all day long."
"Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!	That is so annoying. I don't know why people have to be such idiots."
"I've called management twice about it and both times he quietened down - for about two days. Then up it goes again!	Oh no, that's terrible, that is not the way you want to start a job"
"Nothing in life is certain, the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.	I know what you're saying. I've been there. It's a hard life, but at least you know you have some control over it."
"I have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas.	It's a fun experience. I've never gone to a concert."
"The show is in three months, I hope she sings he late 90s hits.	Oh wow!  I bet you can't stop dancing!"
"Our Property Management team just emailed me to say I've got the apartment I wanted!	That's great!  What did you want?"
"It really was - I can't wait to move in! It's a smaller apartment, but quieter (I hope!).	Oh wow!  That's great!  I hope you have a great time moving in!"
"You'll get there. It really is nice to have your own space. Do you live at home?	That is great! I live in a big house, but it's a bit lonely. I'm moving to a smaller house, and I'm really excited to get out of my house and start my new life. I'm a new mom, and I have a little boy."
"Good for you! Start saving your money now - believe me, you'll need it!	I was on the patio and a giant roach crawled out from underneath.	I am so grossed out just thinking about it"
"It was almost as bug as a golf ball I felt like throwing up.	Yeah, that is the worst.  I would have to throw it back out to the yard."
"I have quite a long drive ahead of me next month. It's about 1/12 hours, but I've don it before so I'll be fine.	Yeah I've been in some long drives."
"I put music on and open the window. Otherwise I'll disappear into my own little world, and that's not a good thing to do when you're driving!	That's a good idea though!"
"It really helps to pass the time, not to mention it can calm you down. And the drive's quite easy and very pretty, which help.	I was so amped yesterday. I got to pick up my now computer for the store!	I am happy for you. What kind of computer did you get?"
"It was just a new model HP that I bought but I'm so excited!	I love getting things! What did you get for it?"
"I get my groceries delivered to my home and am so grateful for the service.	It's great that there are people like that out there."
"It helps me a lot as I'm disabled and it can be quite difficult. Anyway, I hate grocery shopping!	That's good that you have a service that can make it easier for you."
"Ugh. And don't even get me started on ""mini-shoppers"" racing round the aisles screeching! Much better to have someone else buy for me!	I just watched the notebook, pretty depressing movie.	Oh, what movie?"
"It's a romantic love story. Doesn't end so well for the main character.	Oh, that's a good point. I didn't expect it to be so depressing."
"my little boy learned how to  count to ten eeven know he is super young	Yeah that is great.  I am sure you are so proud."
"yeah i was so proud of him as well i thought i would have to wait months till he got to that point	Oh, that is awesome!  I have a 2-year-old and he is learning to count too!  He's getting it fast!  How long has it been?"
"I just went to the park today.	I'm glad you had fun there. What was it like?"
"I was going to hang out, but I ended up tripping and smashing my toe up into a rock.	Oh man. Did you get a bruise?"
"my little brother dumped a glass of water on me this morning to wake me up	Oh, wow, that's so gross!"
"yeah i was furious we are in some sort of a prank war	That sucks. Did it spill on you or was it a small spill?"
"Last night there was a really strange animal screaming outside my window in the middle of the night	I think it was a raccoon, or a coyote. They are all around here."
"Turned out to be a skunk! It sounded so strange!	Oh no. I hope it didn't spray you."
"When I was in college I travelled all over Europe one semester.	That's really fun, did you go to any popular cities?"
"I love all over Italy, but I also loved Germany and France and Spain.	That is so cool! Did you visit any places in particular?"
"Yes it was truly an amazing time meeting people from so many different cultures	We went on vacation and the kids stayed home. I couldn't believe it when I walked in the door and the house was totally clean.	That's great! Did you have fun?"
"Wonders never cease to amaze me. First time for everything I guess, lol	I know right! I was like that when I was a little kid. My mom would clean up the mess and make sure the toys were put away. I think she was just trying to save me from the mess."
"I totally thought the same thing. Too funny (but you might be right)	I feel the way you do about new things, it is so exciting"
"I went ziplining the other day	I've always wanted to do that! I bet it was so exhilarating!"
"I found it using the Internet.  It was a lot of hiking but they had a lot of long lines.	Oh wow. That must have been a lot of walking."
"Yes I did - I had a great time and met some fun people.	I smashed my finger in the door last night	Oh wow, what happened?"
"I iced it up but I was so mad because it was my fault for slamming the door	oh no that sucks. Did you call an ambulance for it?"
"We might have to put our dog down soon.	Oh no. What happened?"
"Yes, she's getting older and she's just getting to that point she can't move around good.	Yeah that can be tough. But it is hard to think that it will be the last time you see your dog."
"i am really lucky that my cancer got cured many years ago	That is amazing! How did that work out for you?"
"i did it with chemo and it took a lot of time and effort	That is so awesome. I am so proud of you!"
"I am so ready to move.	I know, it is exciting and scary."
"California. I'm ready for my kids to try out some new schools and be happier :)	That's awesome! I've always been a bit jealous of people who live in Cali, but I've always wanted to try it out for myself! I'm not sure what school districts you'll be moving into, but I'm sure it'll be an adventure!"
"i cannot stand seeing people throw trash on the streets	That is disgusting. I have seen people throwing trash on the street and I get angry."
"i know right i feel like doing that every time but i dont want to get arrested hahaha let karma get them,	Yeah, that's the way it is sometimes.  You can feel the frustration and anger, but you know you're not doing anything to help.  You can't really do much about the garbage that people don't care about."
"I am by myself most of the time in a isolated area. I only have animals as my friends.,5|5|4_5|5|5,	I can understand that.  How many animals do you have?"
"Sometimes it makes me sad, but than I think how happy my animal friends makes me feel.	I bet it is a little lonely.  I am alone most of the time as well.  But it is nice to have animals around, it makes me feel better"
"I bought 100 packs of magic cards and didn't get a single good card.	i hate that"
"Collectible cards. My friend bought only a few packs and got incredible cards.	I am not sure what to say about this. I have a few packs myself, but I don't think they are worth 100 packs."
"I feel really bad that we have to board our dog when we go on vacation next week.	Oh that is bad.  Do you take her on a vacation with you?"
"We are going to a place at the beach that doesn't allow pets with some friends. Our vet also has a kennel there to board dogs so I guess that's what we'll do. She'll be so sad though.	I hope it doesn't bother her too much."
"I actually recently applied for a few jobs myself, Crossing my fingers for something better than my current one.	That is so cool. I am a bit envious of you. What kind of work are you looking to get?"
"Current job doesn't pay enough, I'm waiting for the stars to align and something better to come along.	That's good that you're looking for a better opportunity."
"I just bought some tickets to win the price at the state fair.	It sounds fun! Are you going with family or friends?"
"I know its not likely but I really want to win the new mustang	That is awesome! Do you have tickets for every fair you attend in the US?"
"I am so scared to live in my neighborhood. There is people that come around shooting their guns.	Yeah, that's a scary situation to be in, especially when you're not sure what the outcome might be."
"I have been thinking about moving but I have lived here for over 30 years. The area has changed so much.	That is a scary place to live.  I hope they are not using the guns for protection from the other people in the neighborhood."
"My fear is that I wont find a safer place. Not much money to find a good neighborhood to move into.	I went out to the country to gaze at some stars.	I love looking at the stars, it's so peaceful. I've never been out there before."
"I was overwhelmed by the enormity of the universe.	I have never been to the country.  What is it like?"
"My kids birthday was last weekend, my whole family showed up! they didn't even tell me they were coming	That's great!  I bet they had a blast."
"Yea, i do. hah. They live a few states away, which is why it was so unexpected. don't see them often.	I love my kids and my family, so it's always great to see them"
"Bought two pairs of shoes recently.	I'm sure they were expensive. What brand did you buy?"
"Yeezy's, the worst part is the second pair of shoes were both right footed.	Oh, that's a bummer. I've heard the yeezys can be a bit tricky for right-footed people to get the right fit"
"I read the instructions to set up my fit bit 100 times.	Yeah, that's a lot."
"I need it to work perfectly I need to get ready for a marathon and I need it to track my progress.	I am sure you can get it to work, it is a pretty easy process."
"I have a big speech to give.	I hope it goes well! What's the speech about?"
"Well I don't really know many of the people I will be in front of, so hopefully I don't stutter or something.	I hope you do well."
"I left my purse at in the seat in starbucks.	I would have felt bad for that.  Did you get a refund?"
"I was in a safe neighborhood so i wasn't worried.	I would never leave my purse in the car."
"I was able to say the entire alphabet backwards.	I bet that was fun!"
"no time, I have a great memory, It was on a dare I nailed it perfectly.	That's cool.  Did you do it at work or just for fun?"
"I have been looking at pictures of crazy car crashes.	Oh no, what happened?"
"Seriously now I can't drive anywhere. I can't even leave the house for fear of car crashes.	Oh, I understand. That must be really scary."
"I was at the mall yesterday. I sat down for a few minutes and when I looked away someone stole my shopping bags.	That's terrible. I hate that when people do that to others. I always try not to sit there too long."
"No. I didn't notice right away. How could someone do that. Im so so mad!	I know how you feel.  I've been robbed of my wallet once.  I had left it unattended and someone took it.  Now I always lock it."
"I was in a hospital and a guy game in with some really bad burns.	That sounds really scary.  Did he end up getting better?"
"No idea, but I had never seen something like that in person. It looked painful.	That must've been scary. I'm sure he's okay now though."
"I saw a guy deadlift 700lbs at the gym the other day. I was in awe.	I can't imagine how scary and difficult that would be! I would be too."
"Yeah it is, it seemed like he had every plate in the gym on the bar. I've never seen someone lift that much in person before.	Yeah, I have seen people do it too. It's amazing how strong people can be!"
"I got to go to a cat cafe when no one else was around!	That's cool! Did you get to pet the cats?"
"It was! I was the only one around so all the cats came to spend time with me	That is awesome! What kind of cat cafe did you go to?"
"I walked out to my car theo ther day and felt something hit my face.	It was your face?  What happened?"
"A GIANT SPIDER! It was terrible and I was so startled!	That's a scary spider. Did you get a picture of it?"
"When I can home, my cat was laying on the pile of laundry that I had pulled out of the dryer before work. Now it's covered in hair.	That's a stink. I'm sure your cat is not happy with you for pulling it out of the dryer before work. I have never been in that situation."
"Well it's pretty inconvenient, that's for sure. Nothing I can really do about it now. Just got to keep the door closed I guess.	That is pretty annoying. I hope your cat doesn't get sick."
"Today when I went into my roommate's office to fix the internet, I noticed the collar of his old cat that passed away. I miss her.	I'm sorry to hear that, what was her name?"
"Yeah, she wasn't my favorite cat, but I still miss her. Cancer sucks.	That's so sad. I have a cat too and I miss her. I hope she's doing well"
"Sometimes an old song runs through my head and I remember the times where I used to listen to songs so many times that I memorized the words	It's nice to look back on the good old days."
"Like old kind of emo songs, full of angst and whatnot	That's really interesting.  I've never really had that experience before."
"The other night when I was taking my dog out to go to the bathroom really late. I heard some rustling in the bushes and panicked.	Oh, I hope it wasn't anything scary?"
"Oh she was ready to fight whatever it was, but she was on a leash thankfully. No, I'm just really easily started, all that anxiety over an armadillo. Im so ashamed lol.	Yeah I know the feeling.  It's always a little bit of a nervous wreck."
"I found an injured bird in my yard today, it was only a baby to!	Oh wow! That's so kind of you to do! I'm sure it was a very good bird."
"Yes, I had to call my local wildlife rescue center to come get it. I hope its okay, they said they think it has a broken wing.	That's really kind of you to do that.  It's nice to help out."
"I have a friend coming over soon and I keep checking out the window to see if theyre here yet.	Oh that sounds fun!  What time do they come in?"
"I am making dinner for the both of us. I have a roast in the oven. It smells so good I can't wait until it is ready.	I can't wait for my roast dinner either, I have to get it ready for the weekend!"
"My boss finally noticed my hard work and gave me a pay raise!	It's great to see people get recognition for their hard work. What was your boss's name?"
"No not at all! I'm excited because now I can plan a family vacation for this winter.	I am sure that is great. I am happy that my boss is paying me!"
"I have a deadline at work coming up.	Oh, I hope you do well! What kind of work do you do?"
"It is top-secret. But every time I try and get serious work done, my co-workers won't leave me alone.	That sucks!"
"My roommate has been gone all week. I don't have anything to do without him here.	I bet that's not fun!"
"It's just not the same doing something by myself. I don't have anyone to go do stuff with.	Yeah, I feel you."
"We just adopted a dog from the shelter last week and I think she is sick with parvo.	Oh no! I hope she is okay!"
"It's a deadly dog illness, basically a virus that often leads to death. We think she caught it at the shelter.	I'm sorry.  Do you think it was the shelter's fault?"
"Yes, they have to do a fecal sample and test it. We take her in tomorrow to see.	Yeah, they need to test her. It's pretty serious."
"Thank you!	We are planning on going on a cruise in December!	That sounds like a lot of fun! Are you planning on doing anything special on the cruise?"
"No, I went on one in highschool but first one with my husband and daughter. It's has been so fun planning it together!	It's so nice to be planning it together with the people you love!"
"I came home today and my roommate was cooking dinner, all i had to do was fix my plate. It was so nice.	Yeah, sometimes it's nice to have a little help from a roomate"
"I sure did, and the food was delicious. I'll have to surprise him with dinner next time.	Yeah that's nice to do."
"What kind of pizza place is it?	We are suppose to be having a bad storm this weekend.	I'm a little worried, I live in a flood zone. I hope it doesn't get too bad."
"Yes, makes you wonder if its global warming. I have been stocking up on food and supplies. Ready for the worst.	Oh wow, I have heard that. I am a little worried."
"My husband just got called back into work, was not expecting that!	That's terrible! What are you going to do?"
"Someone stole some gear, so they called everyone back to investiage. We had just sat down to eat dinner to!	That is terrible. I hope they are able to find out who did it."
"He is in the military so technically he can be called in 24/7 and is payed on salary!	I just prepared an amazing plate of mac and cheese.	I'm not really into mac and cheese."
"It is so good if you add the right amount of pepper.	I love mac and cheese.  I add some bacon bits on top of my mac and cheese."
"I just bought a brand new necklace and shirt.	Oh wow! What are you going to wear it with?"
"Not sure I just though it looked cool. Hopefully it gets me noticed.	That's awesome! What kind of style are you going for?"
"My dog keeps having accidents in the house! I'm getting fustrated.	I know the feeling.  Do you have a pet?"
"Thank you, I will. I think she is doing it to mark her territory, it started when we brought a new dog home.	I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm sure it will get better over time."
"When I was promoted to Team Leader at work, I really felt like all my hard work had paid off, to some extent, and I gave myself a little pat on the back.	I bet that was a good feeling. Did you do well?"
"Yes, and it can be difficult at times to move up at places, especially when there are many other long timers there!	Yeah, it is hard to be in a position where you are the best. But I think it also depends on how you do it, so it is good that you are in a position where you can make a difference and help others."
"I can't wait to go to the water park this weekend.	That sounds like a lot of fun! I love water parks."
"Yes, my kids love it so they are going to be so happy when we get there.	I have never been to a water park."
"I'm just laying in bed with a scented candle burning in my room and my cat on my lap, things couldn't be any better.	It's like a little oasis of peace in your home!"
"Yeah my kitty is just purring away, we're having a good time watching youtube.	That's great. What kind of cat is she?"
"My mom sent my daughter a toy I played with when I was a child!	That is nice of her."
"Yes, it was neat to see her play with it. It'll make some great photos, since I have one of me playing with it at her age.	It will make great memories for her."
"Six months ago my boyfriend proposed to me and we are getting married next month. I can't wait	That is so exciting! Congratulations!"
"On a honeymoon, lol? Not right away. He is totally the man of my dreams. I'm so lucky	I am sure you will have a wonderful honeymoon"
"My husband might loose his job, I'm not sure what we will do if he does.	That's terrible!  I hope he doesn't.  What will he do if he loses his job?"
"The company is downsizing and cutting a lot of departments. His hasn't been cut yet but there are rumors!	That's bad.  I hope he can get it together and find a new job.  It's tough when you are in your career."
"I found out my childhood cat passed away	I'm so sorry. What happened?"
"I do too, it was so sad.	It's hard when that happens."
"My daughter is such a talented and creative young artist. When she was nominated to be 'Most Artistic' at school, I felt very secure she would win, because she really is amazing!	I bet.  How did she do?"
"She did! I know I'm the parent so can be biased, but it's really so impressive how well she draws, paints, shades....	I am so proud of your daughter! She is a talented artist."
"I was very ready for my first car crash	That sounds terrifying! Did you get any injuries?"
"I had all the paperwork set and ready, I had a blanket cause it was in the winter.	I bet! How did it happen? Did you get hurt?"
"Last night a fly got into the bedroom and wouldn't stop trying to land on my face	Oh that is so annoying. What was it?"
"It was terrible! Right as I was about to fall asleep the dang thing would land on my nose!	That sounds awful. I hope it didn't get into the kitchen."
"I left my dog alone in the house when I went to get the mail. While I was gone she got in the cat box and ate the cat poop, super gross.	Yeah that's a gross situation.  I would have to find another way to get the mail."
"There was nothing to clean.... she definitely swallowed it. I stuck her outside cause I can't even think about dealing with her licking anything right now. Gives me the hebbie jibbes thinking about it.	I can't believe you left her alone! That was gross! I would have been so mad if that had happened to me!"
"I have been practicing my speech for days now.	That's awesome.  Did you have to give it to anyone?"
"I have the perfect delivery and all the talking points drilled down. I will be impressive	I am sure you will be very confident."
"My cat puked up a hairball this morning and I had to clean it up.	I'm sorry, did it hurt?"
"She pukes up hairballs every now and then I have some salmon flavored jelly i can feed her, but it happens so infrequently I forget to.	I have never heard of a hairball puked up."
"When I left the bathroom in high school once I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe.	That must have been a very embarrassing situation. Did anyone find out?"
"Yeah it sure was, you know how mean teenagers can be. It's like they have no empathy or think about what if it was them.	It's like they're not human beings at all!"
"I got a new type of pizza I wanted to try	Oh, I love that kind of food.  I had a pizza once that was made from a bag.  It was so bad!"
"A normal pepperoni but it was terrible!	I'm sorry to hear that, did you order it online or at a store?"
"When I was in Costa Rica I was having a lot of trouble with the address of my AirBnB, I was so lost.	That is a problem. I have heard that some places in Costa Rica don't have addresses."
"It was because my Spanish was a bit lacking, it also didn't help that people kept giving me bad directions. I eventually stumbled on it but for a while I was worried I would never make it there.	I'm glad you made it. I've always wanted to go to Costa Rica!"
"I was caught off guard when the gun fired for a race I was in	That is scary. What was happening?"
"Yeah, I forgot to take my sweat pants off, that's when I realized running isn't for me	Oh man, what happened?"
"I slept with a new girl last week	I am glad that she is not a pervert!"
"Not really	That is a little too early for you?"
"Not really. We were very high. We were drunk. But now I feel bad for my partner	I was eating dinner with my husband last night and I was so happy	That is nice! What were you eating?"
"I whole heatedly agree! It was just so freeing and peaceful	Oh wow!  I am so glad for you.  I am not sure I have the same kind of experience.  How did it feel?  I am sure you are happy.  I hope you can continue that feeling!"
"Someone came to my door with a gun the other day.	I hope everything worked out well!"
"I called the police after he robbed me.	oh my god, that sounds really bad, i hope you are ok."
"No, thankfully, I'm fine but scared.	I left my food on the coffee table and my dog ate it.	It is a good thing that he ate it!"
"No, she is fine. I had to find something else to eat though.	I hate it when dogs eat our food."
"I was trying to study for a test one night and my brother was listening to loud music	Oh no! What happened? Did you guys have a fight?"
"I would have totally flipped the circuit breaker if I knew how, but I just asked him to turn it down	I would hate that. I am a bit lazy myself and I like to listen to loud music."
"My dog tried to eat her poo	Oh my gosh. That's a very common thing for dogs to try to do. Did you have her checked by a vet?"
"It probably will.	Oh my god.  That's gross.  Did she get it?"
"I borrowed a book from the library the other day but I left it outside	Oh, did you find it?"
"Yes it did, unfortunately	I hate leaving books outside.  I always forget to do it."
"I got something nice the other day, chocolates from my husband	That sounds delicious!  What kind?"
"It was, and he does that type of thing a lot.	That is so sweet of him. I have been married to him for a few months now, and I have to say, he does that type of thing a lot, but it is always nice. It makes him feel good. It also makes me feel nice. I like to get chocolates sometimes. It is a nice treat for myself."
"I have problems with the city and their constant tax increase on my property.	That is terrible.  Are they taxing you for your home?  I am not aware of any tax on my home."
"Maybe A move out of my state would be the answer and a blessing to the high taxes.	Oh, I understand.  I'm not from here, but my neighbors are.  They are in a different state and have a lot less taxes.  But I can't afford the taxes they have to pay in the state they live in.  It's like they are paying taxes on the taxes of the people they live in."
"I always do the same, it's not had when they are perfect.	I do that too, it's not had when they are perfect"
"My girlfriend, How about you? do you have a partner?	That is a good thing.  I am happy to have you.  I have been with her for 2 years.  She is perfect for me!"
"Wow. Looks like you are doing a good job.	I close on my new house Monday, I didn't think I was going to be able to purchase it but I believed in my mortgage adviser	That is amazing! I am so happy for you. Congratulations!"
"Surprisingly it's been a painless process. I'm very thankful.	I'm happy for you."
"I gave my friend some money that she said she would pay back but she hasn't yet.	I'm sorry that happened. Did you get your money back?"
"I really thought  I could count on her, but now I haven't even heard a word from her. Lesson learned I guess.	That is terrible. I hope she gets it."
"I actually did this, i'm terrible.	That is a good joke. What did you do?"
"I stole my mother's card details to pay for a subscription.	That is terrible.  What happened?"
"We are going to Six Flags this weekend and my kids want me to ride the roller coaster with them.	I love roller coasters, but I'm not sure about the safety."
"I'm really hesitant to get on. It's been a long time since I've ridden one and I don't think I'm going to like it at all	I don't think I could ride that either! I've heard the worst stories about people falling out and hurting themselves."
"When i lost my dog of 12 years i was devastated...	That is terrible! Did you get him back?"
"It is a horrible experience and i hope that i never have to go through it again, how did yours die?	That's terrible. What happened?"
"I think that in the past i have spent time caring about things that aren't important.	I agree.  What do you mean you think?"
"Money mostly. I just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life.	That sounds pretty frustrating.  Do you have any plans to change that?  Do you think that you could ever have enough of money to be set for life?"
"I love thinking back to when I was growing up and the neighborhood we lived in. So many great memories.	That is a nice way to look at it.  I bet there are many great memories there."
"It really is. All the neighbors were so close, we even spent holidays together. It was like a really huge family all living together.	It is nice to have those memories."
"Do you watch any YouTube at all?	I do all of the time, especially when my kids are asleep."
"What type of content do you like watching?	I do, I watch some funny videos and some educational videos. I also like to watch documentaries."
"The other night I wanted cake when I woke up in the middle of the night	That's so weird, how did that happen?"
"The worst part was that there was a cake to be eaten! SO I DID! Lmao	I'm sure you had a lot of cake!"
"My husband was teaching me how to make a steak. The flame was so warm!	I'm glad you got it right. I'm not sure if you were joking or not, but if you were joking, it was a funny one."
"It was but I was so sad that I was so scared	That sounds scary! Did he teach you how to not burn it?"
"I looked at my childhood photos the other day. I remember alled the fun I used to ahve	That's great! What did you remember most?"
"I do to. It was much easier then for me	That's great, what did you do in the past?"
"I have to rely on my prayers and my belief in a high power to get me through not having a job and no money.	It can be really tough when things don't work out.  I've been there a couple of times, but I'm not there right now, so it's hard not to feel like you don't deserve to have it.  I've been working for a few days now, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to work.  I'm going to go out for a run, and then I'm going to see if I can find something for lunch."
"I remind myself all the time that it will work out and all will be good again.	That is so true, I have a lot of friends that are in the same boat as me right now. We all have to rely on our faith in order to get through the tough times."
"I was very sad when I found out that my neighbors houses were going to be demolished because the city ordered it..	I'm sorry to hear that, what happened"
"Nope. They bought them out at city valued tax prices and they have 60 days to find another place to live.	That's a good point, but you have to understand that they're probably just not in the right financial place. I'm sure they have some good reasons for doing that."
"I feel off my bike the other day. it hurt.	I hope you didn't hurt yourself.  Did you check yourself out?"
"A few scraps to my elbows but nothing major, i was just embarrassed.	That's not good, did you take it to the doctor?"
"Hey, Any interest in video games?	Oh, I love video games!"
"great, I'm anticipating the release of Fallout:76 how about you?	I'm not really into games, but I do play some. I have some good friends that we play online, but I haven't played anything recently."
"Isn't it annoying when your friends earn more money then you but you work just as hard.	That's so true. It's like they're cheating the system."
"Very true. I suppose i just get a bit jealous sometimes.	That is a pretty normal thing to feel.  I mean I work hard too.  It just seems like my friends have more opportunities than I do."
"I exams went really well this year, How has your year gone?	That's great! Congratulations! What are your plans for the future?"
"Thanks, I am feeling a lot more confident in myself. Remember the year can only get better.	I am feeling the same way, it's been a good year. I'm excited for next year."
"Had a good day today, i think i was prepared for everything. how has your day been?	Yeah! It was great. I went to the beach and had some fun. It was great!"
"Well i had a meeting with my boss who gave me a promotion today so i'm over the moon!.	Oh that's great! Congrats! That is amazing!"
"I got attacked by a swarm of bees a few months back. Needless to say it hurt.	That's terrible. I'm glad you're not too badly hurt!"
"It was, they we're absolutely furious with me for some reason.	I would have been so angry!"
"Do you remember the old video games you used to play?	I do, I used to love playing Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Jump.  I haven't played either of them in years."
"The nostalgic moments when you play them again is brilliant. You should try it.	I remember them so well. They were so much fun!"
"Life seems to be going perfect right now, how about you?	That's great. What happened?"
"Well that's even better news! i'm feeling hopeful for the both of us.	That is good news. I'm happy for you."
"A girl i went on two dates with wanted a copy of my house key, yikes!	Oh wow, I'm glad you didn't give it to her.  Why would she ask for it?"
"I don't know, she said she needed a place to hang out between jobs. Stupid me actually gave it to her.	That's kinda rude, but I guess it's a job. I don't think I could ever go out with someone again."
"hah, thanks. So far so good.	My girlfriend forgot to order the Chinese food yesterday...	That sucks. What did you order instead?"
"Was annoyed and disappointed so i ended up having a sandwich instead. bad times.	Yeah, I'm sure you didn't enjoy that."
"My dog puked all over the carpet a few weeks back.	I bet that was a pain!"
"Was absolutely disgusting but luckily it did come out easy.	I'm sure it was a pain to get out! Did you have to clean it up before you went back to work?"
"The other night I found my cat laying dead in the side of the road	I am sorry to hear that.  I had lost my cat a few months ago."
"It's tough. I was crying so hard that I had to call my husband to come pick us up	I am so sorry to hear that.  I am sure it was very upsetting.  I am sure it was very difficult to deal with.  I hope you are okay and that everything worked out well.  I hope the cat was able to be cremated.  I am sure it was a difficult time.  I hope the memories will stay with you."
"My family dragged me along to visit an underground cave recently, I was pretty nervous.	I have been there, and I would not have liked to have been as young as I am now."
"It was nice, after i got over the fear from being 23 stories underground.	Oh, that's pretty cool! I have always wanted to visit one!"
"Hah, no i wasn't thinking of being trapped. It just seemed like more effort to breath for some reason.	Had a job interview the other day.	That's awesome! I hope you got it. What job?"
"I think it went alright, i was incredibly anxious about it.	I bet it was a nerve-wracking experience for you. Did you get the job?"
"Ate my flatmates last chocolate bar earlier.	I'm sure it wasn't a good idea"
"Nope, i do feel a bit guilty about it but they should have hid it better.	That is no good.  Did you tell them about it?"
"I went bungie jumping with some friends but I was reluctant to jump.	That's a fun way to get some adrenaline. Did you have a good time?"
"Yes, I don't like heights at all. I did eventually muster the courage to jump, however.	That's great! What was it like?"
"I always try to tell my kids they need to be kind and understanding to others, no matter what.	Yeah, I think we're all pretty bad kids at heart."
"They try but it's hard when there are so many bullies at school. I wish other parents would try to do the same.	I am so glad you are looking out for your kids!  It is hard to see them go through tough times and then be told they need to be more like the bullies.  I try to remind them that everyone is on the same side and they should be kind to others.  I am sure it will get better for them."
"Do you know how much work goes into video games?	That's right, it's a lot of work."
"I was really impressed as some games it can take over 10 years.	I know! I am so impressed. I am a gamer and I play a lot of games"
"An old girlfriend contacted me looking for a one night stand, I had to decline.	That's so rude."
"Hah, they can be fun. Though my partner would not have appreciated it!	Oh, I'm sorry, that's terrible! What happened?"
"I went to a family reunion at my grandparents' house.	That's a nice way to spend time with family. Did you have fun?"
"It was enjoyable for sure, and poignant too.  It brought up lots of memories of my childhood.	That's really cool. I have family reunions too. What were some of your favorites?"
"I had a chance to sell my stake in ice juice for a nice little profit.	I love ice juice. Did you sell it?"
"No, I want to keep it because I have faith in the company doing really well longterm.	It's hard when you want something to be so much better."
"My daughter started kindergarten recently, i walked her in and met her teacher.	That's so exciting! I'm sure she's very proud of her!"
"Very nice, I just cant believe how grown up my little girl is getting.	Yeah, I have a 4 year old."
"6	I lent my brother 200 dollars so he could buy cryptokitties.	That is so generous."
"I really couldn't tell you some kind of digital cat, he says he will pay me back, so hopefully it all works out.	That's nice of your brother. I have a similar situation where I lent money to my sister. I don't know if she's going to pay me back. I hope she doesn't go bankrupt. I'm not a good person at all."
"Everyone wanted to go skydiving for my birthday.	It's a great idea.  I've always been afraid of heights."
"I'm pretty sure that my greatest fear is my chute not releasing and plunging through the sky into the ground. Oh well you only live once.	It's a good feeling, but you still can't help but worry about the worst."
"I didn't notice but I was walking around all day with a sock on my shirt!	Oh wow! Did you have to get it off?"
"On my back! I went to work like this!	I'm sorry that happened. Did you have to go home and change?"
"Someone decided to slash my car tires, key my car, and bash in my windshield.	That's pretty scary. Did you report it to the police?"
"Probably a spurned former lover. Glad I had insurance.	That's awful! Did you have insurance?"
"I have to give a speech at my fathers funeral. I drew the short straw.	I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. I'm sure it's hard to see him go."
"Not really, I just needed to make sure that It goes off without a hitch. I don't want to embarrass my Mother.	That must be very hard for you."
"I've been working at my same job for 12 years.	That's awesome! I'm glad you have that job."
"Yes I do.  Its a fun job.	That's awesome! What do you do at your job?"
"Yes I am a skydiving instructor so it is fun	Oh, I love skydiving! I've never jumped, but I've been in a simulator."
"Yes I love it	On a recent trip there was some bad weather that caused my flight to be delayed several hours. It was already late so i was afraid they would cancel the flight altogether.	I can understand that. How long was it delayed?"
"Yes! Thank goodness. They didn't cancel. I just got home much later than I had hoped.	That is terrible.  I hate bad weather.  Especially when it's so unpredictable.  It makes me so worried."
"Absolutely. I had too much to do the next day to not show up then.	I literally ate all you could eat at a chinese buffet	That is a very bad thing to do."
"I had to go home and lie down for the greatest nap of my life.	That sounds like fun! I love eating all the food I can get!"
"Recently went on a family vacation to an old spot we used to go when we were all younger. It was nice to see old stuff and talk about old times.	It is so great that you have those memories. I am sure they will be a great source of comfort for a long time."
"Oh for sure. I'm always a sucker for nostalgia.	It's always fun to go back to places we used to visit and relive the good times. I'm a bit of a nostalgic myself."
"I love looking through them. I even find myself clicking back to my oldest pictures on facebook and reliving those times in my head.	One night during college I got a phone call in the middle of the night that one of my best friends had been killed in a car wreck.	That is horrible.  Did you find out what happened?"
"Absolutely. It was really the first time I had lost someone close to me, family or friend.	Yeah, it was a pretty hard time for me, but it made me realize how precious life is."
"My birthday was a few days ago, I can't believe my wife had the wait staff sing to me.	Oh, I bet that was fun!"
"Hah, its good entertainment, but i don't exactly enjoy being in the spotlight. Thanks!	I have to agree.  I don't like to be the center of attention.  I'm a bit of a shy person."
"I recently got married and I'm so lucky to have found someone who enjoys doing the same things that I do.	that is awesome. how long have you been together?"
"Thank you. It is nice. This is a second marriage for us both and I like that we are both happy with things just the way they are, no high expectations	That is nice. I like that we can appreciate life just the way it is. I have been married for 15 years. I think I am going to get divorced this time. I don't like it."
"I lost my wallet last week	That is awful. Did you report it stolen?"
"My friend freaked out but I was pretty sure I left it at a restaurant and I trusted in my fellow humans to turn it in	Oh no! I'm sorry.  That's really bad.  You should be careful about leaving your valuables at places you know they'll be safe."
"Yes it was turned in - cash and credit cards all there	I recently had the opportunity to help out at my local Second Harvest food bank.	It sounds very kind of you. What kind of help was it?"
"It was great. I was with a good group of people too. We made it fun.	Oh, wow! That's great! What a wonderful way to help. How did you get into it?"
"For sure. I am happy I had the opportunity. Im sure I will do it again.	I'm happily married and employed, life is in a pretty good spot right now.	That's good to hear. I'm married to a wonderful woman, I'm so grateful for that."
"For sure. I've had some unstable times in my life. I'm thankful to be where I am now.	That's good. Life is good right?"
"Absolutely!	I am glad you are happy. I don't like to talk about my problems. I just wish things would get better."
"Yesterday my car ran out of oil and broke down. I could not believe I would let such a thing happen!	That's awful! Did you call the tow?"
"The engine is totally shot, its not designed to run without any. So now I have to go shopping for a new car.	I bet that was frustrating! Did you end up buying a car?"
"The new car is more expensive than a new engine. But I can't justify such a costly repair on my car.	I understand, but you should try to get a new one for less."
"It does drops a lot after a repair like that. I might as well invest that money into something new.	I was in a big party city and the street was crowded with people. As I was walking my foot got tangled up on something and I went face first into a huge flower bed.	That's so funny. Did you get hurt?"
"It hurt my pride more than it hurt my face.	I bet that was embarrassing."
"That is true. Plus it was a big party area so Im sure a lot of them drunk anyway.	I know, but I just cant help it when people are drunk. I am a good person."
"Literally anytime I order something online and I get the tracking I immediately start checking it. I am so impatient waiting on stuff to come.	That's so annoying."
"Yes. Every single time. I know better. But I just cant help myself but to check over and over	I can't help it. I have to check everything. It's a habit."
"That is true.	My dog died of old age last year and I miss her	It's okay to miss them. It's natural."
"Yes.  She was the most wonderful dog ever	I am sorry to hear about your dog.  I lost my cat last year too.  She was the best cat I ever knew."
"Laugh!  Yes dogs are far better creatures than humans	I'm gonna take the family out to the lake this weekend, we might rent a boat.	It's nice to have some family time. What lake is it?"
"Maybe a pontoon boat, depends on what they have. Should be a nice way to unwind.	That sounds like a fun time."
"I have a friend with loaded parents. She doesn't work but has anything she wants anytime she wants.	That's nice, what kind of things do you guys do?"
"Mine aren't poor but they aren't loaded. They struggle. Same for me. I work my butt of for what I have.	I'm sorry. I hope you have a good life."
"Same. I do wish I had a little bit more money to do a few more things though.	I know what you mean! I feel like we all have a little bit of a struggle going on in our lives. It is hard to make ends meet sometimes and not be able to do everything we want or need."
"I had to do a lot of learning to knock out a big project at work. Finally finished and ready for another.	That's good to hear. What kind of work did you do?"
"For sure. It was a software coding project for a client. A lot of which I did not understand at the start.	That's awesome. I love learning new things and it's even more awesome when you can apply them in real life. What programming languages did you use to do the project?"
"Thank you. But now I have it ready for the next one.	It's always nice to have a good software to get the job done!"
"I have many health problems that require me to see many different speccialist	I hope you get better soon."

"I had a super stressful week and ended up cheating on my diet last night by eating pizza and cake.	That's terrible.  Did you have any time for yourself to relax?"
"Yes, otherwise I had stuck to it - but my weekly weigh in was this morning and I was up two pounds. I felt so irritated!!!!	It's okay to slip up sometimes, but it's good you are able to get back on track. You can do it!"
"I'm a bit nervous- I have an upcoming certification exam to take for my teaching license and it's a big deal.	That's great! I hope you do well."
"I've been studying a WHOLE lot - so I think I'll do okay, but it's still making me feel nervous.	It's great that you have been studying. You will do great!"
"There was a group project due and we had a meeting, but i missed it because it was my 21st birthday. wasnt my best day	That's terrible! Did you get a good grade on it?"
"yeah, but i learnt from it and also had a good birthday!	Oh no, that's terrible! I hope everything works out for you. What did you do on your birthday?"
"I have many health problems but I feel so lucky to have a great support system in my family	Yeah I'm glad you have that. It really makes a big difference"
"It really is!  It is wonderful to know how much they love me!	That's great. I am sure that you will be okay."
"I was so sad when I had to put my dog down last year	I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you have a long life with your dog?  Did you have any children?"
"She was 12.  It was old age but it was so hard because I had had her for years.	I am so sorry to hear that.  That must have been very sad for you.  I am so glad she is no longer in pain.  I know you must have missed her.  I am sure she will always be with you in spirit."
"I wanted to buy a new car, but I wasn't sure about buying the one I got.	Oh that's a good thing.  I would have been very disappointed if I had bought something I didn't like."
"Yeah, it's been a good car so far, but most cars are pretty reliable at first.	I am glad you got it!  I would have been mad if I waited too long.  You should get the one you want, not wait."
"I have an amazing husband who is always there for me no matter what	That's so cool. I'm so glad you're happy. I don't think I've ever been in love before. I think I'm a little bit in love with my husband right now. I'm not saying I'm a promiscuous person or anything, but just because I've been married for a little while, I don't know. It's just nice to have a man in your life who is so supportive and loving."
"He was my sisters, husbands roomate in college and he came down for their wedding and we met there.  I can't imagine my life without him	Oh wow, that sounds amazing! I am so happy for you!"
"One time I went to my friends 16th birthday party.  When I was walking in her house I ran smack into their glass door.  It was so clean that I didn't see it.	That must have hurt. Did you get in trouble?"
"LOL..just my pride.  I was mortified and the funny part is that later on I won the door prize	I can imagine that.  That must have been embarrassing.  I've run into my parents at the grocery store and I'm not sure if I want to run into them again!  I hope that doesn't happen to you."
"My husband and I are planning a big trip to Washington,DC	I love Washington, what city are you planning to visit?"
"I really want to go to the Smithsonian.  I love history and can't wait till we get to go	That sounds like a great time!  I love history museums too."
"I have this knife that I carry everyday. My dad gave it to me before he died.	That's very kind of him. What is it used for?"
"It is, it's like he's always with me.	That sounds like a good memory. What kind of knife is it?"
"I have many health problems that have prevented me from having children	I am sorry to hear that. What kind of problems?"
"If I can get my health under control I would definetly look into that.  I use to be very sad everytime I saw people with their children but I have finally learned to be content in my situation	That is so true, I have been trying to get pregnant for years.  I have had a few miscarriages.  I am just hoping to have a healthy baby and be able to care for them."
"I had a job interview that was very important to me once	It was very important? Why was that important to you?"
"yes, I prepared as best I could and I really felt that I aced it!  Sure enough I ended up getting the jon	That's awesome! Congratulations!"
"I used to live out of my car and it made me feel pretty down on myself back then	I bet it made you feel sad. Did you find out where you were?"
"What types of situations? And yeah it could have been worse but I'm glad I'm out of it.	That's a good story!"
"Skydiving taught me how to let go and stop trying to fix everything	I'm not really a fan of skydiving myself. I've only been in a few times."
"Yeah the hardest part for me was just realizing that I wouldn't be in control, but it was very natural in the end	I've skydived before and it's a pretty amazing feeling."
"It's like something you have to figure out with your heart, kind of like how caterpillars have to stop trying to do a bunch of work so they can become butterflies	I ended up watching all the Robin William movies I could think of last weekend.	i have never seen any of them."
"I don't know if there is one of my favorites, but it sure was a lot of good memories.	That sounds like fun! I love watching old movies."
"I was in a rush this morning and didn't realize I had put on two different colored sox.	oh no!  I'm sorry.  What color are they?"
"One was pink the other was green. I hope no one noticed.	That's so embarrassing! Did you run to the store to buy new socks?"
"I have been working on my dance moves for the last 6 months.	Oh, that's a long time. What dance style are you dancing in?"
"Well its for a dance off, so it's a pretty big deal I have to win this.	That is so awesome, I am sure you will do well"
"This one time my pants fell down in public, but I was really tired so I didn't realize	Oh wow. What was going through your head?"
"A couple minutes later	I hate when that happens.  It is always embarrassing."
"Going in for an interview had me wondering what would happen	That's a scary thought. What did you end up finding out?"
"I decided not to take the job in the end, I guess I just wanted to know I could get it	I am sorry to hear that.  Did you get the interview?"
"I appreciate the place where I started cuz it helps me keep going	That's good. I am sure you are doing okay."
"For sure, it reminds me that things are always getting better	That is good, I hope it continues that way"
"I have been working on at the track to get my sprint times faster1	Oh, really? What is the track you're at?"
"No, just me, but my 100 yard dash is so so slow, I can't even get lower than 6 seconds.	That's awesome! I love sprinting!"
"I think I'm just really bad, maybe I will always be slow.	Yeah, but you can always try to run faster."
"Drinking a gallon of milk everyday makes me feel like an absolute madman in the gym who's gonna take over the world	That's crazy! I love milk!"
"That's not the point, gotta do it RAW	Yeah, I'm trying to cut back on my milk consumption but it seems I can't.  I just love milk so much.  I think I might have to get a gallon of almond milk."
"I had this juicy pump at the gym from doing some benching and it felt too easy	That's great. Did you use it?"
"My pecs were poppin	I bet it was a pretty good workout."
"I was hurrying around the house and wasn't paying attention fully, I ending up hitting my toe on my dogs toys.	Yeah, I hate it when you are in a rush and you hit your own dog. That's like the worst thing ever."
"It really hurt, I think I may need to take all his toys away to punish him.	I bet that was painful. I hope your dog is okay."
"I was at my main girls house and I saw these texts from this guy named Chad	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Was he in a bad relationship or did he just mess up?"
"Yeah, I demoted her to my dinner girl, now I gotta choose who my main ting is gonna be	That is pretty wild.  What was the text about?"
"I got mad because I was too full to finish my plate at the buffet	Oh wow, what buffet was it?"
"Chinese, but no I decided not to, don't think would allow it	Oh, that's too bad. You could have at least had some dessert."
"I spent 20 dollars on a piece of cheese cake.	I would have done that too."
"I thought it would blow my mind but it was dry and really disappointing. Talk about a let down.	I bet that was disappointing."
"I have been working on my bench press for 6 months, I know I can get to bench 400 pounds.	That's great.  I've always wanted to bench press 400 pounds.  You're a strong person."
"Steak and Maximum effort. I also drink lots of water, I'm on the next level like Arnold.	That's awesome, you're going to be a legend! What is your weight class?"
"Paranormal activity is the sCaRiEsT movie of horror movies	That's true. I love it."
"Yeah you'll have to show me sometime	You're kidding me right?  I'm a paranormal investigator and I've experienced some of the most bizarre things in my life.  I don't think I can handle the idea of a real-life Ghostbuster!  I'm not even sure I can handle my own family.  I don't want to be around kids!  I'm going back to work today.  I need to go back to my old life!"
"I just gave up smoking cigarettes. It was pretty hard, but the worst part is how everything puts you on edge and it is hard to relax.	That must be tough. I don't smoke, but I do have a lot of anxiety and stress.  I think it would be hard to quit smoking. I wish you the best of luck in your journey."
"I closed my eyes and visualize a world where anything was possible. I called this world IMAGINATION land.	That's great that you were able to overcome the habit! What made you want to stop smoking?"
"I was challenged to a dare by my best friend!	I bet that was fun! What did you do?"
"No, the challenge was I had to spend the night in a cemetery. No flashlight no tents just a rolled up sleeping bag.	That is crazy.  I bet that was scary!"
"I enjoy getting things done	I enjoy doing the opposite"
"I like to crochet and pay the bills	Oh that's great! I crochet a bit myself."

"Indeed, it was quite thrilling, did a little chest workout, got a nice pump	I am jealous of you! I am a bit of an athlete. I have been doing a lot of weightlifting. I am a bit worried about my body though. I have some health issues. I am trying to get more exercise and eat healthier."
"My cat puked all over my roommates shoes. I feel so bad.	That's so gross! Did you get them cleaned?"
"I clean them up as best I could, and told him about it. Then I profusely apologized.	That's a pretty crappy cat."
"I was really sick the other day and I let my roommate pick me up and carry me down the stairs.	That sounds like a pretty rough day.  Did you feel better after that?"
"I had an ovarian cyst, it hurt so bad. I almost went to the ER again.	That's awful. Did he not get you to the hospital?"
"I was going through my photos today and I saw a picture of me and my ex together. It just made me feel odd, I miss him.	I'm sorry to hear about that. Did you guys break up recently?"
"We broke up back in May, he was just too much of a workaholic.	That is sad.  I am sorry you broke up.  I hope you are doing okay."
"I get pretty sad some nights, but it feels good to cry sometimes	That is good. Sometimes we just need to let it out."
"Yeah, sometimes it's like a deep sadness comes out of nowhere	Yeah, I feel the same way about that, I have a friend who is in prison and I miss her."
"I had just been returning home, and on the side of the road there was some roadkill. It used to be a deer.	That is disgusting! Did you see it?"
"Yeah but my widows were down, and I could almost taste the stench of decay.	That is disgusting. I would have been so upset if I had seen it. I hate animals that die on the side of the road."
"Sometimes it's impossible to shove more food down my gullet	Oh, yeah.  That is one thing I hate about being in a small town with a small restaurant.  They always seem to be running out of food!"
"Nah, I'm trying to gain some pounds, I just haven't acclimated to the quantity yet	Oh yeah, you need to start eating more."
"I just watched JFK's speech, 'we will go to the moon' - reminds me of what I admire in the US	That's really cool, what's your favorite country to visit?"
"It's really moving, wonder what the next big goal will be for humanity	That's really interesting, I never really paid much attention to that part of the speech."
"The litter of puppies had been born!	I am so happy for the puppies! I would have been so sad!"
"All of the puppies survived, truly a lucky amazing occasion!	That's so good.  How many did you have?"
"I was totally caught off guard as a kid when the entire yard was covered in Easter eggs	It is such a fun time of year!"
"My dad, but he wouldn't admit it! haha	That sounds like a fun time, I bet."
"I was a little nervous to eat some cloves of garlic for the first time	That was a bad idea!"
"I wasn't sure if it was going to make me sick or not	It was okay! I have eaten a lot of garlic and it never made me sick!"
"I accidentally left a book I borrowed from a friend outside	That is terrible! I would be worried if you had done that. Did you get in trouble?"
"I did but it was ruined from the rain.	I'm sorry that happened. I hope you can get it replaced or repaired."
"I forgot to take some water bottles out from under my cart and pay for them at the store. I didn't realize I didn't pay for them till later.	I'm sorry. Did you find out about it later?"
"Hopefully I don't get bad karma for my accidental theft!	That happens to me too often, and sometimes I just forget I'm stealing!"
"I attended a ball recently, one of the girls had the most stunning dress.	I am sure she was the only one. What did she look like in the dress?"
"No way, her dress looked like little diamonds had been stitched on every inch of her dress. Not many girls can compete with that. Diamonds are forever.	I have never heard of anyone having diamonds stitched on their clothes. I have always thought they would have to be very special to do that."
"I had to schedule an appointment with the dentist after not visiting one in five years.	It's a little intimidating when you haven't seen them for a while, but you'll be fine!"
"I do not have insurance. I went anyway because I had a problem with one tooth.	I'm sure it will be worth it, I would be a little embarrassed about it."
"The internet has been there through thick and thin for me	Oh yeah. I've had to use my parents internet a lot lately. It can be pretty annoying."
"True, it's a great resource to have	That's right! It's always there and always connected"
"Seeing animals sleep is very relaxing	That sounds like it would be a great way to relax. I'm a bit jealous."
"I don't know, I guess I'm just tired	I think you're just tired of animals, that's all"

"Yeah, it was a huge relief for me. I am so glad to be done with this semester.	That's great, what did you end up getting in grades?"
"I should not have been so quick to let my teen take the car, but she was so excited.	It was a good thing she was excited though. She would have been too lazy to drive if it was up to her."
"Well, let me just say that the pole made it out alright,lol.	That's a funny story. Did you have to pay for the damage?"
"She is, and now my car has a very crude imitation of a red racing stripe down the side!	After a gym workout I'm always ready to get back and hit a new PR	I love working out. It's great exercise!"
"I think just knowing that one day I'll be able to do things that are unimaginable right now, and I know I can do better the next time	I bet you feel good about that? I know the feeling!"
"My stomach made a loud noise while I was in class taking a test	That's terrible! Did you tell the professor?"
"I just pretended like nothing happened, but i'm worried everyone thinks it was something other than my stomach	Oh, that's a good one. What do you mean? Did you do something to your stomach or just make a weird sound?"
"I felt pretty good leaving the gym today, hit a new PR on overhead press	I love working out. I'm a big fan."
"I like to try my hardest!	That sounds awesome! How much weight did you lift?"
"I felt like I could do anything after I finished meditating	That is awesome! Meditation has so many benefits!"
"I try to go longer everyday, I was able to go 50 minutes yesterday	That's amazing.  I'm a bit jealous, but I wish I could meditate."
"I caught my boyfriend texting his ex	That must have been uncomfortable. What did you do?"
"I think he will dump me soon. He would rather be with her, I just know it	I would be mad at him too, why would he do such a thing?"
"My friend has been working with me on the weekends to get my tennis game on the next level.	That is really nice of them! I would do the same for them!"
"yeah I can consistently serve with power and accuracy now. I feel almost decent now.	That is really cool. You have to keep practicing."
"A while back I caught my partner at the time being dishonest to me.	That is so rude!"
"We were together for a year and a half and we had a child together shortly before I found out!	That is horrible.  Did you have to divorce him?"
"High school was a great time, but those days are long gone	That's true, I used to go to high school and then go to college and then go back to work. It's a lot to go through."
"No bills to pay, going out to eat with friends all the time, pretty fun	That sounds so fun! What school were you in?"
"Around 4 months ago, I had major surgery that caused me to be immobile for a few weeks.	I am sorry, what kind of surgery did they do?"
"Well, I had lots of support from my family, but I felt afraid of getting back into the swing of things for fear of failing. I felt so vulnerable.	I'm sorry to hear that, but you will get back into things, and you should!"
"I love going to the gym because I feel stronger	That is awesome, you must be very active."
"Probably half a year, been the most consistent in my life, how about you?	Yeah, I'm not really good at it though."
"It's tough to talk to my parents, but I try to talk about things we don't disagree on	I am sure that you can talk to them about it"
"Anything political or religious really, or relationships	Yeah, sometimes I have to be honest and tell them the truth. I don't think I would be honest with them if it was something I really wanted to."
"I had my dog for 13 years before she passed away last year from cancer. It was devastating!	Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you were able to take care of her well enough for her to pass away peacefully."
"Probably not for a while. She was a great companion, but I don't think my heart is ready to bring in a new dog quite yet.	That is so sad. I am sure you will find someone who will love her just as much as you did."
"I was horribly wronged by someone I thought I could trust. The feeling was devastating, and I've always struggled with forgiveness.	I am sorry."

"MY roommate got a new cat last week, and we finally let them meet today. I was so nervous and worried about it.	That's awesome! I bet you felt bad letting them meet! How did they do?"
"It went okay. My cat bopped him a little and growled a lot but no real swipes. So better than expected I guess.	I bet. Cats can be a little feisty!"
"When I was pregnant with my first born, it was considered a high risk pregnancy. It made me very worried and anxious throughout.	That is a scary situation! Did everything turn out alright in the end?"
"I had to have emergency surgery in the end, but being able to hold my healthy baby was the greatest blessing I could have asked for.	That's so cool! Did you have to have any complications during the surgery?"
"I'm so happy summer classes are officially over and I'll be able to relax for a week!	It's been a long week. I'm glad it is finally over."
"I'm not even sure what to do with all this time! I guess I should relax or have some leisure time, but everything in me says to try and be productive even on break. It's that school mentality.	It can be hard. But you can't let it go to waste."
"My sister came to visit from out of state. It was the first time we've seen her in nearly a decade!	I bet that was a nice reunion!"
"Yes she lives on the other side of the country. We had a nice dinner, but my boyfriend is a loud chewer and a sloppy eater. It was quite embarrassing!	I bet it was. Did you have to remind her to be quiet?"
"I just bought a new dress and I can't wait to wear it this weekend.	That's so exciting! I love when you get something new! What kind of dress?"
"I'm going to wear it to a party. Everyone will have their eyes on me!	That sounds fun. What color is it?"
"A few months ago I could barely walk up a flight of stairs without having to catch my breath, but I bit the bullet and have been training.	Oh no, did you have to do it to get out of the house?"
"Wonderful! It's definitely hard work, but I continue on, even on the days I don't want to. Today I discovered I can now comfortably run an uphill mile and I feel very confident!	It's awesome that you are working towards your goal. Keep it up!"
"My boss told me about a potential job opportunity and I've been waiting to hear if it's going to happen	That sounds like a good opportunity!"
"A little bit. I am mostly excited about it though	That is awesome! I hope it works out for you!"
"I was very prepared for my final exam. It was so easy.	That's great! What was it for?"
"If I'm being honest, I made an answer key from the quizzes we took this semester. As they say, work smart, not hard.	That's good that you prepared well."
"My cousin was swinging recklessly on my hammock and ended up breaking it!	It's a shame. I hope you guys get new hammocks soon."
"I was very upset, especially considering how long it took me to get it set up. I loved laying in my peaceful hammock to read.	Yeah, it's like when you're trying to sleep and someone is banging on your door."
"I received a phone call the other day from a friend I hadn't heard from in ages.	I love that kind of surprise, it makes you feel like a kid again."
"We reminisced about old times. It was very nice, indeed. It was nice hearing from him, especially during some rough times!	That was nice. I'm glad you got to hear from him."
"I have a weekend of nothing but relaxation planned for this weekend.	I love the weekend. What are you going to do?"
"I have some leftover roast in the fridge so I don't even have to leave the house. I'm going to watch a lot of netflix and MAYBE do a little laundry.	It's great to have a relaxing weekend."
"I keep having these dreams that I am out in public and somehow my clothes disappear. It's awful.	That's a creepy dream. Did you ever find out what happened?"
"I hate those dreams, I feel anything but free. They're really uncomfortable and make me nothing but a ball of negative emotions like anxiety as I spend the majority of the dream trying to find clothes and get away from people.	I can relate, it is so frustrating.  I have a dream where I am at the grocery store and I just can't get anything.  I just want to get home and be free."
"One of my friends recently bought a house. I really wish I could afford a house.	It's always nice to have a friend with your back. I'm not sure how you can afford one, though. That's a lot of money."
"I'm starting to feel like I will never be able to afford a house. They're just so expensive. And the market has been going up here about 5% a year for the past 10 years.	Oh man, I feel you. I really do. I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in some kind of financial limbo."
"I ended up staying at home for the holidays	Oh, I know that happened with my family last year. It is so boring!"
"No all my family lives out of state. I didn't feel like traveling, but I just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark.	That sounds like a pretty relaxing way to spend the holiday."
"I bumped into a friend from middle school. We chatted for a while	Oh, nice. How did that happen?"
"Before 9th grade. I moved away that summer. Seeing her brought back a lot of good memories	It's always great to catch up with old friends"
"I had a doctors appointment at 9 am and they kept me waiting for almost 2 hours.	I would be mad too!"
"It was terrible I ended being late for work because of their horrible service.	That is so terrible. You must have been very frustrated!"
"The past few months have been terribly rough, but I think I can say that they have made me stronger.	That is great. What made the time worse?"
"Thank you. I hope that I can move forward and at least learn from these hardships.	I agree. I think we have to take the hard times in life to make us stronger."
"I really hate when people can't hold themselves accountable for their own actions and decisions.	That's terrible. I'm not sure I understand what you mean."
"Absolutely. Yet, these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you, even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.	I can't help but feel that people are trying to manipulate others, especially when they do that."
"I received a very odd message today. It came from a person who I blocked online, but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group.	Did you block the group as well?"
"They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish, and it makes me very anxious.	That's terrible. I would be worried about your safety."
"I'm going rock climbing with some friends!	I love that sport! What are you climbing to?"
"I have done some climbing indoors for practice, but never done a big climb out doors, so who know how it will go.	I'm a climber too.  How many people are you going with?  I'm going to be doing a big climb out of the city this weekend."
"I keep having these really weird nightmares at night.	That's really unsettling. Did you try to talk to a counselor about them?"
"I'm usually in a big city that I'm familiar with, and roam around in the dream until I get stalked, jumped, and sometimes very hurt.	That's really scary. What do you think is causing them?"
"Today I was quite impressed with my endurance during my work out. A few months ago, I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath.	I'm not very good at exercise, but it's good for you. I hope you're not too sore tomorrow"
"I sure have, but it's such hard work. I make sure to work out, even on the days that I don't want to. It's definitely taken a lot of will power.	That's awesome! I wish you all the best."
"I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.	I'm happy for you.  What kind of baby is it?"
"It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty, but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.	That is great that your baby was healthy."
"I just learned my first trick in ice skating, a triple spin twirl kick front flip.	That is awesome! I have never learned anything like that before. I am a beginner myself, but I am really excited for my upcoming birthday."
"I never thought I would have the balance to perform such a feat. I think I can no qualify for the Olympics.	Oh that's cool! I've never been to the Olympics."
"I just started college again, and while I'm doing great in school, it has lead me to feel very lonely with a lack of social life.	That's a bummer, but don't worry, you can always join clubs or organizations on campus!"
"That sound like a good idea if they weren't online classes. Next semester I have a few on campus courses, so I'm hoping I'll be able to make at least one new friend.	That's great that you have online classes. You might consider taking some of the online classes to meet new people."
"This upcoming semester will be my first time taking 5 classes at once. I'm pretty worried that I may have taken on too much.	That's a lot of work! Are you sure you're ready for it?"
"I'm not sure. The more I think about it, the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby, so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.	That's awesome that you're having a baby, that's something to be proud of. I hope everything goes well for you."
"I adore my girlfriend. I am getting very serious about not leaving her side.	That sounds nice, do you have kids together?"
"Thank you. Do you have a romantic interest?	I am in a relationship right now and I am not sure if I will be ever."
"Summer in the South calls for many unwanted visitors of the insect type!	I know, it's so annoying when they show up unannously."
"Mosquitoes, and those dreadful flying ants. They're everywhere!	Oh no! I hate them.  I have never been in a place where they haven't invaded."
"Lately I've felt proud of my success as a newly single mother. It gets lonely sometimes, but I can honestly say I've been doing everything I can and more.	That's great. You're a very strong and independent woman."
"Thank you! I definitely have a drive to feel strong for them. I hope some day they can realize my efforts.	I bet!  You're going to make them very proud."
"I have a plethora of amazing friends. One of mine recently drove me from Georgia to South Florida	I'm jealous!  That sounds like fun.  Where did you go?  I've never been there.  What's the weather like?"
"It is an 8 hour drive! Florida is a very long state	I can relate to that. I am in Texas and it takes me about 3 hours to go to California. It's a big deal for me to drive that far."
"I recently totaled my car. There were no injuries but I feel absolutely terrible	I hope it wasn't too expensive to fix."
"It was very wet and I took a turn at too high of a speed.	That is terrible!"
"My mom and I haven't always had the best relationship. Recently I've had to tell myself to let her in more. It's been challenging.	Oh no, what happened?"
"Thank you. I know that, even though it's challenging, I need to be patient in order to improve our relationship.	Yeah, relationships are tough, but they are worth it. I'm happy for you."
"I have had the toughest time getting my pet rat to get along with others. She's always been very aggressive!	Oh wow.  How old is she?"
"She's never bitten anyone, thankfully, but she gets crazy with other rats. To my surprise though, I've recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!	That is awesome. I would be happy to see that. What type of rats are you talking about?"
"This past month, I was able to visit Six Flags!	That's awesome! What did you do at the park?"
"It was amazing. The last time I was at an amusement park had to have been over a decade ago!	That's awesome!  What was your favorite ride?"
"The other day I noticed my pet has a growth on her lower belly. I fear it may be a tumor.	That's scary. Is it something you know about?"
"She's a rat, so her body is very frail. I'm sad that she likely will not make it. She's been with me through thick and thin.	It's a terrible disease, but I hope she has a good time."
"I let the girl of my dreams slip away. Now I am alone.	I am sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"I hope so. I think that time heals all wounds.	I feel you. I let someone go too. I was so happy with her, but then she moved on. It's a tough thing to do."
"I recently went to the pool and lost my suit. My trunks were in the water without me!	That's pretty awful, were you in a rush to get back in?"
"I was not, unfortunately. People saw everything!	That sucks! I would have felt like I had done something wrong."
"I let a romantic interest slip through my fingers. She's now with somebody that I despise	I am sorry that happened. What did you do about it?"
"I think so. I have plenty of time and life goes	Oh no! I'm so sorry! That's terrible."
"I feel great right now. I have a new album coming out and it feels liberating to be done!	That is so awesome! I love your enthusiasm!"
"I am very excited. It is almost an hour and a half long	That's awesome, are you going to tour?"
"I can't wait to travel. I am going to Madagascar soon!	That's awesome. I have been to Madagascar once."
"I have! I actually grew up in Saudi Arabia	That's so cool! I have always wanted to visit Madagascar. How was your trip?"
"The world is savage. I believe that the right individuals can take us to a better place in the future	That's a great point, I'm sure it will be a better world if more people work towards it"
"I think so too. There are some kind and great people in the world	That is true.  I believe we have a chance for better.  We just have to work towards that goal"
"I went walking in the woods one night. It was pretty scary out there	That is so true. I once went to the woods and I saw a raccoon."
"No, everything was fine, but it was a chilling experience	Yeah I have gone on many a scary hike and walk, and I always try to keep a level head."
"I caught my dog trying to eat my nephew's dirty diaper that my brother left on the couch	That's disgusting! I wouldn't let my dog do that. Did you throw it away?"
"It was really gross. I had to keep my dog from licking my face for a long time after that.	I can understand that. I would be pretty mad at my dog if he did that."
"I recently remembered a sweet memory of my aunt who recently passed away.	That's really sad. What happened?"
"She would give hundreds of dollars of school supplies to kids in need each year.	That's very nice of her. It's great when people like that still exist."
"She did! I fill stockings around the holidays and go around on Christmas giving them out to people who have to work. :)	That's really kind of you. I have to do that for my kids. It's a lot easier when they're little, but now that they're older, they don't care."
"My daughter and her family are coming this Thanksgiving. I'm already preparing for their visit.	Oh no, I bet that is going to be a fun trip."
"Not too much, just really exciting. I'm planning everything even though it's months away, even the menu.	I can't wait for the kids to come visit! I hope you have a great time!"
"My mother in law was recently placed in hospice and is not expected to live much longer.	That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry to hear that."
"She's 87, so she has lived a long life, but she has Alzheimers, and it's really sad to watch her lose her mind.	I hope she has a good life and is at peace.  I know that is hard to see, especially for those who love her."
"That's a great way of looking at it. I should try to keep a positive attitude towards it.	That's very compassionate of you, to try to keep a positive attitude towards it. I hope you can find a way to help her out as much as you can."
"I was driving home from out of town really late one night and was exhausted	I bet you were so tired you didn't even drive"
"I did get home safe but it was scary because the roads were two lane and lots of 18-wheelers were heading in the opposite direction. I kept thinking I would swerve into their lane and collide into them	I can imagine. Did you get a good night's sleep?"
"I've been trying to be extra supportive towards my husband.	I bet.  I bet you are the best husband you've ever been."
"Yes - so true. His mom is dying, and he is working long hours on top of it. I feel really bad for him.	That is really nice. I hope he feels better soon."
"My friend who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit. She married a very wealthy man and I was a bit envious	Oh that is a lot different from when you were friends. I can understand the feeling."
"She drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world. I wish that were me some days.	I'm sorry, I was trying to be funny.  I know that feeling.  It's hard to be happy when you're struggling with money.  But I wish you the best of luck and I'm glad you're able to see the world."
"I was at a get together recently and a friend's husband was flirting with me.	That sounds kind of weird."
"I didn't know what to say to her, and was afraid she wouldn't believe me and it would cause her to be angry at me. It's a bad situation.	I would have been in a similar situation."
"When I was in second grade, I wet my pants in the middle of class.	That must have been very embarrassing. What happened next?"
"I know! I was super afraid of my teacher, and was scared to ask her to go to the bathroom.	I know! I had to go to the bathroom and get a towel to wipe up the mess."
"She was really mean and always yelling! I didn't want her to yell at me. I'm much older and wiser now!	I want to trick my butler into thinking he won the lottery. I've taped the local new's winning lottery numbers and I'm going to buy a ticket with the same numbers and give it to my butler	What is the odds of winning?"
"I'm not sure he likes being the target of pranks, but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin	I love when people do that."
"My friend just took her kids to Disneyland and I feel a little bad about it.	That's cool! I have a friend with kids."
"I'd been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years. I'm happy for her- just wish it could have been me.	I understand that. But you could have been there."
"I won a trip to Washington D.C. a few years ago	That is awesome. What did you do in Washington D.C."
"I had a blast. I met people from all over the country, visited many historical sites, and learned a lot about how government works	I would love to visit Washington D.C."
"I'm looking forward to my best friend's surprise birthday party next week!	Oh yeah! I love surprise parties. What's the surprise?"
"I'm really happy about it- she's a great friend and she's turning 40, so it's a big one!	Yeah, I bet it'll be great!"
"About 20 friends, surprising her at her favorite bar after work.	My 25th high school reunion is coming up and I'm excited.	Oh that is nice.  What are you looking forward to?"
"Honestly? There was this girl who really treated me poorly - I can't wait for her to see how successful I have been!	Oh man! That's awesome! What did she do?"
"A hurricane hit my city. The first night I thought the wind was going to tear the roof off the house	Oh no!  I hope you were okay!  What happened?"
"It was my third. Luckily we didn't lose power for more than a few hours	That is terrible.  I hate when hurricanes come through."
"It damaged the roof and the fence. We lost power for six days during the first hurricane I experienced	I'm glad that didn't happen to you.  What hurricane did you experience?"
"I am loyal to my principles, that is why I do not eat meat, because I love life	That is good. I love my wife, but I eat a lot of meat."
"If I already have 10 years of vegetarian	That is great! I like vegetarian food too."
"I healthy physically and spiritually	My daughter recently broke curfew by three hours!	I am so proud of her!"
"I was super angry, yes! I ended up grounding her for three weeks- one week for each hour she was late.	I hope she learns from it.  What is she going to do next time?"
"I have a certification exam coming up and I think I'll do well.	That's good to hear! What's it for?"
"I think so- I've studied quite a bit with my husband and others.	It's great that you are prepared. I hope you do well on your exam!"
"Education- teaching license certification	Hello ... I confess that when I see my daughter's eyes, my heart suffers.	Oh, that's a very sweet thing."
"They are sick	I am sorry to hear that. What is wrong with her?"
"Relax, they are things that happen	My new manager gave me a pay-rise!	That's great! What kind of pay rise?"
"I feel very grateful that he has been so generous.	That is awesome!  What kind of pay-rise?"
"My partner left me the other day.	Oh no. I'm so sorry."
"That's fine, its not your problem. i just feel very lonely right now.	I feel you, I was in a similar situation recently."
"I just moved to a new city and I don't know anyone	That's a bummer. But it's a great opportunity for growth and meeting new people. What's the new city?"
"Yeah, it's hard though. I hate to go out by myself. It's hard for me to meet new people	I am sure you will meet people."
"I took my final exams a few weeks ago and I was sure I had done well, but I failed.	That is bad! What happened?"
"I don't know what happened. I studied and passed everything else. Now I have to retake the class and I'm upset	That's terrible. Are you going to retake the class?"
"My sister kept playing a few seconds of a song over and over again on her laptop last night. Now it's stuck in my head.	That is annoying, I bet. Did you tell your sister about it?"
"It drives me bonkers when she does that	Yeah, that is the worst part about being in a relationship. She does this all the time and I am the only one who doesn't seem to care."
"I saw these 4-color Bic pens in the store the other day. I remember when I was young and getting one was like Christmas morning!	Oh my god, I love those pens!"
"Yes! My mom used to always get me one each year before school started. Those were the coolest pens in the world!	I'm glad you liked the memory, it is a good one. I'm sure you'll be getting a pen soon. I've been getting new ones for a long time."
"I'm optimistic that my house is going to sell soon.	That's good news! I've had to sell my house a few times."
"Only a week- and 17 people have seen it already, so I'm feeling good about it selling quickly!	That is good to hear!  Are you selling it to someone or to a family?"
"My best friend was going to travel from Wisconsin to see my this summer, but she ended up not being able to come.	That sucks!  I'm sure she was really looking forward to it!  Did you find someone else to take her place?"
"Nothing- I still haven't seen her. I felt pretty let down - but hopefully I can make the trip to see her soon.	I understand your feelings.  I'm sure you will be fine.  You can't be disappointed.  She will come back when she is ready.  She will come back when she is ready.  She will come back when she needs to come back."
"My sister threw up the other day and made a huge mess.	That's no good.  Is she okay now?"
"Fortunately no- she cleaned it up. But she had just had spaghetti and it was floating in it. It was so gross!	That's disgusting. I hope she felt bad about what she did."
"I was livid when I went to work the other day and saw my car was broken in to	That's terrible. I hate when someone breaks into your car!"
"I heard it was happening in other areas but didn't expect it here because we live in a nice neighborhood. So frustrating	I hate when that happens.  Did you call the police?"
"Every year when the kids go back to school, it brings back so many memories of when my kids were going to school.	That's a bummer. I'm sure it brings up some memories of your kids."
"I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly	I know what you mean. I have 2 grand kids and they're both going to be in the same class this year. I have a hard time remembering things."
"So everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints, and I ate the whole thing for breakfast.	That's so awesome. What did you eat?"
"LOL, I swear it was like I sat down and they were gone!  Probably gave myself diabetes. So not going to be able to eat the rest of the day!	I can imagine. I would be so annoyed if my family and friends were gone for the day."
"Sigh, I have no self control, definatley need a veggie or two today now! Probably should knix those form the pantry	My father passed away in November, it's made me feel empty ever since.	I'm sorry about your loss.  I'm sorry about your life."
"I didn't think it would hit me hard. I felt like I was prepared.	That is sad.  What happened?"
"I surprised my girlfriend with Chik-Fil-A breakfast this morning when she got off work.	That's really sweet of you.  Did she enjoy it?"
"She works nights, and had no idea I was coming. I knew she had a bad night so I wanted to do something nice for her.	Oh, nice. That was sweet of you."
"I recently was laid off from my job. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm trying to stay positive that I will soon.	I know that feeling. I was laid off from my job too. It was hard."
"I keep looking and applying, but still here I sit. I know it will happen when the right one comes along though	Oh no. I hope that doesn't happen to you."
"I lost the book that my friend let me borrow. I feel so embarrassed.	I would feel that way too. Did you find another copy?"
"I'm trying to find a new one, but this one was rare and hard to find.	It is always good to find new books, and I am sure you can find another book like this one."
"My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.	That's a bit of a let down.  Did you talk to them?"
"I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.	I know that's what I thought too. I'm not sure what they were thinking about it."
"The older I get, the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling I have. It is nice to just enjoy being alive.	I agree, I am getting older too, but I am happy about that."
"Those examples are definitely the simple pleasures of life. It makes me want to go outside and listen to the birds and smell the flowers.	I'm the same way. I've always been a simple person."
"I went swimming the other day and when I jump into the water and came back up, my bathing suit top was pulled over my breast and I was wandering why everyone was staring at me.	I would have just swam on."
"Yes I did realize fairly fast why everyone was staring. I looked down and seen my breast exposed.	That's disgusting! I would never do that!"
"I think my cat likes my new girlfriend more than he likes me now.	That's a little creepy, I guess."
"Yea he loves to sit on my lap while i work, but prefers her side of the bed now when he sleeps.	That sounds like he's a pretty nice cat."
"My grandfather passed away not too long ago, i received a bunch of items he left for me.	I'm sorry about your loss. What kind of items did he leave for you?"
"Some interesting antiques, grandfather clocks, and a lot of items related to his work for the house of representatives. Interesting stuff	That sounds like a lot to unpack!  What kind of work did he do?"
"I had to let my dad borrow my car the other day. His truck is in the shop.	That's nice of you."
"Yeah it has. And, he took good care of my car, as always.	Yeah he always does that. I'm lucky I can trust him with my car."
"I ca not believe what happened the other night at my friends house, I'll never show my face again.	I can't believe what happened. What did happen?"
"Sure, I fell asleep on the chair and had a dream, in my dream I went to the restroom, so yeah, I peed right there in their chair.	I'm sorry you had a bad dream."
"Yes, it was not fun, but good to know I am not the only one.	I enjoy helping the wildlife in my area where I live. I give them a helping hand. I give them water, birdseed, my left over food. The animals love watermelon and cantaloupe.	I am glad to see you helping the wildlife. I have never given them watermelon."
"I just have the small non dangerous type of wildlife that I like to help Birds, rabbits, squirrels and such. No big bad bears!	It's great that you are doing this.  It's so nice that you're taking the time to help these animals."
"We got a new puppy! We took him in from our father in law.	I bet that was so much fun to watch!"
"Its a long hair chihuahua and a short hair chihuahua. He has the most adorable under bite!	It is so cute.  I love puppies."
"I found out my wife was having an affair, the worst part is i knew the guy and welcomed him in my home and was kind to him.	That's terrible. I'm so sorry."
"I'm learning to live my live without her, it's tough. Some honesty would have made the way it ended much better. Thanks for the kind words.	It's okay.  I know you are trying to move forward.  You will be okay.  I am sure it will be okay.  It will get better.  You will find someone else to love you.  Don't give up.  You will find your way again.  It will be okay."
"I went on a soda fast for two days so that I could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking. I am addicted to soda so it was hard. I made it though and I was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days.	It was good that you were able to do that for him.  I have a friend who is addicted to soda.  It is so hard to deal with."
"Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.	That's great!"
"No, they suck!!	I recently had an argument with a friend. Even though I talked ot her about it and let her know how I felt, my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband. She thought I was being two faced, which lead to a long discussion. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.	I am sorry.  Did it get resolved?"
"Yeah, I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter, even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..	I understand that. It was good that you talked about it and explained why you were acting that way. I hope your daughter is not too hurt."
"That's good advice. Thanks!	I found huge box full of my old cd's recently, found a ton of old pc games i used to play, reminded me of a simpler time!	I love that. I have a bunch of old cd's myself, I used to listen to music and watch movies all day."
"I did, i played a few sessions of age of empires and i plan to play some command and conquer red alert tonight before bed, still great games.	I have played some of those games too, they were a lot of fun."
"I got turned down for a job I really wanted.	I hate being turned down for a job I really want.  I would have to look for another one.  Did you get the job?"
"Thanks.  But yes, I was really dejected.  I thought I'd interviewed well and had a good enough resume.	Yeah, sometimes you can't do what you want because of what you have."
"When my wife left me, i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest, I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic	That is a good thing, how did you change your life?"
"Well, Like the saying goes, get busy living or get busy dying. I'm not sure if i'll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!	I know right, I feel you.  I hope you find what you're looking for and find happiness in the end."
"I bought a 20 foot boat. I believe it will be able to handle the large lake that I will be taking it on.	That's a pretty large boat!"
"It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions.	That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that. What lake?"
"It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy.	It is nice that you have this dream of yours, I'm sure your wife is glad you got it."
"We should have a lot of fun this summer with it! Makes up for all the hard work saving up for it.	That is awesome! What kind of fish do you like to catch?"
"I like like loaning money to friends. It can ruin friendships and sometimes doesn't get paid back.	That's a good thing to have friends in your life."
"Yeah, I meant don't like, sorry. I recently lent some to my friend with no expectation of getting it back because of her hard situation. I actually got it back.	Yeah, I can understand that. It is not fair to expect people to do good things for you, but at the same time, it can be good for them to get the chance to prove themselves"
"Last summer, my dog went missing. We looked for him everywhere and called all of our neighbors. No one had seen him.	Oh no.  That is so sad.  I have had dogs before and lost one.  I hope you found your dog!"
"After a week of looking for him and checking the shelters, a neighbor found his body under her house. He had gotten under there and couldn't find a way out. I was so heart broken and so were my daughters.	Oh my gosh, that is awful. I hope you are okay."
"I try to skateboard with my kids everyday. They love it, and it makes me feel young again.	I love skateboarding.  I've been doing it since I was 8!"
"It can be scary some times, but its worth it.	I skateboard a lot.  My kids love to go with me."
"My daughters 6th birthday was recently, unfortunately her mothers side of the family didn't show up, even though they all rsvp'd	That is a bummer. Did you end up having a family celebration?"
"Hah yea, she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her. They grow up fast.	That is very sad. It sounds like they are not getting along with the mother's side of the family."
"The other week, a friend of mine told me there was an opening where he worked and to get him a resume. I took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else.	That is frustrating! I would have been upset too."
"It would have been nice. Less pay, but I would have had to work less. Oh well, guess I'll try harder next time.	I'm sorry that happened. Maybe you can try again next time and see what happens."
"The other day I was running late. So, I jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house.	That is crazy! What did you do next?"
"I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains. I apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes.	That's disgusting."
"I have MS, and sometimes I have bowl problems.	It must be frustrating.  Are you in a treatment program?"
"No, I've tried science remedies. I like those kinds better.	I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you find what works for you."
"My son got a remote control car for his birthday. Its really cool.	I have a son who loves cars! He has a remote control car too."
"No, his grandpa did. But, after he went to bed, I went outside and played with it for a while.	Yeah that's cool. I'm glad he got it. I've been wanting one for a while now."
"Someone broke into my car the other day, but they didnt steal anything.	That is good to know."
"I know! I feel both violated and kind of sad because I have nothing in my car worth stealing.	Yeah, that's the worst.  They probably didn't mean to cause any damage or take anything.  But still, they shouldn't have done it."
"There was an elderly lady at my church who was blind and could not hear well so you had to talk really loud for her to hear you. She was very faithful about coming to church so our preacher picked her up and took her home for every service. When she needed help, we took turns helping her.	That is really kind.  What a good woman."
"When I saw that she needed help, I always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker. I liked helping her. She recently passed away and I miss her.	Oh wow, that is a very kind thing to do. I would do something similar for a family member or friend. It's always nice to help out those who are less able."
"Yes, she loved everyone she met. She would say she couldn't remember everyone's names, but she loved them anyway.	I took my son to kindergarten the other day. He loves it so far!	It is great that you are letting him experience new things."
"You bet! He made a girlfriend on the bus by talking about Zelda.	That's great! I had my daughter in kindergarten. I loved it."
"Lately, my family and I have been very blessed. We are all happy and healthy. All of our major bills have already been paid for the month, and we have been going to a three week long revival at a local church.	That sounds like a great time!  I have been to a few revivals and it's always a lot of fun!  Did you have a lot of fun at this church?"
"We have just been trusting in the Lord.	That is great, you must feel very happy and relieved."
"Thank you.	I was looking at some old pictures of my kids' first day of school from 4 years ago.	That's nice. I'm a big kid, but I used to be a little shy and didn't like crowds."
"It just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes.  My youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in 7th grade.	That's awesome! I love when my kids are in different grades and can see the progression of their education. I'm 25 years old and my youngest is 10, and my oldest is 16."
"And tons of pics!  I try to take pictures of everything.	I couldn't believe Aretha Franklin passed away last week.	I know right. I was watching her live performance on Saturday. She was so talented."
"Sometimes you think people will be around forever, their aura is just so...legendary.	You are right. She was the Queen of Soul."
"I just finished eating dinner.  We had red beans and rice and with sausage.  I'm as full as a tick!	I love red beans and rice, it's my favorite!  What do you think they put sausage in?"
"I had to soak them for 3 hours.  I think that's what makes that meal so satisfying - the wait!	That is the best way to eat red beans and rice.  The wait makes it so good.  It's a little bit like eating a meal that you didn't have to work hard for."
"I do the same thing!	Found out some bad news today about my kids custody case.	I am sorry to hear that. Is your child a boy or girl?"
"Yeah, it really is. Due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father.	I am sorry, that sounds terrible. I hope that things work out for your family."
"I think I aced my supervisor exam!	It is good to see you got it right"
"I should know something by tomorrow morning.  Hopefully they tell me right away.	That's great. You should be proud of yourself!"
"I have all my kids' things ready for the first day of school tomorrow!	That's exciting! I've never been to first day of school!"
"I think I am.  I tried to do as much in advance as I could.	That must have been a lot to do.  Did you do anything fun for them?"
"My daughter is in 8th grade and just started school a little over a week ago. She is already being bullied.	Oh no.  That's so sad.  What is the bullies name and age?"
"Yes, and will again because it didn't help. I try to cheer her up with hugs, goofy moments, and whatever else I can think of.	That is terrible! I am sorry you have to deal with that. I hope your girl gets it together."
"I had a chance to cheat on my wife once,	That's terrible! Did you do it?"
"I did not. I left there quickly. It was not something I would ever want to do.	I would never cheat on my wife either."
"My dog got very sick and lay in bed for a couple weeks.  I was so concerned.	That's terrible. I hope your dog is doing better."
"She did get better eventually.  During that time I tried to tend to her as much as I could.	Oh wow! That's great. How did she do?"
"My roommate recently got a kitten, and he went out of town so I am watching over the little bugger.	That's so kind of you!  Do you have a kitten too?"
"I love cats, I have one of my own. I haven't been around a kitten in forever so it's a real treat. I also don't have to sleep with the little brat at night either so it's especially great.	Oh wow! That's so nice of you! I hope the little one is well taken care of."
"I had a solo competition last week for cello. I was well prepared and knew my music well. I felt great walking into that room.	It sounds like everything was going well until you went out to practice and had a disaster."
"I have been playing the cello for 5 years.	That sounds like a lot of practice!"
"I slipped and feel at work the other day. Several people saw it. I wanted to just crawl in a hole and hide afterwards.	That's terrible! I'm sorry to hear that! Did you get hurt?"
"Just my pride	I'm sorry you had that happen. I hope you didn't get in trouble for it."
"My ex and I broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork, like 70 plus hours a week.	That's terrible. I'm so sorry you are going through this."
"He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.	Oh my. That is horrible. I hope he is okay."
"My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it, we've been getting along great since we broke up.	That is great, you must be happy."
"The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much. He decided he didn't want to leave after all and wants to keep working 70+ hour weeks every week.	That is awful. I hate when people do not follow through on their promises. It's like you are stuck in limbo because you don't know what to do."
"I came home today and the food I had put in the crock pot was ruined. The outlet must have died and the food sat in there all day not cooking.	That sucks. I'm sorry. Did you call to ask about it?"
"Yeah it was pretty terrible. I had to throw out a TON of food, and to add insult to injure I had to go eat out tonight.	Yeah, I know what you mean.  I had that same experience with the crock pot."
"I let my friend babysit my kid last week.	That's cool, did your kid have a lot of fun?"
"Awesome. I usually have a hard time letting anyone watch my child but he had a great time with her.	I can't wait to get my own kid to babysit!"
"5	I can relate. My sister has two kids and she is an amazing mother."
"I was out walking by the lake over the weekend and there shore was just covered in dead rotting fish.	That's pretty gross.  What do you do in that situation?"
"I don't know, that's what I would like to know! The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped, and they died. I imagine it was pollution.	That is terrible! I hope they were not toxic."
"I have a really big game coming up this weekend. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league.	That's a lot of pressure. Do you have any experience?"
"I just don't want to embarrass myself or my team. I'm so scared i'm going to make a fool of myself.	I hope you do well."
"Several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches.	i was so scared!"
"I had to get 2 stitches in one of the holes and 1 stitch and all the other holes. He was a big dog, a little over 50 pounds.	I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get a settlement for it?"
"Last year I made a bet with my friend and he lost, so he had to buy me a Nintendo Switch. I was so great.	That's so cool! What was your friend so bad about?"
"I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet, but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.	I am glad you got a Nintendo Switch.  That is a lot of fun stuff to do!"
"I am visiting my friend this week.	It's always nice to see friends. What are your plans for the weekend?"
"Yes, I mean I promised her I would  and some things came up but I know I gotta stick to my word and make this happen.	I bet you will!"
"Oh I know I can't. She had lots of plans for us.	One time when I was little and playing hide and go seek, my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us. After a while I realized that we were going to be in trouble, and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way.	I bet that was a scary moment."
"Yeah I guess they were, they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin, even though I was 7 and it was his idea.	Yeah, my cousin was definitely a bad influence. He was a bit of a bully and a jerk, and he would often get into fights with other kids."
"So we are moving and I'm having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me. Thinking I should keep it.	I understand why you would want to keep it, but I think it's time to let go and move on."
"Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.	It is nice that you are keeping the thing that your grandma gave you."
"One of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of 25.	That is awesome. I bet they feel like they are on top of the world!"
"Yeah I know, I'm really amazed and proud of him. To be honest as proud as I am I can't help but to be a little jealous too lol.	I can understand that feeling, but at the end of the day, it's all about the money, and you're right, you're probably not that far from that milestone yet. Just time to start saving and working hard for that."
"I stayed at a friends house for the weekend a while back, and when I got home my bedroom was destroyed	Oh, that sounds terrible. What happened?"
"My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it	I'm sure you can get your things back from them.  What did they mess with?"
"Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me, because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.	That is so sad. I feel for you. Did you get a new one?"
"I hope so, I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I just wish I had someone here with me right now.	Oh, that's too bad. I bet you're not alone."
"My husband and I celebrated 9 years Saturday. It was such a good day of quality family time.	That is awesome.  What did you do?"
"Yes I love a good day of relaxation and family time :)	That is great!  I am sure you two have a lot of great memories to look back on.  I am so glad you have such a loving husband.  I wish I had someone like him to love me back!  I think I need to work on my self-worth.  I am so grateful for my family, I am sure I would be lost without them!  I love my family!  I am so grateful for my family!"
"Yes, dinner :)	I went to the zoo last month, I haven't been since I was a kid. I went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos, however I couldn't help but feel bad for the animals the whole time.	I'm sorry to hear that! I hope they are doing okay!"
"The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it.	It's always good to think about how the animals are living their lives. I'm sure they have a lot to be happy about, but sometimes you have to put yourself in their shoes and see things from their perspective."
"I won an essay contest and I get to go to Washington DC for free!	That's awesome! What did you study?"
"I wrote about social security reform. Kinda boring stuff lol but it'll be fun to visit all the sites in DC	That's cool!  What's the essay contest?"
"We are moving. I'm so pumped for new adventures.	It is exciting! What city are you moving to?"
"Yes, a new state. I am just imagining all the fun things and new things we can do.	Oh that is exciting! What city are you moving to?"
"When I was in middle school there was this boy that sat in front of me in 8th, he was always trying to get me to kiss him before class started.	Yeah that's pretty weird. Did you ever try to kiss him?"
"No, the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.	That sounds really awkward. I can't believe he would try to do that. I hope he was not that kind of weird or annoying."
"I've been out of a job for a while but someone I know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field	Oh, that is great! How long has it taken you to find a job?"
"Statistics. I am going to help a real estate company build models to predict house values	I hope you get it, I've been out of the job market for a long time."
"So a friend and I entered a drawing at the mall and she won. I wish I could say it doesn't sting a bit that she won.	That is unfortunate.  Did she have to go to a different store?"
"A weekend trip to Gatlinburg. I would of loved that.	I am sorry to hear that."
"She is but she's taking her husband :)	I saw  man swallow a sword	i saw a guy do that in a bar last year. it was pretty scary"
"Yes I was. I thought it was pretty intense to watch	That is a pretty cool thing to see!"
"I've been packing, packing, packing and cleaning.	Oh wow! Are you going on vacation?"
"Moving, not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.	I know how that feels.  I hope your moving soon."
"Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.	I would be mad as well! Did you get a police report?"
"Huge dent, I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.	That sucks!  Did you report them?"
"I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy.	Oh wow! I've never been to an airport with my dog. I'm not sure I would be allowed to bring one!"
"Oh man, I sure was. And she was so excited to get out of that box.	I remember when I got my first dog.  I was so excited to have her, and she was the most loyal companion ever"
"My brother isn't very good with money but i just lent him some	That's a good brother.  I don't think he would have been very good with money even without you lending him money."
"Yeah I don't do that often, but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time	I know how you feel about that. I've been there too. I just try to be patient."
"I just can't believe some people. I watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today.	Oh my gosh. That's terrible. Did she get in trouble for that?"
"I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.	That's terrible.  I hope you get to the bottom of this."
"So we are waiting on some news to move. I feel like it will be this week that we find out.	That's exciting. I hope everything goes smoothly."
"Not sure yet, waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.	That's frustrating.  Are you planning to move this weekend?"
"So I interviewed for my dream job last week and I didn't get it.	That's unfortunate. What kind of job was it?"
"I really hope so. I was really wanting that job.	I'm sorry, but what is the job that you were interviewing for?"
"So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.	I would be so grossed out!  I would probably pull over right there."
"Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.	I would have been pretty grossed out as well"
"I am so ready to find out where we are moving to.	That's exciting! Where are you moving to?"
"I don't know where I want to go, just want to know where they are sending us :)	Oh, I hope you find out soon!"
"A book I borrowed from the library got rained on and now it's destroyed	Oh no! I am so sorry."
"Yeah. I feel pretty bad about it.	It's a bummer, but at least you can use it as an opportunity to buy a new book."
"I found my dog's old toy. It brought back memories of when I first got her	Oh wow. Did she have the toy for years or was it just recently?"
"I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog was she?	I know, I'm so sorry. I miss her so much. I wish I could talk to her right now. I wish I could tell her how much she meant to me. She was the best dog in the world."
"After months of job searching, I finally got a good offer	That's great! What kind of job is it?"
"I got a job in statistics	That's great! How much did you get?"
"I have a final exam that I've been studying for for days.	Oh, that's good! You're going to do well."
"I think I will do really well. I feel prepared for it.	It's always nice when you feel prepared for an exam."
"I stupidly lent my car to a friend.	That's not cool.  What happened?"
"He got drunk and took it for a joyride. It didn't end well.	That is terrible. Did he damage the car or was he drunk enough to not cause any damage?"
"Even though I could've gotten more money at another job, I've stayed with my current employer. It is a good place to work.	It's always good to stay with one place"
"I work in public relations. I create campaigns for companies.	Oh, that's great. I wish I worked in PR too!"
"I recently did a very successful one for a medical company.	Oh, wow! I'm glad to hear that. What was the campaign about?"
"I just had a job interview that went really well. I'm expecting a call pretty soon.	I'm sure that went well.  Did they ask about anything else besides what you told?"
"It's a statistical analyst job.	Yeah that sounds good."
"I recently moved to a new city. I left behind some good friends.	That's tough. How did you do it?"
"That's very true. It'll just take some time.	That's true. I hope it works out. It'll be okay."
"Last week I was at the grocery store picking up body wash. There were so many to chose from, but I couldn't help but buy my trusted brand that has served me well for so many years.	Oh yeah! My husband always says the same, he likes the same thing as me."
"Yes, why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well.	It's so hard to try new things, especially if it was something that worked well."
"I have to show some brand loyalty!	I have so much to do today, but it's raining. I'm OK with just staying at home and doing nothing.	Oh, I understand. I have the same problem."
"It sucks. Maybe it'll be dry this weekend.	Oh, I know, it is frustrating!"
"My dog I had for five years just passed away. He was hit by a car last night.	Oh no.  I am so sorry to hear that.  I am so heartbroken."
"It is just so sad to have my loyal companion taken away like that.	Oh my! I'm so sorry to hear about the loss. It's so hard to say goodbye."
"His name was Han Solo, I am a huge Star Wars fan. My wife thought it was a dorky name, but I loved it.	I'm ready for hurricane season. I have my kit ready and everything.	Oh no! Hurricane season is scary!"
"South Alabama, near the Gulf.	It's always a little scary when there's a hurricane, but it's a good thing to have the right preparation in order."
"I have been sick the last week and my wife has made my chicken broth soup every day!	Oh wow! That sounds like the best!"
"She is such a blessing to me and spoils me so much.	That sounds so kind of your wife!"
"Yeah, I try to treat her the best I can, can't lose someone that amazing.	When I go out to a restaurant, I order gluten free food items.  I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not, my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.	I can understand why, but I always go to restaurants and order the ""gluten free"" and just trust the person in front of me to do their job right.  I don't want to risk my health and have to go back to the hospital."
"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	It can be frustrating when you order something you want and the food isn't made with your dietary restrictions in mind."
"Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.	We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!	That's a pretty weird thing to see. Did you guys get a t-shirt with a funny color?"
"I was concerned they were the wrong drink order, we lined them up and talked to the server and together figured out the syrup bag must be going empty!	That's so cool! I have never had that happen before."
"While cleaning out our closets, I always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be.  Last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make ""jean purses"" out of someday.  My kid is 14 this week!!!	I'm sorry you are having this hard, but it sounds like your kids are growing up fast!"
"It definitely triggers some emotions!  Then I'm torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging.	Oh, that's so true.  I'm so glad I have a few of those memories.  I don't think I'd ever have those if I hadn't kept them.  My kids are going to be my kids for life, so it's so hard not wanting to hold on to anything that reminds them of me.  I'm trying to be okay with that but sometimes I wish I could just let go.  I hope I can find that balance for myself in life."
"My wife made me pancakes for breakfast. I have a full belly and feel rather happy now.	That's nice. Do you have kids?"
"One of my favorite breakfast foods. She also made some thick sliced bacon. She treats me so well.	Oh my goodness! That's the best breakfast ever! I love bacon and pancakes too! I bet you felt like a king!"
"For sure, no other woman I would rather have.	I love bacon. I have a bacon obsession. I think it's because my grandma had it."
"How can I complain when she gets up early to make me such a great meal!	I think you should just go for it! She is the one."
"I told my brother that I was planning to propose to my best friend, but I hope he keeps it a secret!	That sounds like a pretty exciting moment! What kind of proposal are we talking about?"
"He lets things slip once in a while, but this is a pretty big secret so I have confidence in him.	I bet he will be happy when he finds out!"
"I have a friend who is struggling right now in her business.  I'm trying hard to be there to support and cheer her on.	That's really kind of you, I'm glad you are there to support her."
"RIght? Even if I can't directly affect her business, I can help keep her spirits up to weather the storm!	Yeah, I know how that is.  My friend is in a tough spot right now, but I know she's going to be fine.  I'm just trying to be there for her.  It's hard to see someone else struggling and not being able to help.  I'm trying to be there too.  I just know she'll come out the other side.  I'm so proud of her.  I know she's going to do great.  I know she"
"I saw my neighbor bought the car I have always wanted. I wish I was in a a better financial position to buy one.	That's a pretty frustrating feeling. I would have been too. Maybe you should just save up for it?"
"Subaru Brat, best car ever made. Its like a car and a t ruck all in one.	Oh wow, that is a nice car. I would have loved to have that. I am not very good at cars. I have never even been to a car show."
"I know, it would look perfect in front of my double wide mobile home! There is a used one on the corner for $350. But that will take me months to save up.	I have one! I love my Subaru Brat!"
"Yeah, or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big.	That sounds like a fun way to save money.  I'm not sure what the scratch and win odds are though."
"I am in the process of potty training my daughter, but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper. The other day, we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service.	I know, I was so upset.  I don't know why it still is a big deal with her.  She's 3 years old."
"It was not one of our best moments. Luckily, she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.	I can understand that, but I was so embarrassed. I am not sure if it is a phase or if it's a problem."
"I ordered a new toy for my son online for his birthday.	That's awesome! What toy is it?"
"No, not yet. But, I can't wait to! He's going to have so much fun with it.	That's awesome! What toy is it?"
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December. i can't wait!!!	Oh wow!  That sounds like so much fun!  What are you planning on doing on the cruise?"
"I hope so too. I have wanted to go on a cruise for so long. I'm happy were are able to go this year.	I've been wanting to go on a cruise for years too! I've heard they're very good for relaxation.  Have fun!"
"We are going with a few friends, so they booked it and we got a discount because they are returning customers.	My dad called me one day crying out for help. I had to drive over to his house.	Oh, what happened? Did he have some kind of emergency?"
"He had fallen and bruised his ribs. I had to take him to the hospital.	I am sorry to hear that, that must have been a scary situation for your father."
"Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities, I have been in a rut lately. Last week, during revival, for the first few nights, everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit, but I couldn't for whatever reason, and it made me feel bad.	That's sad.  Did you go back to church?"
"Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.	I'm sorry you felt down and down, but I think sometimes you need that kind of time to recharge and refocus."
"Thank you. He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.	Sometimes I wake up at night and eat junk food.	I do too, but I have to say, I have never eaten anything but junk food at night."
"Yeah but I feel bad afterwards. I like to make peanut butter and nutella sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies.	I'm sure you'll feel good about it in the morning, and you can just enjoy your junk food. I'm sure you won't feel bad about eating junk food!"
"We had a birthday party for my son the other day!	That's awesome! What did he do?"
"He's 6. It was so much fun to watch him open his presents.	Oh my, that's awesome. I have 2 boys. I love seeing them open presents!"
"I was the captain of the volley ball team in middle school and high school, so I signed my daughters up to play. since they had an interest in it too. When we got the practice on the first day, the coach said that it was her first year coaching and she asked me if I would help a little.	Oh that's cool.  I'm not a volleyball player, but I know someone who is.  Did they have fun?"
"I was very excite to help. I miss playing very much, so being able to play with my daughters and show of my skills a little was great.	That's really cool!  It's great that you have such a close relationship with them.  Do you have a favorite team?"
"A couple years ago, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with MS.	oh, i see, that's terrible, i hope you are okay"
"Yeah, I was blind in my right eye, and my left arm was numb.	I am sorry. Did you have a cure?"
"My friend has been sick a lot recently and I am worried about her.	I'm sorry to hear that. Are you taking her to the doctor?"
"Yes.  She has been vomiting and having diarhea a lot	Yeah, that is bad. I hope she gets better soon.  I hope it is just a stomach bug and not a more serious disease.  I hope she gets better."
"Yes.  It has just happened on and off for months.	I am sitting here chilling out with my cat on my lap.	That's so sweet. I love my cat."
"Yes.  My cat is relaxing and always sleeping	That is nice, my cat is sleeping too"
"I had a job interview last week	Oh wow.  What kind of job?"
"I am not sure yet.  I was very nervous	I hope you do great."
"Next week I think	I spent a weekend at a lake house all by myself.	That is a bit alone, but it is also very peaceful."
"It was fantastic.  I found it so restful and peaceful just to get away from it all for a while.	That's awesome! Where was it?"
"I had a get together recently, One of my friends brought someone who couldn't hold their liquor.	That was really bad. Did they have a good time?"
"Heh, well they projectile vomited all over my carpet, it was gross.	Oh, that's awful.  I hate that kind of thing.  Did anyone else get a little gross?"
"Me and my daughter went to the skate park the other day.	That sounds like a fun experience.  What was your daughter doing there?  Was she trying out for the team?"
"Yeah we did. She can ride up and down the ramps much better than I expected her to.	Yeah she's got a great personality."
"I've been out of work, and my dads been helping me financially.	That is really nice of him.  I bet you appreciate that."
"No, I am filing for disability. Theres no way I can ever repay him	Yeah, that is understandable.  But, you should be able to repay him, if you work.  You are being very generous."
"I had to meet my new physical therapist this week.	Oh no. What happened?"
"They seem ok. I just hate having to meet new doctors.	That's understandable, but they are there to help you."
"This is the first time ever that both of my kids have been in school.	That is so exciting! I have been to school since I was a kid. I remember how hard it was. How old are they?"
"Yeah, it's just too quiet lol.	That's nice!"
"Recently my family had a trip that was very disorganized. Basically drove a long way to hang see my family for a handful of hours.	That's no fun at all. Did you get to see them in person?"
"Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.	I agree. Sometimes it is just good to stay home"
"That is true, I guess there is that to be thankful for.	I had to wait in line at the store the other day for 15 minutes!	It is frustrating when people are in a hurry."
"Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.	It can be so frustrating. I have been there a few times and I've gotten so mad that I just walked out and bought my food at the grocery store."
"I had to go to my brother in laws funeral last week.	I'm sorry to hear about that.  How did you handle it?"
"I'm ok. It just hit me hard seeing all those sad people.	That is a sad occasion.  I hope they are okay."
"I have some friends who are traveling all over Europe this summer	That's a fun trip. I'm a bit too old for traveling to that kind of distance."
"I am!  I would love to go myself.	It sounds like a lot of fun.  I've been wanting to travel there too.  What is your favorite part of Europe to visit?"
"My and some old friends from college recently got together. It's always great to see those guys again.	That's always fun to see old friends."
"Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.	That's a bummer. I've been away for a few years now."
"No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.	Yeah I understand. It's hard when you can't get everyone in the same room. It's like you have to be on a different plane."
"My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.	Oh wow, I didn't know that!"
"I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.	It happens all the time, I think she just likes the way she looks in them."
"Oh, I've tried...	This weekend I saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color.	I'm so sorry.  That is terrible.  Why was they being mean?"
"No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.	Oh, that's so awful. I hope you guys are safe!"
"No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.	I understand that, but it's hard to see how she was able to get away with that for so long!"
"I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently, but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.	Oh, I am sorry. Are you going to be able to see her soon?"
"We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.	Yeah, I know what you mean. I have a niece as well, but she lives in another state, so I don't see her often either."
"The last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes, shoes, and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school. There first day was yesterday and it went well.	That's great! What are the kids in 1st and 3rd?"
"I'm home with my toddler, so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.	I bet it did. That's what shopping for school is all about."
"Recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back.	I bet. How long have you been waiting?"
"Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.	I bet. I'm glad everything worked out in the end."
"My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.	I'm sorry to hear that, that's not what you signed up for"
"It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.	Oh, I understand. My brother and his wife had a very complicated divorce, and it ended up being a very messy and emotional one. They are now divorced and it's a bit of a rough start."
"Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.	Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends.	I love volleyball, I used to play it in high school."
"The memories are awesome and I miss playing.But I wouldn't trade the life I live now to go back,	That is so true.  I used to love playing with my friends, I miss it."
"I am going fishing at my favorite spot tomorrow. I know I am going to catch something!	I love fishing! Where are you going to go?"
"Blue catfish, they get so huge. I have a secret recipe for stink bait that works well!	I've never been fishing before but I've been told it's fun. I've heard about stink bait, but I've never heard about secret recipes. What's stink bait made of?"
"Oh I will, fried catfish is so amazing. Especially beer battered!	I am going to play dominos tonight	That is a fun night, are you going with friends or family?"
"Well with some locals at the local brewpub	That's fun!  I love playing domino's, but I have never played with a group of locals.  What is it like?"
"Yes I think I will do well even though I just learned last week how to play!	my family came to visit recently, i always get so nervous about people visiting.	Oh, that's a little nervousness. Is there anything in particular you are nervous about?"
"I have to make sure the house is clean and that everything is in order before they arrive, nerve wracking!	I bet that was nerve wrecking. I always feel the same way about guests."
"I have a birthday coming up. I really hop I get the gift I am asking for.	I am sure you will."
"Thank you, I am hoping for a new camera. It is about time to upgrade.	I am sure you will. I got the same thing last year."
"Thanks, I really enjoy getting out and photographing nature.	My dog go into the trash can and drug it all over the house. I am so mad right now!	That's so annoying. Did you take him out for a walk?"
"I know, it is going to take me all evening to clean up!	Yeah that is so annoying. I would have to call the animal control."
"He is usually good, but this time his naughtiness got to him.	I am going camping this weekend. I got my tent, sleeping bag and tons of food. I think I have everything I need!	That's awesome. What's the weather like? I'm a little nervous about it."
"Oh I will, I am ready for whatever the elements throw at me!	That is awesome!  I have been camping a couple of times.  What type of camping do you plan on doing?"
"It will be a blast, I just love roughing it in the outdoors!	The other night i heard a sound like someone was breaking in my house, i was pretty scared.	That's so scary! Did you call the police?"
"No, it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating.	That is pretty scary. I don't like it when it happens."
"It has been raining a lot lately, I am really trusting the seal on our doors to keep the water out.	I hope the water doesnnt get in your door!"
"I know, it really starts too pool up by our house. It is getting kind of scary!	I am so sorry. I am sure it will dry up soon."
"Yeah, really don't want to deal with a flooded home! Would not be good for my family.	I bought a cake from the store and it ended up tasting terrible.	I would have been upset.  Did the store have a good quality cake?"
"No, I ended up just suffering through it and eating it.	I would have been upset. Did it taste like it had some kind of flavor or was it just gross?"
"Yeah, I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me.	I was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently, I bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better.	It's good you took care of yourself and made yourself feel better. It's always a good idea to be professional and look your best in front of a camera."
"Yea, it made me feel better about myself and my chances, or maybe i just like spending money	Yeah, sometimes a little bit of self care can really go a way in making you feel more confident about your situation"
"I love chocolate cookies because my grams would always make them for me.	That's so cool. What's her name?"
"Nothing beats cookies made by grandma. Except for the oatmeal ones. Too healthy haha.	I love cookies, but they can't be healthy. I love cookies too, but I love them more when they're made by my grandpa. He was a great cook!"
"Only if it has raisins to sweeten them up!	I found an old picture of when my oldest daughter started kindergarten 11 years ago.	That is so cool!  How old is she now?"
"It is!  In it, she's just standing with a huge smile on her face and a Hello Kitty backpack.	That's so sweet.  I'm sure it brings back a lot of memories for you."
"I've been teaching my young daughter to play video games with me, she's such a quick learner.	That's so sweet! What kind of games are they playing?"
"Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them, It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence.	I have a daughter, she is 3 and is so cute. She loves playing with her dolls, but I have to play video games to keep her entertained."
"It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.	I love that dip. I used to buy it by the container"
"I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!	That's sad. I'm sure they'll restock it soon though."
"Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!	I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.	Yeah, I'm glad I did that job for so long."
"It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!	That sounds great! What kind of job is it?"
"I try to.  But I'm glad all the effort is being recognized!	I put in to get a promotion at work, and I should know something either way by tomorrow.	Yeah, I bet, you should hear back by the end of tomorrow. What kind of promotion are you talking about?"
"On the one hand, I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.	Yeah I can relate, it can be nerve wring."
"I work for a medical supply company.	I'm sorry to ask, but I'm not sure what that is?"
"Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.	I'm so shocked. I never would think that."
"I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!	It's a shame, and they should be put in jail."
"Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.	When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup	I'm glad they made it that far!"
"So good, genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!	Yeah, England is pretty cool!"
"But yeah - school started for the kids today and it was weird how quiet it was once the bus pulled away.	Oh, I know right? It's always a bit of an adjustment for the parents to be back to work and just having the kids at home."
"It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.	That's cool.  What age are the kids?"
"Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!	It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with. Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!"
"I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years, after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!	That sounds gross! I bet it was gross to see all that stuff that had been left behind!"
"Yes indeed, there was even a frog under there! So bizarre!	That's disgusting! What did you do?"
"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	You are right. They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty."
"Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.	That's really horrible. It's so inhumane. I don't know what they were doing."
"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	That's good to hear. I'm sure it is a lot more difficult for those animals that live in other parts of the world."
"And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!	Yeah, I agree. I have friends who volunteer at a shelter in my city, it's so nice!"
"My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.	That is awesome!  I hope he gets the chance."
"I am, too!  I'm glad he's doing something he loves.  At this point, I'm just waiting on the text to see which team he made it onto.	It's good that he's doing well in soccer."
"I'm so glad the kids went back to school today!	I bet you are relieved to see them go back to school.  How long have the kids been in school?"
"Yes!  I can go back to having ice cream for breakfast!  I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the, ""Mom, you always watch this!"" comment!	That's so sweet.  What are the kids named?"
"How old are they?	I love ice cream for breakfast."
"Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL	My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.	That is sad. What do you do for fun?"
"On the one hand, I hope so but on the other hand, I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD	Oh I'm so jealous! I've been wanting to go on vacation for months but I'm too lazy to get up and go. I'll probably just take a sick day and go home and play video games."
"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	I would be scared.  What did you do?"
"He was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me, the neighbor finally came out and called him home. was intense.	Yeah I've heard of that happening before. It was pretty scary."
"The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.	I'm so sorry.  How did it die?  I'm so sorry you lost your little sweetpey."
"She was under my house, crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.	I am so sorry for losing her.  I had no idea she had such bad health."
"And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad, but I take comfort in those things.	My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked. A few days later she was playing no problem!	Oh no, I am sure she was frustrated."
"Yea, i was pretty proud of her, especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid.	That's so cool. I'm glad she's learning to adapt."
"I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you try to find out how much it cost to find out?"
"I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!	That is frustrating, I hope she doesn't mind you going over there to pay off the fees. I'd feel like that's a necessary step for her to get a good education."
"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	That's so nice of her.  I hope you are doing okay?"
"Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.	That's good to hear. I've been going through a lot of my own stuff, my parents have been helping me out. I'm trying to get back to normal life as much as possible."
"When my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy	That's so sad. What happened?"
"hah, i hear ya. I just got so used to all the commotion i suppose.	I feel you.  I am a very quiet type of person, and I love the peace and quiet.  I am a very introvert and I love my alone time.  I think I would be a little crazy if I was in a busy city all the time.  I would probably be a little crazy if I was at work all day.  I think I would be a better introvert if I was at home all the time."
"When we were kids, my sister and i once stole a blank check from our mom to order a pizza, we got caught.	I bet you felt bad about that."
"My mom noticed the charge and found a the missing check from her checkbook, i'll never forget the look of dissapointment on her face!	That's so funny! I bet it's funny looking at the check now!"
"Oh yea. grounded for a long time.	I just saw a movie I had been looking forward to and it was terrible	It is always better to wait for a better time to watch the movie, I think."
"It was the new Jurassic World	I'm sorry, I have heard that movie was terrible. I'll try to avoid it"
"My coworker forgot to turn in the paperwork to switch our on call weeks. He ended up costing me $250! I'm so mad!!!	Yeah, that's not good. You can't just leave your work without following the proper procedures, that's not good."
"He's such a worm. I can't stand it.	That's terrible.  What did you do?"
"Working from home can be difficult when people won't leave me alone to get work done.	I know, I hate working from home too.  It can be hard to get out of the house.  Do you work from home?"
"I love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video, gonna pull my hair out.	I know the feeling. My kid is always playing video games."
"I have a big date coming up and I can't get these butterfly feelings to go away.	It can be hard to have butterflies about it. I'm sure it'll all be alright."
"Yeah, I really think she might be the one. I hope I don't screw it up.	That is great! You will be fine!"
"Thank you, I am looking forward to taking her to a nice place to eat!	I bit into an apple and found a worm. It was so gross.	That's disgusting! Did you throw it out?"
"Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple.	I know, right?  I was so grossed out.  I thought it would be a worm in my water.  I was so grossed out."
"That is true, I should be thankful for that.	I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs.	Oh my, that's scary!  Did you get to watch them?"
"They really startled me, the female did not seem happy to see me.	That is a pretty scary situation, I would be very scared too."
"Yeah, thankfully I was able to get away. It took a while for me to catch my breath.	I got a new dog recently, he is the best. I am so thankful for him!	That's really great. Do you have any pets?"
"He is a male australian shepherd. His name is charlie, he is super cute!	I love a good dog story!  I've got a couple of pets myself, so I know what you're talking about!  What breed is Charlie?"
"Will do! He is super cuddly and loves to follow me around!	There was one piece of pie left in the fridge. Instead of sharing it, I ate it. I kind of feel bad.	I would feel bad too."
"It might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone. I look super guilty right now.	I would too. You should try to make up with her. I would."
"I could, I might have to buy her some of her favorite chocolate.	I was at the park today and almost stepped on a rattle snake. I almost jumped out of my skin.	I'm not even going to the park today."
"Me too, that would of wrecked my day. It was so close! It haunts my thoughts even now.	I am so sorry to hear that. I hope the snake is not still around and is waiting to strike again."
"It might take me a little while to get over my fear and go back to the park.	I am sorry.  That is a scary experience.  Did it happen recently?"
"For sure, wouldn't want to relive that experience	I just got a bonus from my job. That money came at the perfect time!	It is always nice when you get a bonus."
"It was a really nice bonus too, they were impressed with the quality of work I have done this year.	I bet! What kind of job is that?"
"Now I will have to work even harder and try to earn a larger one next year.	I was going to go to the movies with a bunch of friends. But they all bailed on me and now I have to go alone.	That sucks, I hate when that happens"
"I hope so, but I am really missing them right now. I didn't want to go alone.	I know how you're feeling. Sometimes you just can't go without them. Maybe next time they'll be back on your side."
"It is hard to find reliable friends. No one seems to show up anymore.	I was out photographing butterflies and took the most incredible photo. I am really happy with how it turned out!	I love photography. Did you get it with a good light?"
"The butterfly was yellow. It was a tiger swallowtail. One of my favorites!	That's so cool! What kind of camera did you use?"
"I saw my dog try to eat a dirty diaper one time	I would have been so grossed out."
"Yeah, it's nasty. I wouldn't let her lick my face for a while after that.	Oh, I'm sorry! What happened?"
"I was trying to take a nap, but my cat kept on trying to play with my head.	It is annoying when the pets keep playing with you."
"I usually love mine, but not when it is keeping me from sleeping	That's a bit annoying. I'm a cat lover, but I don't want my cat to sleep with me."
"I just had a job interview and I'm waiting to hear if I got the job.	Oh, I am sorry to hear that.  Are you sure you got it?"
"Me too. I'm feeling pretty nervous about it	That's good! I'm sure you'll get it."
"I was on a plane ride and we went through some pretty severe turbulence	That's no fun. Was it scary at all?"
"Yes it was. I was so afraid we'd crash	It's always a little scary when you're flying. But it's usually not as intense as it sounds."
"My cousin and I tricked my butler into thinking he won millions in the lottery. I feel so bad.	I would feel bad for you, that would have been so bad to do."
"Only a few minutes.	That's so sad.  I hope you both got away with it.  Did you guys laugh?"
"Someone came to my door with a gun, asking for money	Oh no!  What happened?"
"I didn't have any. He came into the house and stole some stuff	That is terrible. Did you report the crime to the police?"
"Our cat had to many health problems, so we had to put him down.	That is terrible. I am so sorry.  I know how hard it is to lose our pets.  My cat passed away last month and I still feel so much loss.  I am so sorry you lost your pet.  I know how hard it is to lose our pets.  I know how hard it is to lose our pets.  I hope you find some comfort in the memories of the time you spent with your pet.  I hope you find some comfort in the memories"
"I had him for 17 years, he lived a full and happy life, but I was not ready for him to go.	Yeah it was hard. He was my best friend."
"But they make your life so much enjoyable while they are around!	I went to do karaoke with a guy i'm dating and I discovered he's a really talented singer	That's cool. I've never done karaoke before, I'm not very good at it. I hope he didn't sing too badly!"
"He's kind of shy about it. He had to get really drunk to perform karaoke	Oh wow, that is cool! Did you guys have fun together?"
"I had to do a research project and present it to my professors to graduate. Thankfully I passed!	It's good that you passed. That is great news."
"I worked many long hours. It was stressful but I'm happy to have done well	That's great, you must be proud of yourself!"
"My sister has been playing a song I dislike over and over and over	That can be frustrating."
"She does it more because she likes it than to bug me. It's going to be stuck in my head for weeks	That sounds annoying!  I hope she doesn't get it stuck in her head and start singing it in the car or something!"
"okay.	I am happy for you"
"That is great! What will you be doing there?	That is great! What will you be doing there?"
"I accidentally slapped someone in the face while I was playing basketball.	Oh no! That must have been very unpleasant! Did you get in trouble?"
"No, I think she was just a little shocked by it. I felt so bad.	That's a little embarrassing, but you're right, it's not a big deal."
"I let my friend borrow my car. He's an international student and only has a permit.	That's good of him to do that for you"
"I was in the car with him. He just wanted to practice driving and he didn't have his own car.	Oh no, I hope he didn't get into trouble."
"I am at a cross road. I am trying to decide my major in college.	I am sure there are plenty of options out there.  What are you considering?"
"I was thinking about graphic design. Or, I was going to do something practical like Nursing.	That's a tough one!  What are your thoughts?"
"I guess you are right. I really like sketching and painting. I can use my creativity side.	I've been trying to save money so that I can help my husband with the Christmas shopping this year.	That's so thoughtful of you.  I love Christmas and the time to get all excited about it!"
"Well at first I was a little discouraged because I wasn't making that much. Things have picked up recently though, and I feel I will be able to help him a good bit so I'm feeling better about it.	That's great! It's good that you are thinking ahead. I'm sure you'll do just fine."
"I had planned to take my daughter shopping a few weeks ago. We were all really excited, but the plans fell through.	It is unfortunate that things don't always go as planned, but it is good that it didn't ruin your plans."
"Yes. We were able to go about a week later, but the closer it got to school starting back I started to stress. Everything is good now though.	I bet it was stressful.  I hate it when that happens.  Did you find anything?"
"I check in with my partner to see if we are okay. I ask him if there is anything that we can work on to make the relationship better.	That's nice. What do you think?"
"I don't want to have problems. This is why I check in with him.	That's very thoughtful of you. It's great that you are looking out for each other. I'm glad to hear that you are in a healthy relationship."
"When I go out with friends I really have to be tight with my money. Times are really hard for me financially?	I understand."
"I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much. I sometimes like to leave a tip if possible.	I completely understand, I always have to be careful with my money.  It is always good to be frugal.  I hope you have fun with your friends and that your financial situation doesn't worsen."
"I find it appalling how my husband's family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away.	I'm sorry to hear that, I hope they understand how much you care for your family."
"Yes, it is. They are all being really selfish and childish. My husband is staying out of it, but I can tell that he is getting fed up with it.	That's horrible. They are probably trying to get attention from you."
"I have to run several errands for my father-in-law today and he wants them done before my mother-in-law get into town, which is at some unspecified time today.	That's pretty frustrating.  What do you do?"
"Yeah, I'm ready to get everything done so I can relax. I can't start on the errands until I drop the kids at school though.	That's great that you can relax.  I hope you can relax and enjoy the day."
"I really do miss my mother. She has been dead for about 15 years now.	Oh no. That must be very difficult."
"It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.	Yeah, I think that is the best way to deal with the situation."
"Yes, it is. I know that time heals.	I'm glad you have someone like that in your life."
"My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings. So, I would have to let go and let them fly.	Oh, that's a sad thought. I hope they are happy."
"I have 23, 20, 17 and 14. They are doing stuff that I question but I don't want them to not tell me stuff.	That's so sad. You should try to have a talk with them and see if you can find a solution."
"When I was in labor with my third child, they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital. The nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor. In the 2 minutes it took for him to get to my room, my heart dropped and I started to panic. He told me that the baby's heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency C-section right then.	I'm sorry to hear that, that's awful. Did you have a C-section?"
"Yes, everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.	Oh, that's terrible! I hope you're all okay now!"
"Yes, they do. I ope your boy is all good now.	I finally beat level 150 on the crucible today in my favorite game Grim Dawn.	I love that game too.  I love playing it when I have some free time."
"PC all the way. I've been grinding devotion points all week.	Oh wow! Congrats on finally beat level 150! That must feel so good."
"I just found a hello kitty pot in my daughters room filled with water and old flowers.	That's a little spooky. Did she make it?"
"It's not cute, and she's nine. By old flowers I mean, it's a green, stagnant slush with mold growing on top.	Oh wow, that must have been gross."
"When I enter the bus, I fainted. I think that I got overheated.	I am sorry to hear that! Was it a long bus ride?"
"Yes I did. It was so hot outside and I did not have much to drink.	That is awful! Did you get help?"
"I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends	Oh no!  Did anyone know what you did?"
"I fell down, and apparently said some embarrassing things.	Oh no, that's a bummer. What were they saying?"
"My daughter is graduating from college. I cannot wait until she finish.	It's nice to hear."
"Yes, I will. She has been under a lot of stress.	I bet. Congratulations."
"Two years ago I got diagnosed with MS.	I am sorry to hear that. How is it treating you now?"
"Its a disease that attacks the nervous system. It was really scary to find out I had it. I just went blind in my right eye one day. Two days and several test later I found out I had MS.	I'm sorry, that is awful."
"I found out that my daughter is moving out. My youngest one told me so.	Oh no. How old is your youngest child?"
"I feel really sad because I felt she should have told me.	That's sad.  How old is your youngest?"
"I let my sister borrow my car. She is a new driver.	That's so sweet of you. Did she get in an accident?"
"Well, nothing. I'm sure that she will be a responsible driver.	That's not fair. She's a new driver. She's not going to be responsible. I should be the one to take her car."
"I think that I will do good on my test.	I hope so! What are you studying for?"
"It is tonight. I studied really hard.	That's great! What test is it?"
"I heard a song that I hadn't heard in awhile. It reminded me of my high school days	That's cool. Did you go back and see your old friends?"
"Yes, it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when I was young.	That's nice. I like that."
"My dad dies when I was 33 years old.	That is sad, what happened?"
"Thank you. I was crushed, and it left me with questions about my own mortality.	Yeah, that can be a hard thing to deal with."
"My mother fell and injured herself. I wanted help and comfort her in any way possible.	I hope she recovers well. I am sorry to hear that."
"Yes, but bhe bruised her wrist, and had a concussion. I wish that I was there for her when it happened.	That sounds really bad, I hope she is okay now."
"I had a nice meal and my favorite beverage after work	That's great. What did you have for dinner?"
"It was a skirt steak with avocados. I was very satisfied.	Oh, I love a good skirt steak!"
"When I started a new job. I was nervous about proving myself all over again.	I know that feeling. I was nervous about proving myself too at first."
"I did, but I find it hard to trust people. Especially at work.	I can understand that. I had a hard time trusting my coworkers at my new job too, but it took me some time to get used to"
"I am trying to quit drinking soda and I have prayed to God and asked Him to help me. The problem is I am addicted to soda and Its very hard to quit. When I do manage to skip a day, the lack of caffeine causes horrible headaches.	It's not easy quitting anything but it's worth it to feel good. I know how you are feeling."
"It just makes me feel bad, that no matter how many times I try, I still give in to the temptation.	It's a tough struggle, but I know you can do it.  I've quit drinking too, it's hard but worth it."
"Yeah, I think that's what I will have to do. Thanks for the advice.	I went on a job interview. I'm anxiously waiting to hear if I got the job.	It's okay, just relax and you will get the job"
"I still need wait another week.	That's good, you'll get there."
"A drafter.	I just went to clean my kids sink a few minutes ago. I found a bunch of toys in the catch and I am mad.	That's terrible. Did you get any toys out of the catch?"
"Yeah, all the toys are out. But, they got some explaining to do after school.	Yeah, that's a good idea, they need to know what to do with them."
"I couldn't sleep last night. I ended up staying up till 2am and eating a large amount of Shepard's pie.	I'm sorry you had such a rough night, but I'm glad you were able to sleep eventually!"
"Combination of stress and new meds I think. Maybe I can get back to my old scheduled soon.	That's a good excuse. I know how it is."
"I saw my crush talking to another guy.	That's not good."
"I was a little upset, but it wasn't my business. I let it go.	I am sure you were not."
"When I went to the store the other day, I seen a guy all tweaked out on drugs.	That must have been scary."
"No, but he seemed a little unpredictable, so I used the other door.	That is a scary thing to see, especially if he is not a friend of yours."
"Holding each of my children for the first time was amazing.	I'm so glad you got them!  That is the best feeling in the world.  Did you have a big celebration?"
"Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.	I have two. They are both 5. They are going to be in college soon."
"I forgot about my grandmother's birthday a couple years back. I felt so bad about it!	I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do to make her up for it?"
"Absolutely! I called her the next day and made sure to visit her. :)	That is so good of you. I would have felt the same way. I have a grandma as well and I forgot about my grandkids birthday a couple years back and I called them. They are 6 and 8, so I called them both at the same time."
"She did. :) It ended up being a good visit anyway!	I was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day, and I found all my old paintball gear.	I bet that brought back some good memories."
"No, just me. But, I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.	Yeah I know how that feels."
"I went skydiving last summer with my partner. It was so scary!	I would never do that!"
"Absolutely! I've always been scared of heights, but I'm so glad I made myself.	I can understand that! I'm afraid of heights myself."
"When I was a kid, I had a dog at my grandpa's. He gave it away because it wouldn't hunt.	Yeah, that's a good story."
"I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.	I bet you did. I had a dog when I was 10. I was so mad when she was sick, and she died too."
"I tripped and fell in front of some people.	I hate when that happens.  What happened?"
"No, only my pride was injured.	That is so funny. I would have been mortified."
"I recently dug up a necklace my grandmother gave me when I was young for a birthday. I hadn't seen it in years.	It's nice you can still look at it now and see how beautiful it is!"
"Yeah, she passed more than five years ago and I had forgotten all about it. It brought back so many memories though!	That's great! I love it when you have those kinds of memories. Did you go shopping after?"
"I just won an award for best yard in the neighborhood!	I love winning awards.  What award did you win?"
"I did, mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off.	That sounds like a lot of work.  I would love to have a yard.  It must be great to have a yard like that.  I bet the neighbors love it!"
"It is, it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards.	I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends, it should be so much fun!	That sounds like a great time."
"We often throw around a frisbee for a little bit, but we never get too intense with any sports.	That sounds like a fun event"
"Me too, there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!	That sounds like fun. I love hanging out with friends, especially when there's good food to eat."
"I snuck some candy out of my daughter's snack stash. I feel bad because I had been trying to diet.	That is not good.  I hope you don't eat all of it."
"Otherwise it's been pretty good- I've managed to lose 12 pounds! Just wish I could let the sugar cravings go.	I am so sorry. I hope she doesn't find it too hard."
"My childhood friend gave me a watch for by birthday a few years ago, I lost it in a move recently. I'm pretty upset by it.	Yeah that's a bummer.  You should probably check with your friends to see if they have any information about it.  Maybe they've found it."
"I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!	Yeah I've lost a few things before. I hope your friend gets it back!"
"I let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day.	That's awesome! I bet she had a blast. How old is she?"
"She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.	I bet. I've never let her ride without a helmet."
"It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.	Yeah I feel bad for her. I hope she is okay."
"It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.	I am so sorry, it is terrible to hear."
"I was feeling really down for a few weeks and my sister knew. She drove hours to come see me and make me feel better!	That is nice of her, I bet you felt better after seeing her."
"Yeah it was really sweet of her and made me feel so much better!	Yeah, sometimes the people we care about the most can really make a big difference in our lives, and that makes us feel better."
"I was recently on a long international flight and we hit some really bad turbulence.	That sucks. Did you get any compensation for it?"
"I didn't, but I was really nervous for a little while. My wife didn't handle it quite as well.	I hate turbulence. It makes me nervous. I hope it was a short trip."
"For sure. And it was a great trip.	I screwed up plans for a date night with my wife. We ended up having to cancel and she was really mad about it.	That's terrible! Did they reschedule for another time?"
"We did and I made sure to not screw that one up!	That's so frustrating! What happened?"
"Me too. Who knows what would have happened to me if I did it twice.	I was able to go back home to my parents for a few weeks recently. It was wonderful to relax in my childhood home.	It sounds like a great time!"
"They loved having me around again! Our ten year old dog wouldn't leave my side.	That sounds like a great trip! I bet you had a lot of fun times there."
"I've been thinking about buying some new, softer skateboard wheels.	That is a pretty cool thought.  Are you going to go for a new set or just upgrade to something new?"
"No, they make rough pavement feel smoother. I think I'll just keep the ones I have for now though. Just have to deal with having a rough ride.	I understand, I have to deal with having a rough ride on the road too. But I think it would be nice to have softer wheels to ride in."
"I took my dog I've had for years over to meet one of my husband's sisters the other night.	Yeah, I'm sure that didn't end well for your poor dog."
"It did not go well at all! She pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home.	Oh my god! That is terrible! I'm sure your husband is not going to be too mad about it."
"Yeah, I think it might've been too much on her at once. I was pretty embarrassed.	I had to take my daughter to the doctor the other day. She was very sick.	It was very bad. I hope she is okay now."
"It was just the flu. I got her some medicine, brought her home, and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.	I love tomato soup!"
"So my sister is getting married in a few weeks.	Oh that is great! I hope you have a wonderful time!"
"Absolutely! The whole family is flying out, we can barely contain ourselves.	Yeah, that's always a special occasion!"
"So my friend adopted a new kitten very recently.	Oh no! What happened?"
"Oh, she is absolutely adorable! I'm so envious, I haven't been able to adopt one yet.	Oh, wow! I've been wanting one for years. I'll definitely have to check into it!"
"Bought a new car a few months back. Couple nights ago we had a big storm roll through. I thought for sure it was going to hail all over my new car.	I bet that was terrifying!"
"Nice! We have a garage, but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.	I bet you were worried about it!"
"I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker. He is a programming wizard. He easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods I had never even heard of.	That sounds awesome! What kind of programming do you work with?"
"That is true. I usually can keep up, but this guy is on another level.	That is very impressive. I am a programmer myself but I am still learning."
"I had a meeting with my bosses the other day to discuss finally getting a promotion.	It's good that you got the promotion. What is it?"
"I've been working there for a couple years now. I'm feeling pretty good about my chances! Haven't heard back yet.	That's great, I hope you get it!"
"I feel so good about knowing I am going to win the race on Sunday. The race is for my favorite charity. When I win the race I get to give my winnings to my charity of choice.	It's great to hear that! I hope you do well!"
"Yes, it is my local animal shelter. They will be there to cheer me on!	That's really nice, you're a very generous person."
"My wife has had a trip in mind ever since I've known her. She recently had a big birthday so I surprised her with the trip. We went and she loved it. It made me happy to see her so happy.	That's awesome! Where was it?"
"It was just a trip to the west coast. There was a handful of things she's always wanted to see/do. So we did all of them.	I love it when you surprise your spouse."
"Not yet. We try to take one big trip a year if possible. We just got back from that one, so we will start plotting out next year a little later I would imagine.	I live in Florida. When I go home once a year it is a grand occasion.	Oh that sounds fun, I have family up in the Carolinas. What are you going to do when you get back?"
"I grew up in Alabama. It is not far from Florida but still I get so thrill when I can go back to see family and friends.	Oh, that's awesome! What is the reason for going back to Alabama? Do you have a big family or friends there?"
"My sons first day of school was the other day.	That's so exciting! I'm sure he was nervous!"
"Very first. I was so nervous till he got off the bus.	I am sure it was a little scary! What did you do on the bus?"
"I have a test coming up that I've been studying for weeks for.	That sounds tough. I wish you good luck."
"It's a Japanese language test for college. I feel pretty good about it though, been going over and over it every night.	Yeah, I know you are studying hard for it, but it's good to feel confident."
"I had phone interview for a job. It went very well	Oh wow! Congratulations! What kind of job is it for?"
"Thank you. I wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand.	That is great! I bet you got the job!"
"I saw an old movie. It reminded me of my younger days.	That's nice. What movie was it?"
"Yes. It's almost like a time machine. Fond memories.	Oh man, I loved those movies! I used to watch them all the time."
"I lost my job because my company didn't pay rent at our location.	I hope you found a new job."
"Not very well. It makes me so angry. So I go work out to relieve the stress.	Oh man, that's terrible! I hate that when that happens. Hopefully they pay up soon."
"Recently my wife left me home alone with the dog all weekend while she was gone on a girls trip.	Oh that is terrible! What happened?"
"I missed her while she was gone. We have a mixed breed rescue pup.	That's terrible, I would have been upset if I had my wife leave me like that. Did you find a new one for the dog?"
"Our computer system at work is goofing up a lot, but the development team just keeps saying there's nothing wrong.	Yeah thats a bummer, but you can always try to fix it yourself, or just wait for them to fix it."
"Sometimes. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things I need to do.	I'm sure it's frustrating"
"Me too!	Every time my kids go to grandma's they get to eat all kinds of candies, and get new toys.	I love candies!"
"Yeah they do! Some times I wish I got to go visit grandma's like they do lol.	Yeah, I would love to have that.  I have to be content with the candies and toys."
"I was really happy when my nephew was born, Sadly i was informed he had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.	That's terrible.  I'm sorry he's got that.  Is it something that will affect him in the future?"
"He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy, but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.	It's a tough life. I'm sure he's doing well."
"I bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price. They didn't.	That's terrible! What kind were you talking about?"
"Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.	That's a good strategy, but you should have been more careful."
"I came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor. He hasnt done that in ages.	I hate when that happens."
"Thanks. I dont think so. He has seemed fine otherwise. I've watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine. He is a mutt from a local shelter.	I bet he's just a little bored, or maybe he just had to go."
"Yeah. I love that goofy animal.  Hope he's ok	I work for a software company. I have been trying to learn a new language for some stuff. I knocked out my first task like a champ.	That's great! What's your target goal?"
"Well I have the opportunity, but rarely have the time to really devote to it.	I wish you luck!"
"Yeah i get that. I work for a startup so things change pretty rapidly around here.	I landed an ollie on my skateboard for the first time in 14 years yesterday.	Wow, that's awesome. What did you do next?"
"Yeah it took a lot of practice.	Oh man that is awesome. I can barely do that. I'm sure it took a lot to do that."
"Next week I am off work and going to the beach.	That's nice. What are you doing at the beach?"
"No I am going with my wife and her family. But we all get along great so it should be fun.	That sounds like a great time. What do you plan on doing while you're out at the beach?"
"Amen. It is much needed. Ready for some sun and a drink with an umbrella.	Oh yeah, I am going to a bar."
"Not too long ago, I took a trip on a plane. The airline lost my whole suitcase!	That is terrible. Did you get it back?"
"The whole vacation! I was so upset! I didn't have anything to wear for the duration.	That's horrible. Did you get your luggage back?"
"We usually don't do anything big for birthdays but my wife got me an apple watch this year.	That's awesome! I've been thinking about getting one for my husband, but he's not really a tech guy."
"Yeah i really did not see it coming at all.	That sounds cool! I've been wanting an apple watch."
"My boss and I went to lunch and had a personal conversation about some life issues.	I love going out to lunch.  What kind of food did you have?"
"We just went to a local taco place. It was a good conversation.	I love taco places. I have been going there for a year now."
"It was more about just some personal life stuff. Not too much really.	I came back from a trip recently, got called in the boss's office and was given a decent sized raise.	That is awesome! I love when that happens. What kind of job do you have?"
"Absolutely. I certainly won't say no to that.	That is awesome, how much was the raise?"
"Budget is kind of tight lately and I am really afraid my wife's aging car is about to bite the dust.	I am sorry to hear that.  What is it?"
"I may have to if that happens. We are making it now, but if the car goes it will be pretty tough.	It is tough.  But I would not have it any other way, I love my wife."
"It is ok. We are probably too proud to take help anyway. We will make it.	Oh yeah, that's the problem. We are not proud."
"So I recently went through some old boxes and found some of my childhood dolls. It brought back a lot of memories!	Yeah, I used to have a lot of those, but I don't see them as much these days."
"Absolutely! I remember having so much fun with them dressing them up. My sister and I would play for hours.	Yeah, I had a bunch of them. I used to play with them every day."
"So, i may be in the market for a new laptop or a repair at least, thanks to a little mishap.	I have never had to do that. What happened?"
"My daughter tripped on the cord and it smashed on the ground, not sure if it can be saved. I was pretty angry.	It is very unfortunate that it happened.  It can be frustrating when it happens."
"I woke up the other morning, got ready and drove all the way to work. Just to find out it was a holiday and we had the day off.	That sucks. I'm sorry. Did you go to church?"
"I know, but the extra day of work was nice. Especially since I wasn't expecting it.	That is nice. I wish I had that day off."
"It was wonderful. I ended up being twice as productive since I got up early.	That sounds good! I'm glad you got a bonus! What kind was it?"
"My new job is starting tomorrow. I'm feeling nervous, but really optimistic about it.	Yeah that must be a lot of nervousness."
"It's a job they opened up for graphic design! I'm super excited to get started and learn more from them.	That's great news! I hope it goes well!"
"Going to my son's first pee-wee football game tomorrow!	That sounds fun! What position does he have?"
"He thinks he does.  All I can think of is a bunch of Tiny Titans in helmets running around like chicks in a barnyard.  *chuckle*	Oh, that's great! My son is in the 5th grade and he's never been to a game."
"I put in a job application for a new job. I am fairly certain that my credentials are enough to get me the job.	I hope you get it!"
"I was, I go in next Tuesday. I am pretty excited for them to give me the job.	I bet you are."
"Me too, we shall see. Now the waiting begins!	I got a call about job with a good company that is in my line of work.	I'm sorry to hear that.  That's a great opportunity.  Did you get the job?"
"No, but I have the necessary experience, and I'm optimistic that it will work out.	Oh, nice. You must be excited!"
"I went to the petstore with my dog and he had an accident in front of everyone. He had the saddest look on his face.	Oh no! That is terrible! Did he get a bath?"
"He did, the clerk walked over, told him it was ok and gave him a treat.	That must have been very scary for the pet store clerk to deal with. Did you see the clerk's face change?"
"I had a video job interview. That was a new experience.	That must have been nerve wracking!"
"I'm not sure. It was a little awkward and stressful.	It was okay, I hope you did good. I hope you got the job"
"Sure, that's ok. And thank you.	That is a good way to put it. I think I would have been a little upset."
"I've been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and the pain is horrible. The problem is that the medicine that my doctor wants me to take has side effects worse that the pain.	That is awful.  Are you looking into anything else?"
"Maybe, I haven't been back because I can't afford to go right now. I've just been dealing with the pain.	Oh no, I hope you are able to get some more treatment."
"It suck.Hopefully we can both get coverage soon.	My son got picked to be on the soccer team that he was on last year!	I am happy for him.  I am not sure about you."
"He is!  Especially since last year's team won the Opening Day Tournament and then won the Regular Season title!	That's awesome, I bet he's excited!"
"Yeah!  We had a group of really talented kids, and some very good [and patient] coahes!	The other day, my three year old didn't know I was paying attention to her while she was playing with the dog. I overheard her trying to teach the dog how to count to ten.	I'm sorry that happened.  How old is she?"
"Yes, I thought that was pretty good for a three year old. When I asked her about it she said they were playing school. Haha.	That's hilarious.  She is such a smart one.  She can do all sorts of math and read."
"I'm very proud of her.	I am too, she is such a smart and creative one."
"I babysat and worked odd jobs all summer when i was younger to save up and buy a sega dreamcast.	That was a great time, I used to play that all the time. I had to go to work to pay bills, but I loved it."
"Yep, i've never looked forward to something so much in my life. I still have the dreamcast as well.	I bet you were a good babysitter."
"I'm gonna need your support here, because I'm going through something a little bit rough, okay?	That is a terrible thing to do.  What is going on?"
"I'm 29 years old and I woke up to find that I'd wet the bed last night. I'm...not even sure how. I didn't drink a whole lot before bed or anything.	I don't like it when I wake up to a wet bed."
"Should I see a therapist or anything? Is this indicative of some deep-seated problem that I'm not aware of?	It's not a problem. You just need to go to the bathroom."
"My Uncle Jebodiah is always looking out for me. He recently told me that he had a special concoction that if I drank it, it would cure my herpes.	Did you drink the concoction?"
"Listen, my Uncle Jeb wouldn't do me dirty like that. You may call it """"""snake oil"""""" but I call it the miracle cure this world needs. After all, it worked.	I can't believe you have a uncle that is that kind of person."
"My cat was kept overnight at the vets recently. I was so worried!	Oh, that's not good. Did it come home?"
"She's fine now! They found out it was something minor after x-rays. I was so relieved.	That is so good to hear!  What was the minor problem?"
"My car broke down on a busy highway the other day. There were so many cars zooming past me, it was scary!	That is terrible. Did you get a good deal on the car?"
"My brother had to pick me up. He had to pull up behind me on the curb. It felt dangerous!	That sounds so scary. I'm glad you are okay."
"Look, can we just be honest with each other for a second? Having ebola shouldn't mean that I have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions.	That is not a reason to be grounded."
"I saw one, and he said if I gave him $25,000 he would clear me for flight, but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.	I can't even imagine having to deal with that."
"I am obsessive about being ready for anything	That sounds like you're a bit anxious. What makes you so anxious?"
"I don't know.  I just see stuff in the grocery store and think I like that food and buy it because it is on sale.  Even if I already have it!	That is so cool!  You must have a lot of money!"
"My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer.	Oh no! That's really scary! I've never been near the water in my life."
"She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.	My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer. She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.<|eot_id|>"
"It was swallowed whole, unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't have it, and neither will I.	I forgot about plans that I had made with my mother over the weekend.	Yeah, what happened?"
"I called her right up and we rescheduled! I felt so bad though.	Oh no.  What plans did you forget about?"
"I was talking to a British friend of mine and trying to explain why our president feels compelled to tweet	That is very interesting. What does he tweet about?"
"They think someone needs to take his phone away	That's so annoying! What is wrong with people in this age of social media?"
"I was looking through the attic and found a box of childhood toys. They brought back so many memories!	Oh that must have brought a lot of back memories! What did they do?"
"It was nice to find them all and think back to those simpler times	Oh, that sounds great. I have a lot of old stuff that I found too!"
"The last trip I took to Chicago was by plane.	It's so cool to see how much different the city is in person."
"I had! I love chicago.  The flight is nice and short too, though I wasn't feeling well.	I love Chicago!  I went there last week.  I was there for a week.  I think I had a great time.  I think you should go there.  It's a really nice city."
"I think my electrolytes were off, I actually fainted on the plane and they made a whole to-do about it.	My university is posting live stream of students moving in and I was reminiscing about when I studied abroad in college	I am sorry I missed out on that. What were you studying?"
"I studied in Venice Italy and travelled all over Europe	I love traveling. I've always wanted to visit Europe."
"I won a storage shed auction last Monday and found my grandmother's old glass eye in a steamer trunk inside of the shed. Really reminded me of her and how much I miss her.	Oh that's nice.  Did you find a good price for it?"
"Rita May. She used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon. Those were such good times.	Yeah, it was a lot of fun, but now she's gone and I miss her so much. I wish I could see her again."
"I'm pretty excited for the upcoming Halloween season.	That is awesome. I love Halloween! What are you planning?"
"Well In September, Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events, after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.	That's so cool. I've never been to any of the Universal Studios locations. I hope I get to go next year!"
"I was loyal to the same company for 10 years.	Oh no.  What happened?"
"Nice. I wasn't rewarded though. They laid me off.	Oh, I'm sorry.  How are you coping?"
"I told a lie to my mother.	I'm sorry.  What was it?"
"I was about school. And I eventually confessed.	That's a tough situation. Did she believe you?"
"I got a job after a long period of unemployment.	That's great, I hope you can keep it up!"
"Yes. I was very happy to be gainfully employed.	That's great! You must feel happy and relieved!"
"I was in a car accident. Both cars were totaled.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing alright."
"They were running from the police. It was nerve rattling.	I bet that was scary!  What happened?"
"So my family surprised me this year with a party for my birthday.	I'm glad you had a great time!  What did they do?"
"They got me the new shoes I've been wanting. I was so elated and had such a good time!	I'm glad you were able to celebrate your special day with family."
"I had a job interview. The guy really knew his stuff.	That sounds awesome. What did he do?"
"Yes, really smart and easy to talk to.	That is great! You must be excited."
"I don't know yet.	Our power went off the other night. We were without it until morning!	Oh wow! I hope you were able to get it back."
"Someone crashed into the power line I think. It was so quiet and felt pretty spooky.	That sounds scary! I hope you were safe!"
"I bought a raffle ticket for a charity where I have a 1/500 chance of winning a car	That is nice. I hope you win!"
"Yes.  They were $100 but they only sell 500 tickets.  And the money raised goes to breast cancer research	That's nice. I don't have any money to buy raffle tickets."
"jumpfortherose.com	Someone helped me move.	That is so nice of them, I am sure they were happy to help."
"Yes, and I paid them with beer. I was thankful because I had a toe injury.	That sounds like a good time. Did you have to do the moving yourself?"
"I bought a powerball ticket last week but did not win	I know, it's always disappointing, but you have to keep trying."
"I would have bought a new car and a house perhaps.  But I lost :-(	I am sorry to hear that, but I am sure you will win soon! You never win on powerball!"
"Yes.  Maybe next time I will win!	I spent Saturday night playing Lord of the Rings Online.	That is a great game.  I have been playing it for months now and I am addicted."
"It is good, but I sometimes wonder if I'm trading real life for a fantasy world.	I have played that game before. I was also wondering that."
"I am so mad that our politicians won't do something to stop Russian hacking	That is terrible. I am so angry about that."
"Yes.  The Republicans just don't seem to care about our country any more and I am so mad that Putin owns Trump	That's really sad.  I don't know how you feel.  But I think that they should try to stop Russian hacking."
"My goldfish died.	It happens to the best of us. I'm sure he was a great fish."
"For 4 years. I'm bummed.	Yeah I've had my fish die too. It's always a sad day when that happens"
"Not yet.	I had an unprofessional job interview.	I know how that feels.  What happened?"
"The receptionist ignored me, and my interviewer was not prepared.	That sucks! What happened?"
"My computer crashed while I was working on a project.	Oh, that is bad. What happened?"
"I did. I hadn't saved, and I forgot to set up autosave. It was very frustrating.	That is so frustrating. What did you do?"
"My favorite team blew a big lead in the playoffs. It was like drinking sour milk.	That's awful. I can't believe that happened."
"I hate when teams choke. It makes me sick.	That's terrible.  What team is it?"
"I woke up this morning and my eye is itchy and my right eyelid is drooping	I hope you can get it under control.  Is it a cold?"
"yeah I am going to see what it seems like tomorrow - not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what	That is terrible.  Is it going to be okay?"
"Yeah I will if it does not get better quickly	Me and my family went to see a magic show for the first time today.	That's really cool. I've never seen anything like that. What kind of show was it?"
"I didn't catch his name, but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat. Classic trick, but I'll never forget it!	I love magic!"
"I have a job interview tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it.	I'm sure you will do great! What is the job?"
"Yes. It seems like a great opportunity.	Oh, you're excited about it! That's good!  What kind of job is it?"
"I scored well on an aptitude test.	That's awesome! Did you feel confident about the results?"
"I had a few drinks. I felt good.	That's cool! How did you do?"
"So today my mother brought over a whole week of meals to help me out.	That's really nice of her. How did you like the food?"
"Yes, she's always helping me out! I am so thankful for her she's an amazing mother.	That's nice of her. I have a similar mother too. She always comes over and brings food, and she's also super helpful.  I wish she had kids of her own.  She's a very nice lady."
"So I moved away from my parents not too long ago. It's been a big change.	I am sure it is.  I moved away from my parents a few years back.  It was very scary and lonely at the time, but I think it was good for me in the end."
"Out of state. I'm by myself now, so it's pretty quiet! I miss them a lot.	That is sad. How old are you?"
"My oldest child needed braces but her health insurance wouldn't cover the expense. It was close to 4000 dollars and we did not have that kind of money at the time.	That's horrible. Did she get the treatment she needs though?  I have heard that is a big part of the deal when you're trying to get the insurance to cover something."
"Yes they do. My aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn't has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help.	That must've been really tough. I'm glad your aunt was able to help."
"I was sitting on the couch after a long day taking care of work and all the mommy stuff the other day.	I bet you were exhausted! How old are the kids?"
"It was! My family was happy and together. Chatting and watching tv. Everything just felt right.	Oh, that's wonderful! That's always nice to have that kind of time with the family"
"My husband used to work out of town in a different state Sunday through Thursday.	That is a long time. How did you manage to keep it that long?"
"Yeah, he does work hard. Even thought my children were with me and we kept our usual routines, I was miserable when he was gone. I would cry after he left every Sunday. Luckily now, he has a job where he is home everyday by supper time.	That's great! I wish he would come back more often."
"We really are, he brings out the best in me.	I didn't have a car to get to and from work, so my parents actually let me just keep theirs for a bit!	That's really generous of them.  I don't have a family to speak of, so I wouldn't have done anything like that."
"Yeah it was so giving of them to leave it to me for so long and helped me a ton!	That was so nice of them, I'm sure they were happy that it was their car."
"While driving today I went past my grandma's old house. She passed last year.	It's nice that you went back there to pay your respects."
"Oh for sure. Good feelings, but I also miss her so much.	It's okay to feel sad about the loss, but I know that she is in a better place. I hope you are able to find happiness and peace in your future."
"I went outside to get my paper this morning. Someone had ran over my mailbox!	That is a terrible thing to see.  I would have been mad.  Did they steal it?"
"No, it's completely demolished! I'm feeling pretty annoyed.	Yeah that sucks! What are you gonna do?"
"My sister is a journalist and she got her first big story published in the paper today!	That is so cool. What is your sister working on?"
"It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her.	It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her"
"So my partner gave me the biggest surprise this week.	Oh that's great. What was it?"
"He got us a trip to Hawaii! I couldn't believe it, I am so elated!	That's so cool. I've never been to Hawaii."
"I finally went and adopted a cat last month and go way more than I expected!	That sounds great!  I am not a cat person, but I love dogs.  I have never even been around cats.  I know they can be a bit more challenging to take care of, but I have heard good things about them.  I think I would be okay, but it would be a lot of work.  I would have to do a lot of research to learn all the right things.  I am sure it was a bit overwhelming."
"Well it was only supposed to be her, but we found out she was pregnant! She popped out a whole litter of adorable.	Yeah, that must be a lot of fun!"
"I had to leave town last week and that meant leaving my pets who are my babies. I needed someone who could take care of them properly.	That is terrible, how did they do?"
"It is very hard! The only one who I'd let do it was my sister and she did an amazing job.	That's good, I hope you can get them back soon."
"So I finally decided to take my dog for his first dog park visit.	Oh, I'm glad you were able to take your dog."
"It's hard to tell! He refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play.	i bet you were a little nervous for your dog."
"Im embarrassed to admit I forgot to pick up my brother from worth the other day after agreeing to	I know how that feels.  What did you do?  Do you know how he felt?"
"Ha ha, he was a little miffed. He got over it though when I stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! I felt like such a jerk.	That's a pretty good excuse for being a jerk. I'm sure you're a good brother in the end."
"I finally took the plunge and decided to go back to school this year.	I know you mean to go back to college."
"I start next week! I was super hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I'm making myself do it.	I'm glad you are.  What is it that you want to study?"
"I was going through some stuff and found a box of jewelry my grandparents had gifted me through the years.	That must have been very emotional for you.  Did you keep it?"
"Yeah, it really made me think of them and old times.	It's always good to remember where you came from."
"I recently had a shop fix my car. They worked so fast!	I'm sorry to hear that. That's not how car repair should work."
"I was able to go home, but I realize now that I didn't even have to	That is awesome. I hope you get the car back soon."
"My husband is going through the process of quitting smoking on top of dealing with drama from his parents. He is having a hard time.	I'm sorry he is having a tough time."
"They aren't being supportive at all, but that's not surprising, that don't support him very well in anything. I just wish I could make it better for him, but I can't	That sucks.  I'm sorry that he's going through all that.  I hope it gets better.  Maybe they can learn from this.  Maybe it will help him in the future."
"I have some great friends. One of them drove me to the airport tomorrow	Oh no! What happened?"
"Yes I am, they are great	Yeah, it is nice to have good friends"
"We just found out the person working in our accounting department has been stealing money from our company for years.	That is terrible.  What did they do exactly?"
"Yes, it just makes me sick to my stomach. You think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind. I don't get some people	That's awful! I am so glad that it was discovered! I hope that the company is able to take action."
"I miss high school. My girlfriend was the best	That sucks, what was her name?"
"That's great. College was also fun	I'm sure. What did you do during that time?"
"I recently bid farewell to a good friend. I miss her	I am sorry.  How long did you and your friend know each other?"
"Thank you, that means a lot. I will see her again	Oh, that is so sad. I hope you can make some new friends to keep you company."
"I lost my car keys. I'm such a fool!	I've been in this situation before, but it's always a shock.  Did you try calling anyone to borrow them?"
"That's pretty funny, and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!	That is a funny story."
"I came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over. I've only seen him with a friend over once in my 3.5 years of living here.	It is always good to see a friend over. I hope your roommate is friendly and you have nice conversations."
"Yeah I sure was, he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.	That is good to hear. It's always nice to meet new people, and to be able to socialize."
"One of my co-worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor. It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor.	Yeah that happens. I've heard of people lying to get a promotion, or to be in a certain group."
"Yeah I figured it was, so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.	That makes a lot of sense. It seems like you're not being too friendly with your supervisor."
"Man there aren't many people I would give my last couple hundred dollars to, with one notable exception.	That's an understatement, I don't know what to say. What did you do?"
"My buddy Stefan. He used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters. We sold them and netted $2000 a piece!	That's really cool. Did you ever see him perform live?"
"I finished first in a race. I feel like gold	That is amazing! Congratulations!"
"Yes! It was my first victory. All my hard work is paying off	That's awesome! Congratulations!"
"Some of my friends told me that they had a big surprise for me. They know I hate surprises, but I complied and let the blindfold me and drive me out to the location.	That's really sweet of them."
"They had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together. It was a flying lesson at the local airport.	That is awesome. Did you have fun?"
"I found an old photo album at my grandma's house that had pictures of me when I was a kid	I love looking at old family photo albums."
"Yeah, it did. I really miss the 90s. Everything seemed a lot simpler in those days	Yeah, I'm pretty sure they have lots of them."
"When I was in middle school, I had a friend come over to ride horses with me. After riding my mother pressured me to get on a horse bareback I wasn't comfortable riding. She made such a big scene that I got on to make her stop.	I bet you felt pretty uncomfortable!"
"Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents, it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.	I am glad you were okay."
"My friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him, but I haven't been rollerblading since I was a little kid. I didn't want to roll into a car.	I bet you did.  What did you do instead?  I used to rollblading.  It is a great way to get exercise!"
"We went, but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.	It was a good experience though."
"My husband is on the road a lot, I hardley ever see him.	I bet you feel lonely sometimes?"
"Yes, its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.	I am sure you can enjoy alone time and not have to think about your family. It's nice to have time for your self."
"I have an interview for a job that I don't feel qualified for	That can be scary, do you think you'll get the job?"
"I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard	Oh, I hope you do well. I'm sure you will."
"I'm moving in a few months to a new state, I'm starting to feel nervous.	Oh no. What are you moving to?"
"To my husband hometown so it'll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family.	It can't be that hard to get used to."
"I saw a dog get hit by car today on the highway.	I am so mad!  What did you do?"
"It was pretty tramatic, I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No, I was on my way to work, I couldn't stop :(	That is awful! Did you see the dog?"
"I can't even begin to tell you how nervous I was about my first tattoo.	Oh wow, I'm so nervous about my first time getting a tattoo."
"Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood, and my pain threshold was low at the time. It turned out great though, and now I have several!	Oh, I can imagine. That's a scary feeling. But it's good that it turned out good in the end!"
"I love my husband! He has been so sweet this week!	That's nice. What is he like?"
"He knew I had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and Taco Bell! It's the little things :)	That sounds like the perfect day!  I'm sure he knew you needed it.  What did you do today anyway?"
"It's been a great week!	Oh that's so great! How has your week been?"
"I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting!	Oh, that's good news! Congratulations!"
"Music is a powerful thing. Sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place. You know what I mean?	That is so true, I have always loved music."
"Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.	That's awesome. It's nice to have memories of loved ones that are no longer here. I'm so sorry about your dad."
"I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories.	I know right? I used to love that stuffed rabbit. I have a few that my grandma gave me."
"Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.	That's a great story. I have a stuffed bear too. It's my baby."
"My dog got hit by a car.	It sounds awful. I hope he's okay."
"He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.	That's awful. I'm so sorry to hear that."
"Some random guy was in my backyard, I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.	That's weird. What were you going to do?"
"Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first.	I can't blame him, he was doing his job and I was a bit grumpy."
"My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.	That is terrible.  I am so sorry.  My family has lost a few family members recently and I know how that feels.  I am sure you are feeling a little down right about now."
"My siblings and I are managing, and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.	That is so sad. What did your dad do to make you all so close?"
"I've got a week off from work. Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.	That sounds like fun. What shows?"
"I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time	It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a funny show."
"I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.	i know, i was so upset. i thought i was going to fail."
"That is what I was thinking at the time, but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.	I'm sorry, I understand that you're having a tough time. But it's hard not to be worried about the future when it's so hard to make ends meet in today's economy."
"I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.	I can imagine how embarrassing that was. I've tripped so many times in my life. I'm sure it was embarrassing for everyone watching you."
"It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.	Oh no, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. I'm sure it didn't help."
"My boyfriend is sick. He can't eat much so I made some soup for him	I'm sorry to hear that! Hopefully it doesn't last long."
"I made chicken noodle soup.	I bet that was very helpful!  Is he feeling better now?"
"I had a meeting last week where I gave a presentation over the wrong documentation and no one said anything until after the meeting.	That's so frustrating, I can't believe they didn't say anything"
"After I figured out what I did, I sure was. Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.	That's not good. Did they tell you why?"
"I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend.	That is good, you will do well!"
"It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.	That sounds exciting. What kind product are you presenting?"
"I caught my boyfriend texting his ex	Oh wow, did you confront them about it?"
"It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her	I would be upset with him for that.  I don't know how you can handle that."
"I know I broke up with my ex, but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.	I know that feeling.  He can be really annoying."
"We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial, i think he does too.	I know you feel that way too but you should try to get over it. It's not going to make you happy"
"I can't wait to see my final grades. I think I got all A's this semester.	I hope you got all A's too!"
"On Monday. I'm going to treat myself if I did well	I am sure you will do great. You have put in a lot of effort."
"I was very upset when I found my kitten today.	I'm sorry, what happened to the kitten?"
"No, I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.	I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you take him to a vet?"
"I cried a bit, but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out.	I enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion.	It is a wonderful place. I visit my grandmother's home every month."
"Not really, I take my daughter to see them, so many of them have no visitors at all.	Oh that sucks.  I don't really visit the nursing home either.  I'm afraid they have a lot of people who don't want visitors."
"She likes to bake, so we take them what she makes :)	That's so sweet, what type of bakery do they make?"
"She is pretty good for an eleven year old, better than I was.	That's awesome. I've never baked anything myself, but I'm sure you're a great mom."
"I had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her, as well as get off my chest. I know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her.	I know, I feel so much better now.  She is so caring and supportive."
"Yes, I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!	I can relate, my sister has been keeping some stuff on the down low for years, and I've been keeping some stuff on mine too. But my sister's been keeping it on her for years and I've been keeping it on mine. It's hard to deal with, but I'm glad to have a sister."
"My son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us. I was anxious and nervous waiting to see if he was accepted!	Oh, that's exciting. What was the wait like?"
"He did! He's in his 3rd year, going to be an Aerospace Engineer, so we are very proud of him.	It is great. I have one son who is 4. He's in his 3rd year of college."
"My sister passed away several years ago. She took her life, and my mother and I found her right after she did it. This was very painful, traumatic and hard for us all.	Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for your loss."
"It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile, she was in denial. But, it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile, as she was my only sibling and we were very close.	I'm sorry to hear that. Did you ever get to say anything about your feelings to her?"
"When my son first started college, I felt so much love and affection, but it was definitely hard to see him go! I was very proud though.	That's so cool! How old is he now?"
"He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's focused on science, engineering, etc. He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer. It's great to see him go for his dreams!	That's great, I bet it's a lot of hard work. I hope he does well and gets where he wants."
"We went on vacation a few weeks ago and went to the beach, It was so relaxing and great. I really enjoyed the time with my family.	That's so nice. What did you do on vacation?"
"That's great! I'm sure you earned it, just like we do. It's so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!	It is so important to take time for ourselves and enjoy the simple things in life."
"I am looking forward to next week! My husband has been out of town on business for several weeks and comes home next weekend!	That sounds like a nice time to have your husband back! I hope you have a wonderful time together!"
"I am going to cook a special meal and see if he wants to go out, just us two. I know he will like that.	That is so exciting!  I am sure you will have a great time! What is it?"
"My husband has been out of town a few weeks for work but is coming back next weekend. I have a surprise night planned for just us. I am optimistic and sure he will really enjoy it.	I'm sure you'll have a great time."
"Thanks! We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.	It sounds like you two are really committed to each other."
"My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!	That's so cool, how old is your son?"
"Yes, very. But, time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!	That's so true! I remember when my daughter was young and we would go to the park every day to play and she would get so sick and tired and then we would go to bed with her and she would sleep for a week. It was like she was just going to sleep and then suddenly wake up and be all ""oh no, I'm so sick again!"""
"I was promoted to a Team Leader and I felt very secure I could do well at the job. I had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role.	I hope you do well! I hope you get a promotion too."
"Yes, thank you! I had worked very hard through the years, and I felt that I earned it, and would do well at it.	It's great that you feel confident in yourself!"
"There was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him. I was so mad, beyond angry!	I hate when people do that to kids.  That is not right.  What did you do?"
"Yes, and she had two children of her own, similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle, that made her mad! Can you believe that??	Yeah, and I was not able to tell him that she was making a joke."
"Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.	It's normal to feel that way, especially if you have a history of anxiety."
"It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing.	I'm glad she did well! What did she start at?"
"I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!	That is terrible.  Did you plan anything?  I always try to be prepared for anything."
"I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.	It was fun! I'm so sorry you had such a hard time! I would be so upset if I had to forget everything!"
"One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me, while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!	Oh wow, I would have felt the same way."
"I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....	I'm sorry to hear that, but at least he is a good guy."
"The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.	That would be so frightening."
"No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.	I would have been a little worried, but I'm not a scared person. I'm sure they just didn't know what they were doing and just didn't mean anything by it."
"I was trying to ignore the fact that my 50th birthday was coming up but my family decided to throw me a surprise party.	I love surprises.  I'm not a fan of birthdays.  How did you like the surprise party?"
"It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more	It's a good thing that you were not expecting it."
"A few weeks ago, my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things, and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.	That can be tough. Did you apologize?"
"Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later.	Yeah, I can understand that. It is always good to take a step back and think about how things might sound to others. I hope it doesn't come to that and you both just can't agree."
"One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.	It would have been so terrifying. Did you ever find anything out?"
"Yes, and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But, luckily, it turned out to be my shadow!	I'm glad that it turned out to be just your shadow. I would have been so scared!"
"There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	It's always good to be considerate of the people that are less fortunate than us."
"Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it.	I agree, homelessness isn't common where I live either, so I feel it's my part to give.  I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed."
"When my children were born, it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.	That's great! How many kids do you have?"
"Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.	That's so wonderful.  Do you have any kids?"
"I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.	I can relate to this situation. I had to walk away from a group conversation because one of the people in the group disagreed with what I believed. I didn't want to conflict with them."
"Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.	I agree, I think we should all be treated equally, regardless of how they came to be here. I'm a Muslim, and I have a friend who's a Muslim, but we both work together in the same office and are friends."
"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!	I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.	That's so exciting! Did you drive it safely?"
"Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.	That's terrible. Are you driving it in the rain?"
"I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.	That's great! I've joined a few groups myself, but I've never joined one that's specifically for weight loss. What kind of group is this?"
"It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them	That is awesome!  I hope it works for you.  I have been trying to lose weight for a long time, but I have been having trouble sticking to my diet and exercise plans.  Maybe I should try to join a group too.  I am sure it would make a big difference."
"A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!	I have always been nervous about it. I'm not a good test-taker."
"I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!	Oh wow, that is a lot! But I bet you were proud of yourself!"
"Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!	I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	That's a nice way to look at it. I'm sure it brought some good memories for you."
"It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?	I think that's a very good point, but I guess I've thrown some out because I thought it was too much effort to keep them."
"That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!	That's very nice of you.  I have a lot of old cards and papers that I keep.  I'm not sure what to do with them all of the time."
"I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.	I'm sorry I don't have the time to read a lot of books. I just have a lot of work and family."
"When I was entering the store it was really slippery.	Oh wow, that's a pretty scary thing to happen. Did you trip?"
"It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.	Oh wow, that's crazy! Did anyone see you?"
"I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.	I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.	I know how that feels."
"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	That's a pretty tough decision to make.  Do you feel like you're doing the right thing?"
"Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.	I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.	That's a bummer! What's the play about?"
"I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.	Oh, that's a bummer!"
"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	Oh, good!  How is it going?"
"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	That's great!  I hope she enjoys driving."
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	That is so awesome. You are so lucky!"
"I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!	I'm glad to hear that you guys are working towards this.  It's great that you're both supporting each other and working together to get her to drive further and further away from home.  I'm happy to hear that you're working hard to get this done.  I bet you'll both be proud of each other when it's all done!"
"My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.	That is a bit stressful."
"I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*	I bet you're excited to see what they bring!"
"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	That's very cool.  My brother and I also sold a house, but it was a lot more complicated.  I'm glad you have someone to lean on."
"We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.	Yeah, I've got a brother too. I'm lucky to have him."
"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	Yeah I've been there.  My older brother is like my best friend.  We've been through a lot.  He's always looking out for the younger brother.  We were always fighting."
"Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)	That is a great relationship. I am glad to hear it is not typical of everyone."
"My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.	that's awesome! i'm so proud of you!"
"I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!	I am so proud of you and your children. You have a lot to be proud of."
"Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.	Yeah, you can get lost. But I'm sure it's just a little bit."
"I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.	Yeah, that's a good idea! You can always ask for a map or a GPS."
"I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.	I am sorry.  What happened?"
"Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.	I'm sorry to hear.  I hope you're okay.  I know it's tough losing loved ones."
"Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!	I am sorry to hear that.  I hope they have a good funeral and are in heaven."
"She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!	That's awful. I hope you're doing alright."
"I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before	I have never owned an Xbox either, but I have played a few times."
"I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.	That is awesome. I am excited for that."
"My father passed away 2 years ago, but my mother lives in my neighborhood now. I'm so thankful she lives close by and still here with us. She's such a wonderful mother.	That is so kind of her.  I hope she continues to take care of herself and stay in your life."
"I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.	That's a great point, my mom is always there for me and my family, and I appreciate that."
"I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!	Oh wow. What's the weekend for them?"
"The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...	Oh, wow! I can only imagine how you feel about it!  Are you going to go hang out with them?  Or are you going to stay home?"
"Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!	My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it	That is awesome! What country?"
"We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor	That's awesome.  I love voice acting.  I've been doing it for years.  What kind of character do he do?"
"I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten, with no collar, in a window well.	Oh that is so sad.  What did you do?"
"We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!	Oh that is great, how old is he now?"
"I felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself	I'm glad you felt the need to help!"
"I did not, I was little but I think I put it back into a tree	That's so kind of you. I would do that too."
"Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving	That is bad. Are you going to college?"
"Yep, had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out	I'm glad that worked out for you."
"I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!	That is horrible. Did you call her?"
"I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :(	That must have been really tough for you."
"You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???	I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party, not my greatest moment	That's the worst. I hate wearing pajamas at parties."
"I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret	I can understand that, I wear pajamas at work too."
"I had some trippy nightmares as a kid, now I don't really have dreams	I bet you must have been very scared"
"Yeah, it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me, pretty weird	It's always weird to hear about the past of dreams."
"I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards	I feel bad when I do something wrong."
"No, I was scared to get charged, but I stopped after that	Yeah, I've done it before too. It really makes you realize that it wasn't right."
"I was at a meditation retreat last year for 10 days and I can say that I experienced a better feeling there than I could ever remembe	I love meditation, I do it every week. It's so calming."
"Yeah, thankfully there's an app for that - Headspace (no I am not sponsored)	I have never been to a meditation retreat before.  What is it?"
"I am really looking forward to going away for the holidays.	That's great! What's your family like?"
"I want to go see the Harry Potter land at Universal, the kids will love it.	Oh that is fun. I am sure the kids will enjoy it."
"They love the films, plus getting to ride Hogwarts Express, score!	I'm really hoping my acceptance letter shows up in the mail soon.	That's awesome, did you get a letter from a college or university?"
"Law School, I'm pretty sure I got in to my first choice, but you never know.	That is great news! You will make a great lawyer!"
"Thank you, fingers are crossed.	I just ordered a new cookery book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. I want to delve in and try lots of new recipes!	That's so exciting! I've been waiting a long time for my cookbook to arrive! I hope it's not too long."
"I'm vegetarian and cook all sorts of different cuisines - Indian, Italian, American. The only cuisine I'm not good at is Chinese. How about you?	You're right, I've always been a bit of an adventurous eater. I've never really been to China, but I've heard great things about the food. I'll have to try some of the recipes."
"Have you heard of Mark Bittman's book How to Cook Everything Vegetarian? That's the book I'm waiting impatiently for!	I witnessed the most epic bottle flip in the history of bottle flips at my school	I'm a little jealous that I never get to see those things. What happened?"
"Yee yee, it landed on this little ledge that was super high up.	That is pretty cool, what did you do next?"
"My little grandson just came home from the hospital. He was born premature and weighted under 2 pounds.	I'm so glad to hear he's healthy and doing well! How long has he been home?"
"He is doing well, thank you. And we are so thankful everything is ok. It was touch and go for awhile	That's great! I'm sure he's going to do well."
"I love my girlfriend. She would never cheat on me	That's awesome, I hope you're together for life!"
"I hope to make her my wife some day!	I am happy for you."
"My sister spilled some milk on me. It set me off!	That's terrible!  Did you get mad?"
"It was indeed a mistake. My clothes are fine now.	That's terrible! I'm sorry that you had to deal with that!"
"I recently did not pay my rent. My land lord has been terrible at providing services	I am sorry to hear that.  Are you going to call a collection agency?"
"He decided to start caring and doing his part.	I would have done the same thing. I would have been angry at him for being so bad. I would not have done it to my brother or sister."
"I'm thankful that I was able to repair my tire before it went flat on my car	I'm glad that it was not your car."
"Right, I caught it just as it happened and brought it to the shop, didn't cost as much as I thought it would either.	Oh that is so nice of you.  I am sure it was frustrating.  I hope you were able to get the tire fixed and that you are okay."
"I love my friend. She just drove me to class	That's so sweet of her."
"I think I am getting her a gift soon!	I love my friends as well, I am glad you have a good relationship with them."
"I stole from my friends when I was a child. I feel terrible about it now	Oh, I'm sure it's a minor mistake."
"It was some Pokemon cards!	That's not good.  I'm sorry you feel that way.  I'm sorry I made a similar mistake.  I was a little kid."
"My father almost passed away last year. It was very tough on everyone	I'm sorry.  I hope he is okay now."
"Yes, he has made a full recovery! It's been a journey	That is great news.  How old was he when he passed away?"
"I remember when I was a young one. I loved life.	I know. I have fond memories of that time too"
"I do, but maybe not with he same flare as before	I'm sure that's true. Life is good, but it's always nice to look back on it."
"I helped find my friend's cats. She's glad they're back now	That's nice! Did you have a problem finding them?"
"Yes they both just wandered off when the door was open!	What cats?"
"5	I love how much people love to share their life on social media. It's like you can't turn on the lights without seeing someone posting about their vacation or their adorable cat."
"I recently got an A on my paper. I feel great.	That is awesome! Congratulations! How did you do?"
"I went swimming recently. I lost my trunks walking out of the pool.	Oh no, that is bad. What did you do?"
"Yeah, we all have a good laugh about it now	I bet. Did you guys get your trunks back?"
"Drinking a gallon of milk in a day wasn't a good idea	I was drinking 4 gallons a day.  I had a stomachache for weeks."
"I wanted to see how hard it would be, turns out my stomach was JUST big enough	I would have done the same!"
"My friend slept with a girl I like. I feel horrible now	I would feel the same way"
"No, but I don't think he is my friend any more	I understand. I would probably tell him I didn't know and see if he would do it for me instead."
"I don't like working with managers that try to micro-manage me	I understand, I have been in management for a long time and I know how to let people do things."
"Right, it kind of feels like they're insecure with their abilities while trying to make me feel bad at the same time	I understand where you're coming from, I feel the same way."
"Teeth are weird, but also take a lot of upkeep which is sometimes irritating	It's like my dentist says, they're a lot of work."
"Yeah that's what my dentist says, I'll try	Yeah, it's hard to take.  But you have to do it.  I've had a lot of dental work done, and it is hard.  But you need to have clean teeth."
"I wake up with chills sometimes for no reason	I am sure it has to be something."
"I think it's from dreams that I'm not able to recall	i have that too. i think it's the brain."
"I wasn't able to reach my goals in the gym a couple days ago, and it helped me realize where I'm slacking off in other areas	That is true. Sometimes you need to be in other places to see where you need to work on."
"Yeah, it's fun to see how much you can conquer yourself, and it's nice to be able to see how you're changing	Yeah, it's fun to see how much you can conquer yourself, and it's nice to be able to see how you're changing"
"I recently went skydiving. It was a thrilling rush	Oh wow, that's a very adventurous thing you did. I have never gone skydiving. How was your experience?"
"It was excellent. I feel so alive!	Yeah that was pretty cool. I'm not really adventurous but I love the rush of adrenaline when I'm skydiving. I hope I'll get the chance to go again!"
"I think I will have success in my life. I love life these days!	I love your optimism! I feel like it is very hard to be positive in the world right now, but it is good to have someone to share your optimism."
"I recently finished a new album I have been working on!	That's awesome! Congratulations! What kind of music do you make?"
"I'm excited to think of all the possibilities that are available to me at the moment	That is awesome, what do you want to do?"
"Being able to learn basically anything with the internet for one	That's the best part of the world.  It's always good to have the world at your fingertips."
"I like meditating because it puts things into perspective in a way that I don't usually expect	I'm not really good at meditation."
"For sure, my mind is pretty energetic	I meditate every day. I think meditation is very good for your mind and it helps you to be more productive."
"I've been processing what being lonely feels like, because I want to be able to have fun by myself sometimes	That is good. It is a normal thing for many people, especially when they have a job to support their family. I am sure it doesn't bother you much."
"True, and I've felt that way before, but sometimes like a wave of those kinds of feelings hits like I'm not worthy enough and stuff like that, but it's all good	That sounds like a really tough feeling to deal with.  What are you doing to try and get out of it?"
"I'm trying to get over my need to control things, and I find if I just let things happen it feels like a weights been pulled off my shoulders	Oh, that's good, it's good to not be so controlling."
"Right, but things always seem to turn out for the best anyway	That makes sense. Sometimes you have to let go of control and trust that everything will work out in the best possible way. It's hard sometimes but it's necessary"
"I grew up pretty skinny and now that I've grown some muscle I feel a lot more comfortable in my skin	That's great! I wish you the best!"
"around 9 months, been pretty slow to make progress but overall it's been solid	That's awesome! You're a rockstar!"
"I am going to go camping tomorrow! The back's already packed	It's going to be fun! I love camping."
"I hope not. I'm in Florida so it might get bad	I hope so too! I love camping, especially in Florida! I'm not sure if it will get bad though. I don't like getting sick when I'm sick."
"My old house burned down, and I went to check it out, was surreal taking a look around the place	I am sorry to hear that. What was it?"
"Yeah, it was built a long time ago, some kind of electrical fire	I am sorry to hear about that, did you lose anything?"
"I was truly surprised when I notice my tire got hit by a rock, thought I wouldn't make it to the tire place in time	I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get to the tire place?"

"It's like if I don't get that sorted out I won't be able to live a fulfilling life	That's great! I love how you put it. It's like if you don't have God in your life then it's like you don't have anything in life! I love that."
"When I can't take a breather in the day I feel suffocated	Oh, you feel like you're drowning in work or something?"
"Right, it's like I can't focus or relax	That's the point of a break. You need a break to take a breath and relax"
"When I was in elementary school I was envious of the kids who were popular!	I know, I felt the same way, I wanted to be popular too"
"Yeah, I just had trouble socializing is all	I am sorry you were envious, but it's not your fault."
"When I do things that are challenging I feel more self-reliant. I recently tried taking an ice bath	That is very scary!"

"I'm eating a lot of food to make sure I can lift more weight in the gym next time!	Oh no, what kind of weight are you lifting?  I am trying to get stronger and lift heavier."
"I'm taking everything, honey, raw garlic, yogurt, EVERYTHING!	That's awesome! You must feel good to be lifting that much weight!"
"I don't like scammy sales people, nothing good comes from it	Oh I know what you mean. I have to be careful with the people who try to sell me things that aren't really what I need."

"Listening to old artists like they Might Be Giants is my jam	Yeah, I like that one."
"Haha, I didn't grow up with them but it's like discovering a gold mine that no one else seems to listen to	That's awesome. They're so underrated!"

"I've had the worst week, someone stole my credit card information.	That is horrible.  What are you going to do?"

"Seeing people taken advantage of by fake religious services is something I find the most vile. It makes them believe that they're doing the right thing, but the person taking advantage of them knows what's really up. What do you know about that?	I know it makes people feel bad. I don't like the way people take advantage of each other."
"Exactly, I feel that getting people to believe irrational things is the same as giving them a brain virus, it'll slowly erode their ability to think rationally.	I agree completely. People need to be taught that the truth is not always what they're told. I'm not sure what's worse though, the people taking advantage of them or the people telling them they're right."
"I have a presentation for work on Monday, I'm a little nervous.	Oh, you're nervous about it?"

"I had to leave my key in my car for the mechanic and I was left wondering if someone might find it	It's always a good idea to leave your key in a safe place so you don't have to worry about it."
