"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	oh my god , i have been too"
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you are ok ."
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	oh wow . i would have been too bad ."
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	what are you going to do ?"
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	that ' s good to hear . i ' m glad you ' re going to be safe !"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	that is a good thing"
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	that is a good thing to have"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	that sounds like a lot of fun !"
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	oh wow ! congratulations !"
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	oh no ! how did you feel about it ?"
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	that is a very sad thing to have"

"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	that is a great idea . i ' m sure you ' ll be able to get it ."
"thank you so much!	that ' s great ! what kind of job is it ?"
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	i am sure you will do that ."
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	oh no , that sounds scary ! what happened ?"
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	i ' m sure they are not good ."
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	that ' s awesome . i ' m sure you will have a great time ."
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	i am happy for you"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	oh no , that is terrible . i ' m glad you were able to get it ."
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	that is a good thing to do ."
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	i ' m sorry to hear that ."
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	i would be too"
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	that ' s great ! what kind of work is it ?"
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	that is good , you are good"

"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	i ' m glad you have to do that ."
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	i can relate . have you tried to find a new job ?"
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	oh , well i ' m sure you ' ll have a good friend !"
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	maybe you should try to talk to him about it ?"
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	i think they are a kid ."
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	oh wow , that is so nice . did you guys go back with her ?"
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	i ' m sure you ' ll be fine . i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ."
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	i ' m sure they will be fine ."
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	that is a good thing to have a friend ."
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	what is your favorite thing ?"
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	that ' s good to hear ! what happened ?"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	that ' s great to hear ! did you have a good time ?"
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	i hope it goes well !"
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	i hope you do well"
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	that ' s awesome ! did you have a good time ?"

"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	i ' m sure you ' ll be able to find a new friends ."
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	i can understand that . do you have any friends ?"
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	that is so cool . how old are they ?"
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	i know how you feel"
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	oh wow ! what kind of food is it ?"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	what kind of food is it ?"
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	that ' s great . i ' m sure you ' ll have a great time ."
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	i bet you are happy to have a great time ."
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you have a good relationship with your relationship ."
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	i ' m glad you ' re doing that . i ' m glad you ' re doing that ."
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	that ' s awesome . how did she do ?"
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	i bet she ' ll be able to get her ."
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	that is good , i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ."
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	well i hope you are able to get it back ."
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	i ' m sure she ' ll be fine ."
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	i know . i have been there . i know how you feel ."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	oh no ! i ' m sure she will be fine ."
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	that ' s great ! i ' m sure you ' ll do great !"
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	i think that ' s a good idea . maybe you can get a new new person ."
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	i ' m sure it was ."
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	i bet you are ! i bet you ' re a great workout !"
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	i think i ' m not sure i ' ve never been there ."
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	maybe you should go to a skatebaord to go to the beach ."
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	i hope it is not fun !"
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	i don ' t know how that is . is it a big thing ?"
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	oh no ! i hope you ' re a good friend ."
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	i know how you feel . i ' m glad you ' re going to get a good time ."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	i know that feeling , i ' m so excited to go to the kids ."
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	that sounds like a lot of fun ! what are you going to do ?"
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	oh wow ! that ' s a good thing . what did you do ?"
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	oh wow . did you have a good time ?"
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	that ' s great ! i ' m sure you ' re a great parent !"
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	congratulations ! i wish i could have a good time ."
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	oh no ! what happened ?"
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	i think its a lot of people like that , but i ' m sure you ' ll do it !"
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	that ' s terrible . what happened ?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you can get it fixed ."
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	oh , that ' s so sad . i ' m sure you ' ll be able to get a new time ."
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	that sounds like a good time !"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	i know how you feel . is it a good thing ?"
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	i ' m sure you ' ll be fine . i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	oh no ! what happened ?"
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	that is good , you should get her ."
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	that ' s terrible ! did you get hurt ?"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	maybe she should take her back to her ."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	what kind of food is it ?"
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	i agree . i have a lot of people like that ."
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	i bet you were happy to see that . did you have a good time ?"
"Are your kids adults now?	i agree . i have a kid myself ."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	that ' s awesome ! did you get it out ?"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	i ' m sure you ' ll do great !"
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	that ' s good to hear !"
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	what is your favorite thing ?"
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	i ' m sure it was fun to see someone else ."
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	oh wow ! that ' s a good surprise ! what did she do ?"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	what are you going to do ?"
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	that sounds like a lot of fun !"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	did you get a good meal ?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	did you get to go to the manager ?"
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	oh no , that ' s scary ! did you get to get it back ?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	i would have been too too . i would have been terrified !"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	oh no ! what happened ?"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' m sorry you had to go through that ."
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	oh no ! maybe you should take it out and it ' s a good thing to do that ."
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	i know how you feel . i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ."
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	oh no ! did you have any good idea ?"
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	that sounds like a good movie !"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	oh no ! what did you do ?"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	that sounds like a good thing"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	that is so sweet . what did you do ?"
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	that ' s good . i hope you can find a new gift ."
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	that ' s great ! i ' m sure you ' re a great person ."
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	i ' m sure you ' ll get it out !"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	i would have been terrified !"
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	i hope you can find a new one ."
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	that ' s nice of you to have a friend like that ."
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	that ' s a good thing . maybe you should try to talk to him about it ."
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	that ' s so gross ! did you get a refund ?"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	i ' m sure it was a bummer !"
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	oh no , what happened ?"
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	that ' s nice . i ' m sure she ' ll be able to get her ."
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	i hope she is okay !"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	i hope you find her ."
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	that ' s awesome ! what are you going to do ?"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	that sounds like a great time . i ' ve been there ."
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	that ' s great ! what did you do to do ?"
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	i ' m sure she ' ll be able to get a new job !"
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	that is so annoying . i would have been too ."
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	that ' s so annoying . i would have to do that for a while ."
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	what did you do ?"
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	that is a great thing to do that . i ' m sure you ' re a happy person ."
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	that ' s a good idea . what do you do ?"
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	i think you should be a good way to see ."
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	i agree , i ' m sure they are going to be in the world ."
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	i agree . i ' m glad you ' re going to be a good person ."
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	what are you going to do with them ?"
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	that sounds like a good time ."
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	that ' s great ! i hope you ' re happy to have a great time ."
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	that ' s awesome ! congratulations !"
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	congratulations ! that is a great feeling . congratulations !"
"Did they give you any feedback?	that ' s awesome . what kind of her is she ?"
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	that ' s great ! i ' m glad you got it out for you ."
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	i ' m sure it was a good feeling ."
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	that ' s terrible ! what happened ?"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	that is so annoying ."
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	what happened ?"
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	what movie was it ?"
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	that ' s great ! how old is she ?"
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	that ' s great . i ' m sure she will be proud of her ."
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	maybe you should try to talk to the manager ."
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	what happened ?"
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	i would be too"
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	i can ' t imagine that ' s a lot of money !"
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	oh wow , that ' s a good idea ."
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	do you have any idea ?"
"I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.	Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.	oh , i ' ve never had to deal with that ."
"I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.	i know that feeling . i know how you feel ."
"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	that ' s great ! what kind of dog is it ?"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	that ' s awesome ! congratulations !"
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	that ' s great ! i ' m sure he will be a great friend ."

"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	i know what you mean . i have a lot of people like that ."

"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	i am sure she will be fine"

"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	i hope you have a good time ."
"A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.	that ' s great ."

"I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.	i can understand that . i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ."
"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	oh no ! what happened ?"
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	oh no ! i ' m glad you ' re able to get a cat ."

"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	i know how you feel . i ' m glad you ' ll get it ."

"You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?	i think you should be a good parent ."
"But you failed the exam? Did you revise?	i ' m sure she will be fine ."
"At least you know for next time eh?	My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.	i wish i could ."

"It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.	i hope you have a good time ."

"I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.	that ' s great . i ' m sure you ' ve never been able to do that ."

"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing.

"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	oh no , what happened ?"
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	oh no , did you get it ?"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	that ' s awesome ! what did you do ?"

"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	oh no ! did you have a tornado ?"

"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	i know how you feel"
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	oh that ' s awesome ! what was it ?"
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles.

"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	i ' m sure it ' s not good ."

"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	what kind of work do you have ?"

"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	i am sure you will"
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	i ' m sorry to hear that . maybe you can get a new time ."

"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	i am so happy for you . i wish you the best of luck ."
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	i know that feeling . i know it is hard to get a relief . i know it is hard to get a relief ."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	oh no , that ' s terrible . are you ok ?"

"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	that is a good thing to do . i ' m sure it will be nice to have a good time ."
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	i ' m sure you ' ll do great ! what ' s your favorite interview ?"
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	i hope it goes well ."
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	that ' s great . i ' m sure you ' re a good friend ."
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	that is a good thing"
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	oh my gosh ! did you ride it ?"
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	i hope you can get it back ."

"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	what kind of job did you get ?"
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	that ' s great ! i ' m sure you ' ll do great !"
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	i ' m sure you ' ll be fine . it ' s not good to hear ."
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	i hope you get better soon !"
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	that is a good thing to do . i would be mad"
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	i hope you get better soon !"
"Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day	i hope he is okay"
"Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!	i know that feeling"
"Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing	Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking	i know . i ' m sure you ' ll get it out ."

"How long have you been there?	i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' m sorry to hear that ."
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	congratulations ! that ' s awesome ! i ' m sure you ' ll have a great time ."
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	i ' m sure you ' ll get it !"
"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.	i know how you feel . i have a kid myself , i have a kid myself ."
"If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*	I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!	i have never seen a movie ."
"I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*	i have a classic that ' s a good thing . do you have a good time ?"

"I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].	that ' s great ! i ' m glad you got it ."
"It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD	i hope you have a good time ."
"I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.	i wish i could have a good friend ."
"No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.	that is a good thing to have"

"Me too! <fist bump> ;-)	So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.	oh , i hope she ' s a lot of work !"

"My husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache	oh wow , that is so sad . i would have lost my friend ."
"Not yet, but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.	i know the feeling . i hate when that happens ."
"Ah, it's been rough. My dog passed away two nights ago.	maybe you should try to get a new one ."

"Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special!	that ' s great ! what did you do ?"

I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it!	oh no ! did you get hurt ?"
"Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!	i ' m sure it was a lot of people !"
"I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!	i am happy for you !"

"I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!	i ' m glad you were able to get it ."
"It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.	that is nice of you to do that ."
"I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.	oh no ! did you call the police ?"

"My transmission in my car went out the other day, maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.	oh no ! did you get a car ?"

His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck	that ' s cool . what kind of car ?"
"Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!	i ' m sure he will be worth it ."
"So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.	wow ! that is awesome ! what kind of car did you get ?"

"I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.	that ' s so annoying ! have you tried to go home ?"

"I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!	that ' s awesome ! what are you going to do ?"
"Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)	I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!	that ' s awesome ! what kind of car do you do ?"
"It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.	i hope you do well ."
"We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone, especially my brother and sister.	that ' s great ! what kind of work is it ?"

"My brother got a custom-made bowling ball, and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.	that ' s great ! i ' m sure you will do great !"
"He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.	i hope you have a great time !"
"Ok, so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!	that ' s great . i am sure you will do great !"
"Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)	i know that feeling"
"Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.	that ' s awesome ! i ' m sure you ' re excited to hear that ."
"Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.	that is awesome ! i am sure you will be happy for you ."
"I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.	what kind of christmas was it ?"

"The last time I went into a job interview, I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.	i know how you feel . i have a diet and i have a diet and i ' ve been eating a few days ."
"Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.	i ' m sure you ' ll get it !"
"Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!	that ' s awesome ! what kind of car ?"
"I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!	that is a real car !"
"It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my ""attacker"" off with!	I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself	i would be too . i would be a bit nervous ."
"I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese	well , you ' re going to be careful and you ' ll be able to get it on your new friend ."

"I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!	i love the food . i ' m sure you ' ll get a good meal ."
"Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!	i hope you have a good time ."
"They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.	Someone stole my identity.	that ' s great . i ' m sure you ' ll do great !"
"I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.	that ' s great . i ' m sure you ' ll be able to get a good time ."
"i have food on my table, a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful	that ' s awesome ! i bet you ' re a great time !"
"yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted	that ' s awesome ! i ' m glad you guys are going to be in the future ."

"I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!	oh no ! that ' s a bummer ! what kind of stuff ?"
"Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.	oh no ! maybe you can get a new new job !"
"Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!	When I spend time with my family, it reminds me how lucky I really am.	i am glad you were able to get that"
"Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.	i am sure it was a good thing to do"
"My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much	that is so sweet . what kind of dog is it ?"

"I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!	that ' s great ! what kind of car ?"
"I want an SUV, like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!	that ' s great ! i ' m sure you ' ll get it ."

"My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.	i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' m so sorry to hear that ."

"I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.	oh no ! did you have a good time ?"
"Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!	that ' s so scary ! i ' m glad you were able to do that ."
"They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.	oh no ! that ' s terrible ! did you get hurt ?"
"What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!	did you do it ?"
"I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!	i know how you feel . i ' m glad you ' re going to be in the way ."

"Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.	that ' s awesome . i hope you can get it back ."
"When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.	that ' s a good thing to do . do you have any children ?"
"It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!	i think you should have a good time ."
"Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.	i hope you have to go back and get it fixed ."
"There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.	I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away	i have a lot of people have to have a good time ."

"I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!	that ' s great . what did you do to do with the manziel ?"
"Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!	oh no ! did you have a good time ?"
"I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.	what was the issue ?"
"That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.	i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope he is going through that ."
"That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.	When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.	what kind of health is it ?"
"It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!	i ' m sure it was a lot of people ."
"I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.	i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please	oh no ! what kind of cat was it ?"

"Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.	that is very nice of her ."

"My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!	that sounds like a good time ."
"My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.	oh no ! did you get a dog ?"
"Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!	i know how you feel . i have a dog who has a pet and i know how you feel ."
"She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!	I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!	oh no ! that is terrible ! what happened ?"

"I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.	that is so annoying . are you going to get a good time ?"
"Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.	i think they are . they are so rude ."
"For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.	i know how you feel . i ' m glad you ' re happy for you !"
"It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!	i can understand that"
"It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in!	Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.	i know that feeling . i don ' t know how you feel ."
"Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries.	i know that feeling . i ' m sure you ' ll get it ."

"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	i hope you can get them"
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	i agree . i have a lot of people who who do that ."
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	oh no , what happened ?"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	oh wow . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	that ' s nice of you . i ' m sure you can trust your money ."
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	i hope you can find a new new job ."
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	that ' s terrible ! i hope you ' re able to get it out ."
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	that sounds like a lot of fun ! i ' m glad you ' re able to get it out ."
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	that sounds scary ! i would be afraid of the street ."
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	i ' m not sure it was . i ' m not sure it ' s not a good idea ."
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	why is that ?"
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	i bet she will be fine"
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you ' ll be able to get another pet ."
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	oh no , i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry you had to go through that ."
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	oh no ! did you get hurt ?"
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	i hope everything goes well !"
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	that ' s good . i wish i could have a good wasking with the car ."

"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	that ' s a lot of stressful . i ' m glad you ' re going to be prepared ."
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	that is pretty scary"
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	that ' s great ! what are you going to do ?"

"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	did you get it ?"
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	that sounds like a great time !"
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	maybe you should try to go with a new time ."
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	that is so sad . i would have a pet for a pet ."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	that is so sweet of you . i am sure he is a great dog ."
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	i ' m sure you ' ll have a great time ."
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	i ' m glad you were able to get it ."
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	that ' s so sad . maybe she ' s going to be a child ?"
"She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade	that is a good thing"

"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	oh no , what happened ?"
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	oh no , what happened ?"
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	oh no ! did you find out ?"
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you find him ."
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	that is terrible . i would have been a dhec of a friend ."
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	that ' s terrible . i hope you can find a new one ."
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	that ' s great . i ' ve never been there ."
"I will, you never know when someone else is in need!	i hope you get it ."
"It is, I have been so blessed in my life!	My husband started college this week!	that ' s awesome ! i bet you are proud of him !"

"I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.	what happened ?"
"No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.	oh no ! did you have a good job ?"
"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	oh no ! did you get hurt ?"

"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	oh no , what happened ?"

"When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!	that ' s great ! i ' m glad you got it paid off ."
"Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.	what kind of job did you get ?"
"Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!	i ' m sure you ' ll do fine !"

"It really is, you are molding their future!	I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce	that is terrible . i hope you can find a new dog ."
"No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.	that ' s good . i ' m sure you ' ll get to get a good dog ."
"Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.	i know that feeling . i ' m glad you ' re going to get it fixed ."
"They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	maybe you should get a new new one ."
"It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.	My sister got a promotion at work last week!	that ' s great !"

"My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.	i know how you feel . i ' m glad you ' re proud of you ."
"Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.	that ' s great . i ' m sure you ' ll be able to get that money ."
"My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!	what game did you play ?"
"I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.	i love nintendo . i have never seen that ."
"Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?	that ' s great ! what do you do ?"
"Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!	i ' m sure you did it !"
"I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.	that ' s nice of him ! i bet you were happy"
"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	wow , that ' s a good thing to do . what did you do ?"
"I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.	that ' s no good . what are you going to do ?"
"I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.	maybe you should try to get it to go to the store store to go ?"
"Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.	I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made!	what is the issue ?"
"Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.	oh wow ! that is a good idea !"
"Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!	that ' s great ! what did you do ?"
"Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.	oh , i ' m sorry to hear that . i ' m sorry to hear that ."
"4	that ' s great ! what did you do ?"
"Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.	i love to hear that . what kind of work is it ?"
"My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.	I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday	i hate when that happens ."
"Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic	oh no , that ' s awful . i ' ve never had to deal with that"
"I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am	i know that feeling . i know how you feel . i know it ' s hard to be able to get a good time to get a good time ."

"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	oh wow ! that is a tough test . do you have any anxiety ?"
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	that ' s great ! i ' m sure you ' ll do great !"
"She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.	oh no ! did she get it back ?"
"Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!	I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.	i ' m sure it was a good time to do that . i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ."
"I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.	i am sure it was a good thing to do ."
"I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome	oh no"

"I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!	that ' s a good thing ."

"Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.	i hope you enjoy it !"
"I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!	maybe you should try to get it out"
"I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.	i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope you can get it again !"

"Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.	oh no ! i bet she was a good feeling !"
"I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.	maybe you should try to her to the doctor ."
"Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.	oh wow , that ' s a good thing to do . i ' m sure she ' ll be able to get it out ."
"I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise.	i ' m sorry to hear that . maybe you can find a new new one ."
"I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.	that ' s good . i hope you have a great time !"

"It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.	i hope you can find a relief for you ."
"Thank you so much for being supportive. :)	I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.	oh no , that must have been scary !"
"Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.	oh no ! did you get to get out ?"
"Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.	I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.	oh no ! i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope he is okay ."
"Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.	i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope he is okay ."
"Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.	I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	oh no ! what happened ?"
"I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.	i hope you ' re positive and positive positive and positive positive !"

"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.	that ' s great to hear . i ' m sure you ' ll do great for him ."
"I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me	that sounds like a good movie !"

"Yeah, nobody said anything	i know , i have had that happen"
"My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!	oh no ! how did that go ?"
"Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!	i know how you feel . i ' m glad you ' re doing that ."
"Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.	I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.	that ' s good . i wish you the best of luck ."
"I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.	i ' m sure he was a good friend ."
"Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.	i ' m sure he did that ."
"No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(	congratulations ! that ' s a good idea ."
"He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.	So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?	wow , that ' s a good thing . what kind of dog is it ?"
"I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.	i hope you ' re able to get it out ."
"I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.	that ' s great ! what kind of dog do you have ?"
"Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!	i would have been too ."
"Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.	I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though	that ' s terrible . what kind of him is he ?"
"Yes, I feel much better now.	i ' m sorry to hear that . i hope he is okay ."
"I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.	that is so sweet of you . i bet you were very happy"

"I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.	My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.	oh no ! did you get it back ?"
"I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.	oh no ! i hope you ' re okay ."
"Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.	what did you do"
"Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.	that is a good thing to do"
"I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.	i ' m sorry to hear that . what happened ?"

"You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions, and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.	oh wow , that sounds like a lot of fun !"

If not, my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.	oh no ! that ' s a good thing to do . i ' ve never been there ."
"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	i ' m sure they ' ll be fine ."

"The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.	i ' m sure you ' ll be able to get a lot of money !"

"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	oh no ! did you get it up ?"

"Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple.	i know . i would be too"

"I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....	i know what you mean . i ' m glad you ' re happy !"
"The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.	that ' s awesome . what are you going to do ?"
"No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.	that ' s awesome . i ' m sure she ' ll be able to see them ."

"Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later.	that is true . do you think she is married ?"
"One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.	oh no ! did you get hurt ?"

"There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	i ' m glad you ' re doing good . i hope you ' re able to get a good day ."

"I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.	that ' s great to hear . what did you do ?"
"Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.	i agree , i have a lot of people who have a lot of people ."
"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!	I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.	oh no ! did you get a ride ?"
"Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.	i ' m sure you ' re going to be safe ."

"Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!	I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	oh no , that sounds scary"
"It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?	oh no , did you get it ?"
"That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!	why did you feel bad about it ?"
"I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.	i hope you have a good time ."

"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you have a good 335lbs ."

"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	i hope you get it"
"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	that ' s a good idea . maybe you should try to get a new job ?"
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	i have never been to buy it . i was a new computer but i was a kid ."

"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	that ' s a good idea . maybe you should get a new home ."
"We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.	i know how you feel . i ' m glad you ' re going to be a good time ."
"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	that ' s awesome ! i ' m glad you were able to do that ."
"Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)	that sounds like a great time ."
"My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.	that ' s so sad . maybe you should take care of the new animals ."
"I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!	that ' s so sweet . what kind of dog is he ?"

"I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.	i love those nostalgic . what did you do ?"
"Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.	i can understand that ."
"Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!	thats good . i wish i could have a good friend ."
