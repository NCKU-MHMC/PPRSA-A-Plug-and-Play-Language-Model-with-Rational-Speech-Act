"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	that is horrifying . i am so sorry to hear that ."
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	drunk driving is a serious problem . i hope you are ok ."
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	mine too . i ' m in a similar situation ."
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	he was not punished but he was drunk and he was in a car accident . i was so scared"
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	sorry to hear that . i am sure you will find someone else ."
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	maybe you should try to go to a different country to meet up ?"
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	nice ! what concert ?"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	that was expensive ? i ' m sorry to hear that ."
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	oh no , i ' m so sorry to hear that . i ' m sure you ' ll find someone who can help you ."
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	oh no ! i hope everything is okay now . . ."
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	oh no ! that must have been so painful ."
"i was singing nursery songs :)	singing is a great way to get a good laugh ."
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	i hope so too . i hope he gets a job soon ."
"thank you so much!	you are welcome ."
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	wow that is scary ! did you call the police ?"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	protect your son from what ?"
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	thats awesome ! i hope you guys have a great time !"
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	congratulations ! that is a great achievement ."
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	i would be angry too . i would be too ."
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	yeah , i agree ."
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	i would have bought it online ."
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	sorry to hear that ."
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	wow , that sucks . i hope you guys can work things out ."
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	thats good . i hope he gets better ."
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	aww , that ' s great ! i bet you ' re so happy !"
"i totally agree with you!	it ' s hard to find things that last forever ."
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	aww , that ' s sad . i ' m sorry to hear that . maybe you can meet some new people ?"
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	that would be great ! i ' m sure you ' ll find something to do with your time ."
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	i agree . i have a son who does the same thing ."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	me either ! i don ' t understand them either . i ' m glad you have a good relationship with them ."
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	ew ! i hate bugs too ! i hate them so much !"
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	that must have been really nice ."
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	i ' m sure she will find someone else ."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	birth is the best feeling ."
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	i agree . i am happy for you ."
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	yes ! it ' s so nice to have a good bank account ."
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	exactly . i hope you are doing better now ."
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	that ' s great to hear . what happened ?"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	yes you are very lucky to have such a close friend ."
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	thank you . i appreciate that ."
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	exactly , we are all part of the moment"
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	aww , that ' s sweet ! i ' m sure you had a great time ."
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	she sounds like a great mom !"
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	maybe you should try to find a hobby to keep yourself busy ."
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	sometimes it does , but it ' s better to be honest with them than to be rude ."
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	haha , i know what you mean . i remember when my son was a baby , he was so different than i was ."
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	wow that is so cool ! i bet babies are so cute !"
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	i know what you mean . i love chicken , but i ' m not a fan of their fries ."
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	ugh that is so annoying , i hate when that happens"
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	aww , that ' s so sweet . i ' m glad you had a good visit ."
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	that is great . i bet you were really proud of him ."
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	thank you for your support . i hope so ."
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	she moved far away from me , so i don ' t really know how she did it ."
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	shame is a very important thing to have . i ' m sure you ' ll be fine ."
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	6th graders are the worst . i ' m sorry to hear that ."
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	sorry to hear that . i hope you can find out who she was ."
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	that sounds like a great job . i ' m sure you ' re very proud of him ."
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	i admire you for your dedication . i am a little jealous of you ."
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	i try to stay positive and try to stay positive . i try to stay positive and try to stay positive ."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	that is awesome ! how old is she ?"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	aww , that ' s too bad . i live 30 minutes away from my mom and she ' s a bit far from me . i ' m sure you ' ll get to see her soon !"
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	congratulations ! i bet you were so proud of yourself ."
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	venice marathon sounds like a great destination ! i ' m sure you ' ll be doing great !"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	haha , that ' s amazing ! i ' m sure you ' re a great swimmer , but i ' m sure you ' d be a little nervous ."
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	that ' s interesting . i ' m not sure i understand ."
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	oh wow , that must be hard . i hope you guys can get through it together ."
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	bullying is not fun ."
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	anger is a very strong emotion ."
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	aww , i ' m so sorry to hear that . i ' m sure she was devastated ."
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	that was nice of you . i hope she is doing better now ."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	disne__unk__ is a great place to go ."
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	awesome , i bet you were so excited , i bet you were so proud of them ."
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	that ' s great . i ' m glad you have a good father ."
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	wow ! that is great news ."
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	i organize my house too . i love it ."
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	labels are a great idea . i ' ll have to try that ."
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	yes , i agree . i hate when people don ' t respond to my email ."
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	text is the best way to communicate , but i agree , email is better"
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	oh no ! that ' s terrible . i ' m sorry to hear that . what did you do ?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	tempers are the worst . i hope you guys can work it out ."
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	aw , that must have been so lonely . i ' m sorry to hear that ."
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	hong kong is a beautiful place . i ' ve always wanted to go there ."
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	i know right ? i feel like people are just trying to be nice to others ."
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	i agree , but sometimes it ' s hard to tell if they ' re just being a jerk or if they ' re just being a jerk ."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	oh no , i ' m sorry . i ' m sure he ' ll understand ."
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	yeah i understand . i ' m sure he will learn from it ."
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	oh no ! did he apologize ?"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	that is good . i would have been mad too ."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	health is important , but i think it ' s important to be healthy every day ."
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	yes there are . i am glad you have that in common ."
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	aww , i bet that is so sweet . i bet you are so proud of them ."
"Are your kids adults now?	they are , they are still in their teens ."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	confidence is a great way to start a new life ."
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	maybe you should try again ."
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	that ' s great ! it ' s nice to have a family ."
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	insurance is a big worry . i ' m glad you found a job that you love ."
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	uh oh , what happened ?"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	aww that ' s so sweet ! i ' m happy for you !"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	wow that sounds like a lot of fun ! where are you going ?"
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	panama city beach is a great place to visit ! ! i ' ve been there a few times ."
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	brunch is always a good idea ."
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	dang , that sucks . did you ask her why she didn ' t return ?"
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	did you call the police ?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	scary ! i would have been so scared !"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	li ? what happened ?"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	oh no ! that is so terrible ! i would have been so angry !"
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	oh no ! why did you look like that ?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	she sounds like a real jerk ."
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	oh no , what happened ?"
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	rain is the worst , i hope you got a good view of the stage ."
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	who was sleeping on the couch ?"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	oh no ! that ' s terrible !"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	surprise gifts are always nice ."
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	that is very nice . i am glad you gave him something ."
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	good luck ! i hope you get it !"
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	congratulations ! i hope you get it !"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	oh no , what happened ?"
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	oh wow that is horrible . i am so sorry to hear that ."
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	hahaha that is so funny ! did you guys get to go out again ?"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	wow , that is so disgusting . i hope you are ok ."
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	wow that is terrible . i hope you can get it fixed ."
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	yes , i know ! i have had to call a lot of times to get food from the restaurant i work at . i have to be very careful when i order from them ."
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	oh no ! that ' s terrible . i ' m sorry you had to go through that ."
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	i understand , i am sure she will find someone else ."
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	mom ' s are the best ."
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	she probably didn ' t know you were embarrassed . i ' m sure she ' ll forgive you ."
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	that sounds so nice ! where are you going ?"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	panama city beach is a great place to visit ! i ' ve never been there , but i ' ve always wanted to go ."
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	that is great ! she is going to be a great mom !"
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	exactly ! i wish i could afford to have a house like that ."
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	i hate that too ! i hate when people do that ."
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	exactly ! i always put it in the corrals and walk it back to the store ."
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	4d baby ? that ' s amazing ! i bet you were so happy !"
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	yes , i agree . i am happy for you ."
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	me too . i think it ' s a great way to get a rise out of people ."
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	i sure am ! i love visual recording !"
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	absolutely . it ' s a great way to help people ."
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	exactly , i agree , it is a trap and a failure"
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	babies are the best ! i love them so much !"
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	bugs are cute , but not as cute as your baby !"
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	that ' s great ! i ' m glad you got to spend time with your family ."
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	i know what you mean . i love to get gifts from my mom , but i ' m not sure if i could ever get a gift from my mom ."
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	maybe he was just really tired ."
"Did they give you any feedback?	they gave me some feedback , but i am not sure what you mean"
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	mistakes are not my fault"
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	congratulations ! i hope you have a wonderful time raising the baby !"
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	congratulations ! i bet you were so happy !"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	netflix is the best ! i love watching it on netflix ."
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	i have heard of that show . i have never seen it ."
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	thanks for the heads up . i ' ll have to check it out ."
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	that ' s great ! i bet you were so prepared ."
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	congratulations ! that is a great accomplishment ."
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	traffic is horrible . i hate it ."
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	people are so rude , i hate it"
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	i remember that movie . i was scared of the house too ."
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	i know ! i remember seeing the first one when i was a kid ."

"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	that ' s too bad . i hope you have a great recovery ."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	sorry to hear that . i ' m sure you will find someone soon ."

"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	yelling at people is not a good way to deal with people ."
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	lol true . maybe you should put a note on the door saying "" thank you """
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	move to another city ."
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	i hope he says yes ! i ' m sure he will !"
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	ouch ! i ' m so sorry to hear that . i hope you feel better soon !"
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	i had a surgeon ' s office come in and help me . i was so angry . i was so angry ."
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	yeah , he ' s a creep . . but he ' s a good lawyer . . he ' s a good doctor . . he ' s a good lawyer . . he ' s a good doctor . . he ' s a good doctor . . he ' s a good doctor . . he ' s a good doctor"

"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!	harry potter is my favorite ."
"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	exactly ! i think it ' s because they ' re so young ."
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	definitely . i think it ' s just a lot of kids being more mature ."
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	congratulations ! that is great news ."
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	dairy queen is a great restaurant ."
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	i ' ve heard good things about it ."
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	good , i hope you get a raise soon ."

I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!	congratulations ! that ' s great news !"
"Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!	that ' s great !"
"How long have you been there?	for about a year ."
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	it would be hard . i ' m not sure how to make a case ."
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	that sucks ! did you have to pay for it ?"

"So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!	sounds like you have a plan ."

It was just about elbow to elbow!	hahaha ! that is hilarious !"

"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	i like avant garde theater . what was the play about ?"
"Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!	mystery candy ? that sounds like a recipe for disaster ."
"Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!	that ' s tough . i ' m sure you guys will get it eventually ."
"It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!	i hate waiting for bonuses ."
"When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.	wow thats a lot of money ."

At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	oh no ! i ' m so sorry to hear that . i hope she gets over it ."

"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	yeah , he will be alright ."
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	oh no ! that ' s scary ! did you guys get out of the house ?"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	that ' s so sweet ! i bet you were so happy !"
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	i saw one fly once . it was scary ."
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	drones are very expensive ."
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	maybe she is just being nice to you ."
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	oh wow , that must have been creepy ."
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	i know how you feel . i lost my dog a few years ago ."
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	aw that ' s so sad , i ' m so sorry . i hope he gets better ."
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	oh no ! i hope everything turns out okay ."

"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	sounds like a nice weekend ."
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	aw man , that ' s too bad . maybe you can go out and have a party ?"
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	dogs are so much better than family ."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	sorry to hear that . i have a dog and a cat . i ' m sure you ' re feeling a lot better ."
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	oh no ! i hope you didn ' t die !"

"Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.	Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends.	volley ball is a great sport . i used to play with my dad when i was a kid ."

"I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!	i agree . i don ' t know how they can defend themselves ."
"Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.	When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup	i remember that game . i was so happy ."

"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	wow that is crazy !"

"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	absolutely . i ' m glad you have more people to help out ."

"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	yikes ! that ' s terrible . i hope you found him !"

"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	she sounds like a good mom ."

"Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple.	apples are good but i prefer my apples fresh"
"That is true, I should be thankful for that.	I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs.	wow ! did you get scared ?"

I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	that sounds so nice ! i love to read those too ."

"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	that makes sense . i would tell her ."
"Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.	I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.	oh wow ! what part ?"

"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	that is a good idea , i hope she enjoys driving ."
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	that is good , i hope she gets better soon"

"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	that ' s great . i hope you guys are still friends"
