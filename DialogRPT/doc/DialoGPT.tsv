"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	Oh that sounds awful! Sounds like you need to be more careful and check your water marks more often, that's a bad situation to be in."
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	It was your fault for being drunk. That doesn't make you a bad person."
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	Yeah. What happened?"
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	Well, the incident is over now and no one was seriously injured, but man was that scary. I was turning and about a corner and the car just went another way."
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	Oh no that is hard.  I'm so sorry.  I hope you two can be happy again soon!"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	It will come, that is the truth. Everyone finds someone special and everyone elses fault"
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	What concert was it?"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	That is amazing.  I saw them a couple of years ago and always wished I could have gone.  It is always nice to go to a concert and have a great time."
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	That's so sad to hear! Did the parents change their minds once she was born?"
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	That's very fortunate. I'm sure she's in good hands now."
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	Oh no. Is he okay though?"
"i was singing nursery songs :)	Did someone sing you a song?"
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	I am sorry to hear that! I bet he is looking for something better."
"thank you so much!	Sure thing, no problem. Do you have a trick to overcome this phobia, or is it something you can naturally overcome?"
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	oh man i hear you.. scary stuff right there.. i hope no one got hurt"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	That is awesome. protection from what?"
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	Oh that's awesome! Do you miss them?"
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	That is great. What do you like about your country?"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	Thats awful. Did he apologize?"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	That's awful! Was it a stranger or someone you knew?"
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	That is a bummer, do you not like paying for convenience?"
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	How did it feel?"
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	That's great that you took the stand. A friend can be a great influence."
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	Oh wow, I'm glad you had the courage to tell her! You sound like a great friend."
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	That sounds nice"
"i totally agree with you!	Are you happy or sad about it?"
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	Why don't you join one of your local clubs?"
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	Did you end up joining?"
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	That would be really annoying. And really unfair of her to demand you buy it back."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	Yeah it's really hard to be a parent.  You've got to have a plan for them to keep you grounded."
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	Gross! I hate bugs too."
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	It's nice to hear ex's make good conversation, what happened?"
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	I understand,  everyone goes through tough times sometimes. But,  they'll get through it"
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	Congrats! That is the best feeling, birth right?"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	That is great, it is always nice to remember happy times"
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	I absolutely have. It is scary. I have delayed many projects due to various deadlines and my personal finances in a row, leaving me little savings and belongings to fend for myself. It was an extremely stressful time."
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	That's quite an interesting situation. I guess I've never really been scared or worried about death before. I was more of a scared of the unknown. But I suppose there's no such a thing as too much anxiety. Glad you're happy now."
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	I'm sorry to hear about your friend's situation. What happened?"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	Oh no! Were you able to help?"
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	thats great"
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	that's so awesome! i love it when something feels right"
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	That sounds like it would be very fun. I am glad you had a fun time."
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	That is awesome that your mom was able to do that!  Was this a surprise?"
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	I am sorry that you feel that way. Sometimes life can get in the way of making a connection"
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	I've felt that way as well. Sometimes it's hard to tell if somebody is being nice to you because they won't back down or if they're being rude!"
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	That is a good way of looking at it."
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	How does one like things in a sling? I never understood that"
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	It is delicious! Are you a chicken or beef person?"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	Happens a lot. The empty parking lots are a good place to sit and relax."
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	Oh that sounds amazing.  I'm incredibly grateful for my parents for taking the time to help me in my time of need."
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	It's good you were able to introduce him to new people."
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	I'm sure it will. That's what marriage is about!"
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	She did not know that I was ex-girlfriend of theirs. I was more of a ""what's your secret?"" type guy"
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	That's too bad. Hopefully you learned your lesson though."
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	Aw, I am glad you have good friends like that to help you through tough times!"
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	that is really bad of facebook. they should not be allowed to post pictures of famous people"
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	You must really like to work hard to get such a great example."
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	I like your attitude! You're really inspiring! I think we need more people like you in society."
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	I just have to keep doing the best I can and try not to let things get me down."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	How old is she now?"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	I wish you the best of luck! Maybe she's counting on you to be around even when you aren't."
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	wow great for you, you must have worked hard for this"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	Sounds awesome!  What did you do?  Was it a marathon?"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	Wow. You have some endurance. I bet you could do it in a day."
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	Oh wow I'm sorry!  That is so tough to deal with.  Sometimes it's just hard to reconcile people and even that can be hard."
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	What is she changing to do?"
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	I feel the same way. If someone is being bad to me and it's not my kids, I'll usually just beat them up myself"
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	Honestly,I dont know. But if you can't let it go,Then just make it known that you are frustrated with that specific situation and so you should express your discontent with it."
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	I bet you were so sad and worried. I hope she knows that loss is never easy."
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	It's good you were patient. She'll be fine"
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	That's awesome! Are you a parent? I bet you are super excited as well."
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	Oh wow! That sounds like a really great experience. Do you live in Tucson now?"
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	Now that is a pleasant suprise! How did it make you feel?"
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	Oh wow, what kind of car?"
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	I love organizing! We have a large family, too. We had to hire a hand-inker once, so we have some hands, and I know how to use them well."
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	That is true. I have a newborn and I had to write a check for $1000 with him for his first birthday."
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	I know right. I get so busy and ignore everyone that comes my way that I forget what's even in my mailbox"
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	Yeah, I know the feeling. Some things are better handled in person."
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	Oh, well I hope it gets resolved"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	Where did you discuss heated topics?"
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	Aw, that sounds awful. How far did you guys move?"
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	I have never been but i would love to go."
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	I have a friend like that. Makes me feel pity on them."
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	Thank you for the encouraging words. I've always been self-aware and seek out new ways to be useful. I hope that continues"
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	That's good that you were able to keep it respectful. No one should ever be jealous of someone else's efforts."
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	Heh, yeah I have bad days also. But, usually it's not as bad as yours. If he'd had asked, I could've probably told him no. I hope you're able to work it out, too. That can be really tough to figure out."
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	Oh I get it! It's annoying when people do that.  That's the weirdest thing I've ever heard."
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	What a nice person! It's nice to have friends like that."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	It sounds like you're taking steps to try and keep healthy everyday. I hope that it works for you."
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	Good for you. Have you always lived this way?"
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	I know the feeling.old photos are the best but it really makes you miss the good times"
"Are your kids adults now?	Ha. No. They are neither. School starts soon."
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	That's awesome, I agree with you. I hate when I feel like I don't fully fit into a given category."
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	I understand, it's hard to be happy all the time, but maybe there's a good reason you're feeling that way."
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	It really tough for sure!"
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	Part-time jobs are awesome. I hope you're able to find something that will keep you occupied while you work."
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	Well that's disappointing. What exactly happened?"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	Wow, how did that make you feel?"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	That sounds wonderful. I am sure it will be a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation."
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	that sounds like a nice place to have fun!"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	How did it go?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	Oh man, that's a pain! I bet your really mad right now."
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	What did you do?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	Oh my god! Did the guy get shot?"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	Oh no, what happened?"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	That's terrible. I would hate to have my anniversary ruined"
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	what happened?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	Everyone could have drank that stuff! I am sorry that happened to you."
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	No, what happened?"
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	Whoa that's insane, I would have peed my pants if it was raining"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	Did you tell them?"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	Oh my! I am so sorry to hear that! Did he/she pass away?"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	wow! i could not believe it when my wife got us a cat"
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	That is great. What was the gift?"
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	That's fair, how many chicks have you hometen?"
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	How did you feel after you saw their face?"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	No, and I hope never. That was a scary experience for sure."
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	That is scary! It sounds like you had a great time though"
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	Oh man that is so crazy! I would've freaked out!"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	Well, hopefully he will get over it, he seems like a nice guy."
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	Oh no!  Did you end up buying a new one?"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	Oh man. I just got a divorce a few years ago and it was rough. Even worse when you're trying to get pregnant right?"
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	Ouch! That is hard! How did you respond?"
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	She probably understands. It is difficult for parents to have to support their children."
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	Oh wow, that must've been embarrassing, but I think everyone could've reacted to that to some degree, and maybe they did."
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	did something happen?"
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	Oh nice! Where are you going on vacation?"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	Oh, that sounds lovely. Is it your first time?"
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	I'm so proud! Your kids sound like awesome people."
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	Exactly. It's not about what you can do for other people, it's about what you can do for yourself."
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	Seriously! How much do they pay you to park your carts?"
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	I do the same! I always put my extra clothes in a backpack so I don't have to lift it up when I go to the store!"
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	Oh that's sweet.  How far along is the baby?"
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	Waiting is the worst.  But, it's good you're excited about it.  What's the matter?"
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	that sounds wonderful.. is there anything like that where you work?"
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	Oh wow, that sounds like a great job. I think that you must have some supervisory experience, if you're so qualified. I would contact a HR department as I don't know how you'd do that."
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	I totally agree. Leaders who put their foot down for the people are typically better than those who don't."
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	That is unfortunately true."
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	Awesome! Was there any special occasion or anything like that?"
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	Awwwww. I love that movie"
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	Aw, that's nice. I always love Mother's Day, but I'm not usually one to brag about myself. It's good that you had a great event and were able to enjoy it with your family."
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	That sounds very sentimental.  Is there something about cards that you are sentimental about?"
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	Couldn't catch a break. I guess I need to find a new job now."
"Did they give you any feedback?	Not yet, they told me not to worry about it. I'm expecting a call in a few days."
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	Yeah, I am. But mistakes happen and I can't learn from them"
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	Congratulations to them!  Is this your first child?"
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	announce what?"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	I didn't have any Netflix but now I am going to try one out."
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	Oh wow! Did you enjoy it? I've never seen it before!"
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	oh thats kinda neat, are you a fan of the show?"
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	That's good. Did they award you a retainer?"
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	You deserved that 6 months! What a great accomplishment!"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	I feel that, even in major cities. I don't like driving in them."
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	Did you ever say anything or do anything about it?"
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	Oh no! What was it that scared you about?"
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	Because you like them or because you wanted to see them?"
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	Thats awesome!  When does she start?  Its always the hardest when kids are young"
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	That's really great that she is a good friend! Most don't last that long."
"I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.	Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.	You have a new banana plant?"
"I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.	Oh no! That's awful. How much rain are you getting?"
"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	Oh, Congratulations! I hope you get a puppy! Where are you going to get him?"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	Oh that sounds like fun, what did you do?"
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	I feel bad for you."
"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed	why are you better off with them"
"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.	How did you learn to be independent?"
"Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married	Good luck in your future endeavors. How long have you been together?"
"My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.	Wow, that's a big amount of money."
"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.	that's worrisome"
"True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future	Oh, does that make you anxious?  What did you tell them?"
"I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path	Good luck. I'm sure you've got it. Just know that the work can be hard and that you will need to practice over and over."
"That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?	I have no idea, but I really hope that it gets better. It is making me very angry."
"You could chat to them and complain!	I have tried that but they don't care."
"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.	i bet that was nice of them"
"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	You are so lucky. I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.	Are you looking forward to having to get rid of all the trash?"
"I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.	Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood	Right, what do you miss most about that time?"
"I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era	Oh my gosh! You must be so excited. What toys and shows do you have?"
"The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.	I love 90s music. Do you still listen to them?"
"Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.	What trends and shows did you see?"
"How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.	I was 13. I dont count 90s as kids. I count 80s and early 2000s as being pretty old."
"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	I do not like either of those things"
"Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?	It was a group project so we used a resourceful person to help us learn and it turned out to be a better experience that we both anticipated!"
"I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.	To be honest, i didn't liked it either."
"Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.	What movie is it?"
"My parents keep taking my money	Why is that?"
"They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.	I understand. Do they take advantage of you when you do save a lot?"
"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!	I would guess that kids today have little concept of personal space and are eager to herd whatever is around them"
"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)	I always tell them to go to the back of the room."
"The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.	I am so sorry to hear about your friend. Was it unexpected?"
"She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.	oh my god, that is horrifying! is she okay?"
"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.	That is awesome, and beautiful!"
"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	What helped you heal?"
"A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.	Wow, what a wonderful situation you're in. You must be so thankful to him that he's able to support you in this difficult time."
"We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!	That's so random! Did you guys have a good time trying to drive?"
"Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind.	It's nice to have nice people around. That's what makes life better."
"Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.	Yeah I bet that was fun"
"That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.	I am glad you have one now!"
"Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops.	It was raining hard one night and the power shut off	That's too bad. Are you out of house or out away"
"Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles	They must be really expensive candles!"
"One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam. It was hard and I studied all night.	That sounds like a really difficult exam. Did you end up passing the exam?"
"I ended up actually getting a 98%!	That's great! I did not know you could get that many%."
"Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.	Do you have any pets?	yes i have a dog. what about you?"
"Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff.	My cat does the same thing. He leaves his little ball of fur everywhere and curls up at the last second if he gets near a door or window."
"My son graduated.	Congratulations, what is he going to do now?"
"Highschool.	Oh, no. Are you ok?"
"One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.	That has happened to me too! How did you feel leaving them?"
"I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.	I know what you mean, my friend. When you see your loved ones, it makes you feel warm and fuzzy."
"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	Are you happy for him?"
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	Wow, he is really getting into the beans business I guess"
"I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.	That's a tough situation. I hope you guys are able to work through it."
"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..	You should totally be on that show. lol"
"No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.	She sounds like a great person. I would do the same. I am sure she knows you can trust her."
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?	Yeah, I listen to rock n roll. What kind of songs does it take you back to?"
"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..	Yeah, I understand what you mean. It can be a little daunting"
"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	That is terrible. Do you miss him?"
"It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(	Oh my God! That's terrible! I'm so sorry you had to go through that."
"Thank you. I appreciate that.	I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.	Sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too."
"The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha	That's terrible! I hate the flu."
"Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.	Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends, so gross.	I do not like oysters."
"Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it	Well, it's a good thing that you were able to make your own sushi. I would be furious if I was eating raw sushi!"
"You don't care for sushi that much?	I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!	Wow you must have been pretty mad to get played on that prank."
"I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!	Why were you upset"
"My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.	I feel you, thats happened to me before, its tough"
"I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.	Oh, I see. Do you think he'll be a good officer?"
"I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.	It's never too late. Why 3 more years?"
"We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha	Haha, that is great! Do you love all of your animals?"
"I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.	Oh no, why is that?"
"I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.	What are you so unsure about?"
"I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.	You can also try online dating"
"I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.	that's a really good idea, i hope she says yes!"
"I am very lucky, my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?	I was just talking about this with my friend. I would have to say my birthfay was 25th. But it has been a good year!"
"Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!	That sounds fun actually. I've always wanted to go to a party with a friend"
"For sure, maybe you need new friends!	5	What does that mean exactly?"
"I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.	Oh no, how come?"
"I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.	Oh wow! That must have been so scary! What happened?"
"Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt, though.	What happened?"
"Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?	Absolutely!  That's the best feeling ever!  It's so refreshing"
"Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha	I will try that next time it is winter. My apartment is right next to a road."
"I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.	I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me, even to this day.	That's really sweet of her, it's good you have a great family."
"I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.	That's sweet of you. What kind of gifts would you like to give her?"
"You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?	I guess no one told me. I guess I'm not as lucky as I thought."
"But you failed the exam? Did you revise?	Oh yeah, I definitely did. And of course I did. But the exam still isn't over and I'll have to keep at it for another year."
"At least you know for next time eh?	My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.	Well that's very nice of her! What kind of car did you get?"
"She's amazing. Do you love your mom?	I do.  She has done so much for me growing up."
"I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.	Try not to feel sad about it. She will find someone else."
"It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month, so I will likely discuss it when she returns.	Oh, so it will be like a reunion with your parents?"
"That sounds tough. What do you do/	I'm a stay at home mom, but I would be scared if I was out alone in the dark all night long."
"That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.	It is not hard work at all. I work for a company that releases standardized tests in the US. The tests are easy peasy!"
"Fair enough. As long as you look after your back""	I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.	I believe in you!"
"Environmental engineering! I enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.	Environmental engineering is hard! I feel like most people's passion is that of driving."
"I watch so many scary movies that I haven't been able to sleep alone in years due to fear.	Oh no, do you feel okay when you do watch them?"
"I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.	What interest do you have in them?"
"I've been telling myself that for years, I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?	I like movies about vampires. What kind of movies do you like?"
"What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?	i dont have a favorite, i was just saying what i thought would be a good movie to watch tonight. guess what i got"
"Donald Trump is now the president. It makes me feel bad about life.	I'm sure he will be good for the economy"
"I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him, too.	I'm a pretty lefty guy. You've probably never heard of this guy?"
"I am now going to be a master's student. I will got to he University of Florida	That is great! Congratulations! You must be very excited!"
"Environmental Engineering is my major. I enjoy it.	That's awesome. What makes you so fond of it?"
"I have been feeling very faithful these days. My lover treats me so well.	That's great! How long have you been together?"
"He is really nice and provides for me well. He is also very sweet and very respectful.	That's good, there aren't too many nice people in the world."
"Do you like to go through old family pictures?	I love going through old family albums. It can be so wonderful to see how things have changed and how people have changed."
"Absolutely. I love to hear my mÃ¡mÃ¡ tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.	You have some pretty interesting interests, hopefully you'll make some money while doing so."
"I also love to look through the old scrapbooks my mom made when I was a baby and young child. I find it's so funny to see what you looked like as a child.	I recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another. I am incredibly jealous of him.	Oh no! I am so sorry.  Do you think she'll treat you better?"
"I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.	You can do it! I believe in you"
"How long?	How many hours do you have left?"
"About what exactly?	Sorry I meant I got an older car that needed an engine change but could not afford it at the time. I needed to move it but my dad was able to help me."
"Now that is an interesting perspective!	My mother recently went to the bank for me. I love her so much.	That's awesome, it's nice to have a caring mother. I'm glad you get to spend time with her."
"Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!	Absolutely, people like that really make an impression."
"My father almost died. His recent health problems have been devastating.	oh wow i am very sorry for your loss. how long did he live?"
"It is tough, but I think I will make it.	what are you struggling with"
"My friend bought a new car. This makes me so jealous!	What kind of car did they get?"
"It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.	How so if I may ask?"
"I recently met a new person that I am very fond of. I want to give her my love and care.	That is wonderful! I am so glad you meet someone. I think it is so important to find true love."
"I am very happy, too. Do you have someone special in your life?	My wife yes"
"My family is very loving. They care about me so much.	That's wonderful to hear. You have a great family!"
"I agree. I hope you are also close to your family!	Very much. Our relationship is unique and I love them dearly."
"I stole my friend's Pokemon card when we were 7. I still feel guilty about it.	You shouldnt feel bad. People do stupid things all the time"
"Yes	what is good"
"I one time lost my trunks in the pool! People saw me in a way I didn't want!	oh man that is a great story! what was it that made you so embarrassed about it?"
"I covered my body and then went to the bathroom and got a towel!	I like turtles"
"I recently graduated from college. I loved it and now I feel great about my life!	Wow, thats awesome. You must be very proud. Any plans to move up?"
"I agree. I am thinking about moving to the West Coast of the USA.	That is a great idea."
"we went for a doctor visit because she was	What was wrong?"
"sorry lol. because she was ""late"". but she told me the result was negative, not pregnant. so then we went to a furniture store just to browse	That is funny, but why would she be late?"
"well here's the thing. We are married. Been together 5 years. So as I'm walking around looking at stuff in this store, I notice a bookmark hanging off the ear of a wooden rocking horse!	Having the whole house to your self sometimes isn't as good as it may seem!	I agree. It is annoying especially if you don't have someone to come home too."
"My whole family is out the house for a few months. I'm going to be so bored with no one around...	lol I feel the same way.  Mine went on vacation for a month and came back to just me and my dog."
"I have a huge chance to win a PS4!	I hope you are right because I would love that too"
"There's only 2 other people in the final round! Winning a PS4 will be awesome!	Who are you playing with?"
"My son really needs to cut down on the amount of sugary snacks he has!	Oh, that is so frustrating! Have you tried asking him to granola bar, peanut butter, and chocolate?  Sometimes, he just refuses to eat them!"
"Well, my wife gets them on deals, so likes to hoard them in the cupboard.	I'm sure she doesn't hoard them that much though"
"the house is very quiet now that she's been gone for four days visiting with her family	Why the long absence?"
"because she hasn't seen them in almost 2 years. Misses them	How often do you see them?"
"In the middle of the station, on my new suit, a seagull threw up on me!	I would have been so disgusted! Were you able to get it off or are you still scarred for life?"
"I was! I had to travel all the way home with a huge mess on me!	oh wow that sounds embarrasing.  Was it one person, or a whole lotta people?"
"Paddington Train Station.	I can't believe someone half my age got promoted instead of me!	I feel you man, I was out of work for two months and I barely got a call!"
"Have you ever missed out on a promotion?	I have. I felt so bad the one time I had to have a meeting cancelled because of it."
"My wife cried quite a lot at her mothers funeral. They had a very close bond.	Oh I'm sorry. Were you there?"
"Unfortunately she passed away, hence the funeral.	I'm so sorry.  I recently lost my grandmother to cancer.  It can be hard.  Take it easy."
"Getting this new job should be easy. I am easily the best person that applied.	congrats, i hope it works out for you"
"CEO of Apple. I figured they need a Steve 2.0 to take them forward!	You mean Smedley 2.0?"
"ok, so after 5 years and the baby, there was disconnect. Things like not sleeping at the same times, not even hardly talking. Just avoiding each other really	I'm not sure what you mean by not sleeping. Are you talking about the baby not being able to talk?"
"plenty lol. kicked them out long time ago. now with new wife of 5 years haha. but point is, i never cheated even during those 8 months of feeling alone, heck, BEING alone	Wow I didn't realize you had a wife. That must be nice"

"He's dating Kylie Jenner. Have you heard of her?	No. Is she attractive?"
"Justin Beiber.	Have anything to tell me about?	Not yet. You?"
"Oh wow, I can imagine. How old was it?	I think it was about 15 years old. A real rollercoaster ride of emotions."
"That's rough, but I'm sure you can get past that.	Starbucks always get's my order wrong!	oh really? are you going to dispute it?"
"They definitely are expensive. What's your favourite drink to get?	I love coffee so I would say that's a no-brainer! But I also love tea, lemonade, and watermelon!"
"I'm so happy for my son, went to his graduation from Harvard last week.	That's awesome! What did he study?"
"Thank you! Looks like there's going to be another Doctor in the family!	Who is that?"
"My pizza I bought fell all over the floor on my way home!	Oh man, that is a bummer.  What are you going to do?"
"The pizza was from my favourite pizza shop as well! Quite the sad moment.	What kind of pizza was it?"
"I was getting keys out of my pocket, and then WHAM, right on the floor. The pineapple slices were the first to fall on the floor.	Why does McDonalds always get my order wrong! I said no lettuce!	They just don't try to keep up with trends. People just don't appreciate a good burger anymore, so they won't try anymore."
"Sometimes I think the management don't even care!	Really? Why do you think that is?"
"I ate so much of my wife's cookies, but she shouldn't make them so irresistible.	haha oh no, is she mad?"

"Just my luck I step into a huge pile of dog mess...	Awww man that's terrible. Is it on your big break?"
"That is true, cow poop is much worst! But I was wearing brand new Gucci flip flops!	Were you wearing them outside? I've never had the pleasure of wearing Gucci flip flops outside. My feet get prettyaked easily when I walk outside."
"The key to making good chicken and rice, is following the recipe precisely	What's the key to making good rice?"

"Without prayer, I don't know if I would have passed that important test!	I am glad you passed because that is awesome!"
"It was a test in Numeracy, so counting 1 - 100. I've always found that difficult, but god made it possible!	Wow that is amazing. Did you not study for it?"

"had to hitch hike. made it on time for check in though. now the cars been in the shop 4 days, no progress. kinda getting worried about it	Oh wow, that is a long way to be on time! I hope you made it!"
"My son was just born, my first boy after 11 girls!	Oh my gosh. That's amazing. I have 4 boys and they're in their twenties. I can't believe how many little ones there are now."
"It's easier if you had 12 different baby mamas, that's my trick anyway. This last labour was 6 hours long!	I heard the same thing my mom did when she was in her early teens. Did you do anything extra special, like diapers?"
"Some times at night, I can hear some shouting ""AHHHHHHH"", ""HEE HEE"".	Oh no, what does that mean?"
"No, the spooky thing is... I think it's the ghost of Michael Jackson. I even saw him dancing to Billie Jean.	I bet you were dancing to the beat of your hat!"
"My best friend is doing 30 years in prison. I miss my good friend.	thats a long time"
"I can't visit him. I've had to flee the country. We were robbing banks together, and he got caught with half the cash. I'm currently in the Bahamas.	Oh wow. Where did you guys go? I've only seen photos of the Bahamas."
"My son worked for many years to be a footballer, he finally signed a pro contract!	Wow. That's great. Hope he does well for them."
"He's just joined Juventus. Can't be more happy for the lad.	He's a talented player, what team is he on?"
"4 months later he will be here. It has taken me around 3 months to save up enough money to be ready for him when he's born	Wow. You are a very impatient person. Do you have any children already?"
"yes it is. I am very happy	Good. How long have you been married?"
"only child for now. name is RAIDEN (god of thunder) :D	On my way home from work, a massive bat chased me!	Oh my! That must have been frightening."
"I know! This one was absolutely huge, almost human sized. Chased me for a whole hour. The more I think about it, it might have been the batman! I shouldn't have stolen those diamonds!	Oh no that is terrifying. Did you get hurt?"
"Every day I thank God for my blessings. I'd be in hole right now if it weren't for HIM	What a great person you are. How do you know he's there for you?"
"especially since he takes care of us even though don't deserve it	That's really sweet of him. Does he live with you?"
"Once during an important school sporting event, my entire sports team was counting on me but mid-way through my event, my shorts fell down and I tripped	Oh no! Did you end up on the floor?"
"yea! it was! I thought everyone would be annoyed at me but the next day when I went back to school, everyone just made it a joke so its alright. This was about 5-6 years ago now haha	That's awesome! Yeah, it's never to late to start making new friends!"
"I love youtube. been listening to all my classic tracks. Tupac forever	Omg. I was just listening to some of his stuff the other day. Such a great musician."
"I started out with one hit wonders but ended up at Pac. I miss my youth lol	Awwww, I bet that was a nostalgic experience for you. Have you seen ""The Ring""? I was thinking about that recently."
"When I was younger, my dog died. He was getting up there in age, but he was still on the young side. Later, we heard the pet food we had been feeding him had been recalled because of similiar fatalities.	That is sad news. When did you find out if he had died of old age?"
"No, they just had a recall. Apparently they didn't clean out their machines properly when making the food, so it got contaminated.	That is terrible, recall or not, it is highly unlikely that such a thing would happen in the US"
"Seeing people who have less than me just makes me so grateful for the blessings I have been given	It's good to feel grateful sometimes."
"absolutely! Always give to people who have less than myself :)	I appreciate that. Do you feel confident in your ability?"
"hiding for almost 2 years but I'm still not over my paranoia that one day I will have to pay for what I did. Don't ask what it was	Could it have been something drug related?"
"no way. I just pray she can forgive me. I could never admit to this sin. Jesus save me	It is very difficult for some to give up the good things in life. Have you been forgiven recently?"
"When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So, when he had his back turned, I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.	Oh no, I can imagine you feeling horrible after that. Did you end up apologizing to them?"
"Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.	Wow, I'm glad you had a plan to help you calm yourself down!"
"after she got her 1st job and new car, she started doing girls night out. Out until 3am one morning. I checked her chat history and sure enough she had kissed another guy >:(	hahahah yeah i am surprised she didnt do it to you"
"jealous isn't the one I felt. I wanted to rip her apart lol	Ah, well maybe you can borrow hers and then you can really rip her apart!"
"My dad always worked his ass off at a job he didn't like in order to support us, doing a lot of back breaking work as a caretaker. He even had a second job at Wal-mart for a while. I have no idea how he managed to do that sort of thing.	That must be mind boglin"
"Yeah, especially because we were single income. My mom homeschooled my brother and I. I think he took only a handful of sick days his entire time working, had something like 600 days saved up when he retired.	Wow! You can do pretty much anything with a little money saved up. What was it that he did?"
"I think he got 3 weeks a year, only used like 5 days.	Maybe he should take a break."
"my instincts are never wrong. I found out her lies when I checked her facebook chat history.	Oh, that's awful. I don't know what I'd do if my instincts were ever wrong. What did you do?"
"she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t-shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other. Made me so mad	That's awful, especially if you knew you were just going to see him. Did you confront her about it?"
"I never thought she would tell anyone and make it seem like I did something wrong. I didn't force her	Guess you were surprised huh"
"ye and so I had to leave the country because of her	Oh my, I hope you have a safe flight!"
"Public school really sucks sometimes. Making boys shower all together. I didn't want to but had to or else fail PE	I am sorry, I hope the were not to be taken for a dip"
"yes. Well it was a long time ago but I haven't forgotten	What was it that happened to you?"
"My mom homeschooled me when I was little. I was in public school till first grade, but after that I was homeschooled. Did take a semester in grade 11 though to make sure I was up to current standards.	That's pretty cool.  How far into the series were you?"
"Really? I didn't even know that was an option. Then again I'm 25 so it may not have been available then.	Well you saved some money I guess"
"I still haven't got over it. Brandon Lee RIP. I was 17 when I found out he died during filming. I visited the area he took his last steps a couple years ago	wow that is horrible, i can't believe people do that to each other"
"Now the remake is well on its way. Maybe it can lift this depression I feel if they stay true to the story. Jason Mamoa isn't bad looking	He is not bad looking in the slightest! He is a great actor and I would not change him for the world. I hope it happens."
"I had to adapt to life. I had to change to survive. Now I feel better	adapt or die"
"I am reminded every day that I can survive anything. A friend gave me a special bracelet (paracord)	thats cool. what kind of bracelet?"
"I recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years.	Oh goodness, that's terrible. Have you spoken to her or seen her in the past or has she been silent for awhile?"
"Very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way. It makes me think less of her as a person.	People are so easy to be angry and frustrated with these days. Is there something specific about what she did or why?"
"I was sucker punched when I was 17. The guy broke his hand and fled the scene. I saw him one time after this riding a bicycle but didn't do anything.	That sucks, did you get hurt?"
"I wasn't confident. Now I regret not punishing him.	What did he do to you?"
"I recently completed my masters degree in education at almost 40 years old. I feel really pleased with myself.	Wow! That is incredible!"
"Thanks! It was a huge challenge, and I'm SO glad to have it behind me!	What kind of challenges have you had?"
"Being a mom is great, too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks!	You're welcome! Yes, hopefully I'll still be able to teach my kids in the future. :)"
"I feel happy about the new house I have and that I can work from home. Thanks be to God	That's good!  I am glad that you are content with the home you have."
"It took me 9 months of determination and sacrifice. But worth it.	What did you do to get the determination?"
"I blamed myself for her fall because I wasn't close enough to prevent it. I took care of her for months afterwards.	She sounds like such a nice person!"
"I was distracted by the sound of running water.	Oh no! Did something happen to you?"
"I can't get enough of music today. Especially all my songs/bands from when I was in my twenties.	That is wonderful. I love listening to my old music. It brings back wonderful memories."
"Its true though, they can't make good music these days. Not in ANY genre.	I agree.  EDM became a huge industry only a few years ago."
"I get paid today and I'm getting this new game I've been waiting on to be released!	Hey, that's awesome! What game is it?"
"I'm thinking about getting FarCry 5. I pre-order for the early release! I'm really excited about it.	I am sure you will love that game"
"Hi, I joined a firm 6 months ago and then I got a promotion for Junior Manager	Well done, what was your role?"
"yes, They thought that I have some extraordinary talent and that is the reason I got that position	what position is that?"
"Maybe yes, Haha, Now I am looking for a Manager post and then become a senior manager	Well, you know your future, so maybe you will get that position."
"Hi, I have applied for a driving license thrice and I have failed in all the thee	Really? why did you fail?"
"Yes, I am a little uncomfortable driving backwards. I just can't do that.	Oh no! Are you turning or are you turning in the other direction?"
"every time I try not to hit that cone but those are so close.	Do you ever get a little squeeze of the squeeze button, and you know you've made it?"
"I still can't believe my life is where it's at, especially if you look at the past few years. I would never believe you if you told me I would be here.	Where are you now?"
"Well, for many years I was an alcoholic, working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!	What changed?"
"It does. I worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests, and I couldn't believe when I passed with flying colors!	Congratulations! It's always a great feeling when you accomplish something well."
"Yesterday, I was standing in a lift and a man next to me whispered in my ears that your zip is open.	Wow, I wish someone would say something like that to me! I think that is something only men say, but I could be totally wrong."
"It was just very creepy situation	What happened?"
"lol thats funny	My hubby lost his job a couple of months ago but he has an interview this friday so i pray he will get that job	I think he will.  Is it a big one?"
"armed security	Are you a good shot?"
"I stayed alone at night in a office due to excessive work and was much scared.	Oh. Was your work understanding? How did you manage?"
"no, I was on a 10th floor and security was down. I was scared even with a single noise.	Did the person scared you?"
"I have been awarded with a degree in marketing.	oh that sounds great, congrats"
"it took 4 years but at last got it	That's great. 4 years is a long time to be having kids!"
"Yeah,  I have  a job that I was looking for and now I am really enjoying my life.	Hey, have you ever been in a car wreck?	I haven't been in a car wreck, but I have been in a motorcycle wreck!"
"I was in one about 2 years ago. No one was hurt, but it totaled both of our cars.	Wow, that is terrible. I bet you were very scared."
"Have you everr been in a fist fight with anyone?	I certainly have. I once was embarrased as a child, but I have since moved past it. Have you?"
"I got in a fist fight with my step father once. It wasn't a fun experience as you can imagine.	Sorry to hear that. Did you win your fight?"
"Have you ever played and old video game called Everquest?	I have. I loved that game!"
"It came out in 1999. I used to play it when i was a teen. I installed it the other day and had a good time playing.	Nice! Would you consider playing it again now?"
"Have you ever eaten at Hardee's?	I haven't actually.  Why would you want to?"
"I like it too, but I'm not a big fan of their new sliders. They're so tiny, and just one of them cost almost 2 dollars!	Those new sliders are so much better than the ones from the old days."
"Have you ever had a sleep paralysis dream?	Yes, I nearly had one. I was so scared I would pass out!"
"Yeah, in mine I saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me. I've never been more scared in my life.	I know what you mean, what happened?"
"Have you ever rode on a roller coaster?	yes, at a amusement park."
"I hate riding them, but i used to machine components for their drive chain when I was a machinist.	Oh yeah i have heard that before too!!? It is always fun to get your hands on new parts!!"
"A while back my friend's boyfriend tried to get me to have an intimate relationship with him. He knew I had been married a very long time, as well as he was in a relationship with my friend. I turned him down flat, as I love my husband very much.	Well, he sounds like he's in the wrong crowd."
"Yes, I let him know that was wrong and disgusting. I couldn't believe he did it!	What did he do"
"Yes, as I am honest with him. But, I didn't want trouble.	I'm going overseas and I think I packed everything i need!	Where are you going?"
"Going to Kazakhstan. That's where i was born. My parents still live there and i miss them so much	I have never been, but i would love to"
"Hi, My girlfriend was recently let go of her job, but she put so much work in to finding a new job and got one with better pay!	Wow that sounds like she's a keeper."
"Yes I agree, she was so happy when she found out the job was hers	oh, what job is that?"
"She wasn't really fired, her position was no more. Schools don't have much room left for Home Ec teachers. Sad	Wow. Why don't they hire teachers from other schools?"
"Yeah she has a passion for teaching. These kids will be great to work with.	So about a year ago now, my girlfriend decided to surprise me with a puppy!	That's so cute! Was it a boy or girl?"
"Yes, so nice!! It was the best thing that could've happened! It's a German Shepherd!	It's beautiful, how old is he/she?"
"There was this one time I was fairly drunk at a bar and this attractive girl was trying to make moves on me, but I did my best to ignore it all.. Having a girlfriend and all.	I'm glad it worked out for you!"
"I was very proud definitely when I woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!	Sounds like a good achiever. What was your goal in life?"
"There was this one time my girlfriend and I had plans to meet a Longhorn steakhouse for a date.. She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.	I bet that was a bit uncomfortable"
"Yes, she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!	Aw, that's sweet, sometimes we get our moments, eh?"
"I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!	I know, right. It's been a long week already."
"i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long... but i'm a mom so i don't sleep in. ever	i feel you. My son also has a sleep schedule like me. You're not alone"
"I had to cancel a trip to see my brother after it started snowing heavily.	I hate snowing hard. Was it canceled completely or were you still stuck on the road?"
"Yes, when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous, and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.	Oh man! Are you always worried about that? I've never had any snow!"
"It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.	Where do you live?"
"When my parents got divorced when I was a kid, it was one of the hardest things for me.	Oh man I bet that was rough! Were you close to your parents?"
"It does definitely get easier over time I suppose.. Now that I see my life I guess it was for the best.	That's good! It really does get easier as you get older. At least for me it did."
"Just the other day my girlfriend and I were getting ready for the beach, but right before we left it started to pour rain.	That sounds like a rough scene... did you end up okay?"
"Well, when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!	That sounds nice, at least you got to go"
"There was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family.	Thats nice of her. You guys sound really excited."
"Yes, the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.	Wow! What a huge party! Where were you?"
"There was this one time I stole a shirt from my friend, and I feel pretty guilty about it.	I would imagine so.  Did you return it?"
"Because I really liked it, and didn't think he'd care.	Sometimes we are unable to anticipate the needs of our moment. It's nice to hear that he liked your gift."
"My girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week, I was very lonely during this experience.	I know how you feel, my friend. Why was it so lonely?"
"I mainly just played video games and watched tv.	what kind of games?"
"I moved to a new apartment and they didn't accept my dog breed, so I had to give her up. :(	Aw man, I'm sorry. Hopefully you find someone who does!"
"Because here in my area in Florida, there isn't too many options for me.	Right, maybe you should move there, then?"
"My mom doesn't have a ton of money, but last christmas she made sure to get me some awesome things!	That's very nice of her. It's very nice to be supportive of your family."
"She got me a brand new laptop I had been wanting for gaming!	That's awesome! What kind of laptop is it?"
"I went on this ride at the beach called the Slingshot.. It shoots you super high up in the air.. It was so teriffying, I had so much faith in the ride I wouldn't die!	That sounds like a fun ride! You must have been pretty brave getting on that!"
"It was seriously so scary, I almost pooped myself!	Oh no! What happened?"
"There was this time I went to the bar with my girlfriend and once I came out of the restroom, I saw her talking to some guy!	Wow! How did you react?"
"Well I get super jealous and angry of course.. But in the end it was just a work friend.. Oops!	Aw, sorry to hear that. I know that can make you angry! But I bet you're grateful for your friend, right?"
"My dog randomly got up on my couch last week, and just started peeing.. Like what!?!?!??!?!	Your dog are very lucky, I hope you take him to the vet to get checked out"
"Not since lunch, so it's actually been about 4 hours.. I hate living on the top floor!	That's not good! Do you have an app on your phone that tells you what your doing or do you have to do it manually every time you have to leave?"
"I finally graduated college last year, it felt like it took SO long!	That must have been a great feeling. It's always nice to get a degree."
"Yes, I am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!	Oh, what did you accomplish if I may ask?"
"My girlfriend saw me kissing another girl, who was kissing ME at the bar.. I was very drunk..	That had to be embarrassing. How did you end up in the other girls' underwear?"
"No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.	Action steps always work. You sound like a good person."
"There was this one time I was driving down the road, and this guy on a sports bike popped a wheelie.. It was so sick!	Did anyone get hurt?"
"I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!	Haha bikes are fun though"
"When i was younger, I came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead.	Oh no! I bet that was so heartbreaking.  What pet was it?"
"He was very old, so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!	He lived a good life? Tell me more!"
"My dog chewed a hole in my carpet 2 weeks ago.. I was very disgusted to say the least!	Did you have it cleaned?"
"Oh dang, I guess I can't complain too much then, that's brutal!	It really is, though. You have to have a lot of patience to take a beating like that."
"I have to go to confession at the church... i was a little mean to my mom, sometimes its difficult to be always nice	I am sure that you are being honest with your mother and taking the mother's feelings into account."
"Well yes when i shouted and i inmeaditelly apologize but i feel really bad	Apologize for what?"
"We walked, we ate ice cream, we rode a bike, we laughed a lot, we enjoyed the outdoors, we were exhausted	Sounds like a good time. Where did you go?"
"I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul	Oh. I'm sorry you had to go through that. It's hard to be in that situation and to watch your kids grow up and learn in that way. I hope your kids are going to grow up to be wonderful people."
"Sometimes one gives priority to work	The world is very beautiful	I think so too! What do you like about it?"
"Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice	People don't notice what?"
"People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life	I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.	I know the feeling. Who is your celebrity now?"
"Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself, is it?	Right? I always gave my husband the benefit of the doubt when I put him on the mantle, but I still felt really bad when I thought about it."
"As a kid, I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.	Tornadoes are pretty scary! Was it anything like that?"
"That's the thing -- NO! I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!	Well, now you know what it's like to not have any friends"
"My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said ""You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that."" For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)	That's wonderful and scary! I'm so glad it worked out in your favor."
"I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated, really.	I feel the same way sometimes. But I guess kids have to learn somehow"
"Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.	wow that is really deep. what have you learned so far though?"
"I do look at that as a strength, in anyone. Being able to say ""I'm sorry"" and ""I made a mistake.""	I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!	That sounds great! where did you guys end up going?"
"I highly, highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.	Yeah it's really tough to do, but it's great to hear people recommend it."
"i would fear my gift	What's Your gift?"
"my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me	I am glad you had a good phone. So, did you talk on it?"
"yes but its a valuable gift to me	Oh really? what is the gift?"
"yeah but this gift is definitely different for me	I have such an amazing husband! He works so hard so i could stay home with our baby	That is awesome. I bet he appreciates you being there for him."
"he is an armed guard	Who is that?"
"I have a pretty bad vision so i'm so scared to drive at night	Get some binoculars"
"yes, i even have glasses but because of astigmatism i don't see good at night even when i have glasses on	It's frustrating that it doesn't work out well for you. Do you wear glasses?"
"It seems like today everyone in the grocery store was in such a rush. Hurrying around!	It's always like that. Everyone wants to be in a hurry. Maybe they had important stuff?"
"Yes! They cut in front, and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it	That is rude and annoying! Did you say anything?"
"I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible	i know how that feels! i wish i could sleep with the baby on my side but i have to keep him awake during the day"
"i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible	I understand that. I went through that as well but now I feel so relaxed in life."
"I love being around them and it's great to see them each year.	Me too. It's like they grew up on me."
"O I'm sorry, my niece and nephews, only seem in the summer. Do you get company during the summer?	They visit during the summer."
"My kids are going into 7th and 8th grade in a couple weeks. They really are growing up well	I remember when my kids were in school. I loved those days."
"My oldest daughter has some learning disabilities so I'm really proud of how she is doing. They're both growing up so fast	Yeah, kids grow up way too fast! That is really amazing that she is learning and developing so quickly!"
"i paid all my bills today, i feel so relived and good	That is a wonderful feeling.  It is good to have money in the pocket."
"rent and electricity. we've been struggling financially so it's such a relieve to pay bills	I hear you. We have been in that predicament before."
"I studied so hard for my bar exam so that I could become a lawyer. I prepared for almost 3 months straight!	wow thats crazy"
"I did pass! It was a rough 3 months, but once I got there, I felt like I was ready.	Congrats! Hard work always pays off."
"I was about to book a flight for my baby and i and i was so surprised to find out i didn't need to pay for my baby'sticket	Wow. Where did you find out?"
"i know! now i can spend the rest of the money on something cool	What are you planning on spending the money on?"
"my husband called me a punk today for no reason. and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn't even understand why	That is not good. How did you respond?"
"no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes	Who can be a punk? What happened?"
"When I was younger, I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive, because i didn't want to get into an accident.	im scared to drive as well, but i believe in god i'll be cool and make tons of money in no time"
"I tried to tell myself that, but my dad got into a really bad accident once, and it has scared me ever since.	Oh no! Did he get hurt badly?"
"I recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches.	How long do you think that will take you to do that?"
"Yea, i put them in a glass of water for a week or two and they grow their own roots, wasn't expecting much.	That is wild. Were they bugs?"
"I do yes! and since the method i used is working, i have tons of tomatoes!	You are so right. It is satisfying to eat tasty tomatoes."
"Around town it seems like traffic has been horrible lately. Driving around town is just crazy.	Yea, traffic is pretty awful where I live.  I'm glad it's better now though, since I was getting ready to leave work."
"Yes, exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!	Were you pulled over for speeding or for hitting someone?"
"A few years ago, I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other, so we met up in person!	That sounds fun! I used to play Warcraft on my own as a Horde character."
"I'd say it's going pretty well, we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?	On a cruise! But I call dibs on the first lady, lol. How did you meet your friends?"
"OKay. I care for everyone	You care for everybody, but you care about me?"
"Thanks, I hope I am. You sound like one too	What sort of qualifications do you have to be a social worker?"
"because you gave me a compliment, which I feel is a genuine one	I recently had a one night stand with a woman from my past. It caught both of us off guard	Oh my gosh! How did it happen?"
"Yes, it was a very interesting time. I wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations	That's unfortunate, but understandable. What did you talk about?"
"My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!	Oh wow, you must be so proud of her!"
"She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.	I do agree with that. Having a degree really opens doors for you."
"I walked my dog outside, and she still pooped in the house! Ugh.	Did you discipline her?"
"Yeah...Even though I take her outside, 10 minutes later, she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?	Ugh, sounds like dog poop. I would have a talk with her"
"I think being with my husband makes me a better person	Does he do things for you that make you feel better?"
"Definetly, he's my best friend forever.	That's awesome. It sounds like he has a great heart!"
"I really don't like when things happen when noone is home.	I know what you mean. I hate that too."
"Like stuff falling off shelfes because a dog runs into them! Hah, crazy I know.	That's funny! Well they do have droolingholes in them so hopefully that will stop that!"
"I really love my life right now.	Thats good to hear! Any special reason?"
"Nothing really! I just love that I can work at home and have time to clean or cook whenever I want.	What do you do for work?"
"Right? And no having to interact with others unless we choose too.	Yea and no one teaches you manners or respect."
"So i just got home and all of my friends were there for a birthday party i have no clue! can you imagine my reaction?	No, I can't imagine. Where was it?"
"Well the party was for me, hahaha they really got me on that one!	I bet it was fun for you. Did they have good food?"
"Its not fun being reminded of things you've forgotten.	Oh no, have you flashbacks or something?"
"Owed money to my mother in law for something, $15, she reminded me in a less then nice way.	Wow, that must've been a surprise for you."
"Exactly, especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.	I went to San Antonio the other day, was great to see that city.	I haven't been to San Antonio in a long time, I'm sorry to hear that it was nice."
"O really? What's your favorite thing there?	The food court.  I love eating there."
"I just got back from my graduation! can you imagine after 5 years i graduated with the highest score of my college in the past 20 years!	Congrats! It is truly an amazing experience"
"Yes! i studied so hard, can you imagine how i feel? i cannot believe it!	I'm sure you will do well. What made you want to study so hard?"
"I hate the sight of someone throwing up. My nephew did that the other and day and man.	I know the feeling. Did you throw up after or just run around it?"
"Yea, he had eaten to much sugar and well, it didn't end well	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that.  My parents have been like that, too. What are you going to do?"
"I came home from work and step barefoot on one of my sons legos, i was so pissed!	Oh no! Did you ask him why he did it?"
"Yes, i was so mad i always tell them to pick the toys up.	What did you do?"
"My mother in law got to eat Qdoba today, one of my favorite places I haven't had in awhile	That sounds delicious! What do you like from there?"
"No way. queso all the way! They don't have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did.	I love queso,  What is your favorite thing about it?"
"Yesterday i watch on tv a kid who could speak 4 different languages at age 3, i was in shook!	That is incredible. Do you know what languages he was trying to speak?"
"Well they are called wonder kids! i was in wonder, i also read about one who just graduated from college at age 11	Are you a wonder kid yourself?"
"My husband is quite impressive to me.	Oh really?! What sort of things has he done that make you so impressed?"
"Yea, he's become the best manager in his market in just 3 years.	Awesome, what market is that?"
"This afternoon i went to my sons soccer game and he scored three goals! happiest dad ever!	You must be so proud and he is lucky to have your son in your life."
"Yes! i love him so dad, but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play, he dedicated the three goals to me!	You deserve it! You sound very talented."
"I was doing a presentation for work, and tried to tell a story about something kind of related to break the ice.  No one laughed or even really cracked a smile, so it put me off for the rest of the presentation.	Ah well at least you tried! Maybe next time you can surprise them with a good story."
"Yeah, and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking, but at least should have gotten a chuckle.	It's not what you think it is, the truth is quite hard to stomach sometimes."
"My wife went to Germany to attend a language course at the end of June.  I've been mostly spending time with my dogs while she's been gone since we recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	That's pretty cool. Have you met anyone in Germany other than your wife?"
"That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me, I should look into that.	There is! You can find dogs and hang out with them!"
"Something I did not expect from a neighbor, this morning he gave me some beautiful flowers	That is nice. What did you plant?"
"It was a nice gesture on his part. But I do not know	I think the proper term is ""symmetrical""."
"But beyond that. Small gestures make others' lives happier	My neighbor has a really annoying little dog that she always brings outside when she's smoking.  It barks constantly at everything and she doesn't try to keep it quiet.	You should have a talk with her."
"A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically, but this one is just terrible.	Did you take it outside?"
"This morning my husband received a call, he got nervous, I think it was a woman ... difficult	Oh no, did the callers read your husband's emotions? Did you confront him about it?"
"I think so ... I'm a little worried, because of the situation	What situation are you in?"
"Thank you for your solidarity	I have a great picture from my wedding where my friends and I are in a circle having a shot, makes me want to go hang out with them again.	That sounds like fun!  Do you guys not get together as much anymore?"
"Yeah, we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to Graduate school.	What does she study?"
"Yesterday, a difficult day, the anniversary of the death of my mother	I'm so sorry to hear that. You must be really upset."
"Thank you for your solidarity	Thank you for your support"
"seven years .... I miss her	I went for an interview for a job I really wanted and ended up waiting a long time before I heard anything.  I managed to keep my spirits up for a good long while.	That is no good at all. Did they interview you at a different place?"
"I did actually!  It's a good job, especially since the market where I am isn't great for my field.	That's great. What field do you work in?"
"My daughter is angry with me, she says she does not need me, because I scolded her	What did she do to scold you?"
"She is 9 years old but she is a very focused girl	Sounds like a smart girl! How did you land her?"
"that's right ... but I think I've surpassed	Hello, tomorrow I have the cooking test and I feel safe. I am sure that I will approve with an excellent rating	Good luck!  I hope all goes well.  What is the test for?"
"have my own restaurant	Good for you. Have you been cooking for yourself?"
"with work, effort and clarity in the goal ... I will surely arrive	I'm so happy i made enough money yesterday to pay my bills!	Haha, yea? That's good! It's hard to do that sometimes. What did you get done?"
"yes, such a relieve!	What did you relieve yourself from?"
"Sometimes we have angels, called friends, I'm happy because God sent me mine	Really? That is so awesome, did he do it for you personally or through an outside source?"
"We are 12 years old, but we have had difficult moments, but we have overcome it	Oh, bless you. What has overcome you?"
"That's right ... I'm happy	my son behaved badly with his friend, I treat him badly, I had to punish him	Sometimes it is just difficult to sit back and watch your friend get actions from a person you don't know well. It takes a while for people to develop the courage to do that."
"He is 12 years old, but he must understand that friendship is something sacred	I agree, that is an extremely precious thing to have in a person. I wish I could be that carefree and youthful"
"he hit him and said a bad word	When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. It was so fucking annoying	Was he going to get a job at the company he worked for at the time?"
"I do my best but sometimes that's super hard. I guess that's just one of those things everyone got to deal with.	I know what you mean. It's a tough skill to have to have."
"You too, thank you!	I went to a job interview a few days ago, and I feel like I totally rocked it!	congrats!! what kind of job is it?"
"Thanks a bunch! It pays much better than my current job, so I really hope I do, but I think I got it in the bag.	Awesome, what field do you work in?"
"I went through some of my old stuff yesterday, and I found my security blanket that I used when I was a kid!	awww that's so sweet!!!  I bet it brought back memories"
"It really did. It kinda made me sad, because it was all tattered and dirty. I ended up washing it.	It's amazing how dirty and tangled a clothes can be after being washed."
"You know, I see all the back to school shopping and I think parents have their priorities mixed up.	Yep, I've been doing the same thing. My son has been getting ready for year two and has already started making his own clothes."
"Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor.	Ah, i get it, parents worries shouldn't be based off looks alone. But then again it's parents..."
"I found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road, and I nursed him back to full health. Poor thing.	Oh wow, that is so kind of you! I love animals"
"I did! His name is Alphy.	Is that your middle name?"
"It's hard as a parent, when your kids are teenagers and have to handle their own problems	I completely understand, I have siblings and know how hard that can be. What kind of problems do they have?"
"I know, they mommy in me wants to just jump in and fix it all like I used to	You can tell she is frustrated with you. Just give it time and it will go better"
"My wife called me this morning and told me she scored a new job with Microsoft!	Congrats! That is awesome."
"She is so excited. She's even making more than I am.	wow, that is great, she must be very proud of herself."
"I felt bad my dogs ears have been bothering him. We had to finally take him to the vet yesterday.	Oh no. I hope it's nothing serious."
"Yeah, it was ear mites and he got medicine for it. You can tell he isn't feeling good from side effects so I've been babying him.	Medicine? Medicine for what? Medicine for what? Medicine for what? Medicine for what? Medicine!"
"I bought a chocolate bar for my wife at the store, and I was going to give it to her, but I ended up eating it...I feel bad.	I know how you feel, I do that all the time. Did you end up giving it back?"
"lol I didn't tell her...Should i?	Why not? You seem like a nice person"
"Don't you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn't do? My boss got mad at me for someone else's mistake.	I do. I get mad at my coworkers too."
"Yeah, that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.	i hate when they do that, they sound like they are getting worse every day"
"I'm taking a vacation and going on a cruise to Alaska next week!	Sounds awesome! I've never been on a cruise before, have you?"
"I've never been, so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.	Oh no im sorry to hear that! Hopefully its raining and nice out there?"
"Hello, I think I will not forget the beauty of her hair, the sweetness of her lips and the clarity of her eyes	Whoa! That's quite the compliment. Do you have a beautiful wife too?"
"she died ... my mother	Who did? Sorry to hear that."
"It is true...	Hello, I never imagined the violence that can unleash a dog attacking a bird ... I was impressed	What kind of dog is it? Is it a big one that acts tough or a tiny one that needs lots of love?"
"in a big dog ... in the park	... I was scared"
"I did not have the strength to control it	My poor neighboor is suffeing a lot without her husband	That's terrible.  Do they have a good support system?"
"He passed away from cancer.	I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my father in cancer, so I know how you feel."
"I enjoyed my day the other day, found out something good! Newphew may come to live with us for ayear.	Wow that's awesome! Congratulations! That sounds exciting."
"11, he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.	How come? Do you not like him?"
"I lost something of my mother in laws the other day, I feel so bad.	Oh no! What was it?"
"I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear, it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!	What is she going to do with it?"
"I may do that!	I was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award	Was it for your work on the project?"
"Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for	Oh cool! What work are you referring to?"
"I appreciate that. Thank you	Wow! Congrats on your new job! I can understand why you are apprehensive, but it sounds like a good opportunity.	Thanks a lot. I am apprehensive because it is something I never had before. And yes, it is a good opportunity!"
"No problem! Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.	What do you mean? everything in life is always going to be okay if you believe in it!"
"I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!	Nervous about what exactly? Were you nervous because you were unprepared?"
"I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?	Yes I have. It was rough. How do you feel about it?"
"It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!	I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.	I totally understand your point. Some people are just plain bad."
"It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.	That's awful! Did you ask her if she was OK, or did you just leave it up to the imagination?"
"I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.	Have you thought of getting a mic?"
"Well, for the most part it's my family. My husband, kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!	Oh, well that's a different experience I guess. But I'm glad you're being nice to them and doing what you can to make them feel better!"
"My daughter is a teenager now so we don't spend as much time together as we used to.	Thats really sad. I remember when my daughter was a teenager."
"Yeah, luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.	That sounds like fun!"
"I'm really looking forward to this trip I have planned next week.	Sweet. Where you going?"
"I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.	Where are the national parks?  I haven't been to the parks in ages."
"I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend, and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.	That's disgusting. She will be careful next time."
"It WAS. Since she was wet, the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.	She might be stressed out from the humid weather?"
"Been having a good day, relaxing on my couch watching Netflix. I got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap.	Awww I love cats. I have a dog that likes to cuddle with me."
"Yeah, it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.	That's sounds like a good plan."
"I had a job interview yesterday. I was really nervous before it started.	Job interviews always make me a little anxious. Did you handle it well?"
"It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room, then we took a lab tour afterwards.	How did you find the lab? Did you find it scary?"
"i am very faithful	That is good to hear, it is always nice to have people you can trust"
"yes my behavior refereed to people	People are people too you know."
"thank you	What did you say to me?"
"nothing	did you do something?"
"thank you	what for?"
"nothing	I'm sorry, what are you trying to find?"
"i am going to garden	good luck with that."
"thank you	thank you?"
"It was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake	What mistake did they make?"
"placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it, so they gave me something else without telling me	What was it?"
"Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen	They will when they see your case. It takes a strong case to get a ticket taken off your car."
"I really was distraught	Oh no. What happened?"
"yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok	That's a shame. Maybe you can find a new store to store your organic groceries."
"it made me proud he was my rep	What rep did you have?"
"the president represented us at this association	It is good to have people you can count on.  Who are you hoping for to get re elected?"
"International Ceramic trading	It has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation. No one to talk to.	I hope you feel better soon."
"I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.	I know what you mean, having company when you don't feel like it."
"I can't wait to travel south to get my favorite take out. Can't find it here.	What do you love about your hometown?"
"About an hour. But it'll be worth it.	Why an hour?"
"I'm quite happy with where I live. I have 3 swimming pools to use anytime I want and also a gym.	Nice! That makes me feel good about my life too. I need to get a pool as well!"
"Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.	Aww, you must be lonely. At least you are the only single person that cares about your well-being here."
"I have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing.	That sounds like such an amazing experience!"
"It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up, go to work, etc. but I was wrong about that!	What happened?"
"Yes, last week. Thank you!	It was a long 3 weeks but I'm so happy it's over and she's back now	I can't wait to get the house clean after we got her!"
"She went to visit her family	Where did she go?"
"It was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother	I'm sorry. Losing parents is very hard."
"Thank you for your solidarity	Thank you, glad to hear people are supporting me"
"thanks	We knew she was pregnant, but didn't know the gender yet. Imagine my shock when I saw the ultrasound for the gender!	Wow! Did you two have a great time trying to figure it out?"
"Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met	Ah well that's different then."
"Even though there are plenty of flirts around, I remain loyal to my wife.	I understand. You love her no matter what."
"It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one, which was 5 years ago now.	Are you still going strong?"
"My friend got a new truck, I'm really envious of him.	What kind of truck is it?"
"I agree, if I work hard I could buy that truck.	True. It is not hard to get something like that especially if you have the means."
"I should, I just need the drive to get out there and do it. I need to stop wasting money.	Hello, I feel that today is going to be a wonderful day .... I will enjoy it	Why do you say that"
"If I really like to be positive, despite the difficulties	What are some things you do to be positive?"
"so it is ... a big hug	I have been looking after my wife this week. She has the flu	That's unfortunate. Is she feeling better?"
"It seems so. Sleeping all day today lol	Lol, well, at least you're productive"
"This morning and I saw a tree, I never detailed it, but this time I saw it beautiful ... I realized God exists	Oh wow, It's always nice to have things like that to remember when you visit"
"I gave thanks in spite of the difficulties	That's nice. It's good to be grateful sometimes"
"thank you for your comments	Today I realized that my daughter sings wonderful, I enjoy it a lot ... I was impressed	You must be very proud of her. That is awesome."
"she is 9 years old ... she is a nice girl	What makes her a nice girl?"
"that's right ... thanks for your comment	Hi, I feel bad because I've realized that I do not love my husband, but I do not have the courage to tell him	Oh no, how come?"
"You're right	So what's going on?"
"thanks	I'm looking for a new job, and I'm feeling pretty good about my options.	Great. What sort of job are you hoping for?"
"There's a lot of openings for tech jobs lately, especially technical support.	That does sound good.  Will you be a candidate for one?"
"My wife just went out of town for school for 2 months.  I don't really know anyone here, so I don't know what I'm going to do while she's gone.	Maybe you should try going out to meet new people?"
"I'm sure it is great for her, but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.	What are you unsure about?"
"Hello, I made a serious mistake. I made a comment without bad intentions of the elders. I related them to the dinosaurs, and my father heard it ... he looked me in the eyes ... and he told me that you too could be one of them ... I felt bad	That is a great story! How old are you today?"
"yes, but I feel like a cockroach	That's no good. Have you tried any treatments?"
"thanks	I'm supposed to be on a diet, but I couldn't help myself and I ate three chocolate bars.	hahaha hey it's okay to break a diet sometimes, it's healthy!"
"But I'm supposed to be on a diet! I can't lose weight if I have no self control :(	True true. Well then stay motivated and you'll even begin to see results"
"my husband lost his job a couple of months ago and yesterday he finally got a new job!!	Congratulations! I am so happy for you and his new job."
"He is such a hard working man! He works so much so i could stay home with our baby	He sounds like a nice guy. I wish I had children."
"I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.	I hate that!  That must have been so frustrating.  Did you end up taking the nap?"
"Ugh, that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.	I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  I hope it doesn't get worse."
"I lost my favorite hoodie somewhere. I'm so upset. Like how could i lose a hoodie? it's so big, did i just leave it somewhere?	Maybe you should return it and see if there is another owner?"
"I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it	What places?"
"I'm going to see my parents in 3 weeks!! I didn't see them since 2014! I'm so excited	That's aweseome! My parents are coming to visit me too. Hopefully it's not just because my mom needs time to heal up."
"no, with my little baby. they've never met my son, they can't wait	That sounds stressful."
"My wife had been out of the country for 2 months for school.  I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.	That's awesome, was she well?"
"Yeah, it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	Have you been out there long? How's the weather?"
"I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.	Oh wow, thats a crazy time to be out there. Did you talk to them about it?"
"No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.	That is disappointing. Maybe they should think about putting smoke alarm on your car."
"Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!	my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing	Wow that must have been a pretty bad experience for you. How did you feel after?"
"she did, she didn't say anything but i know she heard it	Who was she?"
"My girlfriend went on a week trip with her friends, and left me alone to fend for myself.	Where did she go? Is she coming back?"
"Mostly been playing video games, but it's so boring without her.	I can understand that. It is quite sad to be alone."
"Hello ... I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not, the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth	Thats good"
"For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it	That's great! How long ago was this?"
"for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible	i think you are over complicating things, if that's what you're saying"
"condition the mind and spirit	mind and body"
"I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.	That is tragic. I am so sorry to hear that."
"yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort	I am praying works too!"
"I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some.	I had plans to move from Florida to California, but I'm starting to get cold feet...	Can you cancel them?"
"Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.	I'm sure you will find out soon if it is better or not. Don't rush."
"today I think today is a day to learn, to hug, to smile, to make someone happy	I think you are on to something. today is a good day to learn something new."
"that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that, to my children I kiss them, my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something	that's such an important thing to your kids to learn"
"It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile	I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends, no husband, no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life	My biggest fear is loneliness.  I'm so sorry you are going through this."
"not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward	I think video games help you socialize, if anything at all."
"My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.  I can't wait to go pick her up at the airport!	Well I hope she gets back soon!"
"I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.	She got stuck in a traffic jam, unfortunately"
"Germany for a language immersion course.	I am so thrilled to be able to go on a short but long overdue vacation	Where are you headed to?"
"A short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water.	Sounds like fun. How long will you be staying for?"
"Down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks. It is around the current river	I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.	That would really stink! Did you end up going with someone else?"
"Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.	That is strange, did you say anything to her about it?"
"I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.	How did it happen?"
"The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.	That's cool"
"Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.	how was your day?	It was good how was your day?"
"yeah good. whats your name?	Sonia"
"oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend	hello how was your day?	It was great how did you do?"
"yeah fine great day	So how is it going?"
"yeah nice to talk to you.	I wore wrong pair of socks to the college. But, no was there to spot it. But, when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes. At, that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes. They made a fun of me. That was very awkward situation.	You got me there! Wow that sounds like a tough situation. How did they make fun of you?"
"My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.	Oh wow. I bet that was a tad bit messy."
"ohh	I went for a job interview, and it seemed to go pretty well.	How do you think it went?"
"It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.	Are you worried at all?  Do you have any big plans?"
"I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.	Well it is good that you are getting out of your area so soon."
"Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.	That can be tough.  Do you think you are ready?"
"I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.	wow, thats a long time to stay"
"Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.  We just moved recently and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	Dogs are so relaxing! You should get out and meet some new people."
"Germany for a language course.	I almost got in a fight in a drive-thru lineup.	Was it over something stupid?"
"No, the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.	Wow, I would have been furious!"
"Yes, afterwards I regretted the confrontation.  I thought I could have easily been shot.	I got on a stranger's boat by accident at the marina.	That is terrible."
"Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off, but I sure felt stupid about it.	Oh no! How long ago was this?"
"Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.	I was looking at old pictures from my first ""adult"" apartment, and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates.	Those good times must have been really bittersweet."
"It can, but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore, but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.	I understand where you are coming from. Being young and having no responsibilities can be very stressful at times."
"Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to. I was in a house full of people screaming and yelling.	did something happen?"
"My friend and her mom were fighting about money, and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.	Did you call your mom to tell them that?"
"I hope so too. I plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this.	I had a job interview today and i think it really well.	Nice, I hope you get it!"
"The interviewer told me that I was his favorite interview so far. And I think my qualifications are a really good match for the company.	That's cool, do you like the interviewer a lot?"
"I saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so I called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog, but it turned out I was wrong.  Whoops.	Haha, it happens! What kind of dog do you have?"
"Yeah, I don't like calling people out in general, don't know what made me think to do it this time.	You must have felt a bit guilty for something you did."
"I'm surprised the police are going to let they get away with it.	What happened?"
"I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.	Oh no! Have you called the post office to complain?"
"My test results come back today. I do hope everythings ok.	I hope they come back and you did well"
"I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.	Is everything okay now? I hope you are feeling better!"
"Absolutely! I'm just over-worrying because I've always been so healthy. Just a little stressed out.	I went back to my home where I grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me. I had so many fun times with my best friends when I was a child.	I love when that happens, so many good memories!  Are you planning to go back again?"
"Playing outside in the summer time. Many fun summer times. Swimming holes, icecream, catching fireflies.	Wow, summer's been a wonderful time of year for me. I love going out and just enjoying nature. How often do you get to go?"
"Me too!	My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.	You must be excited and relieved! What kind of car is it?"
"Thanks, now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.	Real estate can be exciting, what are your plans?"
"The more problems I have to deal with, the more faith, and faithful I become. I am stronger in my faith when bad things happen in my life and around me.	that's really good you have a positive attitude about it. you're a kind person"
"I was told once by a dear departed friend that ""what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt.	thats so true"
"yeh to that	I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well, but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.	Dang that stinks. What field do you work in?"
"I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.	that bad huh"
"I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.	I am jealous of them for sure, but it is because they are way better at what they do and I feel like a better person for doing their job better."
"You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.	I did. He was promoted to a Lieutenant in the Navy. I was just trying to be helpful."
"Okay, I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.	I just got a puppy, but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.	Pets are good companions. It's understandable. Dogs are another matter entirely though."
"Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.	Ah, well that makes sense. If you're keeping a TV on him, he might run off."
"Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.	Stealing is wrong. What happened?"
"If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.	What do you mean?"
"My dog disappeared while I was away at college.	Did you find him?"
"My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.	Oh no.  I hope she wasn't hurt."
"Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.	I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!	How old is she?"
"Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby.	Well if you guys are going to go that far, might as well just get it over with and start over."
"Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors!	Oh no lol I thought you said Oh yes! and I was about to be very nervous"
"Oh cool! What kind of doctor?	My own. I have fibro and I've been seeing a doctor for about a month now."
"Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.	I am!  I've never been so self-employed before!  Naturally, I put a lot of work into her polishing and decorating the house.  And she did great with the money she was making!"
"My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.	That's great. What is her major?"
"I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.	I bet that was sad. Do you know if he was thanking God for his luck?"
"Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.	I'm sorry you are miserable. Maybe the bad bosses are giving you bad instructions."
"A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.	That must have been quite a nuisance. I am sorry for that."
"No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.	Is your neighbor a nice person then?"
"I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.	was he famous for a reason?"
"She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.	She seems like a nice person tho"
"Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.	Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!	I know what you mean, I'm right there with you! Life can be hard sometimes"
"Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!	I guess so. I think it's because we were peaceful and didn't have to worry about money."
"That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.	Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time, but now I worry that they will come back.	Did they damage anything?"
"Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.	Oh no! That can be annoying. Was it difficult to replace?"
"I woke up this morning, and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.	OH no! That is horrible! Did you get it back?"
"I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.	you and me both"
"I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well, but I guess not.	That sucks, I've been there before. Just keep trying, and I'm sure you'll land something soon."
"Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.	Good, what kind of jobs have you applied for?"
"Last week, my pants fell down in gym class. The elastic strap holding them up broke.	Oh no! Were you able to fix it?"
"I ran out of the gym crying, and the whole class pointed and laughed.	im sorry to hear that!"
"I love my cat, but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.	Oh no! I know that feeling, mine has caused me to become very irritable as well."
"She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles.	I would just keep walking, that is not nice"
"I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!	Sounds exciting! Where are you going?"
"We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to, and we will be seeing the ocean as well!	Wow, I hope they won't take advantage of you."
"I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.	Oh no! Well that's terrible if it happens at a friend's house! Hopefully you don't feel ashamed at all and can make it up to them."
"Yes, it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.	Have you been treated for it?"
"I won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy, proud	What was the prize?"
"It was for a chess competition.	How do you think you did in the end?"
"They gave a cash money of 200$. Isn't that cool? Have you won any?	I have a coworker that will not stop talking. He mostly talks about himself	Uhoh. That's definitely worrisome. Have you tried talking to your manager about it?"
"Yes, it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people, but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.	Yes. That is especially annoying.  What happened?"
"I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.	Oh no. What was in it?"
"Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be, so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting, I guess.	I know the feeling, it's like they pull out a month or two before the actual release date!"
"I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around, and people laughed at me.	oh no, what happened next!?"
"That is good advice. I feel better about this.	Yeah, it's good that you're willing to take chances in life."
"I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.	That's good. How long had it been since?"
"It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week, not 20 years ago.	Thats sounds bittersweet"
"I just saw the craziest thing! A baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!	That is crazy! What was the dog doing?"
"She couldn't have been older than one!	WHAT?!? Are you insane? That's absolutely crazy. Why did you think that?"
"I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly, it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do, even though I put my best work and most effort into it.	I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe it just wasn't meant to be."
"It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.	How has the revamp been going?"
"That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!	I'm worried that if my Aunt doesn't answer her phone, I won't be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend.	Why would she need to answer your phone?"
"Yes, I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.	Aw, that's no fun. Hopefully his aunt is more understanding than you thought!"
"I am always suffering due to lack of money and I wish I could be rich someday	It will come someday. Just keep working at it and you will be there before you know it!"
"That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks	What are some tasks that you do?"
"ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair	I agree and it feels even worse when they don't have it good. Do they not realize how unfair it is?"
"That is so true. But to lead a happy life, money is necessary to some extent.	I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.	I'm so sorry! Is it far away you can't go?"
"Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere.	Are you in the mine field?"
"I feel sorry for me too!	oh why is that?"
"They are very helpful and I always will be faithful to them	That's good to hear! I'm very close to my wife as well."
"Yes, what about you? Do you feel likewise?	Well, I feel guilty for once for getting drunk."
"Do you follow any particular denomination?	I'm so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend. I was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up	That is wonderful that you have a good friend like that."
"yes, and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money	Good for her! How did she help you?"
"I saw this kid on a skateboard the other day.  I thought he was gonna wipe out hard, but he pulled off some kind of multi-flip jump thing that really shocked me.	Multi-flip is a really cool trick, learned it in middle school, super fun to watch!"
"I know, right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid, made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line, never managed to do anything else.	I had the same problem. You just have to keep at it and believe in yourself."
"I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!	I'm proud of you! I've never said that but I've heard it before."
"I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them	I definitely agree."
"I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(	Oh I bet! I am sure there must be a special plan you could try."
"I know he will, i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky	Maybe you could give him some benadryl and give him some of that crazy crazy crazy energy."
"I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.	That's scary! Were either of them okay?"
"Yeah, I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one, but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.	Oh no! Well it looks like neither side got hurt."
"I just recently finished potty training my dog, that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.	Oh my gosh! I am so afraid of training my dog! What did you use to clean up the mess?"
"I can imagine a rescue, generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get, can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!	I can imagine it can be! What breed is your dog?"
"My dog started looking really sick and in pain, but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet, so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.	Oh no!  Was the dog okay?"
"Yeah, he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing, but he got medicine and rest and is good now.	Oh that's good to hear.  It's always good when a pet is feeling better and better"
"I was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life. It was great . You ever have any of those moments?	I certainly have.  I love that feeling.  What was the coffee like?"
"I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?	Yes, I love seeing humming birds too! They are so cute."
"Oh I can agree with that completely!	I interviewed for a job a while back that I was waiting on hearing about.  I felt like it went well.	It's always good to get a feel for what everyone's got. Did you get the job?"
"A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!	That's awesome!  I love labs at universities because the students love to interact and have fun.  Have you worked with them before or is this new?"
"Have you ever had to file for disability?	I haven't - do you?"
"I've had to recently. Its been really tough.	That's tough!  What's going on?"
"Do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?	When they're little and they have no idea what you're talking about, yeah. But then they grow up and become somewhat competent."
"My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first, but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.	Oh I've never tried that, is it good?"
"I've had to help take care of others before as well.	thats nice of you"
"Yeah, I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.	Oh no. That is no good. I am so sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better!"
"I failed my driving test twice, but I was really encouraged and did better the next time.	Good for you.Dont be afraid to pass.One time i failed twice and im ashamed but im keeping at it."
"I agree, I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.	I agree, being a determined and skilled person is extremely hard to come by unprepared. It's a great feeling when you accomplish something in spite of not being prepared or unable"
"I once went a restaurant, and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen!	Ew, yeah that is no fun! Did you call the restaurant?"
"I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out, how can a place like that operate!?	I bet you were, i would be too"
"Do any of your kids play any sports?	yes some do. They play football also. How about you?"
"My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.	That sounds so fun! How old is she?"
"I was so late for work one day, I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!	Oh my, how did you manage to do that? I am sure no one noticed."
"I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on, I was so in shock, even the neighbors saw. It was bad.	i hate it when that happens"
"I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.	That's a long line"
"The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.	It's ridiculous, isn't it? Why can't they just be good and help everyone out instead of hiring bad people?"
"I was so excited when I got my new puppy, it was awesome!	Oh I love puppies. What breed was it?"
"I agree with you, the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions, positive ones of course!	I agree, its exciting to see a new face. I wish the kids happy lives."
"Those were simpler times, I wish I could go back and relive those days!	I know right. Life is a lot more confusing now."
"Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.	Good memories for sure"
"It was great, so much time running around outside without a care in the world.	I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child.	Aw, that's wonderful!  Was it for a contest or a school project?"
"My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest, was the one that released the most gas.	that is some imagination. i really wish i had more time to do that with my project"
"I'm sleep training my toddler, he never slept in his crib before. He is crying and it makes me feel so bad	Crib training is really hard! Kids always seem to want to take off running in their sleep."
"how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry	Oh no that is so sad, how did you cope?"
"I just got back from my vacation. We stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there, it was so much fun! We really had a blast!	i wish i could afford a place like that"
"It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years, due to personal reasons, so you can imagine how we felt when we went!	I bet. I have 3 kids and a husband so it's especially hard to not take them on vacations."
"As I look at my 21 year old son, I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!	Thats awesome! I cant wait to see my son grow up, 18 and change"
"Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.	I can imagine he was ecstatic! What a wonderful day that must have been!"
"I want to go on a vacation next month but now I cant.	That is sad. Did you already make plans?"
"Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.	Thats terrible. Maybe they should hire more people."
"My son is in his last year of college! We are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!	Congratulations! Does he have aced his last year?"
"He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.	Wow! That's an engineering achievement for sure.  You sound like an engineering student myself!"
"We took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!	That's great to hear! I bet your nervous about the appointment making it to the doctor though."
"I hope so. Do you have any kids?	I do not. I hope to have kids in the future but I have been very busy."
"I went to the flea market last weekend!	How did you find the sale?"
"Well, kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies, haha.	Oh those would be good for keeping track of"
"I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s.	I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.	Wow, sounds like she's a hard worker!"
"haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol	I think it's all about presentation. If you can't show off your strengths, you're less valuable."
"My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!	Oh no, is the baby alright?"
"It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.	Oh no.  What happened?"
"She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!	My mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital. I was so concerned, but she became better after a few days. Such a huge relief!	I am glad to hear she is doing better!  It must be quite stressful."
"Thanks, she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it, so it could have been much, much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!	I am glad that she is better and glad you are too. Hopefully this clot dissapears and we don't lose her."
"I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.	That was nice of you. Did the cat return?"
"The cat appeared very relaxed, but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.	It's always sad to have to put a cat down...but its better to end the pain quickly and then to have it all to yourself"
"One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.	Oh no, did you get back?"
"If that wasn't frightening enough, I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!	Oh man that must have been really terrifying! Did you get hurt?"
"I didn't force her into anything. She seemed to know what she was doing anyway	That's good. If you don't force a relationship, it can end terribly."
"I wish it never happened now.	what happend?"
"she was 8	She was? Still pretty young I guess."
"A little while ago, my friend went on another beach vacation. It was her 3rd one for the year. My family and I hadn't been on vacation for several years, due to issues beyond our control, so I begrudged her trip a bit.	Oh I bet that was tough. Did she apologize?"
"Yes, true, I know they tend to let bills go for things like that, which I don't do.	You shouldn't have to pay if you don't want to. That is how it should work."
"I am so happy it's a boy	What makes you happy?"
"He'll be here in about 3 months	Who are you talking about?"
"Hey, I just started the keto diet!	How's it going?"
"It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first, but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.	That is awesome. I need to go into the lnoe more. I just found out there is a 24 hour fitness on campus too"
"Thank you, I wanted to be completely ready, so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.	Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy	What is a boy"
"I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha	Oh, yes. There are some images that are hard to forget."
"I just had my Sweet 16 party...	that sounds so exciting! how did you all do it?"
"Well, about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...	Did he say why he didn't give you one?"
"A BLUE one! I'm so devastated. I don't know what to do.	I recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out 6 years ago.	Hey that's great!  What uni are you in?"
"I was scared about it at first, but so far I have all A's. I must say, I'm proud of myself!	That is great, you must be very successful"
"Over the past year I've been on a weight loss journey of over 100 pounds.	Oh wow, I have been there too! It's so hard! I'm so proud of you! I've never been able to lose weight that much!"
"As well as exercise and diet, by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.	I agree, I will get there one day. I will also have to be a better person which is something I have struggled with."
"I never liked milk growing up, because my family drank skim.	I can understand that.  I never liked cereal either, thinking back."
"Well, first I tried whole milk, and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk, and I like it!	You must have done a lot of research to find that out!"
"I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.	thats great to hear"
"No, but I am satisfied with my choice.	How come?"
"I just got back from our vacation, but the drive there was so nerve wracking. There was heavy rain and traffic, and some nighttime driving. Had me on edge	The nighttime driving always scares me. You never know what kind of car you are going to be in during that time."
"Yes, well, it was just one of those things I know, but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.	What was that thing?"
"Recently, I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.	I am sorry to hear that. I know that must be tough."
"It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.	Yes its hard, but he will get through it.  Im sorry."
"On my recent vacation to Florida, there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving! It was such a hassle!	Oh wow! Did you get stuck at one of them or were you able to continue on your way?"
"I wanted to pull my hair out lol. But, knew once we were past it, there was the beautiful ocean on the other side...finally!	Nice. I love pulling my hair out!"
"Robby got me flowers today.	oh thats so nice. what did you get roby for?"
"Yes, how could you forget? It was a nice surprise, but then he said.. ""happy anniversary.""	Why did he say that?"
"Thanks, but I'm so embarrassed that I forgot!! D;	dad caught me kissing my half aunt	Oh no!  How did you react when you found out?"
"I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her	Oh my goodness, I can't imagine how awful that must have felt!"
"Me found cave.	What cave?"
"Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.	i am too, we actually live in the same cave"
"Me miss BC. Me miss wife.	One of the scariest, yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that I was going to have a baby.	Oh wow! Congratulations! Is this your first?"
"Oh, we were totally unprepared. In fact, my partner and I were working out of state in a compromising environment. We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!	What was the big change?"
"When I was pregnant, I felt ill until it was over. The doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby.	Oh my, that must have been very hard to go through that.  Were you able to get things over with?"
"Usually the sickness stops within the first few months, so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all, I had a healthy, bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.	That's great. Is your boy doing okay?"
"When my dog passed away, I felt so helpless. She was old and suffering and I felt angry that there was nothing I could do other than put her down.	I am so sorry for your loss.  My thoughts and prayers are with you."
"She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough, I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.	That is really sweet.  I would be the same way.  She was a rescue so..."
"I had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him	Did you feel awkward?"
"I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted	Who did she want?"
"My son is in college and about to return for his Junior year. We have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs.	You sound like a great parent!  You must be very proud."
"We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!	I know what you mean. My 3 year old needs to take his first steps soon."
"After a long few months of being a hermit, I went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!	I love playing with my dog!"
"It was definitely exciting for me! I haven't been able to play with a dog since my own passed away.	Aww, I'm sorry for your loss. Doggos are the best."
"I've been feeling a bit blue and overwhelmed lately.	oh no, what's wrong"
"I could definitely use one! However, I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!	Congratulations! Waiting is the worse part. At least you can go on vacation with your newborn :)"
"These days my skin has never looked better. My diet is good, my family life is good, I've got good grades. Life is good!	I have heard that before.  Good for you!"
"Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water. It's amazing how much the little changes can impact.	Dang, well I hope for the best for you and just be happy!"
"I flew all the way to New York City to buy a designer dress for the prom.	Wow, that is a long way. How did it take?"
"I am, thanks, but I wouldn't go there... Becky STILL managed to get the same dress as me! I am so mad!	that is awful! why did she get it first?"
"I just love playing retro games. Takes me back	Me too, they are such a great time"
"Oh yeah? Cool. I like the old Sega Mega Drive games. The music is just classic on those games	Yes, I remember playing those on the N64."
"One night, I was home alone, when suddenly, I heard a loud BANG!	Oh no. What was it?"
"It was a ghost! I ran into the kitchen to investigate, and I saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window.	Oh my gosh! Did you try to find the culprit?"
"Recently my daughter was voted 'Most Artistic' by her peers! She is so talented and we feel lucky to be her parents.	I think that's amazing! Is she far from home?"
"Yes, she has a natural talent, but really puts much practice and time into it.	What natural talent?"
"what does that mean?	I think he is saying that I am really good looking."
"this has obviously gone all wrong somewhere	Sounds like a personal issue?"
"5	A year ago, I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.	That's awesome, did you take it to an animal shelter?"
"I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat, Muffin.	Aww that is cute, how long did you wait to get her?"
"I'm proud that she traveled across the world all by herself. 2 big suitcases and all	Wow, that's quite the feat! Where did she go?"
"Wife. And she was 6 months pregnant to boot!	thats awesome.. congrats!"
"There was a storm the other day, close to our home. There was a tornado warning near it, so I was afraid and nervous!	Oh wow. Was it a big one?"
"Yes, it luckily passed our home, but you just never know!	Yeah that's true.. sometimes life can be really tough!"
"My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend, I'm really happy for him. :)	thats great news!"
"Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money, but still wanted her to have something nice.	thats nice of him"
"I can't wait to get a new car soon	Oh nice. What kind of car are you getting?"
"I want a compact SUV, like maybe something like a Toyota RAV4	I love Toyota's and their RAV 4. Not sure what you're wanting exactly, but they're usually affordable and fun to drive around!"
"not yet ready for the baby, need fix up his room	Oh, that's stressful! Make sure he sleeps with his shirt off!"
"Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!	Thats a long time to be alseep."
"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	oh no did you try calling them and asking to speak with a representative?"
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	maybe they think that because we're the bigger market that they think would drive the prices up"
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	Where did she take you?"
"It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it	Why did it take so long?"
"Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired	I hate being alone! I feel like i'm the only person on this earth"
"It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again	What did you spend your hard earned money on?"
"For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies	Oh no, why did they lie?"
"Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!	That is too bad. I hate to hear that. Is she going to be OK?"
"At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently	Were you in a relationship at the time?"
"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special	What happened? Normally we admire people for their good deed, not their bad"
"I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant	Wow! travelling alone isn't such a great accomplishment when you consider how many people you'll need to carry."
"Yes. It's a boy	Oh okay, is it your first?"
"My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business.	Oh no! I hope they are okay. How long will you be gone?"
"I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.	That's unfortunate. Is there any chance of getting a different flight?"
"I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him	It sounds like there might be a solution there."
"In the club	in the what?"
"I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to	she wanted too what?"
"She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew	I guess you're a lucky guy! I'm still pretty young and don't know anything about cars."
"I know I will save the money I need for the baby	That is a very stresffull thought. Are you able to budget for it?"
"Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday	It's good to have a schedule. How often do you work?"
"I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out	What didn't come out?"
"Kinda. I thought it was a secret	What was a secret?"
"it was brutal	What happened?"
"i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.	tomato, i like that"
"yes. homeless for a bit	thats good"
"i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye	I am sure you will be okay. You have to live with yourself."
"it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her	Did it break your heart?"
"i was heartbroken when my dad passed away.. still not over it.	Im so sorry for your loss. Thats so awful."
"5 years..	Oh wow, so close to 5 years. Are you going back?"
"i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition.. she seems like a born artist	that is great, how old is she?"
"yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her	That's great. How did she do?"
"i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents	Have you ever told them the truth?"
"yeah, but still.. that feeling never went away	What was it that gave you that feeling"
"i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere	You must have a super high chance of making it on time then!"
"well, i guess women are more detail oriented	More information is always better."
"i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her	That's really awesome that you have someone like that to support you.  Do you feel the same way about your girlfriend?"
"yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me, i escaped from there right awat	What haha, escape from there? Like.. on vacation?"
"my dog passed away earlier this year	I'm sorry, how old was he?"
"yeah.. but its too soon i feel	Too soon? What do you mean?"
"some guy drove past me so fast last week.. i was furious	That sounds like an annoying person."
"yeah.. i barely escaped!	escaped what?"
"1	Congratulations! It was either 1 or 2, I choose 2 because I wanted you to know I choose 2 because I wanted you to know I picked 2."
"soory it was mistakenly typed.	Oh no! You misspelled it?"
"how was your day?	I'm taking the California Bar exam to become an attorney in February and I'm sooo nervous!	Oh that sounds very tough! I'm sure you will do just fine if you study hard!"
"I played a video game when I was younger, called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and it made me want to become one!	Cool. Which game did you play?"
"once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life	Did everything turn out ok?"
"yeah that really sucks.	Tell me about it.  I got a speeding ticket today because I didn't stop for a red light."
"I fell down at work, and my khaki pants ripped open.	oh no. was anyone around?"
"I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.	I couldn't imagine not wearing a suit in a heat."
"My grandpa is coming to visit!,5|5|5_5|5|5,	Oh that's awesome!  When is he coming?"
"He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!	That sounds amazing! He is quite funny and original. I am sure he will have a great time."
"I ate a gas station burrito for lunch. It was not very appetizing. Actually, it was absolutely horrible.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	I do not like burritos very much"
"Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.	That's terrible.  Maybe it's time to find another job"
"how was your day?	It was okay. Did anything special happen?"
"yeah its an another good day	Yes, what is."
"oh how was the climate there/	What do you mean? I'm not talking about the place I live in."
"I managed to accidently flash a dozen people	That's a lot of people. Did they all die?"
"it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like ""oops!	Oh no, did you wind up getting dirty?"
"Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive	i have always more trust on my girlfriend	That's good. Trust is the backbone of all lasting relationships."
"yeah i do. i love her a lot	Is she your girlfriend?"
"what about you?	I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.	I bet! But think of the positive side - it gives you an opportunity to get even better grades!"
"Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.	That's awesome! Are you excited for it?"
"I get to go the the zoo tomorrow! They opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal, the sloth!	I would love to go to the zoo"
"They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!	I like all of those things! Except for the hippos, that's scary."
"I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!	That must have been a surprise guest"
"Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?	yes you should. What did they do?"
"i have been more happy	why is that?"
"happier now beacuse i have been built a new house	Oh nice! It's always a good feeling building houses!"
"Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.	I agree, but school can always be saved."
"I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal	Thats great. Im glad you were able to get all the help you needed. Its always important to be able to get everyone you need."
"i have watched races in tv	Like an exciting game, or are you just enjoying watching the racing?"
"nope iam a street racer	Cool.  Are you gonna race sometime?"
"i feels happy	Why is that?"
"because i built a new house	I would love to live in a house."
"i have been more happy that i have bought a car	Why is that? Are you less of a frugal person?"
"audi q7	?  what does that mean"
"My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.	Wow that is an amazing gift! I can just imagine how happy you were when you received it!"
"She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version.	I would be so excited for that! What watch is it?"
"I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.	Congratulations! That is such an accomplishment."
"I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.	Well, as long as you are able to do it, it should not be too hard!"
"I am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that I just finished. I took the final exam yesterday, and I am not sure what score I will receive.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	I hope you do well. Summer classes are tough"
"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.	Do you think you did well on the course?"
"I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.	Don't feel bad. Everybody gets turned on at some point. I'm sure it will go over well."
"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.	That is terrible. What are you going to do?"
"My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away.	That is very sad. I am sorry for your loss."
"The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off	Oh no! I hope that you were able to get some time off, she is most likely in a long distance away"
"I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.	That's disgusting. Some restaurants just don't have a good smell, no matter how you try to help it."
"I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.	I hate when that happens."
"I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.	I love coming back to old memories! Were you born in the 80s or 90s?"
"Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?	Yes, I have some of those grandparents. And I do have a great relationship with my great grandmother."
"I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone	Oh that must have been so nice. Did you cry?"
"Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.	What were some of the good times?"
"We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave.	I love hurricane season. We went through it twice as a little kid, in 2004 and 2008. I can't imagine what it must have felt like as a parent."
"Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?	I'm so thankful for everything that happened, you just made my day!"
"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	I bet, do you think it was for a check up?"
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	Oh no. Why did they ask for the testing?"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	That was really nice of them.  I would love to have a tree house.  The house always looks so busy."
"Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?	Haven't we all"
"I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.	I can imagine. funerals are always a sad time"
"Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.	I'm so sorry, how is she doing?"
"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	I do not like doctors."
"I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	Thats true but he doesnt seem to care at all. I feel so alone."
"Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	People can be so inconsiderate when there time is running out. I'm sorry that happened to you."
"I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious.	How big is it? I'm sure you will do great!"
"Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.	Have you studied for it?"
"I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it!	That is actually really cool. Are you going by yourself or with a group?"
"We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?	No, I haven't. Why do you think it's so fun?"
"One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!	Bed and breakfast sounds super fun!"
"We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!	What happened, did he not invite you to dinner?"
"It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?	Ahhhhh I get it now. That was a good one!"
"Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top	That sounds like a wonderful place! My husband and I went through there about a month ago and really enjoyed it!"
"I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.	Oh no. Did you drink a lot?"
"I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.	That is so funny how did anyone see?"
"I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone	Who is going to the party?"
"I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution	What do you mean?"
"sure ... thanks	My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.	That's rough, I'm sure they notice"
"I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?	You should. Just do it in a calm way. You know you can do it but you still feel bad."
"My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.	I bet it feels good to be recognized"
"Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!	That's wonderful! I hate when things are slow and the workers don't get what they deserve. It makes me feel terrible."
"Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.	I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me.	That is really sad. Baby's cry a lot."
"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.	I know the feeling.  At least you weren't enraged!"
"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	Sometimes that can be good for you. It can also be bad for them. So everything worked out for you."
"Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.	Are you able to afford that?"
"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	She sounds amazing! What's the address?"
"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.	That is a hard situation.  You want to do everything you can but you need to be strong."
"A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.	Oh my god. Are you ok?"
"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.	I have never been in a tornado."
"Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy	Nice, are they happy because you do that?"
"Especially when you feel something special by nature	yes, love is a gift that many people take for granted"
"I hope this feeling increases	My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.	Thats nice. Always nice to plan ahead."
"We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.	Wow! That sounds like so much fun!"
"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.	what is the issue? i think in a relationship you should trust the other partner but only if they are faithful."
"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	Well, he sounds like a nice guy."
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	Sometimes you have to do what you have to do. If you don't have a choice then you have to do it in a way that you feel good about."
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	Oh no! Did your stomach turn into a ball of mud, or did it turn into a ball of lye, too?"
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	Wow, I really like that. Why did you chose that nickname?"
"I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!	Haha...I feel for you. The smell of dumpsters make me sick."
"I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!	Oh no.  Do you have go to the bathroom more often now or have you just learned to deal with it?"
"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	Hey, you're a sellsword. What really matters is that you got a new tv."
"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?	You could always donate it!"
"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	i totally understand that feeling, my husband always orders the food, even when she says no."
"Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.	That's very kind of you to offer your service. It's good to have people willing to help if you need them most."
"I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.	Oh, that sounds lovely."
"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.	Good for you. Do you like each other?"
"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	Two classes? Are you having to take a lot of different courses?"
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	That sounds just like my old professor!"
"Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.	That is great news. It is always nice to have more money then you had in the past."
"Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!	What are your plans?"
"My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness	That's a good friend right there."
"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering	I am sorry to hear that."
"Thanks for your comprehension	Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.	Oh wow, that must have been scary!"
"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.	What happened after that?"
"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	I am so sorry to hear that! Have you tried to have a friend in your life who can help you through it?"
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	I am sorry to hear that, i wish i could get rid of this addiction."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	I'm so sorry. That must be so difficult."
"one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel	I feel your pain, I have been nearly kicked out of my apartment three times due to overspending on unnecessary things like food. I just hope your tunnel doesnt end up in a fire."
"is that he loved her	This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.	Gross! What was it?"
"Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.	Oh that isn't good! It is usually pretty clean under there, so there must have been something wrong."
"I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.	Im sorry to hear that! Where did you go?"
"We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.	Oh no, was something wrong?"
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	I would be so mad! Were you able to kick her to the curb this time?"
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	My mom is always telling me to shut up. I'll yell at her later as I'm sure she's done something wrong but she always says something before I can."
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	Well I'm not sure about making any noise. But maybe some subtle hints like throwing a party or something."
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	Was it an important occasion?"
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	I can't imagine surgery on your hip. I hope everything goes well!"
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	Ouch! I hope you're okay. I fell in similar surgery when I was 15 and I was really ill. I could only move for a couple of steps."
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	Well I am sure there must be something I am not knowing about, since I haven't been in school in decades. My mom taught me how to use a dual monitor set up at work and I never realized it could do that!"
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	You are crazy!! People like that are just disgusting. I hope you are not involved at all!"
"The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.	What part of the country is it in? I live in the south and here it's always hot."
"I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.	Is it hard to work in the yard?"
"Writing speeches makes me nervous	i know the feeling,i'm on arumble and it throws me off"
"Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience	Just think positive, it will work out in the end!"
"True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say	I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days, but they always bring back fond memories	What movies do you like to watch instead?"
"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!	I have never seen either of those. I am too poor to see them."
"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	Are you a parent?  I love adventure movies!  What are some of your favorites?"
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	Yeah seems like it.  So many channels, so much information"
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	how did it go?"
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	Was it good?"
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	Most of my friends don't work at all. How does that make you feel?"
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	what do you do?"
"Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day	It's good that you care about others."
"Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!	Wow, did he steal anything?"
"Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing	Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking	I do not like those kind of streets."
"I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill	You had it in you had to ride it?"
"Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed	When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks	lol that made me laugh"
"Yeah, I'm not good with confrontations	Did you give a reason why you feel that way?"
"I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong	I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!	Congrats! That is a great achievement. You must be very proud of yourself"
"Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!	Maybe you should tell her how you feel?"
"How long have you been there?	3 years"
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	Sure, it would probably be a daunting task, but I believe I can do it."
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	Holy cow, that is a fantastic surprise!  Was it an important error?"
"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.	I hear you. What kind of laptop do you have?"
"If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*	I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!	That is awesome. I bet your employer is proud."
"I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*	Oh wow, that is pretty awesome! I love when that happens."
"I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.	That's great, how do you usually role play?"
"I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.	So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.	Oh no! You must feel terrible about it. Did your son cry?"
"He kinda gave me the ""Mom, really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*	that sounds like a good plan, i'm sure it worked out well."
"I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].	That's really sweet! My mom used to do that with me, too. It was so sweet when he'd say something like, ""Why don't you have a seat over there?"""
"It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD	Hahaha. Yes it is! It is like when you are trying to remember the last ten things on a list, but end up forgetting most of them."
"I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.	Aw, that's too bad. Did he pick them up without you knowing?"
"No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.	What did he think when you said that?"
"Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*	Oh, you're eating them too? That's a good idea lol"
"Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!	My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.	Was she understanding when you told her that? I'm sure that's a tough situation."
"I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.	Oh that's ok, do it in a nice way!"
"Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.	I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!	What kind of presentation was it?"
"I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.	Oh no. What happened?"
"Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.	I broke up with my boyfriend last week.	Oh man. Sorry to hear that. Are you ok?"
"Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.	I'm glad to hear you're hanging in there."
"Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.	I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!	Congratulations! I know you worked very hard to get there!"
"I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL	That sounds like a tough job."
"This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!	I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!	Aww that's nice. You must be very happy."
"15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?	Wow that sounds really exciting."
"Ah, make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)	Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is, it	really?"
"Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!	It happens. Are you planning on buying a new electric vehicle?"
"The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!	I feel you, I'll be a teenager in January, I can't imagine being a parent!"
"It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks.	What are you going to do with all the notes?"
"The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What exactly happened to you?"
"It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving.	Oh no, I hope it wasn't too many people and if they had ID's they could've made sure you left with your stuff."
"really didnt want to anything for days	What?"
"I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it"".	Don't be worried, you'll do better next time"
"it is indeed. wont happen again though	I was attending a conference and heard the minister speak. he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district"".	That's awesome. What was it about?"
"it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now	What position was it?"
"I feel uneasy because I don't know if I will be able to save enough money in time	That's always an issue when it comes to saving money! Have you been doing a lot of saving lately?"
"Baby is due in less than 3 months	You must be excited."
"I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me	Wow. Your work must be really hard."
"5 months to find out !	RemindMe! 5 months Did you find out what happened?"
"I tried so hard for that exam, when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!	You must be so proud of yourself."
"thanks. now onto bigger things	ohh, what are you into?"
"starting a clinic	it was the grand opening for our restaurant. The whole town was there. almost double the number of people we were expecting	Did you get any cool gifts?"
"thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town	What is an achievement in your eyes?"
"I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this	its so sad the way some people can be."
"Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym	What happened inside?"
"I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change	That's good.  How often do you change"
"Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.	Yeah, I can get behind that. I eat the same thing everyday too. How long do you think it will take you to lose weight?"
"I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline	That's awesome. Will you be competing?"
"I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing	Carbs and sugar are bad for you."
"the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls	Oh no! I hate when things like that happen. I hope you and your family made it out ok."
"Last week. we're in temporary housing now	temporary huh? temporary while you learn how to survive."
"I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!	That is the worst, when you are little and everything is raining."
"I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.	Did you hit him in the nose?"
"I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.	Oh, that's nice to hear. How's it going, friend?"
"Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.	What book was it?"
"I can't find another way to earn money	Try online dating"
"I just want to work from home	That's a great job to have.  Is it paying well?"
"I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now	wow congrats!!  i know how you feel.. it will be great when your baby is here"
"You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap	I understand that, it's hard to be in a place where you know you can't leave"
"I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials	Yes I pray that too"
"I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back	I'm sure you'll be able to save up.  You must be very proud of yourself"
"She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.	I guess its not surprising that she was afraid of you. How did yo change?"
"Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors	And how did that go. Out of curiousity?"
"I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding	What did she refuse to do?"
"I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again	What issue?"
"I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.	Nice! Did she ride it well?"
"She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.	Wow I'm sorry, I wish I could do that to someone!"
"I did so much practice running in preparation for my 50 metre sprint race at my school!	Oh wow, how did you do?"
"I do! I am so motivated to win and I believe I am one of the fastest at my school.	That is awesome. Sounds like you really put in the work."
"I feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro	Does he still play?"
"Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation	Yes, I was talking about the old games on the console. I miss playing them."
"I was so scared of going onto the train!	Oh yea? why is that?"
"No but I hate going in objects that travel fast, I really did not want to go on it.	I understand! Objects that travel fast can be very scary"
"I am going to get us a new car!	That's awesome! What kind are you getting?"
"I'm not sure yet. Maybe a Toyota	oh nice"
"I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.	How old is she now? I bet that was a shock for her!"
"She loved it.  She's 17, I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.	Ah ok, so she is still very young then."
"I can't seem to feel happy but I'm not depressed	Why are you not depressed?"
"I just feel kinda stuck in life	What's going on?"
"I had pizza at a restaurant a couple days ago and found a hair on my pizza!	That's gross. Did you complain?"
"I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.	Oh no, what was the hold up for?"
"I finally got a new bike! I've been wanting one for so long!	Awesome! What kind of bike did you get?"
"I hope so, my new bike has so many gears. Such an upgrade from my last one! I can't wait to take it out.	That sounds great.  What kind of bike are you getting?"
"Pretty soon I'll be taking over my parents mortgage.  Homeownership is on the horizon.	That's a real thought, I can see the motivation there. It'll be great to have a house you own in no time if you can manage it!"
"A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.	That's great. I rented in San Francisco when I was 18. It was an amazing experience.  You will be in a similar situation in a few years."
"I'm the only one who cares about paying bills. It's very frustrating	I know how that is. I am in that boat right now."
"Unfortunately no. It's very hard on me because I have to be disciplined with spending. Makes life very boring	I can imagine that would be a bit hard.  Do you have a set of rules you follow?"
"I have a beautiful gray cat named Stormy.  Unfortunately she's contracted feline AIDS.	Oh no!  Is she getting up there in age?"
"Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.	oh no. you don't have flowers?"
"I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid.	Oh my! I would be so angry! I would get furious!"
"I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.	Bummer. Maybe there's a way you can get a high score with a little effort?"
"I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.	What was it of?"
"Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young.	Do you have a younger sister?"
"I got a letter from my parents this past Friday with a wonderul surprise in it.	wow. what was the wonder?"
"Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous, but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with.	Where did you go with your wife?"
"Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town, I was a bit scared.	Oh no, what happened?"
"I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.	No probs. Yes a bit foolish but you must live with it."
"When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything.	What a trustworthy friend you must have been."
"No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now.	If you keep quiet it will be difficult to get it back. I wish you luck."
"I was one percent off from passing my math test, I was devastated.	I'm sorry, did you study hard for it?"
"I agree, I should of studied harder too. Practice makes perfect!	You are probably right but I always find it a little annoying that I waste my time doing something I am passionate about and have a million other people doing the exact same thing."
"Last night I was minding my own business walking down a street in a not so good area of town when someone started to chase me!	Oh no! What happened next?"
"I managed to get away after a few smart quick turns, but I was shaking and in fear at the end of the chase. It was wild.	i would be too"
"I was looking through old stuff in my basement and found my old baseball cards! Finding those was like being a kid all over again!	Oh wow I bet that brought back some good memories!"
"I used to collect so many when I was younger, it was such an awesome feeling to see them again!	It's such a good time, isn't it? I loved reminiscing on the good old days. What kind of things did you collect?"
"I was feeling so optimistic about getting a new job at Houston a while back	That's awesome. Are you looking for one now?"
"Yeah actually, i am still working on it. So much fun!	Where are you working on it?"
"I was so much in awe when i saw Hamilton!	oh yea.. was it your first time?"
"Neither, i am talking about the broadway show :D	Oh, I'm sorry. I've never seen it before. Which one are you talking about?"
"I went to the beach other day.. such an awesome feeling standing there	i love the becah, was it seagulls or something?"
"I most certainly did.. There is something about looking at the calm and glory of the ocean.	I prefer to be on land myself."
"I felt so bad about cheating on my science exam, it was terrible	Oh, I bet! You should never cheat on anything!"
"I know, I am disgusted at myself for doing it. I just wanted to pass.	Pass what? I hope you passed."
"I'm taking my wife out this coming weekend to dance.	That sounds so fun and romantic.  Do you think it will be your first time taking her to a dance?"
"We haven't been able to go out in quite a long time.  Family and life stuff just gets in the way sometimes.	I'm sorry. I know how that is."
"My dog passed away couple months back.. i was heartbroken	I am so so sorry. I know that can be hard."
"She got run by a truck.. I felt guilty and blue	did you mean ran over?"
"I always get sad thinking about my dad.	Why's that?"
"Yeah.. he did. He had cancer.	Oh no. I'm so sorry. Is he better now?"
"I went to the beach other day	How was it? Was it relaxing?"
"I sure did! the ocean and the breeze gives me such a sense of joy and calm	I love the sound of the ocean. It's relaxing and the birds seem to be singing too."
"I was so happy that i got to see Hamilton the other day	I've never seen him! Is he a favorite of yours?"
"Yeah, the same. Lin Manuel is a genius to say the least!	He sounds pretty smart, what does he do exactly?"
"I went to visit my family the other day	oh, what did you visit them for?"
"It was such a joyful experience. They always warm my heart	Did you get married?"
"A dog chased me through a street the other day	Oh no! I'm glad you are alright. Was he scared?"
"No i somehow managed to escape.. it was so scary	Oh, what is that? A ghost?"
"I feel so caring of my little sister	Awww! That's sweet! What does she do for you to feel that kind of care?"
"Yeah.. I always look out for her no matter what the problem is	That's a good thing, that means you care"
"I was really nervous when i went to meet my girl's parents	I would have been too. How did it go?"
"It turned out well actually, we had a nice time	You sure did.. what exactly happened?"
"A dog chased me through our street last night	That's terrifying. Did you get away?"
"I think so.. it looked like that. I was shivering when i finally managed to escape	Oh no, what happened?"
"I really envy people who can sing	Do you think there are any singers that are truly great and not just a good singer but also an amazing singer?"
"Yeah.. i did. i never got the chance to pursue that	Oh no, you didn't?"
"I had to leave the house for a bit, before I left I gave my kids instructions on what I wanted them to do around the house.	How did it go?"
"I figured they would just goof off.  However; when I returned all chores were comples.  I was pretty impressed.	Well done!  It is annoying how lazy some people can be."
"i found a bunch of dead mice the other day	So did you kill them?"
"it was! i felt sick seeing that	I'm sorry to hear that. What was wrong with it?"
"how sweet. bless you!	thanks my friend"
"5	what is wrong"
"5	My Mother came into town unannounced.  She hardly ever does that.	Oh, that is a nice surprise! Did you have a pleasant surprise?"
"No.  Thankfully it was just a visit.  She took us all to dinner, it was nice.	What did you guys eat?"
"i was so furious when i found out that my best friend and girl friend had made out	i bet.. harsh"
"I have not confronted them. I am still thinking over it.	What are they doing to you?"
"A big brown roach crawled across the floor in my direction last night.	Oh my, I hope you got it off."
"Yes, but this one didn't fly.  He just decided to go under the chair I was sitting in.	I am sorry to hear that."
"My bills and mortgage payment is coming up soon.  I not sure if I can cover them all.	You should ask your friend to help you out if he has enough for you."
"I am working hard to make sure I can cover them.  Hope fully this month of work is better than last month.	How much do you make?"
"I made sure everything was set and proper before i went abroad	Where did you go?"
"5	When I got my first car I thought I'd finally be able to have a cool social life.  But I was dissapointed quickly.	That sucks, have you ever gotten a second one?"
"I spent my first night out at a Whataburger, eating alone.	That's a shame, did you have fun?"
"i felt so guilty after lying to my girlfriend	Shame on you. What did you lie about?"
"I kissed a mutual friend of ours. I lied when she checked up on me. It was a one time thing, i did not wanted to hurt her.	It's good that you're comfortable enough to be honest with her about your feelings."
"I once lied about kissing the most popular girl at my school. and my friend found out about it	How popular is she? popular enough to kiss her?"
"I was, so very much! I avoided my friends for a whole week thenafter	Are you still friends with them?"
"My four year old daughter came up and told me she thought I needed a big hug and kiss.	Aww that's adorable! Big hugs are the best, are you planning on keeping her?"
"She jumped in my lap and peppered my cheek with kisses.  It was pretty cute.	People are gross sometimes."
"I felt so very nervous after i agreed to meet my girlfriend's parents	I am sorry, I do not understand."
"Well, i lost a few pounds on the weeks leading upto it. But the actual meeting went well	Congrats! How did you lose weight?"
"I have always wanted to join a college faculty.  I went to school to study philosophy for that reason.	That's awesome. There are a lot of great ways to go into education and study."
"Unfortunately not.  In the end I ran out of money and had to leave that dream behind.	Oh that's too bad. But, you can always keep the dream alive in your mind. There's always something to look forward to."
"I feel so sad this time of the year. My dad passed away this time last year	OH my goodness I am so sorry for your loss. I hope you have good memories to remember him by."
"I'm sorry? Are you still talking about the cops?	No, the people who committed the crimes."
"I feel heartbroken whenever i see a picture of my dog	I am sorry to hear that. I have a dog myself and I know how you feel."
"It is ok.. She passed away few months ago	My son and I went to the track yesterday to run.	Did you find any bikes?"
"No, but he did end up puking all over the parking lot afterwards.	So gross! But funny at the same time! haha"
"That is really cool. i bet it felt nice watching those	What kind of sport are you talking about?"
"I envy people who can dance really well	I've heard that some people are gifted with great skills. Perhaps you have the gifts."
"I was stunned with fear to find a rattlesnake right where i was about to step into last week	Oh wow! How'd it do?"
"I stood there speechless for a moment, turned back and ran for my life!	did you get away from them?"
"Needing some extra money, I used the spare change in my car to buy a scratch off ticket.	Did you use it to buy a ticket? That is very irresponsible of you."
"It was Blackjack.  I didn't win anything though.	Sorry to hear that. What are you hoping to win?"
"I once ate a piece of cake, it was old.  After the first bite I noticed spots of mold on it.	Oh yuck! That really stinks! Did you get sick?"
"No I spit it out and listerined my mouth.	ah you really did? did it feel good?"

"thank you. I'm sure it will get easier with time. It was just so tragic, he was so young	What happened?"
"I am so angry to see so much fake news floating around in the media	It is truly sad. You can find anything on the internet in minutes even if you want to."
"Very true! Why does news have to be so hyped up?	Because people love to hear about good things"
"My little girl loves to wake up at night and ask for chocolate milk.	That is sweet, have you taught her to say its name?"
"I have an 18 year old doing the same.  What my 4 year old doesn't know is I giver her the sugar free version.	That is nice."
"I lost a good job a few years back	Oh no! Were you able to find another job quickly?"

"He had lung cancer..	Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. That's not a good death to have."
"My friends are saying my girlfriend is cheating behind my back, but i trust her	Well that's your choice...but still I would be furious"
"May be. But i have known her all my life, she would die before going behind my back	Have you talked to her about it?"
"I have a lot of stuff coming up due this month.  I also have a lot of purchasing goals as well.  I am confident I will be able to meet all of them.	What's your goal weight?"
"That's the plan, I've signed up for a bunch of double shifts.  Fingers crossed.	Double shifts? Man I wish I could do that. That must save you a lot of money."
"I was so thrilled to get to see Hamilton, i was really looking forward to it	I love musicals."
"It is the broadway show, by Lin manuel miranda	Thank you so much. That sounds like a great show"
"My dog started walking again after an accident she had	That is good news!"
"She fell down from the first floor..	Oh my. Is everything okay?"
"I used to be a member of a very cool dance crew. I miss those days	Ahh, dancing sounds like a lot of fun. Do you still dance?"
"mostly hip hop. We were travelling and battling with other teams. It was really fun	hip hop? i getcha, what teams were you battling?"
"i wan to participate in a bodybuilding contest! I'm sure i will win it!	That sounds exciting! You must feel so good to be winning!"

"yeah.. i know.. memories still haunt though..	You shouldn't worry about them. You will be able to forget them soon enough."
"I was really nervous when my girl asked me to meet her parents	Why is that?"
"I was really close to running away, but i somehow managed to pull it off	i am sure it was a good thing you did"
"my friend bought a big house and i'm happy for her but at the same time i'm a little bit jealous	oh man, if i were her i would feel the exact same way, maybe we're soulmates"
"true, but there is so much space for her kid to run and play at and I live in a tiny apartment with my son	Well they can still leave the door open, and the baby can just take a ball or two. It doesn't have to be an all nighter"
"I was so mad when i found out my cousin asked out my girlfriend once	That sucks. Is she a good one?"
"Sort of, yes. He did it anyways. I yelled at him.	What did he do"
"I feel happy when I am outside in nature	yes i agree"
"I love to garden. Organic gardening, I plant peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and a bunch of other goodies.	Wow. You are soentaert."
"Just get outside and started playing / digging  in the dirt, You will soon catch on to what works for you.	i was so in awe when i saw hamilton	Who is that?"

"We planned our honeymoon and booked a flight but I was so nervous about flying.	Was the flight at least fun?"

"My sister recently paid off her house. I felt so envious of her as I've been trying to pay mine down.	That's awesome, where at?"
"I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal, and I genuinely am pleased she did it!	that's great! are you making progress?"
"I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating.	It can be pretty tiring when one or both of you fight about things."
"Yes, but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly, it was more about my own insecurities than about him, you know? As I grew more into myself, the jealousy loosened its hold.	Well, he's probably still there. He's just shy."
"My daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us.	I am glad they made it. It can be challenging to take time away from the kids."
"I prepared for weeks. I could not wait for them to get here. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen them and they have a new baby.	That is awesome. What kind of baby?"
"I cosigned a loan with my son, expecting he would make the payments and he has let me down by being late every month.	That sucks.  I've had that happen to me before.  They have a lot of processing fees, so they take forever.  I had to switch to a different bank because it just wasn't cutting it :("
"I've helped me create a repayment plan where I have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me. I just really feel frustrated because he has the money, but he wastes it.	Oh no! I've been there and it's a hard thing. Have you talked to him about it?"
"I was anticipating a great weight loss after my first week on my diet!	I've been there! It's so hard to lose weight! What helped was making sure I ate a bunch of healthy food, getting enough sleep, and exercising. I'm on day 5 now and I don't want to go back to the diet."
"I lost 7 pounds! I am SO thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long.	Congratulations! What type of diet are you following?"
"I have felt some of the best moments of pure happiness seeing someone I love getting something they've worked hard for -- like my daughter's acceptance into her college and major of choice!	Congratulations on that! It is so wonderful to see a parent reaching their goals."
"Absolutely! Of course, now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah, so happy for her!	I bet she is so excited to hear back!"
"I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were.	That can be disappointing when you have no idea who everyone is."
"Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own ""vision"" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know?	Yeah, I get it. But why wouldn't you be proud that your vision was that of a self-aware and technically challenged person?"
"I've definitely worked through that! Happily, it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)	I recently met up with a friend I had not seen in a while. I want to see him again soon and I think I will!	Do you often see each other?"
"I agree. We went to high school and middle school together.	That sounds like wonderful times, were you ever able to have some free time?"
"In college I studied very hard for an upcoming exam that I was very interested in getting a very high score. I was confident that I did so.	Good for you. Did you get the highest score?"
"I was very excited with my result. I am very competitive. Sometimes I wish I were not so competitive.	Yeah, being competitively social is important. How did you do?"
"You are completely right. It is very important to not lose sight of what is important in life.	A have a friend that is going to be visiting me this week! I cannot wait!	thats awesome friend"
"She was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. That can be really tough."
"I am currently dealing with epilepsy unfortunately, and the doctors have not found a treatment yet.	I am sorry to hear that, I hope that it works out for you."
"Thanks. I have to go to a Monitoring Unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location. Not going to be fun.	that is scary, i hope everything turns out ok"
"Thanks again. I have lots of support so I am fortunate	I've felt so incredibly sad whenever we've had to say goodbye to any of our dogs.	I am sorry to hear that. I have lost many that way."
"I know -- I needed to just come out and say ""when we had to put them down"". Always age or illness related -- but man, SO tough.	That's awful. I could not imagine. Sometimes I find myself wishing I could just go back in time."
"My friend has been on the couch for a few weeks. He is getting under my skin now.	That sounds very painful. You should talk to him about it."
"No, he is a friend that recently got fired and needs some help.	Oh no. What kind of help do you need?"
"I have been trying to lose weight in a group and while i made it to 4 lbs, my friends made it to 15. :(	Oh my, that is pretty frustrating.  Maybe you should try to join a gym?"
"i guess they worked harder but	That doesn't sound good. Why do you think that is?"
"I went on a road trip with some friends. We had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping, too!	That sounds like fun. Where did you guys end up going?"
"Yes, sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more.	Do you have a lot of stuff to sort through?"
"We paid 600$ for a cruise, but they canceled it with not refunds one week before. so mad	Wow that sounds really disappointing. Did they have any other cruises you could have used to go on?"
"we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company, so they dont know what they're in for	Have you contacted a lawyer or your police department?"
"I had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago. I wonder if I will see her again any time soon.	that's good, i've never seen a friend like that before"
"We went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends.	Sounds great! It is always nice to spend some quality time out with our friends"
"I live alone. Sometimes it can be hard with nobody around.	I bet it is! How many people are you usually living with?"
"I think that's a great idea. I will try to go out this weekend.	Cool"
"I saw a huge spider in my car yesterday. I scared me so!	Did you jump out or did you brave the war and kill it??"
"I stopped the car and got out and ushered it out of the car.	Was the other driver ok?"
"I hope that this summer I can go to Florida with my family	I live in Florida. If you like bbq and beach go to Busch Gardens. If you like to drink and eat beach go to The Bowl."
"Summer is not over until Labor Day! We still have the whole month of August!!	LOL.  August is the worst month of the year.  It just means work and school starts.  August is the one time I'm not dreading school.  LOL.  It's also the month my daughter gets 2nd ears.  Is that bad?"
"Summer can be over in July for teachers sometimes. Are you a teacher?	My roommate eats my food sometimes. This makes me so angry!	Have you talked to him about it?"
"I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.	Right! fridges are so useful. You can store foods in there for years."
"I recently lost my sister to breast cancer. She was very young and has left three little girls. I have been devastated.	Oh, wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. That is awful to hear. How old were they when she passed?"
"My parents health has deteriorated rapidly, and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.	That is a shame to hear. I hope that they change their attitude soon."
"It's why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own.	I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can't always get what you want.	I know that feeling. I was rejected by my first girlfriend who I was entice to a relationship with."
"Life is not fair, but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with	it truly is a great place to be"
"I'm a little anxious about an upcoming move. It's to a *very* different state with a *very* different climate and way of life!	Oh I bet! Is it far away from where you live now?"
"We've been great with change, including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot, and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man, those looooong winters!	What is loooong about in Alaska?"
"Ha! Not likely in the city....but hey...who knows! I WILL use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski.	Wow that's awesome. I should try and cross country ski one day."
"The economy has been doing well. The future looks bright.	That is awesome to hear. Do you have a guess what the end of the year will be like?"
"Hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations.	i hope so too, i'm a generation behind but i'm hopeful"
"My sister unfortunately will not seek help for her alcohol problems, and she will not even admit to them. I am extremely sad apprehensive about what might happen to her.	I would be too. That's a tough situation to be in."
"I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention, but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.	Maybe you should tell them?"
"It was still so unexpected when my husband and I -- who were open to getting pregnant -- found out that we actually were!	That's so exciting! When are you due?"
"Oh, that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day, Halloween, visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.	That sounds so fun and nostalgic. Did you go on a tour or anything?"
"The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful, in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!	Wow, how cool!"
"The horror film I saw last night can cause nightmares. It was so scary!	That is scary, so you have not seen many horror movies?"
"I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.	What was the Ring?"
"My daughter was accepted into Harvard. She starts in the fall.	Wow that is great!"
"She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!	I hope so too! That was very nice of her to let you come over and spend a day with her."
"My friend purchased a new car. The ride is sweet!	Very cool. What kind of car did they get?"
"They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.	That's a cool ride!"
"I graduated college recently. I'm so glad!	I bet! It is a huge accomplishment. Congratulations on your education and on your continued success."
"I majored in environmental engineering!	That is impressive, what do you plan to do when you finish your degree?"
"I cheated on my girlfriend recently. I feel horrible about myself right now.	At least you admitted it!"
"I plan on coming clean at some point, but I'm not sure how to break the news.	Have you been thinking about it? How did that work out for you?"
"I can not wait until some of my family come in to town. They will be coming in to town in two weeks.	How long are they staying?"
"I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.	Were they good?"
"I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.	Were you the best at Chemistry?"
"Yes, I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.	I'm sorry, time is always a good thing to have but I wish you the best of luck!"
"I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!	sorry about that, what was the movie about"
"A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.	That's annoying! Were you trying to play it off, or were you actually hoping she'd come out?"
"I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary	Does he take you often to the same place?"
"Yes, it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.	I'm in a similar situation. It would be nice if you could invite someone over for dinner."
"I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.	That is terrible.  I have one of those."
"Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much	I bet she loved you too!"
"I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.	I can't believe either of those things happened."
"We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.	You sound very confident. Has he broken any major laws?"
"Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!	Oh no, well maybe it's not as bad as you think"
"Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.	Oh no. Have you tried different things?"
"Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions	You must have felt really proud of your family."
"No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance	I live in Alabama. Just recently moved there for work. Pretty scary place. How far did you drive?"
"I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight.	That stinks. What kind of project was it?"
"Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad!	Yes I do that all the time"
"I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.	Did you catch any?"
"I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.	That's a tough life, having to mow the lawn every day.  Are you self-employed?"
"Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing.	Thats quite a list.well have fun being homeless"
"It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!	Well how big is the one?"
"Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.	I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times	I've only been to one but it was a cool one. Do you still have horses?"
"A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse	I love a good tragedy, like that of The Big Lebowski. What do you do to yours?"
"Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work.	The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.	That is very lucky timing!"
"I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.	What did you get changed?"
"One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.	Oh that's pretty tall.  Did you?"
"Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.	Oh my gosh. How did you manage to do that?"
"My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!	you must be so excited and proud of him"
"I am, but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here, bored stupid! I know, I'm being selfish.	Being a golf fan is pretty tough these days. All the pro players are on TV!"
"I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.	I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!	Well, good for you! Are you moving for a job?"
"Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!	that is strange i bet it is quite cold and hard to move around in"
"I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate	Meditating can relax you quite a bit, it is a great exercise!"
"No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy.	I'm sorry you missed one"
"My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis	Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.	Oh my goodness.  I would have been terrified."
"Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.	I can't imagine how terrifying that would be.  That's really scary though.  What happened?!"
"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	i know the feeling, that's why i finish things last"
"Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.	It's not just an emotional reaction, it's financial one."
"I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.	I can understand that. You were nervous!"
"Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.	How'd it go?"
"I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!	That is so wonderful of him! Our country needs more people like you."
"Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.	Well maybe you should move back."
"Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!	Sounds like a great time!  I need to be more grateful for the things I have!"
"I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.	I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.	Wow. I would have been too. Did you get sprayed?"
"Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck	Wherever it may be, I hope it's not painful. But where there is pain, there is usually someone who will be more interested in stinging you."
"Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!	So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.	Dang. Did the customer complain and get your back?"
"Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.	Oh no! Did they understand when you explained it to them?"
"I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.	Yes those were the days.  Do you still have a good relationship with your parents?"
"Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha	Adulting sucks.   You can always work at it though.  Life is much more fun when everyone is happy."
"I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.	I'm very envious of people who are successful like that."
"I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.	i love working with others."
"I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.	I mean, wouldn't you have been annoyed with him not coming out?"
"I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!	how did it go? did you like the drink?"
"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	Disgusting, I hope that he pays you back somehow."
"Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!	I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.	I've never won before, but I can understand the excitement! How much did she win?"
"She won $5,000 and never offered to share.	Wow, she sounds like a winner!"
"I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.	congrats. circuit boards are easy. You must have worked hard for that exam."
"I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.	Ah I see. Well good luck to ya. Sounds like ya studied hard!"
"I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.	Oh that will be a boon for everyone. I love limestone."
"Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on	I like clean places"
"I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!	Oh wow! I'm glad you are okay. Do the people you see usually have names attached to them?"
"Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.	Hahaha that's terrible, did you finally manage to get over there?"
"Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!	My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	Oh, I know that feeling! Well, kids can be a bit of a burden sometimes, I'm sure she'll get over it!"
"Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?	No, I'm not sure what you are talking about. I'm a little older, but my mom moved all the way from Alabama to Georgia to teach at an alternative school in Mississippi. How far did you move?"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.	That happens frequently for me on my old computer"
"Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!	That's pretty rude, especially at red lights. Are you a bad driver?"
"Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe	Yes. Maybe we need to drive slower so we are less nervous."
"I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.	That's great! I am really jealous!"
"I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?	Not yet, I work too hard for that lol. What were you hoping to do?"
"I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.	Oh wow. That would be nerve wrecking."
"Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!	Where are you staying that is getting hit the hardest?"
"I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.	I agree, death is so hard to deal with"
"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	I agree. What can we do though to help?"
"It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.	My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.	You must be feeling a little jealous, huh?"
"I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.	Thats awesome!"
"I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!	Which amusement park is it?"
"I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?	I love theme parks! I am more of a rollercoaster fan myself."
"I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.	That is very nice. Where are you going to put it?"
"That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.	That is good, it is nice to be prepared"
"We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.	Wow, that's awesome. I hope you guys had a lot of fun together."
"Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.	well, i would still be livid, cos i dont want to be santa no matter what people want"
"I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.	Oh no, what did you do?"
"That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!	Oh no, did you try calling your vet?"
"I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.	I know what you mean. I watch shows on tv all the time because I'm too cheap to pay for them."
"Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.	Yeah I have felt that way a lot recently as well.  When you see a sad movie it makes you feel that way."
"Nah, I don't get to to bad.	I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!	I would love that, it seems beautiful"
"I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa?	I live in Tampa but I work in Williamsburg. Why do you ask?"
"Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.	That's terrible, my daughter is just about to be 1.5 and she has had to have a few nose infections. My son was fine, but my daughter sure is not."
"This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.	That is no good. Did he get a tummy ache?"
"Not even a little.	What about a little?"
"I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.	That is great, dogs are loyal even when we do things to hurt them"
"Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems	Oh no! I hope they are okay.  Is one of them declined health?  That can be really an issue"
"I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house	Oh no. I hope it wasn't a tornado!"
"It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.	Oh no! That's awful. I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.	I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.	That's great!  It's always great to see old friends from school.  Did you guys have a good time?"
"Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.	What do you like the most?"
"I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.	That is nice. It is nice to be patient."
"No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?	Wow, you are so lucky, what would you call it?"
"I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.	Thats wonderful.. how old is she?"
"She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.	what show was it"
"You know you could still do it. I know you can.	Oh yeah? What techniques do you have to overcome this fear?"
"My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.	Amazing! What a good son you must have raised!"
"He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!	that is very nice of you"
"You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.	Great. Are you ready for it?"
"It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.	Well, even if you don't succeed, at least you tried.  I'm sure it will make you feel better."
"I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.	Haha I'm sure it was! Did you eat it?"
"Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.	Well at least there was trash in there. You can't always smell it all."
"Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.	Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.	Thats amazing, what store is it?"
"It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.	Wow, that does sound cool. Maybe you can find one that does not have all of those things?"
"I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her.	It must be nice to be able to spend time with someone you love."
"I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!	That's very isolating. Every time I've been I've just been thinking Wow I could live here for a while, I'll get to go hang out with my friends later."
"It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!	Wow, where are you from?"
"Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!	Are you going to move there permanently?"
"I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.	I'm so sorry to hear that. You must be so worried."
"Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.	I am glad that you have a support system like that."
"I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.	I think we have much to learn as a species about how to treat others and not be afraid to be angry."
"We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!	how is it divising you? I mean one thing leads to another and so on and so forth..."
"Me too! <fist bump> ;-)	So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.	Wow that's a long time. Do you feel bad for them?"
"He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.	Did you ask to go out on a date?"
"I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.	oh no, bad drivers are so annoying"
"I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?	I agree with you. No one should have to put others lives in danger."
"You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.	What happened to her?"
"She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.	Oh that's awful! How awful for you! I hope she's doing better now!"
"I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.	I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.	Nothing can hurt you, keep trying!"
"Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too.	Don't be so hard on yourself.  Some people just have to ""go"" and others have to ""not"" make any kind of connection."
"One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.	That is exciting for her too!  What does she major in?"
"She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year.	I can see that. I have never tried to be a dentist."
"June and July are very busy, June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.	That does sound very stressful! Did everything work out okay for you?"
"So much for relaxing during the summer?	i love taking my daughter to the beach"
"Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.	I have always wanted to do it."
"It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.	Where were you praying?"
"You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.	I think I will.. I always like taking chances in life! Why do you say that?"
"I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food	That's great! Has your diet been tested or is it a lifestyle choice?"
"I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all	I am glad you have found good ways to make healthy food!  That is an incredible accomplishment!"
"I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.	Have you been taking them for a while now?"
"oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great	When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.	I'm so sorry to hear that. Were you able to be there for her?"
"I was and she was had a full recovery.	That's great!  How did you recover?"
"Me neither, my mom means so much to me.	That's really nice of her!"
"Do you get to see your mom often?	Not very often. She lives in another state."
"I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!	Cool, have you ever driven one?"
"It was blue with white racing stripes.	That sounds so scary!"
"Same here, they are pretty expensive.	My dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day. Now I have to throw them out.	That is so annoying. Did you have the same problem with the other shoes?"
"This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.	Oh no, what happened to her shoes?"
"My wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner.	What was it"
"She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert.	Who doesn't love a good cheesecake?"
"Thank you! What is your favorite meal?	I like anything with cheese, pizza, and steak. But I eat it as a side dish a lot"
"Me too, do you have a favorite flavor?	My long term boyfriend and I broke up recently. I'm so lost right now.	I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have supportive friends to help you through this tough time?"
"I know, it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together.	I know right. Sometimes one thing leads to another. What happened with your first place?"
"My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry.	Did you enjoy it?"
"He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.	Carrots are sooo good! And the potatoes are great too."
"I got a promotion in work. I am so excited for the raise and added responsibility.	Congratulations on getting a promotion! It must be a great feeling, especially since you have put in the hard work to get it."
"Thank you, I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.	Congratulations! It's great to work toward a good cause."
"I work in the military	My daughter can say so many new words, love to see her thrive!	That's cool! What kind of words does she say?"
"Yes, thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?	I do, and its wonderful. No, I don't have children, but I had a great life with mine."
"I've got all of my bags packed, passport ready, and i'm not even leaving for vacation until next week.	where are you going"
"I'm going to Japan. I'm so excited, I've never been.	Wow, that sounds exciting. How long will you be staying?"
"So my parents took me out to dinner for my birthday tonight.	Oh, that is pretty nice. Did you enjoy it?"
"Thanks! I had an awesome time. I went to a sushi place and it was delicious.	Oh, I love sushi!  I had some yesterday."
"I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had, haha.	What kind of roll?"
"So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!	Sounds nice. You must have been rather weather conscious."
"It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?	No, I've never been to a park. I'm afraid I would get lost in the crowds lol"
"It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.	That sounds lonely.  Do you have a pet you could call?"
"That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!	Wow, that is pretty far. Do you enjoy the military?"
"Whenever we moved abroad, I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.	wow that is such good natural talent i bet you are super grateful"
"Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.	You're quite welcome. What is your favorite thing about living?"
"Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive! We've lived in Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Zurich -- Alaska may be next. (And Italy is awesome, by the way!)	It's my brother's 16th birthday in a couple days and he's probably getting a nicer car than I currently have. I'm 24.	Did he buy you a new car?"
"I certainly am! Of course, I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.	Well with Honda, every car is junk. So you know for sure"
"So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore. Score!	That's so exciting! You must be a great sibling."
"Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?	Yeah I do. Do you want to ask them about it?"
"I saw somebody I hadn't in years. It was a nice meeting.	Who was it?"
"Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.	That's great that you had a chance to do so. How did it go?"
"I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!	What sort of things do you miss most?"
"Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?	I visit fairly often.  We're long distance, so it's always a struggle getting used to visiting after long distance."
"I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman.	I bet that was embarrassing! What did you do?"
"I respectfully told her I was not interested, I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.	That is respect. She is asking for it though. If you already have a wife why would you need to ask for another one?"
"I recently attended a play. My friend's acting was significant!	That's great! How did you feel when you watched it?"
"I am very glad that I went and supported him.	Glad you went and did something good.  Who are we talking about?"
"Sometimes when I'm driving home after a holiday, such as christmas, I get an overwhelming sense of being alone.	Maybe you should think about getting a dog."
"No I haven't, but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!	Anytime. No problem. Just don't listen to people advice that your not sure about."
"So I recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe I found and it turned out great!	I love wing sauce. Did you make a new recipe?"
"Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.	Wow! Did you do it alone or with a team?"
"I recently completed some additional training at my job. Perhaps a promotion is on its' way?	i hope so, maybe you get to go on a vacation and earn some extra money"
"Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.	Indeed. Especially after the recent events in the company. You have to stay on top of the situation to prevent them from Softying you."
"I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!	Cangratulations!!!!  You must be so proud!  I have two boys already and want to have a boy, but we still haven't decided on a name.  What is his name?"
"I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.	I have very supportive husbands too. That is a blessing."
"So last night I was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone.	What kind of videos? Were they scary?"
"Yes, I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?	Not really."
"I'm ready for football season to start, NFL preseason started this week, and I can't wait for regular season and I'm really looking forward to the NCAA kickoff!	Oh cool. I'm not much of an NFL fan, but I'm a college football fan.  Do you guys have your own teams or are you hoping to do the combine?"
"In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama	Ah, an American Football fan. How have you been watching the college game?"
"I visited the BMX park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike, it was insane!	I would have cried if I saw that."
"I agree, years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV	That is true. I do not watch TV."
"My car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop. I think I'm going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks.	That was nice. I hope your friend is not upset with you."
"It was just the carburetor, which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.	Carburetor? I've never heard of that."
"I was so set on getting an A on my math test that I studied so hard to do good on it. I studied for days!	It's nice when you can get a B or better. What grade did you get?"
"I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.	Thats awesome, good job."
"My friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago, I'm still in shock.	Oh no that is terrible. I am so sorry."
"They've been really closed up about the whole thing, I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time, I could not imagine.	I am so sorry to hear that you are going through this. I hope everything works out for the best."
"I realized yesterday I was pregnant, I was in shock!	Oh no. Congratulations! How did that make you feel?"
"I am still in awe, I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.	What things did you think would happen?"
"When the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area, I was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood.	Oh wow I could not imagine that! I hope you were ready for it as well as possible."
"I had an emergency generator, extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.	Wow, you are so brave."
"I stole a candy and drink from the gas station once, I felt terrible about the whole ordeal.	Oh wow, I hope you didn't get caught."
"I was 17, at that age I should of known better.	Oh no what happened? Are you okay now?"
"My friend has had the flu, and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.	Oh wow. That's so nice of you to do. Has he been ill for a while?"
"Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well, just whiny.	What did he do?"
"I managed to get on the A honor roll at my school, I was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing.	That's fantastic!  I know you were proud of yourself.  What school did you go to?"
"I'm just happy that I got it, it took a lot of hard work.	Congratulations, what are you going to do with your winnings?"
"The last time I hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie.	What was the movie? I'm always looking for something to watch."
"Yeah, it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it, making fun of the movie while it was on.	What movie was it?"
"I remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview.  I was sweating and couldn't stop my leg from shaking.	what happened at the end of it"
"The interview went well and I ended up getting the job, so I guess I worried for nothing :)	Congratulations, I hope you like the job"
"The other day I had to take my dogs out before work, but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so I couldn't get out.	Oh no, I take my dog to the vet every day. We usually run into each other at the least."
"She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work, but not this time.	I'm glad you could relate. Sometimes I feel like my girlfriend is cheating on me, when she really doesn't mean anything to me."
"I was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and I fell to the floor. Everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor. My face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up.	I bet that was embarrassing.  Did it take long to get up?"
"Now I can laugh, but when I was on the floor I was not laughing, I just wanted to leave.	LOL....You were probably in a hurry to leave or something.  I know it is probably not a good habit to have as a kid."
"My son is 16 months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork. I've been trying to teach him for a couple of months!	I bet that is so frustrating, and very difficult. You must be so proud of him!"
"He is still very messy but he really enjoys eating like a big boy	That sounds disgusting! I'm sorry to hear that. You should get him checked out by a doctor."
"When my wife and I started dating, our second date ended up lasting like 12 hours.	Oh wow, why did it last that long?"
"Lunch, a zoo, my apartment for a while, and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P	Yea that sounds like a pretty awesome night."
"Years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure.  I found him in the kitchen in the morning, he did not go easily :(	That is sad, it can be heart wrenching to lose a pet."
"Yeah, he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.	dang thats awful.. hope he is doing better now!"
"I remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail	wow, you must be very proud of yourself, how did you like the job?"
"Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one	Oh no!!! How many times have you had to do that?"
"I realized that my bus that I ride to work in every day is a revamped school bus	Wow, you must be excited to take it on the road more often!"
"Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is!	Oh man, if you have fond memories, I think you will be happier in life."
"I broke up with my girlfriend last week and it was really hard	I'm sorry. How long were you together?"
"Yeah we where together for about 2 years but im getting over it now	Oh, don't get too over it! I'm sure everything will be just fine and dandy in the end. Are you far apart now?"
"I was out at dinner with my family, and when coming back to the table from the bathroom I somehow accidentally sat down with a different family.	Oh man that must have been embarrassing"
"Yeah, it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P	haha yeah i guess everyone has their bad days.."
"We are getting our son to go back to college in a few days and it really made me stop and think back to him when he was smaller, and how time flies by so fast!	Aww, what a wonderful memory to have! A moment that will be hard to cherish!"
"I know, that's about how I felt too! I think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!	It is the same for me. It is funny that they will teach your child that without pain they are no longer your children. It gives them true meaning."
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped and fell. There were so many people around that saw me hit the ground. You can imagine how I felt!	oh no thats scary! you shouldn't feel bad if you didnt trip though!"
"I scuffed my knees a bit, but I was okay. I was also with a person that I really liked, so that made it even worse. But, I jumped up super quick lol	Dang, I hope you feel better soon."
"i stold some spare change from my parents	That was very nice of you.  What did you change for?"
"maybe like 19, but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner	Oh, sorry to hear that. You are a good person then"
"Yeah i told them as well	My sister passed away several years ago. I really had a hard time with the grief and couldn't really relate to anyone that tried to help me with it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, I know how that can feel."
"Yes, I'm sure you can relate as well. Ironically, that was the same age that my sister passed away. She took her own life, which my mother and I found her, and it was very hard for us all. But, I couldn't burden my parents with my pain, I felt.	Sibling rivalries are interesting"
"Having a good job is something to thank	i agree with you"
"to life God to that higher energy	I think you mean higher than God, right? I don't know much about physics, to be honest."
"Nobody ... that's why I'm grateful	I'm grateful for what?"
"I'm an administrative assistant for a construction company	What does that mean?"
"I was devastated when I lost my phone	oh no, what happened?"
"I did but it took a while	What took so long?"
"I was surprised when my family threw me a surprise party	Oh. Was it your birthday?"
"I turned 34	Oh wow. How do you feel about that?"
"i didn't see my parents since 2014! I miss them so much. it's so sad that i live in a different country	Oh wow I'm sorry to hear that! I hope you can visit them soon!"
"actually in 2 weeks! I'm so excited about it. I'm going there with my son! They've never met him	That's cool! Where did you meet him?"
"I was annoyed when my favorite show wasn't on	Was it on USA? I know they have some issues."
"I ended up watching Impractical Jokers	That's a good show.  I've heard of it.  Is it a laughing show or a sad one?"
"I love when I need to show someone how to do something and everything goes off without a hitch.	Those are the best times in life!"
"Fortunately it's usually just not having the best answer for what they ask. I've learned and prepared a lot more this time.	Thats good. They will find out eventually."
"I tend to know a thing or two on occasion.	I am taking a long overdue and much needed vacation this week. I wish i didnt have to fly.	Oh, are you going by yourself?"
"I usually do pretty good on short flights. Longer ones make me a little nervous.	I'm with you. I always worry about going on long flights."
"I hate turbulence too.	I didnt think to invite my sister to a party I recently helped put on.	Why didn't you invite her?"
"No she wasnt. In all fairness it was a group of people I never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with.	I would have thought the same. Did things work out or did things not work out?"
"you are right. Guess I know better for next time.	My sunday was great. All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.	That's good, it's nice to enjoy the work you've been working so hard."
"I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.	I feel your pain, I also live in a small town and there is hardly any grass so it is hard for me to see when it is being grown."
"ouch! I would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way.	Yeah, it is not a fun time of year for me either! Even in the summer months."
"My husband has to travel a lot for work. It can be hard on a marriage, but after almost 23 years of marriage, I have faith he is loyal and faithful when he does.	That is good to hear, travel can really add up."
"He is an iron worker, so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings.	Oh that sounds like work!  Do they have many projects under construction?"
"I've been married almost 23 years, but many years ago, my husband was acting a bit too ""chivalrous"" to a female acquaintance of ours. He said he was only being nice, but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice', which made me feel a bit upset.	Oh that's not so bad. I married my husband 19 years ago, we've had to be very subtle about things, but you said he was being too nice. So did I. I married my wife very politely, but I think she liked being invisible, so we kept it a secret for a little bit. We're all about being inconsiderate sometimes, if you catch me."
"Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.	At least he didn't hit on her, that is a positive I suppose."
"My niece is super talented lately.	Oh, that's awesome to hear! What kind of instrument does she play?"
"Art, she was accepted into a special program for high school.	How special is that?"
"Mostly drawing. And she's in advanced level classes in most subjects.	One day my 10 year old daughter came home crying after she got off the bus. A teenage boy purposely tripped her as she was getting off and she got hurt. Needless to say, I was very, very upset!	Aww, poor baby, did she apologize to you and get off the bus?"
"I actually knew his father, so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.	That was very nice of you. I'm glad you felt confident enough to do that."
"I really dont like my husbands job right now.	Oh no! Have you tried to talk to him about it?"
"Retail, but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks	That doesn't sound fun."
"We are hoping with in a few months.	Each year my husband usually gets a bonus this month or next. It's not promised, but it has happened for several years now. I am really wishing it will be this year too!	Makes you wish you had a large bonus!"
"Well, we have college tuition, just got back from an expensive beach vacation, etc. So, if anything replenish some savings, right!	But what if you get a bill of error?"
"I hate watching movies that are full of gore! I just saw one today and so gross!	Yeah movies with lots of blood and guts always make me feel sick for some reason. Did you see it?"
"Yes, I was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off. yuck!	oh my god thats awful, please tell me someone recorded it"
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	I would be nervous to be that invested in a company."
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	Is it a large one?"
"He is a welder and iron worker, so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel. He has earned it!	I've been married a long time, but my husband is gone quite a bit for work. I feel a bit by myself at times because of this :(	That's sad. Maybe you should get out more?"
"Luckily, my children still live at home, but it's not quite the same. Plus, it won't be too long before they are ready to move out	I can imagine, I have 4 children myself."
"My youngest child started high school this year. It really made me think back to her starting kindergarten, and how time really goes by. I can just see her learning to read!	I understand, starting a new year can feel like a huge change!"
"Yes, it really is bittersweet. But, the older they get, the easier it is to think back to the younger days!	Very true! Yesterday I was looking back to when my daughter was about 10 and it made me remember the good times I had with her as a child."
"I was so scared when i heard a gunshot sound while i was walking through the streets the other day	oh my god. i would have freaked out. what was it?"
"No, i felt it would be better if i dont go looking for it. i managed to get the hell out of there	Well, whatever you decide to do it for, I wish you the best of luck! Maybe the stray dog you find will be a better companion."
"I feel so sad whenever thoughts about my dad come to me, he passed away last year	I'm so sorry to hear that.  I lost both of mine recently.  It can't be easy."
"He had terminal stage brain cancer.. we did all we could, but..	that is so terrible. i am so sorry."
"i felt really good about myself when i got a new job at a reputed firm	Congrats, its always satisfying to feel confident.  Is it your first job?"
"i was so angry when i found out my girlfriend kissed a friend of mine	Why is that?"
"i have not confronted them. still thinking about it	Why haven't you confronted them?"
"I went to the beach last week	oh really? I love going to the beach. Was it your first time?"
"yeah. so much memories of me and family spending time in beach came to me	Well, hopefully you have things that can help you forget those bad memories."
"I was so furious when i found out a coworker badmouthed me to my boss	Some people are jerks."
"Yeah. i outperform this person, and he started throwing shade on me out of pure jealousy	That's terrible that he did that.  Why do you think he was jealous?"
"I went to see Hamilton last month in NYC	How did you enjoy it? I've never been"
"It was such a stunning show. Lin manuel should get a grammy for this	What show was it?"
"I was so ashamed when i threw up in public the other day	Oh no, what did you eat then/"
"Yeah, i felt like i was coming down with something. i rushed to get a cab, but i couldn't help it	oh no, what happened?"
"My girlfriend asked me to meet her parents next week	Do you think you will? Do you have a good relationship with them?"
"I am not sure to be honest. i am feeling so nervous about it	Oh no! I think that's normal! Get to the bathroom and take a shower! That is what I always do. You'll feel better!"
"i felt betrayed when my girlfriend kissed another guy at a party	Was she unfaithful?"
"Nothing. She was drunk, so i let it go. I still feel disappointed	oh no, how did she get drunk"
"I was really upset when my daughter went into labor and I couldn't be there.	i am really sorry to hear that"
"She lives in another state and wasn't due for several more months. Everyone is fine now though, so it has turned out to be very joyous.	What state is that?"
"I was in total shock the night my fiance proposed to me at a concert.	That sounds pretty amazing."
"They started playing one of our special songs and the next think I knew he was down on one knee. I said yes, of course!	They played Who's song was it?"
"I admire my boss because he does not act like a boss. He acts more like a friend and he is so down to earth.	Sounds like my boss! Except he act like a boss, lol."
"He is not just friendly, he is a good leader and knows how to treat his workers.	That is so great that he is so approachable! I am a teacher and he is approachable."
"I remember when I was a kid and in the summertime I used to catch fireflies and place them in a jar by my bedside at night.	Oh those were the days. I can still vividly picture it."
"The fireflies would blink in the jar all night long.	Oh wow, how night terrors! Did they ever get to you?"
"I'm so tired this morning, I went to bed early, but it seems when I go to bed early I wake up more tired. It aggravates me!	I understand! I am in that boat! I hate being tired!"
"I hate it! I feel more energized when I get 4 hours of sleep than I do when I get 8!	That's interesting, do you feel more energetic when you have more sleep than when you have less?"
"I'm in contract to buy my first house, fingers crossed closing goes well and I close next Friday!	Thats a good feeling isnt it.  Good luck with that."
"I'm definitely excited. The house just now got built and I saw it for the first time last Monday.	Wow you must be really excited. Is this your first time?"
"My Mother and I made plans to hang out and do lunch this past week.	ah, sounds like you got a good setup. Are you happy to do it?"
"Unfortunately she was unable to make it because her diabetes is wreking her health.	That's really sad. Hopefully she can get some help in the meantime."
"I am feeling bad because my grandchild wants me to play all the time but I have to work a lot.	I know what you mean. Grandchild's always want to do everything, but adult responsibilities are much more demanding. I just try not to think too hard on it."
"She doesn't understand why I always have so many other things to do, but she would literally play 24/7 if I had the time.	I feel you, man. My girlfriend only has one job and it's to clean and do housework for other women. She's a stay at home mom, too."
"My four year old daughter came to me beaming with pride and showing me a drawing she did of me.	That's awesome!  What did you do to her?"
"I was really surpised.  I expected a stick figure, but she drew a lot of features including my beard and mustache.	how long have you been drawing for this."
"I had to run some errands.  While gone I instructed my older daughters to complete some math assignments.	That's very nice of you to have them complete, must have been a relief."
"When I returned I found them playing video games, the math work was not even attempted.  I tunred their stuff off and we did it together.	You are skilled"
"A recruiter contacted me the other day about potential job openings, so I'm hoping I may have a job soon!	I hope you get a good job, that sounds exciting."
"Me too. I've been dying to get out of my current job, but having a recruiter makes me feel at ease.	It always feels good to have someone that will help you in the future."
"I found a box of old photos in my closet yesterday.	oh really find anything cool?"
"A lot of them where photos of my sister and I when we were toddlers.  It was a good trip down memory lane.	That must've been really nostalgic, not knowing what you'd have looked like 15 years later."
"I was disgusted when my dad left me	Why do you think that is?"
"I'm not sure. I guess he just didn't want anything to do with me.	What happened?"
"I have been rehearsing for a job interview for a couple of weeks now, and I am so ready!	I'm sure you'll do great!"
"I don't normally prepare for interviews, but I really want this job, so I put in a lot of practice.	What kind of job is it?"
"I went to the fride and was surprised to find what I thought was an ice cream cake.	Cool! What kind of cake was it?"
"It turned out to not even be an ice cream cake.  It was some kind of pinapple cake.  I still had a piece but it was disappointing.	Oh, well that's disappointing!  Don't let it get you down, there's plenty of cake out there still too."
"I was surprised when my wife left me	I'm sorry to hear that, why did she leave?"
"We were married for 10 years	How did you keep it together that long?"
"I was annoyed when my family missed my birthday	I would have been too, how come they didn't invite you?"
"Yeah that's very true. Doesn't mean we aren't important though	You're very important to me!"
"Interestingly, I also had a job interview recently, although I've already heard back and I got it!	Congratulations! That is great news. What job did you interview for?"
"A lab manager for a Physics department at a University.	ohh, how does that make you feel"
"I had a terrifying experience what using the restroom yesterday.	Oh! Tell me more! What happened?"
"As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise.  When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.	That must have been quite a shock!"
"When I was younger, my dad got into a motor cycle accident. It made me not want to learn how to drive for almost 2 years.	Sorry to hear that. Did he get okay?"
"I did learn, but it took a long time to overcome my fear. I'm glad I eventually did!	How long did you go for?"
"I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience, and not altogether pleasant.	Wow, I would imagine, having to deal with something that new would be very frightening. What was wrong with it?"
"Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard, but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident.	what kind of dva"
"In college I was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper.	What kind of ideas did she steal?"
"It's ok.  I'm basically over it now, but it was really angering then.	How so because you over reacted or what"
"I was grateful when I married my wife	that is good."
"We met at a store	What did you guys buy?"
"When I was in college an older woman in a class of mine stole my ideas for a paper.	Oh my goodness that must have been so embarrassing!"
"Well, ranted about it to my girlfriend for a while then talked to the professor to make it clear what she did.	Oh, did she get mad?"
"My family and I are close to aquiring a new home.	Are you excited?"
"IIt is an older home in need of some repairs.  We can't wait to get started on renovations.	Wow, it's been in need of some repairs for a long time? I hope they aren't too costly."
"I was excited when I bought my car	What kind of car did you get?"
"It was a mustang. I saved up enough money and purchased it outright	What color is it?"
"I was fast asleep this morning when my cat pounced on me and jolted me awake.	Thats funny. cats are mean sometimes"
"It came out of nowhere. I almost fell out of bed!	What did?  Was it a prank from someone?"
"I'm feeling a little down right now. The weather is perfect, but I miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset. Those were great times!	i completely understand that"
"Yeah, we would take a bottle of wine with us, watch the surfers and just kick back. Wish those days would return.	Yes, those were the days.  I miss the old days when we just kick back and relax!"
"Maybe one day. That was when I lived in Northern California - the best place on the planet, imho!	I am confident that I will win that spelling bee tomorrow	Wow! What was the question?"
"I have. I've studied for 3 week now	What do you think will happen?"
"I've been trying lately to potty train my youngest daughter.	I think that might be a good thing. My daughter is almost 2, and I'm sure she has a hard time with a lot of stuff."
"It's been a challenge.  Yesterday she got on the toilet herself though.  She said she didn't want to be a baby anymore.	wow she sure did!! i hate to ask but if she is a girl try lancing her periods to relieve stress"
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a while.  Dropping her off at the airport was really hard.	At least you had a chance to catch up with her."
"Yeah, we talk by text all the time and call every day.  It's still hard though, we haven't been apart longer than a couple days since we met.	That's sad"
"I was sad when my dog died	That is sad. What happened?"
"Its ok. It's just been rough without him. I miss him	I know how you feel. I have been missing my best friend too. What happened?"
"My wife is coming home after being out of the country for 2 months.  I can't wait!	I am jealous! Where did she go?"
"I am!  We've never been apart this long, so it's been tough.	I am sorry to hear that. When did you break up?"
"I was afraid when I watched a horror film	I've never really been a big fan of those kind of movies. What was the movie about?"
"Some have pop ups and they are creepy	Yeah I hate those. I turn off ad blocker"
"I'm going on vacation for the first time in several years!	Where to?"
"I'm taking a cruise to Alaska. I'm soooo excited.	That's great!  Are you going by yourself?"
"My wife is coming back into the country at the end of the weeks after 2 months away.  I can't wait!	I bet your excited"
"Germany for a language course.	how did it go?"
"I was prepared for tonights big dinner	Was it a birthday dinner?"
"It's going to be at my house. We are going to have a lot of food	Sounds fun, I hope you guys enjoy it!"
"I was terrified when I watched that horror movie	Oh no! I hate that kind of movies!"
"It was Scream	What was that?"
"I was digging through some old stuff I had and I found letters that my wife wrote me when we were still dating. They were so sweet.	That is really cool. Were you able to read them?"
"Yeah! It gave me all of the feels. I read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again.	That sounds wonderful! I love to read and talk to my characters."
"I managed to spook myself really bad once watching too many horror movies and being in a house alone by the woods.	Oh no! I love horror movies too. Was it a good movie?"
"Yeah.  I kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods.	Do you ever get weirded out by strange noises like footsteps or knocks?"
"I'm so proud of my wife	That's great! How long have you been married?"
"She really is	Who really is?"
"I was angry when my son destroyed my car	Oh no. Did you find out who did it?"
"no not salvagable. i had to buy a new one.	Oh wow I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're enjoying your new gaming rig!"
"its okay. gave me an opportunity for a new adventure	I'm starting a new job next week, and while I am excited, I am also very nervous!	You will do fine. Do you have a job lined up already?"
"That's true, but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous.	I understand, I get anxious whenever I have to make a decision about something."
"I had to go out of town and leave my dogs with a friend, I was worried about them.	Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Did you end up going?"
"Yeah.  They annoyed my friend some, but overall it was fine.	What did they do?"
"My wife has been in Germany for 2 months.  I can't wait till she gets home.	Where did she go?"
"It sucks, but it's best to keep busy with whatever you can.  Videogames helped a lot :P	What is your favorite game?"
"My wife has been out of the country for 2 months.  She's coming back soon, but it's been tough without her.	I am sure it will be worth it. Where has she been?"
"I'm looking forward to it :)	Ok good. How come?"
"I'm planning on moving to a new city, but I'm starting to get cold feet.	Are you in a bad city?"
"I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there?	I lived in a big city for a while and it was miserable. Just depends on where you live. I recommend online classes if you can"
"One of the things I had to do when I started my job was be in charge of moving a department.  When we were doing it, one of my coworkers bailed on me.	That's unfortunate, did you appreciate him?"
"There were others, but we needed all the help we could get.	What were some things you needed help with?"
"Everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! That movie was so amazing, I feel like i was holding my breath the whole time	What movie was it?"
"omg, you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it, it's about aliens	Really? Which movie is it?"
"it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff, and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it.	I know right. Some people make very enough to not have to work for anything."
"Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice.	Yea. sharing is caring."
"I was disgusted when I noticed the food on the table	Eww!  What kind of food was it?"
"It was brussel sprouts and Liver	Oh wow. That must have been a treat to eat."
"I have a lab mix and he is so well behaved and listens to commands so well. I'm glad I got him as a puppy.	Yeah dogs are the best! They are the most curious bunch of dogs you can ever meet"
"oh yea. Basically started the day we got him. That definitely helped.	What's wrong?"
"Yes. I couldnt' handle a dog I have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff.	Why? I just had a dog myself and shut myself up all the time too."
"My friend just recently moved to California...It makes me sad because I have always wanted to live there.	You can always try to go to Orange county. Its not as big but I hear its beautiful."
"Yeah...I really am. I've wanted to live there since I was a little girl. Someday I will!	Yes! someday you will get to"
"When I was planning my wedding, the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication.	That's annoying when you have to talk to someone else to get the service you want."
"Yeah, we dropped them with enough time to find someone else, but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.	I know it sounds bad, but sometimes stress gets the best of us."
"It is so frustrating having to deal with difficult customers that don't want to pay their bills/	I understand.  Those customers are making a bad impression on you."
"Normally I would agree. It only seems to be a few here and there. Most of the time I dont have problems.	i live in a small town and its not like other places it seems like everyone has problems"
"We are a retail outfit. So we have some big customers that pay on established terms.	I'm going overseas in 2 weeks! I will be on vacaion for 1 months and I just CAN NOT wait@	Wow, that's amazing!  I hope you have some good time"
"Where did you go?	I went to the park to meet with my mom."
"I just about had a figurative heart attack the other night.	OH! What happened?!"
"I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door.	Where was it?"
"I'm very annoyed because my friend didn't give me my money back	That is a very annoying friend. I am sorry, have you tried talking to him?"
"Yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back	What happened, did you get in trouble?"
"I typically procrastinate when needing to pack for a trip. But this time I got my butt in gear and it's all done several days early.	Thats awesome!  Where ya going?"
"Thanks. I usually get somewhere and realize I forgot a bunch of stuff I need cause I packed in a rush 30 minutes before leaving.	Oh no! Maybe you can go the next day and get everything back that you missed?"
"Fortunately, my wife usually comes to the rescue on me.	She sounds like a keeper"
"My wife was working yesterday, but she ended up taking the rest of the day off to spend time with me! I was shocked.	Wow, that's awesome of her!  What did you guys do?"
"We did! We went out for lunch and hung out on the beach. It was very relaxing and a nice change.	thats awesome! you are clearly happier now"
"I went to a restaurant my wife really likes with some friends while she was at work.  It's not a big thing, but I felt a little bad about it :P	Ah, I see. What kind of restaurant was it?"
"Not like really bad, just kind of bad that I went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn't go.  It's not a big deal, but I feel bad when I do things like that.	Oh yeah I know what you mean"
"That horror movie made me terrified	It's okay to be afraid! Some movies make you think you're having a bad experience. Which one was it?"
"Scream	Screaming gets my blood boiling. What about it?"
"I really want to have another baby. Baby fever is real lol I don't want to be all crazy about it, don't wanna track ovulation and do all this but i really wanna get pregnant asap	Oh no!  Is the other woman a guy or girl?"
"thank you :) oh yeah, you can track ovulation, measure basal body temperature, etc. I'm not gonna go into details	Well, you're more than welcome to go into those more detail about it if you'd like. That is very interesting."
"My mom bought be a book online.  It should be here today I'm just waiting on the delivery man.	What kind of book is it?"
"Yes it is.  She wanted two options so I wouldn't know which she'd pick.  She picked the right one so now it's just a waiting game.	What are the 2nd choices?"
"It is nice to have in-laws that are accepting and loving. So many people don't have a good relationship with their in-laws.	I definitely agree.  It's good to find someone that feels right at home in a relationship."
"Aw I'm sorry. Mine is only a few years old but it's been smooth sailing so far.	That is great, It sounds like he has a good future ahead"
"I have been trying to get my oldest son to be more responsible.  I started out small by asking him to adopt a good sleep schedule.  After several weeks he still hasn't.	Is there something wrong with his sleep schedule?"
"He does well enough in school.  I think that might make him think he doesn't need any disciple in everyday life.  Make me worry a bit.	You shouldn't listen to him, he's crazy!"
"My wife usually sniffs out anything going on, but I was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing.	WOW! that is great!! you must really trust her"
"Yes. Friends, family, cake, all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.	That really sucks to hear. Does she live far away?"
"Thank you. Probably wont be able to do it again, but happy it worked this time.	I am so grateful for my wife	That's nice to hear. How long have you been married?"
"She really is! I couldn't be where I am without her	Who is she?"
"I can handle, bees, scorpions, wasps, crickets, and spiders.  But for some reason I lose my mind around roaches.	Oh yea. I hate those things too"
"I take some conselation in that, however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.	Haha, that is great! I take some comfort in knowing that my kids will laugh at me sometimes for doing what I am trying to prevent."
"I feel guilty because I couldn't go to my friends party	It's okay, you can make it up to them."
"I was working and I couldn't leave early	that is bad, did you got fired?"
"As a momma's boy I always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time.	I completely understand. Is she somewhere nearby?"
"Fortunately, she rarely was gone for long periods of time, but I always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do.	Oh that is very bad but good for her"
"Oh it's great.	I am so excited about going to the movies	What movies do you want to see?"
"I'm going to see the purge. I have been waiting to see it for a while	That sounds like a really scary movie! I am sorry you are going to see it though."
"I saw a homeless lady and i felt so bad for her because it was so hot outside so went to five guys and bought her some food and cold drinks	Oh that is really nice of you.  It is nice to be able to help others in need."
"blessing bags?? what are those?	They are convenient little bags to carry around in the back."
"wow that's a great idea! I will do the same! thanks for sharing	The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.	That's pretty neat. Did it bring back a lot of memories?"
"Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it, so I don't really know which one, but you can find a bunch on there.	that sounds awesome! I love finding cool stuff on etsy"
"Well, what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems, and I was right.	Nice. Did you drive 1 hour straight?"
"Six days in all, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.	You must have really enjoyed seeing the country, what kind of places did you see?"
"It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas, some with free coffee!	Oh yeah it's great to rest if you're not used to it. It's like exercising keeps you level headed."
"Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!	what do you do for fun?"
"I have big renovation plans for my house.  I've made a money plan and have kept to it so far.	I wish you luck! I'm sure you've worked very hard."
"Yes, hopefully it will all go as planned.  So far so good.	That's good. Hopefully everything goes as planned."
"I was so anxious for my kid to graduate	That can be stressful. What happened?"
"It did. I'm very proud of him	You sound very happy for him. What did he do to deserve that?"
"I didn't really try to use weight but i started going to the pool and i actually lost a couple of lbs	You can still lose weight if you're dedicated. What motivated you to start doing that?"
"it's really fun and it's also a great exercise! Plus water is so relaxing	I can just imagine it is nice after a hard day's work. Do you do this often?"
"I hope when I get older, Im not lonely as I am now	I hope so too! You're never alone in the house you're living in!"
"I was engaged but my woman left me	That is awful. Did she say why?"
"I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.	That's awesome. Phil Collins is such a great songwriter."
"Yeah, for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.	Yeah i can relate"
"I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.	Oh no, did something come up where you could put pressure on him?"
"True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.	Finding a good creative way to make money is the hard part."
"K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there, but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.	Haha, yeah i can relate to that,  my mom used to play scary games with her kids when we were kids!"
"It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.	Oh no, what happened next?"
"Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified, but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.	I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.	did you use one the other day? what was lagging"
"Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie, and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.	Did you look into it any more?"
"My eldest niece, who helps take care of her younger disabled sister, graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.	Very nice. It is great to see that kind of recognition among such people."
"Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.	She's very lucky to have a friend willing to help her."
"I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.	I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.	Just go for it! You'll be fine!"
"Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.	I understand that completely. Maybe you should have a talk with her."
"I really wanted to try bison meet and I went all the way to that whole foods store like 57 miles away and they didn't have it, what a waste of time	Oh, that's a shame! Do you not like hunting?"
"thank you! I hope i can find it somewhere locally. i've heard bison meat is very lean and good	I've heard the same thing! It's a shame it's so expensive though."
"My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.	Can he beamed by your rottweilers habit?"
"Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.	Oh ok,  that's not good"
"It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.	I bet that is boring. How long will he be gone?"
"I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(	Ah, that could be tough. He's a good person anyway."
"I once walkd around the grocery store without knowing my fly was down.	Did anyone notice?"
"I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.	Wow. What did you do?"
"It's been a hard day today, its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.	Sometimes it's good to take some time for the mind to reset. Take a walk, get some cuddles, and get some noise on the weekends to keep things level."
"In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!	Oh that's too bad. What rank is he in the military?"
"My young niece, who is disabled, was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.	Is the surgery successful?"
"Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.	Oh wow, that sounds awful."
"It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too, but they live in Scotland.	I have this cat that loves to cause issues	Is it a cat or a dog?"
"Like last night. She decided that she wanted to jump on the table	Oh no! Did you intervene?"
"I have tried to complete a work assigment three times now without sucuess.	That is tough, I'm sorry to hear that."
"Doubtful.  I will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull.	You can't give up! I believe in you"
"I couldn't go to movies to watch The greatest showman when it came out so my husband bought this movie when it came out. he is sweet	Oh ok what movie is it?"
"it's called The Greatest Showman. it's a musical! So good!! I watched it so many times already	I think I have seen that movie."
"A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would.	Wow, thats some dedication.  You must have felt really strong about it."
"It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker.	oh im sorry about that"
"That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover.	My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.	Oh no. I hate when that happens. Have you called her to let her know?"
"Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.	Oh no. I hope you are okay?"
"It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.	That must be so nice to be able to have your own place, and able to rely on your family for support. I'm glad you have a home to call on."
"After such a long time we certainly will.  I can't wait to start making the house into our home.	That sounds like a lot of hard work!"
"Our pet cat will need to be put down soon.	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"Yes we've had her since the begining.  She is older now and has suffered with feline AIDS for awhile.	I am so sorry to hear that.  Do you know what kind of cat she is?"
"It really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street	That's really sad. Have you seen any pictures or videos of them doing anything bad?"
"I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity	That's very nice of you. Some people would find it difficult to donate even if there was no need."
"My husband shocked me the other day	surprise is the best gift a can receive! Were you happy?"
"He threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death!	Wow that sounds like fun! What was it?"
"I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.	I guess because they don't have much else to live for."
"No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?	What makes you think that?"
"I was planning to view the stars last night, but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.	Jupiter always seems to get a little shadowy around here and there. How did you manage?"
"It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.	What's wrong?"
"A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.	A new baby also means more responsibility.  How is your evening going?"
"Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.	It's not necessarily jealousy - I've done the same work for my husband.  It's more like gratitude I suppose."
"My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!	That is really great that she is so caring. You guys sound very lucky"
"I'm sure that's hard at times. I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.	I know how you feel. I'm right there with you on that. I'm so close to my mom, too. We have kids, too."
"I am dreading the two hour trip to the grocery store this week.	Oh, well it's not so bad. The shorter the trip the easier it is. shorter trips usually make it easier"
"Me too!! Being so far out, it takes forever to get anywhere. I miss civilization lol.	I get where you are coming from! civilization was a dream"
"We are workcamping in the mountains of NM. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours to get anywhere lol. We havent seen new faces around here in months lol.	im really exited to go to disneyland on vacation next summer	Oh yea me too! Are you flying or driving?"
"yes im staying at the hotel for the first time i am really happy	It's always nice to stay at a hotel for a while, but it can get overwhelming once you've been there a lot."
"I finished a class and most of my classmates got an A! It took a lot of work.	What kind of class was it"
"It sure does! I am so proud of the hard work that everyone put in!	What kind of work do you do?"
"I have the best kids in the world.	that's a good thing, i think."
"Lots of little stuff.  They love to draw me pictures, crack jokes, and give lots of kisses.	Oh, I bet that tickles your fancy! They love to do that too."
"My husband has been putting in so many extra hours at work	Well, at least he's doing his job."
"Oh I am pampering the heck out of him! It got him a promotion!	Nice! Tell him congrats :D"
"I just got laid off from my job. I need the paycheck so this is not a good situation.	I am so sorry to hear that. Have you been laid off before or is this new?"
"I am going to apply for new positions. Hopefully I will get something soon.	That would be great.  Perhaps you could see someone in the office."
"I work in I.T.! Thanks for asking!	I just applied for a new job! It is a job that I have always wanted.	That's excellent. What kind of job is it?"
"Thank you! Have you ever applied to your dream job?	I have. I've been interviewing for many different ones. But I'm not sure if I like the job I'm applying for."
"i ahte when my Girlfriend goes to the club alone	ohh good for you. It's a sign of love"
"Yeah it makes me really jelous when guys talk to her	I think that's normal, do you have a girlfriend?"
"When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!	That is a great story. Did you get to know your cousin?"
"It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!	Oh wow, that's amazing. I don't know too many people who get to visit."
"We certainly did. Where I was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs, restaurants etc. so we'd go to the beach and then party at night. Brilliant fun!	My Keurig just died. This is the third coffee pot in less than a year!	Oh no! I'm so sorry! That's so hard."
"I agree! I am so disgusted right now!!! We drink a lot of coffee lol. Its a 2 hour drive to the closest town to get another one too.	Woah! Two hours?! I would have to get up really early to do that!"
"We travel fill-time in our RV so I don't really have room to carry a back up. I hope our next location is more accessible to civilization.	I just had to move across country to a new job.	wow, thats a huge change, are you happy?"
"I am actually! I was so ready for it. I basically studied moving so that everything would be easy	That's great! There's nothing like studying to get prepared!"
"One day my daughter got off the bus and was crying. An older boy intentionally tripped her as she got off the bus and she got hurt. This made me very upset and mad!	Sounds like a tough situation. Is she okay now?"
"He just thought it would be funny! He was also several years older than her and a teenager. Too old to know better!	What did he do?"
"We recently found out that our 15 year old son has a rare, degenerative neurological disease.	Oh no!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Hopefully everything turns out okay for him."
"No, the doctors tell us there is no cure. They are trying to treat the symptoms but thus far its been unsuccessful.	Well, I'm sorry you're going through that."
"Thank you, its been scary. He has good days and bad.	The door bell rang last month. I wasn't expecting anyone, but it was my daughter and her family from way up north.	Whoa, that's really cool! Did you guys make it out safe?"
"I couldn't believe it. It had been almost a year since I saw them and she never even gave me a hint they were coming.	Oh wow, So it wasn't a total surprise, They are always coming."
"I've studied hard all night in order to make myself ready for tomorrow's test	I sure hope you are prepared!  What is the test about?"
"Repititions and exposure are my strategies.  Sumer semesters really ramp things up.	I have never been an outdoors person but i love school and school play do you do anything like that?"
"Going through an unused drawer I found old drawing from when my kids were little	Oh that's cool. What drew you on it?"
"While the actual incidents of each drawing are lost in time it did make me think back to when they were younger.	What kind of incidents?"
"I just had my husband remind me of when I fainted when he proposed!	Omg that's horrible! No one should ever remember that horrible experience. Was he mad?"
"I was so happy when I saw him get down on one knee that I just blacked out lmao	How'd he get up?"
"The news announced a tornado warning. I ignored it at first, but then the city tornado siren went off.	did you get your house okay? i grew up in miami and have always gone to work in palmetto heights so i understand the excitement and nervousness"
"I almost panicked as the winds started to gust, but thankfully it missed us. A few miles up the road weren't so lucky though. Always listen to those warnings	That's good you were so prepared!  You never know if it could have been a tornado or a bad snow storm.  Did you have to call it in?"
"I got a new puppy for my birthday! She is a cutie!	That is awesome! I bet your happy about it!"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	That's awesome! I have two bassets! They're the best!"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	Aww that's so sweet! I had a little doberman named Ducky when I was a kid."
"My neighbor ran into my car! They didn't even leave a note!	That's annoying. Does that happen often?"
"I could tell by the color of the paint left on my car, and their car now has a scrape with the color of my car. I don't know what to do.	That is horrible!  You should take it to the detailing place!"
"A thunderstorm raged all of last night! It kept me awake all night!	That sounds scary! Did you see anything?"
"It is quite frightening! I wish that I could overcome my fear.	overcome what fear"
"I just applied for graduate school! I feel good about my chances!	That's great! Are you going to accept the graduate school offer?"
"Thank you! I am very excited! It is quite unsettling though.	What exactly is unsettling about it?"
"I remember just taking a deep breath the other day in the garden and just feeling happy	What is that like?"
"I have a garden so fully packed that I can't see my neighbors at all!	Wow. That must be lovely."
"My neighbor really helped me out recently after a big windstorm.	Is it a pretty big windstorm?"
"No, they generously helped me clean up my yard and cut up a tree with their chainsaw, and they asked for nothing in return.	That's cool of them, I wish people would help more."
"My son just graduated from high school! He has worked so hard, and he even earned a scholarship.	You must be so proud of him. Is he going to college?"
"Thank you! He is going to study Computer Science!	Computer Science is very exciting."

"I slipped and fell in the restroom last week. The floors desperately needed cleaned.	Oh man, I have done that so many times at work! I hope your ok though."
"The only thing to get injured was my pride. It was quite the gross experience.	I can imagine! Was it a big accident or minor injury?"
"The other day Comcast customer service kept me waiting for 20 minutes just to speak with someone. What a disgrace!	Talk about unacceptable! What did they want to talk about?"
"They're awful. If they'd just employ enough cs people to handle the volume you could just about bear it!	You mean like they do now?"
"Mind you, their product is useless too. Ok, rant over!	Queue jumping is something which irks me no end. I was at the deli counter of my local store recently and some guy came up and started ordering. The employee served him, too.	That is a little strange.  Did you say anything to him?"
"Yes. And I'm disabled and it's hard to stand for a long time while some idiot gets his lunch. I hope it was horrible!	I am also disabled, and I find it hard to stand too. What do you do?"
"Perhaps salmonella poisoning? One can only hope, lol!	I am very glad we headed the warnings and evacuated prior to Hurricane Harvey.	The warnings cancelled my plans on going to the beach. What do you do now?"
"Yes it was a scary time. We stocked up on food and bottled water and moved our RV about an hour and a half inland. Luckily the storn went to the north of us.	Oh no. Is everything okay now?"
"Our Rv is our home, we are full-time Rvers! Thank you so much! Have you ever been through an evactuation? Did you feel prepared?	This past Mother's Day my husband gave me some wonderful unexpected gifts! He even got me a gorgeous diamond ring.	That sounds very thoughtful! What was the ring made of, and what was its value?"
"I was! It was so thoughtful and sweet, and I was very touched by it.	What did you do to make it happen?"
"My parents are going to a tea room for their anniversary.	Do you think they will enjoy that?"
"No that is where they decided to go but the thing is I called the place and they can't accommodate my special diet I am on.  I am so sad b/c that means I can't go with the.	That is really frustrating. Perhaps you could speak with a manager about the situation."
"I am very excited for the arrival of our 7th grandbaby!	thats cool"
"Thank you, I try to be the best Nana I can be. We are hoping she comes while we are visiting for Christmas!	Wow.  That's really sweet.  How long have you two been together?"
"Thank you so much! I surely will.	My dad has early onset dementia	I'm so sorry, how long does he have left?"
"Yes, I try my hardest to be caring and patient with him b/c I know he doesn't mean to be harsh or hard to deal with at times.	It's nice to have people you can rough you up and know you have a good relationship. I bet he appreciates it."
"At work today, all my coworkers sang me happy birthday. It was so nice of them!	Thats nice of them. Happy Birthday to You!"
"It was so thoughtful of them. I didn't even mention it was my birthday.	That is very nice of them"
"I don't know. But they sure wen't above and beyond!	I took a huge test today and man it made me so nervous. I really hope I did well on it.	You will be fine. Relax and you will do great."
"I did, I studied every day for week! I almost wore myself out studying.	I bet that was a lot of studying"
"I really hope so, I am so nervous while I wait for my results.	I am so proud of my son	You should be! You must be a great parent!"
"He got the highest score on a test	He studied hard?"
"My husband usually gets a big bonus around this time of the year. We are eagerly waiting, hoping, and waiting for it!	What does he get? Bonuses are always awesome!"
"It is! It's not a guarantee though, so it's just a waiting game, and not easy.	I know!  Do you have a date this weekend?"
"I am so angry that my brother didnt come to my party	oh no.. why was he not there?"
"I am not sure. I just don't know why he didn't show	Is everything ok? Why did he cancel?"
"I am confident that I will have a great day tomorrow	I hope so too. What do you have to do tomorrow?"
"That is so true. Getting to know you also makes it seem like a great day already leading to tomorrow.	Yes it does! Getting to know yourself is a huge accomplishment. How are you doing?"
"I have trusting issues because my fiance left  me	Oh no. Did she say why?"
"I know but it's so hard because no one wants to be with me	Have you tried going to concerts and clubs?"
"Flying typically doesn't bother me too much, because I love travel. However I was a bit concerned on a flight once right after a travel advisory had been issued.	Traveling is a big deal.  And it can be scary to travel by plane.  I should have studied more before I traveled."
"Well i did have a few of those. It went fine. I was still nervous even after we landed in a foreign country. I just watched my surroundings. Everything went great.	Oh wow. That's impressive. What was the exotic country?"
"I am so lonely right now because no one wants to be with me	That is the worst, the same thing happened to me.  Do you have any friends to turn to?"
"Yeah, but no luck	I've been there before. What's the worst that happened?"
"when i was younger I was really getting into graphic design and really wanted a new Apple computer. I knew my parents couldnt afford it, but they somehow made it happen and surprised me on Christmas..	Well I'm glad they surprised you! I know your heart was racing and you were panicking but I'm so happy it worked out!"
"yea my parents are pretty great. Pretty maddening at times, but I wouldn't trade them.	that's good to have someone that you can count on in your life. I'm glad you have good parents!"
"I hope to be there one day and see it from that side.	i felt really good when i won a poker tournament last week	Good for you.Do you play often?"
"yes it was, it took a long time to do but at the end it was worth it	What is your favorite part about it?"
"Spiders is one of my gratest fear they make me so scared	Oh yeah spiders are definitely one of mine too! I always catch one in the house when I go outside for a walk."
"i have tried to overcome my fear but i just cant they make my skin temble	Try meditation.it worked well for me."
"i am impressed that video games grow so much every year	I agree. Isn't video games like, the oldest form of art?"
"that is a great game the growth on video games has been amazing this past few years	What game are you talking about?"
"We went out to dinner for our first anniversary and they got our order all wrong.	That's disappointing.  What happened?"
"Thank you. The restaurant came highly rated by a lot of people so I guess my expectations were high. I tried not to let it bother me.	I'm sure it was good. Was it local?"
"My wife flew home to see family. It is very quite at home now.	Well that's great. Maybe you'll see her again in about a month."
"I know, that would of been nice! Instead I was all alone for the last few weeks.	I'm sorry to hear that buddy. Was there any special reason why you were all alone?"
"Me too, a home doesn't feel like a home without a woman.	i am really impressed everytime i see my nephew on how fast he is growing	Yeah that's cool, how old is he?"
"yeah but i dont see him very often maybe that is why i always get shocked when i see him	Why do you think it is that you see him so often then?"
"When I got the phone call that my mom had cancer I was so upset.	Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry. That is terrible."
"It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.	Sorry to hear that, I am sure they were there for you."
"one of the best days of my life was when i graduated from high school	That's a great achievement. You must have felt proud."
"i know right time goes really fast and you dont even noticed, for me it was 13 years ago	I know the feeling for you! Time goes by so fast!"
"The other night I was driving home in the rain and slid into the guard rail. It is going to cost so much to get my car fixed!	Oh god, I hope you are not too embarrassed.  I've done things like that before too."
"I know, I will have to be more careful next time. I shouldn't eat ice-cream while driving,	Why do you say that? Dairy is bad for you too if you do that."
"It will still move, but I can't steer very well with the front tires missing.	There is a tornado coming. But I have the pantry full and am ready this time.	Nice! A tornado can be such a relief.  I'm really worried we'll lose power."
"You never know how long the power might be out for!	Oh no! I've had that happen a few times in the past. I hope it wasn't too long."
"It could take a while for any sort of rescue to come!	I had a pretty large loan, with a bit of a high interest rate, and a high monthly payment. My mother decided to pay it off for me, out of the blue!	That is so awesome! How much was it?"
"Yes, I couldn't believe it. She's so sweet and giving, but I sure didn't expect her to do that!	Amazing, is she normally that way or did you somehow somehow get her to be that way?"
"My husband is the most faithful man I know	That is great, how long have you been married?"
"I have so many health problems and he is always there for many no matter what being loving and caring	That's so sad. I hope you feel better soon."
"I left the front door unlocked and the mailman robbed me. I couldn't believe I would do that.	Wow! You should contact the police!"
"Only my pride! I wasn't at home when he robbed me. He took a lot of valuables.	That sucks. Did you inform the police?"
"I hope so! A federal worker like that should have more integrity!	I have always been afraid of snakes i dont know what to do to control my fear for them	have you ever gone to a museum?"
"yes, i one time i was taking a hike and 3 meters to my left was a rattle snake i jumped like a rabbit and ran back to my friends	oh wow! they must have been terrifying"
"I was annoyed when my wife left me	i think everyone gets annoyed when their wife leaves them"
"Yeah its been a rough 2 weeks for me	Oh no, why have you been so busy?"
"I was afraid when I went into the movies alone	That's never fun."
"Because I have always been with someone, so going in alone just frightened me	What happened?"
"I've been married almost 23 years. My husband travel so much, but we both have trust in each other to be true and loyal.	Aw, that is so sweet!  233 years is a long time!  233 years and only counting the time we've been apart.  233 years, that is a long time!"
"for his job. So, it can be hard, but we trust each other.	why is that?"
"I am hopeful that my friend will be able to make it to my party	It is good to have friends that are willing to help out when you need them most."
"It is to me because he is my best friend	Is it not worth to you to just lose touch with him?"
"I have been exercising and taking care of myself more lately.	how is it helping?"
"I think many do, but man does it feel good.	Why do you think many don't?"
"I am joyful that I am with my wife	That's great! How long have you been together?"
"We have been together for 10 years	Wow that's a long time! How is it going?"
"I felt pretty luck the other day! I won $100 on a scratch off ticket! I never win!	Wow! Did you spend it on anything cool?"
"Not usually, I never win. so, it was very unexpected.	I'll give you an up vote for unexpectedness!  What were you playing?"
"My sister was given $1,000 by my grandma as a graduation present. She did not give me a penny.	Wow, she's a keeper!"
"Perhaps, I just don't understand why I was left out. Seems unfair.	What are you left out because of?"
"We went on our vacation about a week ago to the beach and it rained several days while we were there. We wanted to go to the beach every day!	That's terrible. The only thing I can think of is putting the waterproofing on the outside so it won't rain as much when we get off. Maybe we will have to cancel our vacation."
"Yes, and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront! But, we still had a good time, just wished we could have had less rain!	Yeah, I think summer can be a lot of fun but maybe we will get a little more this year."
"I was given the opportunity to work at a new job that I was hoping to get! I never thought it would be possible!	Good for you, what did you do?"
"Thank you! I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity.	What was the opportunity?"
"I fell down in a mud puddle today while walking to lunch. I was covered in mud for the rest of the work day.	Oh I hate when that happens...I am so sorry! Do you feel okay now?"
"No kidding! It was hard to keep a good attitude for the rest of the day.	What happened"
"My husband works nights a lot right now.	That does not sound good"
"It really is, i hate being alone at night.	I do too actually. I hope you get some sleep though!"
"A few, but he still has to sleep all day, makes doing things hard.	I'm anxious (if excited!) about an upcoming move -- we've lived overseas before, but this is such a different state and climate, I'm not sure what to expect!	Wow exciting! How far are you moving?"
"Alaska! We've got some transition time, but I've been doing deep research on Anchorage -- and the more I see, the more I like!	What is transition time?"
"I hate that people hit on others they know are married.	Oh me too! It's so disrespectful!"
"Right? Happens to my husband all the time and it's just frustrating.	Did you divorce him?"
"No, since it's his associates at work!!	i cannot wait for the next star wars movie to come out	I think I've seen every single one.  Are you a fan?"
"he is, i really like the new ones but always will like the old ones better	I am guessing you are a fan of older movies?"
"i hate when i fart in public it is so embarrasing	I can understand that. It's an uncomfortable subject, for sure."
"i can hold them but some of them are just accidental and it is the worst, depends on what i eat haha	Accidents happen but, it doesn't mean you can't get healthy from them!"
"My husband recently got me a great gift. He got me a beautiful 14 kt diamond ring! I had no idea he was.	That sounds so awesome! What was the gift?"
"Yes, it was so sweet and unexpected. We've been married almost 23 years so I guess I deserve it lol	Wow that is a long time! Congrats!"
"i hate that people dont care and they just throw their trash on the street	I'm not a fan of that either."
"if im walking i pick up as much as i can	Good for you.I am sure that you feel good about yourself every day."
"i am extremely afraid of going near hiights	Really? Any specific reason for this fear?"
"Yeah last year i went to disneyland and got on the elevator game and i almost cried hahaha	That is a really nostalgic memory. Did you go on many rides?"
"The last job interview I went on also went well, but it took a long time to hear back from them.	Oh gosh. I hate waiting. Is it for something you are already doing?"
"Oh, I did eventually, it just took like a month.  I ended up getting the job!	Awesome! Congratulations"
"i cant wait for my disneyland vacation next summer	Sounds like a lot of fun! Are you going with anyone?"
"i think me and my family is going there for 1 week it is going to be wonderfull	Where is it taking place?"
"i am getting my new car next week and cant wait for it.	Oh nice, what type of car did you get?"
"it is a 2017 bmw, i traded in my old car to get an awesome deal	What kind of car is it?"
"My in-laws are helping us pay for school clothes for our kids this year.	That's nice of them. How long has it been?"
"Yeah, it helps take some of the burden off of us. I will have to check out Goodwill and see if I can find anything.	You could always donate some of your old clothes."
"Wow, those prices are great. I'll be going by there for sure. Yeah, the best part about them helping, is that they do it, not expecting anything in return. They just all of us and want to help.	Its awesome to have good people"
"Yes, they are great.	I was in a college class once with an older woman.  She took a paper idea I had talked about and presented it as her own, stealing all the work I had done.	Oh goodness!  I hate it when that happens!  That is stealing not being a good student."
"I did.  There wasn't much she could do, but at least I could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work.	Thats the way to do it. copy pasta!"
"i really hate when people make me wait for no reason	Oh me too. Did you get a reason?"
"my girlfriend allways makes me wait, it makes me really anxious ahhahah	oh my, does she do that because she doesn't trust you or because you're not good at holding a relationship together?"
"One of my best friends is moving far away and i dont know when i will be able to see him again	That really stinks.  I'm sorry to hear that."
"yeah i can call him and email him, it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again	well sometimes you have to surprise people."
"I think having goals is important. My mother in law has managed to lose weight and walked daily.	That's great, I'm glad she's healthy still."
"Very similar ones, but I like focusing on others success	I understand."
"It really does, hope any you have works out!	i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it	I have never been a fan of animal cruelty either. Have you ever been in the animal shelter?"
"i know right, it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me	What do you mean exactly?"
"the day i gratuaded from college is my favorite day	That's great. College can be hit or miss sometimes. Sometimes it's great and other times it's hit or miss. What are your favorite parts about it?"
"the fact that it took so much work and time	What did you do?"
"i cant wait for my new tv that i ordered online and will recive this weekend	what channel is it on?"
"yeah it is twice the size as the tv that i have at the moment	Thats too bad. Maybe you could get a new one?"
"I have an older friend who I try to help out.  She lost her husband a couple years ago.	Oh, that's hard! loss can be hard. I'm so sorry. Are you guys still very close?"
"We go out to lunch regularly.  She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.	I'm sorry to hear that. Is she far from home?"
"Thanks.  Yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now.	We need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues, no matter your views.	that is very inspiring you are so positive i bet you are a great person and know how to handle difficult situations"
"Exactly, let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!	Yeah, I agree!Compromise is the key. People tend to get too caught up in their emotions and don't think about the long term effects."
"I spent my first Christmas away from home in a computer lab, working by myself.	Did you enjoy it?"
"Yes, it wasn't very fun.  But I had to do it because my project for work was due the next day.	you are brave"
"I miss my dog Kat	Did she pass away?"
"Yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year.  She was a great dog	I'm sorry to hear that you lost your dog. I loved my dog too. They are the best!"
"Thanks.  I do miss coming home to her.  My cat is just not the same.	It's great to see my husband doing so well.	It is. What makes him so awesome is his love for the sport."
"He's become the top manager in his division in just two years.	You must be so proud!"
"Hello, I am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets ... it is unacceptable	Oh my, I can imagine. Pets are family."
"I feel that pain ... as if I had been hit	By who?"
"it's something since I was born ... I'm like that	That reminds me of the time I went to LA for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark.	Was it super dark?"
"Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also.	That's really good that you have close knit friends.  Do they live close by?"
"I really miss my puppy, we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always.	Aww, yeah that must make you sad. Do you have other pets?"
"Yes, she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.	How old is she now?"
"my son is teething and he is so cranky! I gave him tylenol and got some teething toys. I don	I guess that might help a little.  Try some gentle rubbing and holding his hand if he starts to shake a bit."
"it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! Doesn't sleep good, doesn't want to eat. poor little boy	That's so sad! Is it expensive to fix?"
"i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed. i didn't it's gonna be that hard. I think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college	It will be fine. That's how it works with my kids"
"I hope so, i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face	I used to have feet, but they got so big I had to take them off!"
"I have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around Italy.	Oh that must be fun, seeing your good friends and doing stuff together."
"I wish I were with them.  I love Italy	Do you like all the food?"
"Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.	It is really cool, what is your favorite thing about the world?"
"That is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures	My friend bought me lunch today	Nice did you enjoy it?"
"I had a nice burger and fries	I love fries! What kind did you have?"
"Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch	I hate when people pull in front of you, especially when it's clear behidn you.	I hate it too. I don't know if it's worse to be nervous or anxious because of this situation."
"Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.	Did you slam them hard enough or were you letting them hang loose?"
"yes, sadly I easily can.	I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy	Nothing wrong with that.  It's the unknown that scares us all.  Don't worry about it."
"That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on	Yeah i have the same problem. You're not alone here!"
"I like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs. They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.	I like dogs too. Do you walk them frequently?"
"They do. They get to smell the grass, they play they get their exercise, they get to have fun, they get to be a dog!	i can agree with all of those things"
"Last night at like midnight the power cut out completely on my street	Wow that is a bummer! Luckily you had a couple of hours left before it went out!"
"We luckily had candles around! I was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power	Oh yeah, candles help a lot in stressful situations!"
"A while back my cat knocked over and broke my mothers urn.	Wow, was it an accident?"
"I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it	What happened?"
"I made a bowl of cereal for breakfast and when i started eating i realized milk was spoiled!! I started gagging. it was so gross!	That's so gross! Maybe you should replace it?"
"don't you hate that? gosh, i didn't eat anything the whole day because i don't have an appetite anymore	I do! I know what you mean, I don't know what to do with my food lol"
"I was so calm and happy the other night just listening to rain hitting the kitchen windows	That sounds peaceful and relaxing, what was it that you listened to?"
"It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too!	It sounds pretty amazing doesn't it. I'm jealous."
"i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere	That is terrible. I'm so sorry."
"not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up	Oh wow that's awful, hopefully insurance will be able to help"
"Though the odds are against you, I understand why people gamble. I remember a particular time I was playing video poker at a local dive bar.	I've never played but i've always wanted to"
"Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!	Omg, that's amazing. Well I hope you get a lot of use out of it. I always hate spending money on things I don't need lol."
"I honestly think New Orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the US. You never know what you are going to find around the corner.	it really is a great place to live. I visited a few months ago and had a blast"
"Mardi Gras is great, but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town, and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole, and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!	Sounds like fun. Were they having fun?"
"I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?	Oh I get it, that is so hurtful. It is just awful when you have to say goodbye and all they want to do is make a comment about how great you are or your partner."
"You can say that again. One time, I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.	That is absolutely awful!"
"1	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"sorry that was sent by an mistake	Oh no! I have to admit mistakes happen. Have you made any changes to improve this mistake?"
"I don't think I am a judgmental person, but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day, and I can still smell it.	i think everyone has their limit"
"Trust me, this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off, they had running clean water, but no toilet indoors!	That sounds horrible!  I know exactly what you are talking about.  You would think they would be up to something like that, but no!"
"I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.	How did it go?"
"I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.	That is awesome!  It is always good to be prepared.  Where are you going?"
"I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at, the possibility looks good!	Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?	Yes I have and my friends embarrassed me in the past but I've grown up and realize that no matter what they say or does I will always be their friend no matter what."
"That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!	So sorry to hear that, you must feel horrible."
"Not too long ago, my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it!	That's awesome. It always saddens me when my parents take out loans"
"Yes, I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought, I am blessed.	Does she do it on purpose?"
"I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible	Oh no, that's not good at all. How did you manage to break it?"
"I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me!	Well that's nice of him! How long have you two been married?"
"So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!	Oh yeah!  Where ya headed to?"
"I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.	Did you buy extra stuff on the day you were supposed to?"
"And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!	They do, and the lines are so long."
"I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!	I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong	That doesn't sound good. What went wrong?"
"The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to	Oh no! How disappointing. Hopefully your cookie tasted better?"
"I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!	Holy cow! Congratulations!  I never win anything.  Are you happy or sad that it happened?"
"YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!	Oh good.  I try to get off at 10am pretty often to shop.  What stores did you go to?"
"I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!	Aw, that's so sweet! You have to be happy with what you have! Going online is so convenient too! I am sure everything will be okay"
"Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!	True. Did you end up checking out the deals?"
"The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider	I would have peed my pants, what did you do?"
"I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that!	What kind of things do you hate about it?"
"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	I'm with you. Sometimes you just have to take a stand and speak your truth to someone."
"Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!	I guess you're right. Sometimes people don't know what interactivity is."
"Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!	I bet he's excited to see you! But I'm sure it will be a good relationship building exercise. How long has it been since you've seen him?"
"It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!	thats right it does, and thats no fun at all"
"When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.	I feel you. Sometimes it's nice to give unexpected gifts."
"He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!	That is insane! I really hate people like that"
"Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.	Oh no! Those were good times though."
"I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!	Oh no! I would have been in the exact same situation, except I was a teenager. I ran to the bathroom as fast as I could and threw away my ID."
"I don't know how you are with Calc, but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.	It can be pretty hard especially at first. But just stay calm and do your best you can. You will do great!"
"Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!	Wow that is amazing, how did you feel when you studied for a while?"
"My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night	Oh, sorry to hear that. I hope you're able to get her into her crate for a routine check-up soon."
"She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her!	Oh no, what happened?"
"I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27, I would have thought you were crazy.	I'm a teacher, not a gambler. School can be stressful."
"I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer, but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra, and was accepted to a state university two years ago!	What university did you go to?"
"i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college	I'm sorry to hear that! I hope that you get in there eventually!"
"yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha	Oh man, what kind of college is it?"
"My boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend...	Oh no! How did you feel?"
"Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her.	That must be very difficult. How does he pick her?"
"i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years	I used to love those.  What do you like most about them?"
"gaming has blown up this past couple of years	What's blowing up?"
"I love roller coasters, but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter.	I completely understand that! I used to hate them too until I started taking them on vacations.  Now I love them and anytime I go, I feel as if I'm taking forever to get on and off!"
"Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around, all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.	I am sorry to hear that.  It must be really hard thinking about loved ones being gone."
"I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.	I know that feeling. I went into business to get away from my parents and it worked out pretty well!"
"I'm an Engineering major, electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?	I'm an earth and radiation engineer! How long have you been an earth and radiation engineer?"
"i really am thankful for everything that i have and had	What has helped you the most in life are your family."
"it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little	Awww, you must have been really proud of yourself.  Where is the medal from?"
"he gave it to me beafore he went to the army, and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional	My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!	Do you play bowling too?"
"Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?	I've never bowled a bowwow myself, but maybe I should learn how."
"I keep hearing strange noises in my house. My husband is out of town and I'm all alone. There has been reports of break ins on my street.	oh wow that must be scary"
"No I don't, I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!	Oh I thought maybe you didn't have enough room for all your dogs."
"So I suck hard at bowling, but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.	Oh no! Was your lane busy?"
"Yeah, my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.	That's rough. Hopefully there wasn't any damage."
"I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend, for various reasons, but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!	Oh boy, that's a juicy situation. I would feel the same! How did you respond?"
"Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.	Well you did the right thing. Her love was most of your business and if you had told her then she would have no reason to hurt you."
"I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.	Ahh, that must be difficult. I am sorry."
"No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.	I understand completely. You must be very grown up."
"So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.	My first semester was stressful. You'll adapt with time"
"I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.	Part time jobs are nice but a real time commitment is what gets me most excited about going to school."
"So college is starting up soon and I feel more ready than ever to do well this year!	its nice to have that feeling"
"Thanks, I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.	Well, I hope it goes well and you do great this time!"
"So I just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room. I feel very at ease.	That is great, I love to eat relaxing food! What did you have?"
"Surprisingly enough, a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!	That is pretty unique."
"my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart. i can't wait till these molars cut thru	I just had to put mine in a cast for aorta surgery a couple months ago. I couldn't stand it."
"I do but he doesn't like them. he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad	Oh, that's a bummer then. Maybe he doesn't want to share?"
"I think I will be very busy Monday night playing my new game.	What game is it?"
"World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.	I love wow. I used to play it when I was little."
"I come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing. It's very frustrating.	Have they tried to talk to you about it?"
"Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.	its sad the way some people treat others"
"I think storms are wonderful, except when the power goes out.	ah that's very true.. i havent had power all week"
"It was extra loud and my husband was at work, bit scary.	why is that scary! is it someone you like?"
"O it sure seemed like it did, dogs were scared too.	College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!	It's always good to get a head start so you can get into the swing of it later."
"It probably will be, as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!	You should feel confident. procrastination can destroy a good habit"
"I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.	Well, that is nice. What was it that reminded you of your childhood?"
"It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.	yes, i cant wait to do that too"
"So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.	Have you played bowling before?"
"For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!	Sometimes you gotta bowlers do some proper bowling or you will get the hose again"
"I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.	Why are you so nervous?"
"it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.	How do you like it so far?"
"So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.	That's a dumb feeling. Have you tried calling the place?"
"For sure, that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose, can't expect to be perfect!	I am with you there! Sometimes people make mistakes and we learn from them!"
"So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.	Oh that does suck!  I'm sorry to hear that!"
"No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself, would do again!	That sounds like lots of fun! National parks are definitely worthwhile visits!"
"So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!	That's awesome! Are you happy for him?"
"I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!	Is the father a woman?"
"So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.	Get a test drive! It's worth the wait!"
"Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.	I know what you mean. I bought a new car last friday. My old one is like a museum piece now"
"PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!	They are crazy! I saw a homeless man run out and then jump into the garbage can to try and get the can!"
"It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.	Oh wow!  I bet that was scary!  Was the hurricane strong?"
"So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!	Did you take it to a shop?"
"Oh yes, very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now, I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.	What don't you like about it?"
"I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.	Yeah, that's always tough. Especially if you're trying to get a job done quickly."
"I know! Like, mentally, I don't care, but my body just responds by making my legs shake, my heart pound, and speaking too quickly.	Wow! Does it do physical damage?"
"I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times, it was awful.	That sounds awful! How old is your dad?"
"Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.	Petting the dogs counteracts having to clean up after yourself. I think I would have a stroke if I did that."
"So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.	I bet it was. Did you do anything?"
"Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.	I roll my windows up all the time. No shame in a movie theater."
"I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester.	What are you taking in textbooks?"
"Yes, everything's taken care of, thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!	That is awesome! What kind of books?"
"i was really glad i finished my service for the military	What was done for your service?"
"it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country	What country is that?"
"i did not expect my car to be soo good for the price i paid	Nice! What color did you get?"
"yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well	thats awesome, what kind of used car?"
"i don't like to see my parents smoke it makes me really sad	I'm sorry to hear that. Do your parents like to be blunt about things?"
"yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now	What have you done?"
"i hate when ash from my cigarette drops in my work pants	You mean ash from my cigarettes?"
"yeah, i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off, it is really embarrasing	What color is it?"
"When katrina hit texas my family lost like half of their belongings	Wow, that's terrible, I hope you and your family evacuated to somewhere safe."
"Well when it hit we left but now we are ok and we recovered well	Where did you leave?"
"i cant stand people that dont flush the toilet	Right? Some people are just gross."
"Oh, so where do you go to do your personal buisness	To my home. I have decided to take out a loan this year."
"I guess i will be the next team leader	what do you mean?"
"Yes. I was expecting that very much.	Then why did you expect it?"
"My kids and I went to Six Flags and they wanted me to ride the roller coaster but I had so many reservations about getting on it.	What was your reservations about riding the roller coaster?"
"The high speeds. It had been so long since i had been on one. I finally did get on and we had a blast!	I haven't been on one in ages. How was the traffic?"
"When I turned 40 last year, my kids planned a birthday party for me that I had no idea about.	Wow! How sweet! Did you guys have a great time?"
"It really was and just what I need as I wasn't really happy about turning that corner into my 40's.	Turning 40 is the hardest part of life for me. I just want to be able to relax for a while. How did you cope with it?"
"A few weeks ago we were at a wedding. Everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my 3 year old niece started to choke on a carrot. So scary!	That's funny! I thought about choking at that age. Is she okay now?"
"Yes, someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.	Yeah, the first time I've heard about that. That's quite scary!"
"So an online payment distributor company won't instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct. Feels bad man.	You can file a complaint with the SEC.   That's what I would do."
"Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.	yeah i would be to"
"Today is my off day and I wanted to sleep in, yet here I am awake early.	Are you going to go back to sleep?"
"It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.	Oh no. Why can't your body accept your body, and you just want to sleep?"
"I was dog sitting at my dad's house last week and I heard strange noises in his house.	did you go check it out?"
"I don't know, it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.	Yeah, running the kitchen fan really understadens me. I think the weirdest things are caused by that. Did you take your freetime to do something you were passionate about?"
"Last semester, I had to give a class presentation. My stomach was full of butterflies from the nerves.	I do hate those kinds of presentations. They can be so nerve wracking."
"All things considered, pretty well. I definitely had some anxiety about it though. Presentations are my least favorite thing in the world.	I can understand that. They can really get me anxious. What kind of presentations do you have?"
"My aunt recently passed away after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.	Sorry to hear that. It must be difficult for you and your family"
"Thanks. It's been especially hard because she was almost like a mother to me.	I understand. Take care."
"So I asked out a girl in my class and she said yes. Was a big morale boost.	Congratulations."
"Thanks! We are getting coffee this weekend. Hopefully something comes of it!	What does? Coffee always makes me happy. What are you getting?"
"I always carry a multi-tool and a small 4-1 screwdriver on me. I feel like I can fix almost anything with that.	That is a good idea, you don't have to worry about breaking it."
"I'd like to think so. I just like to be ready for anything.	Yes being prepared is always a good thing."
"I'm starting a new position at my job soon.	What position is that?"
"I'll be managing consumer relations at a law firm. I'm really looking forward to it!	Wow, exciting! Does it pay well?"
"My car is on it's last legs. I think I see a new car in my future very soon.	Did you sell it already or is there a waiting list?"
"I would love to get an X-Terra! I'm a big fan of the SUV platform.	I'm jealous. They are so nice! Just bought my first one!"
"After dropping out of college 6 years ago, I decided to go back this year.	Wow, 6 years is a long time to be in school. What were you studying?"
"I have high hopes for myself, as I have all A's so far. I hope I can keep up the momentum!	Good for you. What subject is this in?"
"I just had a delicious breakfast and now I'm casually relaxing in my room. Life is good!	Yum! what did you have for breakfast?"
"Pancakes and sausage! How can you go wrong?	Absolutely! Those are great food choices."
"So I have been saving money for about a month now and should have enough for any kind of emergency that may happen. Feels good man.	thats great! what kind of emergency?"
"Thanks so much! It definitely relieves some stress knowing that I have a safety cushion. Hoping I don't have any emergencies though!	I bet your anxious, hu?"
"Having a baby 3 months ago really changed my view on life for the better.	You must have been changed. How so?"
"I was a heavy drinker, and looking back now, I know I was in a downward spiral, I just couldn't tell at the time. Now I'm pursuing my education and have become much more healthy and responsible.	Hey that's great!  You'll get there too"
"My husband and I are going a  cruise with a couple that we have been friends with for a long time,	that sounds nice. where is it going to be?"
"We kind of all came up with it together. They booked it and we just pay them a certain amount of money each week, until our part is paid for.	Well, that sounds like a plan. You all should hang out and eat pizza together when your part is paid off!"
"I hope you can too. If its ok, I would like to pray for you, just to maybe help you find someone special.	I am so proud of my sister	Oh yes, are you? What for?"
"She bought me a car	wow, what a nice person. how much did you get for it?"
"We are basically best friends. It is my birthday and she worked really hard to get a car for me	Wow, that's nice! It's great that you have a close relationship with a person that can get you things you wanted. Congratulations!"
"I am sad that my parents didn't attend my birthday	Oh no. Why did they not want to go?"
"No, they just are not wanting to come to it	You shouldn't let their fear stop you."
"Last week at the end of the week I got home from work and was pretty tired.  I ended up just sitting on the couch with my wife and dogs watching tv.  It was nice.	I know that feeling, but I'd rather be at work doing something meaningful with my time."
"Quite a lot, actually.  It was a nice way to spend the evening.	Did you do anything fun with the evening?"
"I was going to a wedding outside of my city, and had arranged to have my dogs watched while I was gone, but the person backed out really soon before I had to leave.	How inconsiderate! Did you end up having to call the bride?"
"Something like that, they were vague.  It was through a company so I couldn't really get much out of them.  Luckily a friend stepped up and watched them for me.	That's great, I've been through that before."
"I was tired last night and my wife was out of town, so I went to bed early.  I ended up lying with my dogs in bed for a while watching TV before falling asleep.	I love watching TV while I'm tired."
"A wire haired dacshund and a shephard mix thing	That's pretty cute! How did you find them?"
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a month and a half.  She gets back in a couple weeks, and it's getting tougher to wait.	I know that feeling well.  When I went on vacation I missed her a bit."
"I do, every night.  It's still hard going from having someone around every day to never, but I'll get through.	Its a good thing that you still have people to share your life with. You must feel very happy when you have someone around."
"My dad was cleaning out his attic when he found a box of my old stuff from childhood	Aww that's really nice! Did it bring back a lot of memories?"
"I did! He found my favorite childhood book of mine and I just sat there thinking about all the memories	Amazing! What book was it?"
"My wife is out of the country for school, and the other day she was having a really bad day.  I couldn't really do anything to help, and it made me feel bad.	What did you end up doing?"
"Thanks, that's actually really helpful.  It's been tough being apart for so long, we haven't been apart more than a couple days since we started dating.	My husband and I were separated for about a year when we were first dating. Glad to hear that helps"
"I almost got into a fight the other day at a store.	Uh oh. What happened?"
"A guy budged in front of some other people, I confronted him about it, and we got into an extremely heated exchange.	What a jerk. How are you holding up?"
"No, the guy eventually backed off and left, albeit not before he flipped me off a few times and called me numerous names.	For a while my husband was really sick with the flu	Oh no, I hope he is feeling better, did you take him to the vet?"
"He is but I just felt so much love for him because there wasn't anything he could do	Who is he?"
"When people make me wait, i get really anxious	I do not like waiting either"
"Not really, i just look at the clock and wait for the time to come and when they dont arrive in time i start getting anxious	I see. Do you ever think they will be there any time soon?"
"I love dogs very much they are always great companions	I love dogs as well. What kind do you have."
"I got a puppy not to long ago and love him with all my heart	Puppies are so amazing, I have one myself and would love another."
"My cat broke her leg not too long ago and had to have surgery one it	Oh, that's terrible! I hope the surgery went well."
"I was lucky cause I know my vet personally so I only paid 175 usd I was so scared for her	What happened to her?"
"there was a shooting in a gas station near me i was really devastated	i'm so sorry, are you okay?"
"im not sure but there was 2 victims i was devastated	Oh my goodness, are you planning to find the other victim?"
"I was sad when my dog died	That is sad, how did he pass?"
"I had him for 10 years. It's just so hard because he was my whole world	Aww!  It must be so hard to let go of such a faithful friend."
"I am so lonely because I am all by myself	I am sorry to hear that."
"I appreciate that. It's just tough because I go daily without talking to anyone. It's nice to talk to someone	Yeah, you only have one social media nowadays. But it really helps to keep in contact with people."
"i was really jelous when i say my  neighboor had a new 2018 Bmw convertible	Nice!  My neighbor just bought a new camry!"
"yeah it is i wish i could have a car like that	What kind of car can you have?"
"I am sad that my friends dont visit me	Why do you say that?"
"I don't have a car and they live far away	Oh no, that can be so tough sometimes."
"I am disgusted that my food didn't come out the way I wanted it	did you put too much effort in cooking it?"
"It was burnt and not appealing	Oh, no, that's horrible!  I'm sorry you had to go through that.  Were you able to do anything to help?"
"when i was young i hit a car on the parking lot and did not say anything'	Did you get in trouble?"
"i did not see any marks on the other car and was running late	Oh no. What kind of marks?"
"My sister is so caring, she took care of me when I was sick	That's awesome. I hope you're doing better now."
"That is so true. I am so very thankful	What is so true?"
"I heard this god awful howling the other night at like 2am right outside my window	That must've been scary, what was it?"
"It was! I was so scared to be honest with you! The worst part is that I don't own a dog either	I am glad it was nothing serious. Do you have any pets?"
"I was surprised when my mom bought me a car	Oh wow, mom's are some of the best people to buy a car from. Did you treat her very well?"
"Its a ford mustang	Oh how cool! What color is it?"
"I am very ashamed in my family	That's always something to be ashamed about. Any specific reasons why?"
"Because they never invite me to go places, and they never call me	That must be so disappointing!"
"I am disgusted because of my friends pulling pranks on me	oh no.. what happened?"
"I dont know. They have been my friends for so long but these pranks are just making me mad	That's awful. I hope you can figure it out."
"I was afraid when I got out of the movie theater	What happened?"
"I was watching a horror film and then I had to walk home alone in the dark	that sucks,  was it a really scary movie?"
"I am very faithful that my family will make it home in time	Thats a good feeling to have"
"They are in Cuba	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that!"
"I am terrified that my wife is going to leave me	Why do you say that?"
"Because she is talking to other men behind my back	Ohh man! Why wouldn't she be speaking to you? Are you some kind of crazy person?"
"I am sad that I won't get to see the movie I want to see	I'm sorry.  When is it due out?"
"I wanted to see the First Purge	Oh yea? What do you think about that?"
"Because I didn't have a ride to the movies	We just got back from the beach two weeks ago. It was such a lovely vacation. We loved relaxing on the beach and just taking it easy.	That sounds so nice! I took my daughter to the beach a couple of days ago and really enjoyed it!"
"It was very nice. There was a day or two of rain, but mostly perfect weather!	That's so nice.  It has been raining a lot here, too."
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December.	that's so exciting! are you looking forward to it?"
"To the Caribbean Islands. We are going with another couple that we have been friends with for a very long time.	How nice. Is it just for a visit? Or you planning to stay longer?"
"Thanks, me too.	The other night I was just craving candy. I ate up all that we had!	Did you get any?"
"Sometimes you just have to! It felt so great then but I hated it the next morning!	Yeah, I just can't go for long periods of time without my coffee. I need a break from work!"
"My husbands cancer free now!	That is awesome. Cancer is the worst."
"Congrats! We are hoping right now that nothing comes back but It's so happy	Where do you live?  I'm so happy too. I moved to a new city for work recently."
"I'm so frustrated with my husband. He dismantled the bathroom to do repairs and still hasn't completed them six months later!	Wow sounds like he needs to relax"
"He promised he would complete it within a month and since it's been so long, I called a contractor today!	Was the project completed?"
"I've got a job interview set up for next week and I'm really nervous!	Oh good luck! You'll do great!"
"I hope so! I bought a couple books on preparing for interviews and I've done a couple mock interviews with a friend.	I hope so too! Are you excited?"
"My parents always argue and it pisses me off!	That is bad. Do they not like you for being different?"
"I have but they rarely listen. They act like children and it can get frustrating. What can you do?	I wish they would all of a sudden"
"Sometimes life just gives you lemons. At an old job of mine, I had what will probably remain the worst performance review of my life.	Life is a series of unfortunate events. I am glad you could make it through."
"I'm not sure it was really about my performance at all. I was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there, and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved, and I would be answering phones.	Sometimes bigger fish have bigger crud. I'd look to move on from here, especially if the payoff was a better outcome."
"That's must be a relief for you.  I am assuming you have children?	I do have children, I just wish they could be more understanding. It's hard when they don't listen."
"So I guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  Do you attend school?	I do but it still stinks when a person can't keep a job they put in. I attend a local community college."
"Do you have something you are looking forward to?	My father passed away about 2 1/2 years ago. It was totally unexpected and really was very traumatic and hurtful to me. He was still quite young and my family and I had no idea he had a life threatening health issue.	Sorry to hear that. Death is never easy to deal with. That must have really hurt."
"I was pretty close to my father and always lived close by. But, you always wish you had more time. But, the last words I said to him was that I loved him, and I'm grateful for that.	It is very important to have that relationship. That is probably one of the most important things to take from your parents, and they are unlikely to pass it on. I'm very happy for you."
"Once when I was younger I went to a friends 16th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen	oh really? what happened?"
"we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but I didn't see it.  It was a very clean door.  LOL.  Later on that night I won a door prize.  which was pretty funny]	That's pretty awesome.  I didn't win anything when I won the lotto, but I got a cool phone number and some money in my bank.  So I'm happy I won that."
"My daughter caught me in a bad mood the other day and was being a bit argumentative. I lost my temper, yelled and really hurt her feelings. I felt bad that it happened.	Oh well, hopefully she will learn to be better by next time."
"Yes, I was already not in a good mood, and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button. But, I knew I shouldn't have done it as soon as I saw the look in her eyes, I felt very bad.	I bet. She knew something was up. Did everything turn out okay?"
"You never know what someone else is going through, and looks can be deceiving. Like this old man that seemed like any other drunk.	Oh no, what happened?"
"It was hard to tell honestly, but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic. He had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home, so I hailed him a cab and paid the driver $20.	Wow! I'm so happy he was able to get home, but why did you have to take the cab?"
"We hadn't been to the beach and years and really wanting to go back for vacation. We were able to a few weeks ago and it was awesome. I was thrilled!	That sounds great! It's always nice to go for a few weeks and then come back to the beach after a long break!"
"It's was great. The weather was perfect most of the time, and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much. We were really hyped to go!	What did you guys do? Go on a boat?"
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped over a big cord. This led to me having one of those running falls, that seem to last forever! I wanted to disappear at that moment!	I know how you feel! Did you hurt yourself?"
"Oh no, there were tons of people that noticed lol. I can laugh now, but not at that moment.	What did you notice?"
"I lost a puppy recently and I'm still broken up about it.	I'm so sorry, that's such a hard thing to lose, I hope you find it."
"it's never going to be ok, but it will be a little less painful in time.	i hope it will be less painful in time"
"I'm sorry youve been there too.,	It's not fun when a 4 year old does something he shouldnt.	What does he do?"
"Took a small toy, put it in his pocket. took it back to the store and made him return it.	How did that make you feel?"
"Yea, he seems to get it now.	As a mom I sometimes sneak a sweet treat when I make it out alone.	i do the same as a mom, what kind of treats?"
"Still feel bad when I got an ice cream the other day	That's so bad. What flavor was it?"
"I've had a rough week! The house has been a mess from my dogs and toddler. My husband hasn't been helping out much, its fustrating!	I bet so. How long do you think it'll take for them to get better?"
"I'm not sure! He has been busy with work but also has been going out with friends a lot :(	Maybe he needs a break."
"My niece made me proud today, graduated from her nursing school.	Congratulations! That is a big accomplishment! You must be so happy and proud."
"YEa, she's over come a lot for it.	What happened?"
"Since it was my birthday today, when I came home there was a big pink cake and flowers waiting for me :)	that is an awesome present!! what flavor was it"
"My husband! I did not see it coming at all, thought we were going to wait till the weekend to celebrate.	Oh no! A little too late for that?"
"We had to clean out our storage building because of roof damage. I found an old box of pictures!	You must have found a lot to brighten up your day!"
"My family and all kinds of old memories, birthdays, festivals, swimming, and other stuff	That sounds wonderful."
"It's so hot and our AC just broke. We had to open the windows to be able to sleep!	Oh god...I hate when that happens...it feels so bad being in a house with AC on"
"The icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you	Oh gross! That has happened to us so many times. What kind of cake were you eating?"
"I'm so excited! My family and I are moving to a new state at the end of this year!	Thats amazing.. to a new place.. thats wonderful. Im sure you are going to have a great life."
"That is nice. Having a better paying job is always good.	yeah it is, i am thankful"
"I've got back in to running this week, I missed it! It's a great stress reliever!	That's great! Did you go running recently?"
"I love to run, did Track and Field in High School! Right now I'm only running 3 miles till I build my stamina back up! What do you do for excersise?	I used to be a track athlete, but after seeing some of the crazy catches they're making, I'm not so sure I want to do it anymore."
"You won't believe the day I've had! I got to sleep in this morning, I haven't done that in months!	Oh goodness, I've been there a few times. What was it that gave you that feeling, if you don't mind me asking?"
"Yes, my husband even cooked dinner for me today, and helped clean the house! He has been very helpful today.	That's so nice! What a good husband. You're lucky to have him!"
"This has been a great week! Well actually a great year for my family.	Why is that?"
"Thank you, my husband got two great job offers!	You must be so happy with him!"
"My daughter is growing up so fast!	I know! Mine is almost 16, it goes by so fast!"
"She is 4 and in Pre-school! She is doing so well learning how to share and also knows her colors!	That's awesome. How old is she?"
"I live in Central Texas, it rained and lightening stuck a house here and caused it to burn down!	oh wow that is not good!"
"Yes, I hope the family is okay! No word yet if anyone got hurt.	Oh wow that sounds scary. I'm so sorry."
"my baby is sleeping, my house is clean... it's just so nice and peaceful right now	That is a great feeling!  Enjoy it while it lasts."
"i just hope tonight won't be that night when my baby wakes up every 30 minutes	Oh. Have you tried putting it to sleep?"
"I feel like a failure, Im suppose to be on a diet but ate too much today!	Diets always such hard to keep track of, I've done them before too. Maybe start again tomorrow"
"Thanks, I keep telling myself to stick with it but its hard!	Staying the ground is the best thing for you."
"I'm thinking about quitting my day job!	Why? Do you think its bad?"
"My boss has been unreasonable and a pain. He dosen't understand how much time I put into the company!	That's too bad. What did he do?"
"Tuesday I got to take my kids to the beach for the first time.	That's great. I bet you are excited"
"We had a blast! I could barely contain myself on the trip there!	Amazing! What was your favorite part about the trip?"
"My new dog is doing so great, she was potty trained in a week!	You must be so proud!  I love dogs, especially new ones!"
"She is a Jack Russell, she loves to cuddle in my lap.	That's really cool, do you have any pictures you can show her?"
"i moved to a new house recently and miss my old one	That must feel very nostalgic. How far away is it from you?"
"10 years, i hope i get to feel the same way i did in my old house	Has it been cleaned up a lot?"
"i feel like i am the best player on my soccer team	That's awesome. Have you been playing for a long time?"
"yeah i do i am always the one that steps up in the game	It is good to stay vigilant."
"I've been having anxiety attacks lately. Everything is great and suddenly i start thinking about something bad happening and i have a full blown anxiety attack over something that didn't even happen	that's awful, i'm so sorry to hear that, are you taking meds for it? i hope that helps"
"no, it just started happening. I would say it started a couple of months ago. i will see a doctor in 2 weeks	My girlfriend has been having weird dreams all of the time. I really hope she sees a doctor."
"We recently went on vacation and it made me feel reminiscent. It made me think of the last vacation I was able to spend with my father before he unexpectedly passed away.	I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing. Where did you guys go?"
"Thank you. I don't think it matters how old you are when a parent passes away, it's very painful. The vacation did bring back great memories with him though.	You are very lucky to have witnessed that. He was a very happy man."
"my friend can literally eat junk food all day long and stay skinny! She doesn't even work out. and here i am, eating healthy, working out and still loking fat	I am sorry to hear that. Is there any way you can do something about it?"
"that's true too! But i just wish i looked like her	I know the feeling. I wish my husband could get the same treatment."
"It was my birthday and My friend sent me a birthday card with a gift card in a mail... i never got it, somebody stole it! and we actually have a cluster mailbox so only i can open it. it means that usps worker stole it	thats horrible! did they steal anything?"
"i did, the lady told me they can't do anything about it because it didn't have a tracking number.	Oh wow. What a rude woman."
"My cat was playing last nigh and brought it to me.	Is it okay now?"
"Well, it wasn't one of his toys like I thought. It was a dead mouse	Oh no! He won't be getting that kind of treatment any time soon!"
"my son just used a potty for the first time! he is only 16 months. i'm so proud of him	That's amazing! Im glad he's learning."
"I know! they  grow up so fast! I feel like i just gave a birth to him and look at him now	That's awesome. It's nice to be able to experience that."
"Sometimes things don't work out like you planned. It can be a real let down though.	I have had that happen to me before. I was pretty embarrassed, but I told the manager anyway."
"I got two tickets for a friend and I for a concert. The day of the show, it poured and no one got a refund.	That is ridiculous! Why can't they take care of it themselves?"
"My family went on a road trip this week and had to stop at a gas station for the bathroom.	Well, at least it was a trip without a car. That's one advantage of being a road-trip-rat!"
"Well the bathroom seemed cleaned but the roaches told me otherwise.	Gross!  I would have been sickened if that was me in your house.  Are they normal size?"
"It sounds crazy to say, but even though I was hit by a car on my bicycle, it could have been much worse.	Oh wow, that is lucky! I am glad you are okay!"
"I'm quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws). I am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!	You shouldn't be so content with just being perfectly fine though. Can you walk around with a little extra leg and a broken bone?"
"It might be, but considering I'm 29 with an artificial hip as well, I've gotten used to being half metal.	Last semester was probably the largest challenge of my life. I go to school for electrical engineering, and I took 6 courses.	Wow, that sounds very challenging! I hope you did well."
"Oh my gosh then you know! I have to say though, it all came out in the wash - 4 As and 2 Bs!	Bounds of excellence...That's amazing man. What do you do for a living?"
"Waiting for something to come in the mail can send me in to a tizzy. It's even worse when it's parts I need to finish a computer repair job.	Oh no, what is the problem with your computer repair?"
"I did get it done in the end. It was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came.	I'm glad to hear it. Particulars are so crucial in vehicle repairs."
"Have you ever lost control of your bowels as an adult?	yes I have. Do you?"
"Phew! I'm glad I am not the only one. Although for me, it happened in the middle of dinner at a small Vietnamese restaurant, and an employee walked in on me cleaning my pants in the sink!	Oh wow! You think someone would do that? Just go in there and do that? What did you do?"
"I went to a heavy metal music festival in Las Vegas a few years ago! I had fun, but to be honest it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster.	Was it fun at least?"
"I think it's because everybody can relate when it comes to live music. My girlfriend broke up with me the second day, but we had to stay in the same room.	Maybe she wanted to have a surprise after the break up"
"You know how sometimes things don't go as planned, but it feels like they turn out better in the end?	yes, I know all too well what you mean"
"You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event, but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend.	did you have fun?"
"My father was having abdominal pain, so he went to the hospital and they discovered a tumor.	That's terrible.  What is he going to do now?"
"It was cancerous, but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well. A few days later he passed away suddenly, with no exact cause of death.	I am so sorry to hear about your friend. That is so terrible."
"I love it when the new star wars movies come out, seeing all those kids (and adults) dress up for the theater really takes me back!	That is cool, what are your favorite Star Wars movies?"
"I don't anymore, but when I was a kid, a friend and I dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of Episode I.	That must have been a lot of fun!"
"On our second date, my girlfriend and I stopped in a dive bar on our way back from the beach.	That sounds like fun! Did you have some good conversation about the date and why?"
"Like a hole in the wall. Cheap drinks, sometimes a little dirty, but altogether relaxed - the opposite of snoody. They had a pool table and I showed her some tricks.	that sounds like a wonderful place for you to be"
"Yeah, I should have just said that. Honestly though, my favorite places to drink.	why is that?"
"My father passed away a few years ago, but I still have my grandfather's watch that he gave to me.	You must be very happy about that! Be sure to pass it on to your kids as well!"
"I honestly hope to. Every time I look at it I remember the good times we had together.	Good. Hopefully everything works out well."
"Hanging out with old flames can be tricky when you are in a committed exclusive relationship.	Oh, that's a shame! I was in one of those committed relationships recently. But, afterwards I kind of fell out of love with them."
"Actually, an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink. She made a pass at me, but I told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend.	I would have passed too. She is a strong independent woman who don't need no man."
"going near hights really makes me scared	why is that"
"just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights	Yeah, me too! I'm 6'4 and can bench, squat, and deadlift over 300lbs. You need to be very strong if you want to be successful."
"During carnival season, there is a big rave at an undisclosed location in the middle of the night.	That sounds scary! Where do you go to find out where the rave is?"
"They are a lot of fun! I must admit though, I was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down.	Oh no. Did they do anything?"
"Well, there were only two officers and a couple hundred of us. By the time we were all walking away from the warehouse, I was actually laughing.	my girl friend broke up with me about a month ago	Im sorry to hear that. How are you holding up?"
"we where just not getting along, and did not h ave enough time to see each other	That can be hard to deal with sometimes. Are you guys still talking now?"
"yes we are	I was always terrified of haunted houses when I was little.	Did you grow out of it?"
"Glad I'm not the only one! My friend has a birthday in October and she wanted us to go to one as a group. I'm still not sure if I'll go,	October is a very busy time of year for everyone. I'm sure you'll be fine."
"My sister snores really hard every night it is getting really anoying	i hate when that happens"
"well it is not really her fault it just makes me angry hahah	why does it make you angry?"
"My friend and I spotted a mini-gold course when we were coming back from the next state over.	That is pretty cool. Did you guys go on a mini golf tournament?"
"I know! We played a round and they let us play a second round for free!	Thats awesome! Were you surprised?"

"nothing at all. I was kinda depressed	Why did you feel depressed?"
"My Calculus final was no joke! I started studying hard two weeks before the test.	I know the feeling.  Calculus seems like it would be fun."
"Trust me it all paid off. When I went in to take the test, I was absolutely solid on the material.	I am glad to hear it. What subject was it in?"
"Felt sad when she left for 3 weeks	Where did she go?"
"To see her family. It sucked though because my car had broken down.	Were you able to get a ride to them?"
"I am happy with where we are now living	Why is that?"
"A very nice complex with 3 pools!	That sounds nice! what is it?"
"I interviewed for a new job and the interview went really well.	Oh, congratulations!  What was the job for?"
"The interviewer made all the comments you'd expect from a good interview and seemed to respond well to my answers.	That's cool.  Did he do an impression of you?"
"Some people are just naturals. The first time I played pool with a friend of mine, she had to beat the guy running the table.	That is impressive but also kind of a weird thing to say."
"I shot so-so, but my friend ended up winning the table and beating 5 guys in a row.	That's pretty awesome. I bet you're pretty jealous of that buddy. ha ha."
"I didn't receive a scholarship in college that I really wanted despite being qualified for it.	I'm sorry that happened to you."
"Yes, I'll still attend but the extra help would've been nice.	What extra help would you need?"
"I know things will work out in God's perfect timing	That is a great attitude to have."
"Yes I am. For everything we want for the baby to be gifted to us lol	That's such a cute attitude! How old is the baby?"
"My sister graduated from college after a long road of persistence and determination.	that is great. thank you for your service"
"Yes, she is. My family and I are very happy with her accomplishments.	That's great! How old is she?"
"I like being alone, but not feeling bad when no one is around to talk to	Yes I totally understand that feeling. Are you socially awkward?"
"It's true I do need my alone time	Yes you do need it, but only for a little while."
"Dog ate grass and then threw up	That is disgusting, what did you do to clean it up?"
"Well she was ok. Shouldn't have been so silly	What made her silly?"
"I am so happy to be having a boy	A boy is a good thing. How old is he?"
"Thanks. Yes it is. I already got a crib and baby bath.	I know that must be so relaxing! Do you feel good about yourself now?"
"When I was younger, I worked really hard to save up money for a car, but needed a bit more. But on my birthday, my parents paid the rest for me.	What an amazing blessing that was! I am happy for you!"
"I agree. I really wanted to do it myself, but it's something I'll never forget.	yeah, same here. it's an experience that will stick with you forever."
"I recently went on my first international trip by myself.	That must have been exciting and a little scary."
"To visit my family for about 3 weeks, I got married a few years ago and my husband and I live pretty far from them now.	Oh I bet that was pretty awesome"
"Yes, just very nerve racking dealing with the international flights and passport checks and security checks. Definitely an experience.	I was very proud of her for flying all by herself	Aww, that's adorable! I bet she had to work really hard to earn that!"
"Especially with 2 full suitcases	Yeah. I guess you can never have enough suitcases."
"I don't generally trust people.	Why's that?"
"Upbringing. Dad use to say never trust anyone before I left for school every morning	It's good you grew out of that phase! Did you enjoy it?"
"You just can't trust people any more. My mechanic told me it was going to be $1000 to fix my Jeep.	Wow! Can you imagine how horrible that is?"
"Turns out, nothing much at all. A guy down the street got it running for $100.	That's a steal!"
"I am so happy that we're having a baby boy	That's wonderful! Is your wife happy too?"
"Yes it is. I am over the moon	Are you talking about me or someone else?"
"I've just successfully completed my first international flight/trip by myself.	Congrats! That is something to be proud of!"
"Yes, I got to see my family so it was great! I had to be very organized. The flights and layovers were kind of intense.	I am sure it was exciting"
"I was so sad to find out what she had done. Found it on her facebook message history..	What did she do?"
"She met up with her ex to return his t-shirt..	Well that isn't very nice! I thought she would keep it for herself."
"I am currently expecting my first baby, it's a boy!	That is great news.  How far along is he?"
"October, right around the corner!	October? Is that the month of the year for baseball?"
"I recently went tubing on a river with my girlfriend and her friends from college.	I'm not familiar with the internet term, what is tubing?"
"I had a blast! It's supposedly a four hour float but we were out there for eight!	I would love a four hour sloopy!"
"My girlfriend's dog was a 17 year old Chihuahua who emerged from a bathroom at a party in 1999.	What happened to her dog?"
"He just sort of showed up and no one knew where he came from. He passed away recently after running away from our friends farm and being struck by a car.	Oh wow. I am so sorry to hear that!"
"I can't believe my girlfriend was still interested in me after she saw the slum I was living in.	Wow.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Maybe she didn't see the best in you."
"Something like that. My room was in shambles and the house was falling apart! I was mortified when she asked to come inside.	Why was it falling apart?"
"Once after a night on the town, I came home and my room had been ransacked.	Oh no! I hope no one was hurt."
"The thing is, my alcoholic room mate was the culprit. He had even thrown some of my belongings in the bathtub!	What did you do?"
"I am expecting my first child. It is going to be a boy! We are preparing the nursery and getting everything in order for his arrival!	Congratulations! Is this your first child?"
"Yes, it is!	What is?"
"A few months back, one of my girlfriend's close friends died from a heroin overdose.	That's terrible! I'm really sorry to hear that. How did your girlfriend take it?"

"An extremely timid girl in my physics class invited the class to see her band play at a bar downtown.	did she get a lot of interest?"
"I actually went last Friday night. Turns out she is an incredible guitarist - a real shredder!	I bet that was fun. What kind of guitar was she playing."
"I am pretty sure everyone is scared of being trapped in an elevator, and I can confirm it's quite a shock.	Everest is pretty deep."
"Yes just a couple weeks ago. The elevator screeched to a halt and the lights went out, and I have to confess I screamed.	Im sorry, that sounds scary"
"I thank God every day for the many blessings. Especially our new home	Congratulations on the home"
"5 months ago now. It's really nice here, there are 3 swimming pools	Nice, are you still in the area"
"Right after I had my baby, my husband worked second shift, so he didn't get home until around 2am.	That's crazy! You must have really wanted to sleep in!"
"Yeah, but it wasn't really a problem, until one night around 11pm. I was changing her diaper. The changing table was in front of a window, and I could hear people running up and down the porch in front of the window and they were banging on the house.	Oh no! That's scary!  I would have been freaking out!"
"I'm not sure. Doors and windows were locked, but I was so relieved when my husband got home.	I'm a youth leader, and just the other day a teen from the group was asked to speak at a local church.	That's great that they are using youth as a source of communication. How did it go?"
"He was nervous, he has to prepare an original message. He did really good, and he really showed and understanding of the bible.	What did he show?"
"Thank you.	I get so mad when I have to repeat myself	Do you repeat yourself a lot?  Do you have to be so repeat yourself?"
"I know. But it makes me stressed out	That's no good.  Why do you think it's stressed you out?"
"Hello ... today I am happy, we go with my children to the movies and then to eat pizza	That sounds like so much fun. It sounds like you have a wonderful marriage."
"The incredible ... they love ... it's going to be fun	What incredible?  Do tell!"
"Thank you very much and you too..	Graduating from college was a load off my shoulders.	I'm sure it was, but now it's just time to get back to work."
"Thanks, it was a long journey.	Where did you go?"
"I was turned down for a job I really thought I'd be a good fit at.	Sorry to hear that. Did you interview somewhere else?"
"Someone else interviewed who had much more experience than I did.	interviewed who? that sounds interesting"
"I went to a sketchy part of town once. Just being there put me on edge.	Oh no. What happened?"
"It was for work so I had to do it, but I typically avoid those places as well	Yea, I have to avoid places that make you uncomfortable.  What was it that made you avoid them?"
"We went to a friend's house the other day for dinner. I was helping her cook. I was following the directions of a recipe and accidentally cracked her baking dish.	Oh no! I think everyone does it accidentally sometimes. Did you apologize to her?"
"Yes, I did, but she wouldn't even hear of it. She told me it was fine.	Well that's awesome, did she tell you why?"
"I am looking forward to moving into a easy place to take care of.	Yeah - is it somewhere you've been before?"
"No, not moving soon, only wanting to and looking around to see what is affordable.	I am in that boat right now too. affordable is not attainable"
"So I had an emergency come up for my family and I had enough money to cover it. I feel great for preparing!	Good for you."
"Definitely! And they are paying me back, so it isn't like I'm losing money either.	That is wonderful.  You must be so happy."
"I drank a lot of alcohol at my friend's BBQ party, and I ended up puking and passing out. Not my finest moment.	oh man was it embarrassing or funny at the time?"
"Hahahaha! Well, I guess we can make light of even our worst moments.	Yeah, lighten up. Let's not get too crazy."
"My eldest son just graduated High School I was so proud.	Congratulations! That's high school. Most kids go into college."
"It's kind of a surreal feeling tho, hard to accept that he is grown.  Now college is about to start.	college is great but it can get tiring"
"The time just flys by doesn't it?  It hard to imagine that they dont need you so much anymore.	So a customer just came into my work and started yelling at me for something that wasn't my fault. I hate when people do that!	Did you say anything?"
"No, I didn't yell back haha. I would get fired.	Yeah I bet you would! What kind of job do you have?"
"Retail, yep.	It makes me angry when people never notice me	Why do you say that"
"Everything. I don't have friends so it's nice to get noticed	What are your favorite things about your life?"
"I get excited when I go swimming	swimming is truly a man or womans game"
"The fact of relaxing in a large pool of water. It just grabs my attention	Are you a water dancer?"
"My wife wasn't feeling so well, so I took care of her and made her some soup <3	That's so sweet of you. Is she better now?"
"She is much better now! I love her so much, so I try to take good care of her.	thats great i loved my partner as he is very old now but he still loves his partner as he never change"
"I am so grateful to my family	What did you do for them to be so grateful?"
"They help me with whatever I need and they are always their for me.	I'm glad to hear that, what are some things you got going on?"
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a party	Aww that's nice of them.  Was it your birthday?"
"It really was. I am pretty thankful for them	That's great, it's so nice to have supportive friends."
"A big wind storm blew through town and uprooted one of the trees in my yard.	Wow, that would have really upset me. I feel sorry for the trees."
"No, but that was my fear. I kept waiting to hear the sound of a branch or tree hitting my roof, or breaking glass.	Yeah I guess some people aren't as fortunate as you"
"I took my dog to an agility competition and she ended up winning first place!	Wow!  You must be so proud of her!"
"Thanks so much! It did, but she's so hard-working and I couldn't have done it without her.	How long have you two been working together?"
"I was sad when my parents left me	why you sad"
"I stay with my older sister now	how long were u together"
"My brother got a really high-paying job and now spends all his time flaunting his money.	Dang, that's some dedication. Is he saving up for a new car?"
"Not very well! I mostly just stew and complain about it and wish I had his money and lifestyle.	Have you tried sharing things with him?"
"I was disgusted when my food had a hair in it	I hate when my food has a hair in it too! Do you know why?"
"Yeah I got a refund. They were very sorry about it and I forgave them	That's good.  Sometimes things don't work out.  Sometimes there's nothing you can do."
"I was anxious when I went to the theme park	theme park sounds fun. Was it really busy?"
"The roller coasters	That's fun! I love roller coasters! Are you a fan of the Metrotown?"
"I was furious when my friend made fun of me in front of random strangers.	Some people are so rude. Was it a real situation?"
"I am not sure. He told me he was sorry afterwards but I didn't listen to him	That's really frustrating. What did he say that was so bad?"
"I feel so lonely because I have no friends	Why don't you make friends?"
"I haven't. Im too shy and I am scared of what people will say	You should be confident in yourself! I am sure you are awesome!"
"I was jealous when my girlfriend was talking to other guys	I can see why."
"I do not. I have trust issues	Oh?  Can I ask why?"
"I was terrified when I watched that horror film in the theaters	Oh yeah? I've never seen the film but I know a decent amount of the plot.  What was the name of the movie?"
"I did but it was really a challenge for me.	Did you win?"
"I was sad when my dad died	Oh no, I am so sorry.  Was it a sickness?"
"It happened 3 weeks ago	what happened? are you ok?"
"I was sad when my wife left me	i am sorry thats quite harsh to hear"
"I just dont know why she would marry me then.	Perhaps she had a thing for you.  But why male models?"
"My family and I went to the beach on Tues and spent the whole day there.	that sounds nice.. i bet it was relaxing"
"One small thunderstorm but other than that great! I'm amazed I didn't really get burnt!	Do you get loud storms in the summer sometimes?"
"When someone talks down to me, it makes me sad	Have you had someone do that to you recently?"
"I am just too shy to say anything. I dont know how	Shhh don't say anything. Just be comfortable."
"I am super joyful when my family comes together to eat dinner	That's really nice! You have a great family."
"Usually once a week. Its a great feeling	I will try it then!"
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a big party	Aww that is so sweet! What was the occasion?"
"It was. I had a great time	What did you do?"
"I am so annoyed that people are so mean to other people	I know right? Like why can't people be nice to each other. It's not hard to be nice to someone if you just say nice things!"
"That is so true! I dont know where this world is heading.	And that is the scary part, so many things could happen!"
"I get so jealous when my parents don't pay me any attention.	Yeah that's always annoying."
"I haven't because I don't know how to start that conversation.	Oh I am sorry about that, I just wanted to say hello!"
"I was furious when my dog ate the wires to my Television	That's awful! I'm sorry that happened."
"Yeah but it will take a few days because I have to wait for my paycheck	Oh that is not good!  Do you have any bills that would be aggravated?"
"So what happens in the middle of the night? I got woken, again, by my upstairs neighbor thumping around. Does she have to be so rude?!	Who does she have to be rude? Maybe you should have asked her to turn the lights off?"
"No, they don't. Well, this time I've had enough. I've told management I want into another apartment and explained exactly why!	Oh that's a good idea! Why did you need to do that though?"
"Not really, but the alternative is to go slowly mad. These blessed individuals stomp around day and night, screeching into their cellphones - they're horrible.	I am a very trusting person. It gets me in trouble sometimes.	Oh really, why is that?"
"People take advantage of me	I know right? How can they not see how desperate and desperate I am? I've had a rough life."
"I'm only 6 months away from having my AA in Healthcare Administration.	Good for you.You are setting a good example for your kids"
"I really am, I can't wait to start my new career!	What kind of career?"
"Going to the dentist always has me on edge. I hate it!	Ohh, the dentist is horrible for me too. I hate cleaning up afterwards."
"I know...it's a necessary evil. But it hurts so much!	Why do you think it hurts so much?"
"One of my very dear friends got his dream job recently. He was so diligent in finding information and contacts. I so respect what he's achieved.	Wow, I'm glad you guys can have that chemistry"
"Well, it takes perseverance and a bit of luck, but you can do it!	What exactly do you mean?"
"Lol, you and me both. You could always marry a Kardashian!	I actually might look that up haha."
"Or someone not quite so objectionable :) Seriously though, I'm so happy for K with his new job.	We started watching a Red Sox game near the end and they were losing. Next thing you know, they were ahead four runs.	Wow, that must have been exciting to see."
"Yes, usually I think so too. But this was really fun to watch and we were so happy because it did not look good at first.	Did the other person do something bad to you?"
"My car that I hate is going to die soon and I'll be able to get a new one. Score!	That's awesome! What kind of car is it?"
"I'm thinking something reliable. Maybe a toyota or mazda.	I love toyota's"

"Well, don't you know, one of my neighbors who works for AA was in San Francisco recently and saw some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). So she bought some and brought it to me. How nice of her to do that!	She sounds very exotic."
"This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.	Oh, I am cream of the crop. I love Cheddar!"
"Ooh, I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?	Oregon. We never get cheddar here. It's like they have stopped making it here. They just put Mustards on everything now."
"I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me. I'm in NC, where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!	People are great in small towns. You should go and check it out."
"my brother would've turned 34 today. he died 2 years ago and It still hurts so much	That is so tragic, I am so sorry!"
"yes we were. He moved to the different country but we spoke pretty often	I'm happy for you. There's nothing like family."
"I had planned to go to the beach with friends, but it looks like it's going to rain.	time for Plan b"
"Nah, it said there's be thunder and lightning, so looks like we're stuck inside :(	Where are you that it's not a thing where you live?"
"I spent last weekend with most of my family, they live out of state and i don't see them often.	i am sorry to hear that.. why did you move?"
"I did, Yes. Work has been hectic lately so i was really looking forward to unwinding with them.	Aww - that's no fun.  Is it going well so far?"
"We ate good food, drank wine and went swimming.	That sounds like a great weekend!"
"It was, kind of hot but not enough to complain about.	Thats what im saying, Im expecting a nice hot day here soon. How hot was it where you are?"
"I hate how our country is so divided right now	Why is that?"
"True. I hope we can become less divided in the future and solve things	I am with you on that one!"
"My father passed away about 2 years ago. It was so very difficult for me and very unexpected. We didn't know he had a life-threatening illness and weren't prepared in any way for his sudden departure from us.	Oh man I'm so sorry to hear that!  Did he get a good end of the stick?"
"Yes, my family and I are close and we were there for each other. But, my sister had passed away around 6 years before, by committed suicide. The last few years have been very difficult.	sorry to hear that. i have the same issues with my family"
"I feel like a terrible sibling right now.	Why, what happened to make you feel that"

"I am going to a concert very soon.	Exciting, what concert is it?"
"Imagine Dragon and Grace Vanderwhall, do you know them?	I don't know who either of those people are."
"Yes she was.	Our new property management person is remarkably efficient. She emailed me details of a conversation we had yesterday. The others promise the earth and don't deliver!	That is a pleasant surprise. I hope they listen to you"
"It is. I've been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it.	Have you called to complain?"
"Absolutely! I move September 1st. No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!	School for my kids started again this past Thursday.	Did you start them back up right away?"
"It was good. I am dealing with a mixture of both emotions about them being back in school. I was happy I had all the supplies, clothes, shoes, and other odds and ends in time.	oh nice.. what grade?"
"I had planned a beach trip about a month before we actually went.	Was there any reason you decided to cancel?"
"We went to Virginia Beach earlier this week. I was so giddy up that whole month I could barely contain myself.	I love Virginia Beach! My husband and I went twice as well."
"My husband, 2 kids and my mother. My kids had never been to the beach.	Oh that must be exciting and a lot of fun.  How old are your kids?"
"I bought a ticket last week for the lottery, when it was over 100 million dollars.	Wow. So where did that number come from?"
"I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn, but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.	Hey that's not fair! Everyone gets one right sometimes. Don't take it so hard. I'm sure you had a great time."
"True, but it would be fun spending that money.	My husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! This was unexpected and great news	That's pretty awesome! I bet you're really proud of him"
"It sure does. It came as a shock, but a pleasant one.	What's the big surprise?"
"I just went today to visit my son in his new house.	That's great! How old is he?"
"It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it.	That's great! Is it for a special occasion?"
"So tonight we are suppose to go eat out as a family but I cant get a single one of my family members to agree on a place.  So frustrating!	What is frustrating about that?"
"That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.	Well, its always good to have original ideas. What kind of food do you like to have?"
"Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.	Jelly for the little guy"
"I guess that way the wallet wins every once and awhile too!  lol	I'm so happy that it is Friday!	Same here! What are you doing on Friday?"
"Somewhat, I work 4 10 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. Yesterday was my off day. What about you?	5 hour shifts and I'm a teacher."
"feels disappointed because my friend fights with me	Hey, that doesn't sound very nice. Are you guys friends?"
"no i can't because i love him a lot	That's the same reason I can't have kids, no matter how much I want to love him."
"I have Lupus and it is getting worse.  I asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet I found that is suppose to help me with it.	Oh no, that's terrible. Have you already decided on a diet?"
"yes, but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun	I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with one or two.  Do you have a solution to the problem?"
"Some time ago, there was a terrible tornado that came through my city. It destroyed many homes, a school and some people died. I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it, or harm my familY!	Wow. I can't even imagine. Are you ok?"
"No, they are so awful! They can destroy so much.	I used to have one of those but they got expensive."
"My husband took me to get a new wedding band recently	That's nice. Did you like it?"
"I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.	Well that's very thoughtful of him. Did he offer to buy you a new one?"
"I love the holidays. Driving around looking at decoration is my favorite.	I'm the same way! I'm an IT guy so I love the holidays too. What do you do for a living?"
"Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.	Oh no. Maybe you can take it up with her."
"I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her	that's a good relationship. I hope everything works out!"
"I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.	You are very lucky. Sounds like you have a great family!"
"A few weeks ago, we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But, it rained several days, so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted, which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.	That would be really disappointing. Would you be able to go back at all?"
"Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So, a long time since we first went.	Oh wow that is not fun! I bet you feel terrible! Hopefully she feels better about it now."
"My husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting	He must be so happy."
"I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.	Hey good for you!  Don't be too hard on yourself.  You seem really happy about it!"
"We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man, so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.	That's good. You are trusting with your daughter but I'm sure it was for the best"
"We didn't have much choice, as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat, so if we didn't, we'd come back to not having pets. But, I wouldn't just let anybody, that's for sure!	Its always important to have choice"
"My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell	Was the same for you?"
"I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things	It's so bad to have to trust somebody with your life. How long has it been since you've seen her?"
"One night when my children and I came home, I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!	oh my god, it looks like a ghost or maybe a robber?"
"It was so scary! Luckily, it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up, but it first appeared to be an intruder!	Oh my goodness, that's terrifying, I bet you were terrified! Were you able to squash the issue?"
"Last weekend, my family and I enjoyed a nice meal together, and then watched a movie. It was a relaxing time at home, just enjoying each other's company.	That sounds great! What movie did you watch?"
"Yes, it was drama free and a relaxing time.	That is awesome!  What happened?"
"My dog, riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure	That is so terrible. I am sorry."
"It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps	Good for you! I struggled with my same thing. But I know life isn't exactly rosesicle."
"I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me. She was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support, and that's why I didn't tell her. But, I still felt so bad about it.	Sometimes we don't fully know the situation and we need to interpret what he said to mean. Either way it was a big deal and I am sure you will be great again in the future."
"Well, she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job, plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.	Oh no, I am so sorry!  That really sounds like a tough situation."
"I am trying a new diet to treat my Lupus.	Oh no! Have you heard about Wheatgrass? I hear it's supposed to help a lot."
"I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take	Oh no! I hope everything goes well for you!"
"There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments, so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating, since it causes others more work.	That is frustrating for everyone. I have found that if you can't let her go, you have to let her know it."
"Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over, but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!	It drives me nuts too hahah"
"My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning, and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.	Oh my, that is horrible. Did she say how she found out?"
"Yes, she was only about 9, and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!	oh no! why did it break your heart?"
"I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.	Thats awesome, good for you!"
"Not normally, so I was quite surprised.	What happened?"
"$1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.	That is a lot of money!  I hope you have been able to do that.  Are you going to save any of it?"
"Thank you, that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out.	I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day.	Oh no! What happened?!"
"Someone backed into my new car.	Are you mad?"
"Yes, they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it.	Many years ago, we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her, but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!	Ah, that's a tough situation. I can understand why you'd want to help, but still."
"Well, she was attractive and at the time, I thought he was thinking that too. But, I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, since she was falling down. But, it was hard to see it at that time lol	Oh no, that's too bad! Was she okay?"
"I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.	Oh no, what happened?"
"Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night.	Wow! Did you confront them?"
"Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.	Small towns are great and all but I get bored easily."
"That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.	Maybe you can put a pole up in your back yard and see who comes to take it?"
"My aunt came to visit today, we went out for mexican food!	What a nice aunt! What did you guys eat?"
"Yes, kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours, she is on a road trip!	Road trips are great! Maybe you can go next year!"
"I have a big exam for college coming up, I have been studying day and night.	I hope you do well in spite of having a hard time! What class is it for?"
"It is for my molecular biology class, I feel pretty good that I am going to Ace it.	That's awesome. I hope you do!"
"I went and saw a hockey game today, It was really exciting.	I love hockey! Was it your favorite team?"
"No, I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool.	I understand, being away from the people you love can be a different experience! What sports do you play?"
"I was on a run today, and saw a loose dog but couldn't catch it before it ran off!	Oh no. Hopefully the dog wasn't hurt too bad."
"Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!	Yeah that's a good point! Even in small towns there are lots of crazy people who have no idea what a dog even is."
"I got some bad news today, my dad passed away.	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that, I lost my mom last year and it can be very hard. Were you close?"
"Thank you, I am a mess. It is still hasn't hit me that he passed away.	I'm so sorry. That is so hard."
"Its so quiet in my house, my husband is out of town for work.	That's usually how it goes - unless your husband is sick"
"True, I'm trying but keep hearing creepy noises. Guess I need to turn the TV up louder haha	Maybe turn on some surround sound too."
"I got some great news today! My husband got a better paying job offer!	Oh that must be awesome!"
"Not sure yet, but itll help us life more comforatbly! We move to his hometown in November when he gets out of Army!	That's a big change! You sound excited about it"
"My daughter is in highschool but took a college course this summer and got an A!	You must be proud.  What is she going to school for?"
"That is very good. You should be proud of her.	I ate way too many sweets today!	oh no! sweets are my favorite"
"Thanks! Being on a diet is hard, espically with family in town!	Yes! Do you try to eat healthy? And exercise."
"I was running today and felt like this car was following me..	What kind of car was it?"
"Yes it was, I think I need to start carrying pepper spray or something	why would you carry pepper spray"
"Im watching the show The Bold Type, my favourtie characters dad died :(	I've never heard of that show but it sounds like a good one.  I'll have to check it out!"
"Yes, it's a great girly drama! Reminds me of Sex in the City but Modern.	oh cool!  I loved that show"
"It's been a great night! I'm just relaxing with a cold drink and my favourite show!	Sounds like a nice night.  What show is it?"
"Yes defenitly, It dosen't get better then this! My daughter has been fast asleep since 8pm.	Are you sure she isn't just tired from work?"
"My family is moving from Texas to Arkansas in a few months, Im worried for the change.	It will be fine. Everyone makes the difficult decisions they must. Do you have any family in Texas?"
"My husband is getting out of the Army and moving back to his hometown where he has a few job offers! Big changes coming..	Ah that is a big change! Has it been for a while now?"
"I recently moved into a new home.	That must be exciting!"
"Yes, there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with.	What kind of age is she and is she creative?"
"We had been saving for 4 years to buy a bigger house. We had outgrown our other home.	I had a doctors appointment today.	and how did it go?"
"I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back.	Oh no!  I'm so sorry.  Did they finally call you back?"
"I agree! Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever.	I had just moved in to my new apartment, and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door.	Oh, how cute! That's definitely something you'd want to feed a tabby. Did you end up giving the tabby food?"
"At first I tried to resist, but I ended up adopting him!	That's awesome! What kind of dog is he?"
"I received a wrong number call last night at 2 in the morning.	did you confront them"
"Yes! It was so aggravating. They would not believe me when I kept telling them it was the wrong number.	That would annoy me too. You think they would be more helpful giving you the correct answer?"
"She did twice before she finally believe me that there was no Bret there.	I recently found out that I am having baby number 4.	Great, exciting and scary all at the same time. How far along is your baby?"
"Wow! That is great. We were thrilled because we didn't know if we were going to have anymore and nature just decided for us.	That is a great way to think about it! We don't get enough natural gifts in our life."
"Yes they are. They make life worth living.	Halloween is quite a big holiday where I live. People get really in to their costumes!	so you really like dressing up with your family and friends?"
"It's peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining. Last year I went as a plague doctor, and everyone agreed it was terrifying!	You're absolutely right.Creativity is the basis for any good creative work!"
"Last year we lost our home of 20 years to a house fire.	oh no! that's awful. is it being replaced?"
"Yes, thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened.	Sounds like a scary situation! Did everything turn out okay?"
"No, we just bought another house closer to town. It was sad losing everything that we had.	When me and my friend got lost in the desert, I thought we were done for.	Oh my god. Was it a major or minor desert?"
"Only a couple of hours. We flagged down an old Chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out.	Oh cool! What luck!"
"I went tonight to meet my daughters teacher.	What grade is she in?"
"Yes, I think she will be a great teacher. She showed us her plan for the year and I think it was great.	Awesome. That's a great way to start the year. What grade is she in?"
"Thanks so much. I completely agree.	I just finished watching the Saw movie.	I've never seen it, but I love to hear people talk about it!"
"I hated it! I didn't want to watch it but my husband did. The gore is just too much!	I can see how you would be turned off by it.  What did you end up doing?"
"Yep! I feel kind of sick to my stomach now from watching it.	I recently went down memory lane was looked at all my high school yearbooks.	That must have brought back a lot of old memories."
"Well.... maybe not as awesome. lol But I do try to keep in shape. It was good seeing all my old friends.	Everyone needs some old friends. It's good to have people you can keep in contact."
"I do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch.	I feel sorry for you. Do you talk often?"
"That's a good idea!	What is a good idea?"
"I had this guy flag me down today after leaving the store.	Sometimes pulling people off the street is worth doing for"
"I was scared at first and then he hollered and pointed to the top of my car and I had left my purse on it. Boy, did my face get red.	That's horrible! Hopefully he didn't hit you!"
"My daughter just bought her first car on her own.	That is wonderful. You must be very proud. What kind of car?"
"It's a 2008 Mustang. She worked the last two summers to buy it.	That's a sweet story. Did she get a good deal on it?"
"She is super excited to start school now and show it off.	I'm leaving tomorrow to go on vacation!	That sounds exciting! Where to?"
"We are going to Daytona and Orlando for 10 days.	I am so jealous of you!"
"I sure hope so! We've been planning this trip for a year.	Where are you going? Are you excited?"
"My husband and I have a fun weekend trip planned soon. We are going to go to the casino for the weekend, just the two of us. We are really looking forward to it.	That sounds like so much fun! I want to be able to go to one of those in my life."
"Yes, it's been awhile since we had just some time for us. Plus, we love Blackjack!	I think I would enjoy a visit from you guys sometime as well"
"I have a very good friend and her live-in boyfriend of 5 years hit on me! I'm married, and he didn't care. He sickens me!	That is just rude of him, I am sorry."
"Yes, I was really surprised and I find it terrible behavior.	What happened?"
"We went on a vacation a few weeks ago, and it really made me think back to our last vacation. It was with my father, the last one before he passed away.	It is so nice to have those memories."
"I did, but of course, wished I had more time. He passed away unexpectedly, so I was going over that vacation in my mind too. I miss him.	oh im sorry to hear that. i hope he passed away soon so you can spend more time with him"
"I was pleasantly shocked the other day when I won on a lottery ticket! I hardly ever win and I won $200!	Wow. Congrats. How much did you pay for the ticket?"
"I just tucked it back for a rainy day. But, I may splurge with it this weekend, since it was unexpected.	I love rainy days!  Did you go all out or did you pull back into the house a bit?"
"My husband sure did surprise me with his handiness and hard work around the house last week. He was able to accomplish so much work in a few days!	that is awesome i bet you were very happy"
"Ok	I was the first person to receive a pretigious award at my college after years of the award being on offer.	Oh wow, you must be proud. What was the award for?"
"At the department office back at the school.	Did you do something embarrassing or funny?"
"One of my coworkers really ticked me off one day. She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!	What did you do?"
"Yes, she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her, and it was her work! I let her know it too.	She sounds like a terrible person."
"One year my cousin wasn't going to get her young son anything for Christmas. It broke my heart so my husband and I bought his Santa gifts that year.	That was so thoughtful! Your husband sounds like a great guy."
"The little guy deserved a Christmas and we really loved him.	Sounds like you had a really good childhood."
"When I went to the fair last year, I tripped on a large cord they had going across the walkway. It was a long, running fall! I wanted to hide!	i would have been so embarrassed, did anyone see?"
"Scuffed knees, but mainly my pride. I was also in front an attractive guy I knew so it was even worse.	Was the guy good looking or ugly?"
"My husband and I are at a point in our lives, we are able to save, afford all that we need and save for retirement. I'm so appreciate we can, as I know many aren't able to do that.	You must have a lot of faith in your husband!"
"Yes, we have been working hard, as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times. But, it's worth having some financial freedom!	Yea it sure is. You sound very ambitious."
"One day at work while I was pregnant, I fell! Luckily, the baby and I weren't hurt, but I wanted to waddle away so fast!	Oh no! How many kids do you have now?"
"Yes, it really was quite so!	What was quite so?"
"There are times I feel a bit alone and down. My husband has to travel out of town for work quite often.	I know that feeling, I'm sorry to hear that."
"Well, yes, of course. But, that isn't quite the same, is it.	haha what's the difference?"
"My children recently started school again and it made me feel a bit apprehensive. They are growing up so quick, and I know it won't be long before they sadly move out of the house :(	It's always worrying when your kids grow up and leave you.  But I'm sure with enough schooling they'll be able to fend for themselves."
"For sure! But, it flies by before you know it. I get my nerves on edge when I think about them all moved out of the house.	OH that sounds horrible! How many people are in the house?"
"Despite working until a few hours before, I scored highly on the ACT the first time I took it back in high school years ago.	Good for you man. ACT is a great test to have."
"Thanks. I thought I'd do poorly because I was tired.	That happens sometimes! But I'm sure you did great anyway!"
"Not that long ago, my husband planned a secret trip for us! I didn't have a clue he was doing it and was pleasantly shocked. It was so much fun!	That is so fun!  Did you have fun?"
"We just took a weekend trip to Tunica, MS. We stayed at a really nice casino hotel and just played some Blackjack, enjoyed good food and each other's company!	I've never been to Tunica, have you?"
"I lied to my mother one day about where I was going. It made me feel pretty bad and have a bad conscience.	thats unfortunate, dont feel bad its happened to everyone"
"She didn't want me going with that friend, but I wanted to go, so I lied to her. I was much younger then.	Was the friend a female?"
"I won a free trip to Florida. It's not the best vacation, but I'll take it for free.	Wow! That is awesome!  In which area are you going?"
"I've been to Florida many times before so it wears on you.	Florida is a pretty big state. I've been to all of theses places except the one time I went to the one pizza shop and it was terrible. What's the deal with that?"
"I won a lottery for a small amount of money.	well congrats! how much was it?"
"No, I wish. It was only a few hundred dollars.	Oh well, at least you got a good deal."
"A good friend of mine moved away recently and we lost contact. I really wish we would still speak.	That really sucks. Did you make any new friends?"
"That's a good idea. Maybe I'll try that soon.	What are you planning on doing with it?"
"Someone was speeding on the road and I got into an accident with them. My car was totalled because of their carelessness.	I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yes, but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn't an enjoyable situation.	Oh no. What happened?"
"I let a friend watch my dog for a week while I was out of town. I would've been devastated if anything happened to him.	Oh my god. What happened?"
"I hope so. I've only had my dog for a short time and this is my first time away from him.	Oh wow I can relate, it's really tough to let go of them. Take time to process everything, but I'm sure you will be fine!"
"I have been feeling great about life recently. My relationships have been going very well	thats awesome to hear, i hope they continue"
"I am not, but I have a person I am very fond of. Are you?	Are you? I'm a romantic so I can totally relate. Do you feel the same way?"
"I got a surprise gift in the mail yesterday.	Oh, what did you get?"
"A gorgeous vase. It's so pretty. I have no idea who sent it.	Awh, that's so sweet. Where is the vase from?"
"Yes, I love flowers. I can't wait to fill it up.	My sister broke my vase. I was pretty enraged!	Oh no!  What happened?"
"I scolded her but then told her it was okay, but it's not the biggest deal!	What did she do?"
"I'm am upset today because my daughter who lives really far away called and said her baby was admitted to the hospital.	OH no! I hate when parents can't keep their kids close to them. Is everything ok?"
"He was premature so he's been having some breathing issues. I hate not being there.	Oh wow, I am sorry to hear that. I am sure everything will work out fine though!"
"I'm so taken by the talents of contestants on the show Face Off -- have you ever seen it?	I haven't but I have heard of it. I used to watch it as a kid."
"Their abilities to both imagine and create their characters is incredible!	What abilities do you speak of?"
"A lot people know Toys-R-Us has completely shut down not long ago.	Oh no, when did this happen?"
"Yeah, a lot of my friends and I got to thinking of all our memories there. Really makes you think back.	All that stuff about the past really creeps me out. Makes me feel weird."
"I feel so bad, I forgot my sisters birthday...	Oh no! I hope everything is okay!"
"Yes I plan on it, its just been stressful time at home with a toddler, it slipped my mind	Oh, I bet. I have felt that way when my toddler was born too (2002). Time for dramatic license plate adjustments!"
"I love my husband so much I could never cheat on him.	That's awesome that you love your husband like that! It must make you feel good to be a part of the right set of people!"
"Yea, I wouldnt want to hurt him, i cant understand anyone who does.	Do you have any animals?"
"It can be really tough when your husband and teenagers have electronics.	I couldn't imagine! How does that make you feel?"
"I do for family time but sometimes I can sit in a full room and still feel no one is there	Do you have a significant other?"
"Tomorrow is my husbands Birthday!	Well happy belated birthday to both of you!"
"Yes, we are going out for a nice dinner. We haven't been on a date in months!	That sounds great!  Are you excited?"
"I love the holidays, that make think back to being a kid.	I do too! What's your favorite part about the holiday?"
"Yea, that would really be great. Or maybe we'd get bored.	I'd be happy either way, having no ""days"" off would be great."
"There is a big storm going on in my town right now!	I hate big storms, they are scary"
"I don't, it makes me nervous with the strong winds and rain!	That bad huh."
"My favorite game has an expansion on Monday, I can't wait.	What game is it?"
"World of Warcraft, It's been my favorite for years.	I have never heard of that, tell me more."
"I just got a promotion at my job!	Congrats! What will your new position be?"
"I work in Human Resources for a big company, I wasn't expecting the promotion! Feel Blessed :)	Wow, that's pretty awesome! Congratulations! That must have been really stressful, though."
"I really like every shelf in my house to be arranged just so.	That's cool"
"I do, everything is in it's place. It thoroughly bothers me when someone puts random stuff on them, like cups or papers.	I hate it too! It is irritating! You get stuff that is not yours and it is just stealing from you!"
"I just found out my husband is cheating on me..	Oh my god, I feel so terrible for you! You must be devastated."
"A few months, I'm not sure what my next move is. Staying in a hotel for a few days to think.	Think of it this way. You don't have to leave anything behind that you might need in the future. Could be good to store small things in case you decide to move on later."
"My daughter is finally fully potty trained!	That is great.  My daughter isn't potty trained yet."
"Yes, I am very happy as well! No more buying diapers haha	Dang, that's too bad. Buying diapers is such a chore."
"So, my new puppy is adorable though maybe not as amazing yet as yours.	Aw, well, I'm sure you've got some pretty good dogs there. What kind of puppy are you getting?"
"She's so cute and fun, i love her already.	That's good! You guys got a great future together!"
"I started doing more research on salaries for the degree I'll have in 6 months.	Good for you! I think education is more important than ever"
"It seems to be about 60,000 per year just out of college. I am eager to see if the statistics are correct.	Wow, that's a lot of kids"
"I know it's silly, but my friend got something I wanted in a game the other day, bit sad.	Yeah, I sometimes feel the same way. I get that we want to have things, but we also need to have things we don't want too."
"I guess, little things at times right?	What little things?"
"I watched The Lion King today with my daughter, reminded me of my childhood.	That is so cute! I love it when kids show us their favorite movies."
"Yes! I'm excited for that as well. I watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!	Nice, which one was it?"
"5	What about 5"
"Opps. Ok, i mean that I was sad the other day because a friend is moving.	Oh no! It can be hard to be sad with friends moving away. Were you friends before?"
"not to far, but it's still sad to see her go.	Why is that?"
"I have been having a rough week!	Oh no! What's wrong?"
"Yes but I am afraid I might loose my job..	What kind of job did you apply for?"
"I hate how our country is right now.	I do too actually"
"People just can't seem to get along, makes me sad.	why is that?"
"I spent all weekend alone, wish my family lived closer.	Aw, that's too bad. Do you think you will make it up to them?"
"My family is over 2,000 miles away in Alaska, its tough!	Wow! What part of Alaska are you in?"
"My husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache	I am sorry to hear that, I hope he pulls through!"
"Not yet, but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.	You're a good friend! Do you plan to make him breakfast one day?"
"Ah, it's been rough. My dog passed away two nights ago.	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I bet he was your buddy and companion."
"Thank you, she was 12 years old so I knew it was coming but still shook up about it.	People tend to get scared when they get older. I bet you were proud"
"I hate when it storms so bad the power goes out	I was in that position when it happened to me!"
"I agree.	I agree that you agree. What do you disagree about?"
"I found a hundred dollar bill when cleaning my closet!	What did you do with it?"
"No! I'm not sure where it came from! and I live alone :O	Oh no. What happened?"
"There was a huge spider on my wall, it ran away before I could kill it..	Haha! I bet that was a scary moment. Did you get it back?"
"Me too, I think it was a wolf spider. I hope I can sleep tonight	Where did you find it?"
"I'm so nervous, have a final exam on Tuesday!	Oh man. That is rough. Just relax and try your best?"
"Yes, I have been studying a lot but still worried. I need to get a good grade!	What class is it on?"
"I have to give a speech on Thursday.	I'm sure you're prepared. Are you nervous?"
"Yes. But mentally I am never ready to give a speech if im being honest.	I bet you feel really nervous then. Do you have trouble with your speech?"
"It's on local politics. Not a fun subject either!	I sold some stuff I didnt need last week.	Sometimes it is helpful to temporarily store stock in case a need arose"
"Yea, enought to have great weekened anyway.	That is so true!"
"I think that my husband and me have so much faith in each other.	Trust is essential in a relationship."
"I know, I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.	That is true for sure, everyone has to have honesty in their relationship"
"Ten years ago now, a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate. I didn't know if there would be anything to come back to.	Man, that must have been terrifying! I am glad you are ok, though."
"Pretty messed up, but the house was still standing.	What happened?"
"was travelling 14 hours internationally. First flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative	At least you were able to make the trip. How many people were on board?"
"British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting, they could not	I have never flown on an air plane, but I have flown on a few on the road"
"I've felt excited when I found out I had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course, taught by someone who I knew could help me in ways that I would I not be able to through self-study alone.	That is great. Its hard to get into those courses these days."
"Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special!	You deserve a thank you note for how your words helped the class"
"I think it was :)	I like going fishing, it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.	I've never done fishing but it sounds like a fun time. What are you most interested in doing?"
"I do, I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?	I don't have a boy but I love dogs. What about you?"
"I dropped all my food in the cafeteria the other day. Everybody was staring at me.	Oh my god. Did you do something or ask for help?"
"No, it was at work.	Oh no, do you want to talk about it?"
"I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it!	Was it an important phone call?"
"Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!	Did you ever find out if it was just the heat hitting your car or was there something else?"
"I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!	wow me too"
"Auburn Tigers	I am sorry, but I do not know who that is."
"I did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday.	Oh no! What did you do?"
"I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.	Oh no, that's disappointing. Were they hurt?"
"I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.	Oh that's exciting! What did he think of the ceremony?"
"Oh yeah, definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!	That's awesome! What a relief that must have been!"
"I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!	Wow, thank goodness you had people you could count on. That's one thing I miss the most about moving to the east coast. I guess people make good choices."
"It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.	Man that sucks, but I guess you made it work for him"
"I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.	What happened after that?"
"Yes, I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!	Awww. Maybe you should get that checked out by a doctor. They're usually pretty good about that."
"My transmission in my car went out the other day, maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.	That's a bummer.  It happened to me before and it was not too expensive.  Are you sure it is the transmission?"
"Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too, so my money is tied up.	have you tried calling your bank to try to get it resolved?"
"I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.	What a pain! Hopefully you were not home!"
"No, I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.	I hate when people do stuff like that. I went to a fastfood. They had the worst drive thru ever."
"Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!	You sound very excited. You must be quite proud of yourself. Are you planning on going again any time soon?"
"I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary	What tools and skills did you have that made you feel rewarded?"
"Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech, and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!	Oh my goodness, that rock band is incredible. Was the piece very good, too?"
"I'm sorry if I was unclear, I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).	ah ok"
"So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!	That is so cool, good for you!  Two hands is not that hard.  You just have to keep working at it."
"Yes, very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.	That is great! I do love to spin the ball."
"So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!	Ugh, I live in an apartment, so I do the same thing. It's just so disgusting!"
"We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess	Ohh no. Where did you go? And what happened?"
"I am starting a new phase in my life. Completed all debt and off to a new start	That's great! What made you want to do that?"
"yes very. but I know that it will be good.	what is good"
"Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress	what was the mistake?"
"I try to be. it can be difficult on some days, but I think I have a good attitude towards most things	Aw, that's nice. Being positive is all you can do."
"I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.	That's great! What are you studying?"
"Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.	You must be proud to be in such a good position."
"My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck	That is very lucky! It seems like everything worked out for him."
"Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!	I know right.  In a city that size, it's easy to get lost in the noise and confusing mess of life."
"So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.	I bet that was embarrassing"
"No, but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.	Wow, that is impressive. I've never seen a ball that big or small."
"My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.	That sounds so nice! I'm jealous!"
"No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!	Yeah? What's the value of what?"
"I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!	Congrats! what kind of car did you get?"
"I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.	That is wonderful.  Nothing better than being prepared for a problem you can't fix."
"I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.	what was it"
"It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado, 2pac, etc.	oh man, i used to love 2pac! he was so good back in the day."
"My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.	Oh, that can be nerve wracking! I'm sorry to hear that."
"They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.	They will probably find something they don't like"
"I am so excited - after a year of misery due to my loud, inconsiderate upstairs neighbors I'm finally moving into a new apartment!	That sucks, hope it's a nice, warm place."
"I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!	That sound so nice and relaxing!"
"Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)	I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!	Did the bowling alley get very angry with you?"
"It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.	She is very friendly"
"We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone, especially my brother and sister.	Thats awesome, family reunions are the best."
"It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.	Aw, well I'm sure there will be times you can talk to them!"
"I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.	wow that is awesome, so you train everyday?"
"Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it, but consistency does seem to pay off.	well, as long as you keep up with it, and do it regularly, you'll do great! what are you most proud of?"
"I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.	That is awesome. What are you most excited about?"
"I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though, I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future	Well, stick with it and you'll be just fine. You only have one life and you choose to make it or break it."
"My brother got a custom-made bowling ball, and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.	That sounds like something I would do too!"
"He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.	He must be pretty darn good then."
"Ok, so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!	Uh oh, so you needed a break?"
"Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)	What did you do?"
"Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.	Aw :(  I hope it gets better.  How are you holding up?"
"Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.	Perhaps, but wouldn't that be admitting you were listening to the wrong music?"
"I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.	thats crazy. i hope it was nothing too dangerous."
"No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.	Oh that's annoying! Happens to me all the time."
"I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!	That is so awesome. I wish I had a better internet service so I could experience this."
"I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him	oh thats good for them, hopefully they get along"
"I can't help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time.	Oh yeah, tell me about it. I always wished we could go back to the good old days."
"I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.	Oh no, what happened to your neighbors?"
"The last time I went into a job interview, I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.	You must have prepared well for the interview! Did you get the job offer?"
"Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.	I agree. It's like losing a friend. Do you have friends?"
"Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!	Whoa, that must have scared you quite a bit.  Did you get away from it?"
"I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!	That is pretty funny! What did you do?"
"It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my ""attacker"" off with!	I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself	control what?"
"I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese	You're not the only one who doesn't want to be obese. I'll be a few dollars poorer if I don't go see the doctor."
"My co-worker just bought a brand new car.	Well, that's nice. Is it a nice color?"
"I know, me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.	I know that feeling. Everyone deserves to drive nice cars. It's just part of life"
"i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i'm so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are	I wouldnt let it affect you too much.  you only have one life to try to save."
"I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone	Aww, that sucks. I hope you can find some friends to come home to watch him?"
"I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!	That sounds very calming."
"Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!	I can imagine. It can be loud in the evenings and early mornings when there is noise from people downstairs."
"They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.	Someone stole my identity.	OH my god! I would be so upset! Are you going to fight them?"
"I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.	They didn't clean anything out for you? Did you call them to ask them to do anything about it?"
"i have food on my table, a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful	That's a wonderful place to be.  You must feel so content and at ease with life!"
"yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted	I agree. I try to remind myself all the time because sometimes we forget how good some people are."
"so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets	that sounds very cool"
"thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies	That sounds like a wonderful plan!  Do you know how often they will have their babies?"
"I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!	that's awesome"
"Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.	It was worth it! That is an amazing story."
"Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!	When I spend time with my family, it reminds me how lucky I really am.	That is really great."
"Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.	What did you not realize"
"My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much	Aww that's so sweet of her!"
"She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?	I do not, I am really happy with my dog. Do you have any pets?"
"School starts a week from tomorrow and I am getting fairly nervous for it!	Oh man. Just a tad!"
"Oh yes, I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?	Oh yea!  Good times at school are the best!  What are you in school for?"
"I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it	thats probably true tho"
"yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad	Does it happen often?"
"I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.	You got this! Summer is a very slow learning process. It's so much fun to get into the groove of things."
"I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.	What part time job do you have?"
"My brother just turned 16 and he's about to get his first car! I'm so excited for him.	That is exciting! What kind of car?"
"Probably some kind of SUV, maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!	SUV's are awesom.  Have you ever driven one?"
"I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!	What kind are you getting?"
"I want an SUV, like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!	I've always wanted an SUV! They are so fun!"
"Recently my husband and I were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off	Aww, that must have been frustrating! Were you able to make it back?"
"I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary	Oladip got hit pretty hard by a rookie pitcher last year"
"My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.	Well, you should spend a lot of time with her before she's too old to have any emotional attachment to you anymore. That's what therapy is for."
"She will be 30. It makes me feel so old, but also how fun it was when they were little.	Thirty is pretty old for anette"
"I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I	Are you happy"
"Sorry, I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!	Oh no! Were you working out on a couch or on the computer?"
"I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.	That sounds great! How was the shopping experience?"
"Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!	That sounds delicious! What a beautiful dish! I'm going to have to try that sometime."
"They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.	that's good, usually people don't green beans on their own"
"What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!	That's pretty neat. Have you ever actually bought from there?"
"I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!	I am sorry. Did he do something to upset you?"
"Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!	What kind of dog do you have?"
"My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.	oh god!! you need a doctor to help you!! that is a serious condition"
"Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.	Why would he get stitches? Isn't that illegal in some states?"
"When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.	Oh wow. That's terrible. I'm glad he's doing better though."
"It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!	What resources are you referring to?"
"Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.	I completely agree. I wish we could go back to the dark ages of childhood."
"There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.	I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. How long has she been gone?"
"Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!	What a great memory! What a beautiful surprise. What did you see?"
"I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!	Wow! You must've been pretty happy when you found out your favourite driver had won."
"Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!	That sounds awesome! The night was rough though, was it your first race?"
"I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.	Oh man, yeah that's an interesting learning opportunity!"
"That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.	I know the feeling. I think some people think they have to start all over when they grow up."
"That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.	When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.	Well, that would be a very peaceful thing to do. But now it's calmer, wouldn't it?"
"It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!	I know right. That's why I'm always ready for whatever"
"I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.	i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please	Thats so great. How old is he?"
"he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian	Wow, he must be quite smart! I should visit him sometime."
"A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.	That's amazing.  Was there any particular reason they left?"
"Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.	Oh, I forgot about that!  Whoops!"
"No, moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband, but we split up.	I found a cat in my attic yesterday!	What breed is it?"
"My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!	That is such a responsible thing to do!"
"My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.	wow thats amazing"
"Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!	She also enjoys cooking and fitness and is on a passion to help others. You'd think she'd want to stay in the kitchen and focus on her passion for cooking and fitness but apparently she doesn't!"
"She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!	I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!	Ive never tried that."
"I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!	I do not have hulu. That sounds like a good service though."
"My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident, I'm so upset.	Oh no!  How terrible!  I hope your cat makes a full recovery!"
"Yes, we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.	oh no. That is terrible."
"I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.	Oh wow! Are you ok?"
"Yes, I heard about it. Such a sad story.	What was the story?"
"My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..	They definitely surprised you. Was it a surprise?"
"I did! It was a very nice gesture.	oh how, what did you do?"
"We are waiting on military orders right now, I'm so hoping they come through next week.	Oh, I hope they do, too! Have they done this before, and did they end up happening?"
"Yes, we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.	Where are you guys heading?"
"I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.	I get what you meam"
"Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.	Poor animals always get hurt the most."
"For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.	Thats sounds like a very nice memory. How old are you?"
"It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!	old memories?"
"It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in!	Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.	I do. My brother does the same thing.  I was blown away when he got a Costco pizza!"
"Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries.	What a waste of money!  Do you not get much done either?"
"We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.	Wow! Congratulations! Are you moving to a new place?"
"Texas, there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change.	Texas is a great place! I recently moved there from Florida."
"Awesome, my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.	I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.	What caused you to be worried?"
"So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.	What are you trying to accomplish by evauating?"
"My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her, one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!	That's wonderful! You have some great family members!"
"Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!	You are so right. That is a great experience."
"Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.	My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards	Oh no, I hope she's okay!"
"She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess	Acessible  or  chihuahua?  I have an 8 month old and I've had so many health problems because of having an 8 month old.  What were they saying to cause this?"
"Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. My parents have gone pretty far as well and both with and without. I hope it's not for the worse for you."
"Yes, it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult, so it was really hard when she passed.	It is very difficult to lose a loved one, I am sorry. I lost my wife last year."
"We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.	Oh I'm so sorry you had to go through that! Our girls went through the same thing last year and came out fine despite it being months."
"I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.	That's awesome that your friend was able to help you out."
"I've been so busy packing, packing and more packing.	I hate that feeling.  Are you going somewhere?"
"Yes, don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.	rushes can be very bad. Do you have a lot of work?"
"I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.	Good for you. That is an awesome accomplishment."
"I do feel very lucky, especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.	That's great! I'm happy to hear that. Any plans to get married?"
"I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.	That is awesome. Who was the station?"
"Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back	i love missy elison she is so cute and ricky Martin is my favorite artist of all time"
"I took a test for college the other day, it was basically our midterm.	Did you study for it?"
"I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.	How long has it been since you took the LSAT?"
"Discrete mathematics	I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago. I know a guy who was playing in it. Guess what? He won! Fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!	That is fantastic, I love watching golf!"
"He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to, lol!	What is the name of the course?"
"You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!	You must be so proud of him."
"Thank you - he'd appreciate it. It makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved.	I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.	That's very cool. I bet it is. I'm sure they enjoy it quite a bit."
"There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.	I am in the southeast."
"There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!	Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life	Have you ever triedouts for different jobs?"
"Exactly!  I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is ""Always be prepared""	Nice, I never got that."
"You know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? That happened to me recently - the owners rented it out the night before I was to see it :(	Oh man! I would be so jealous! Did you get to see it before someone else?"
"Yes, but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!	I am sure you will find something soon"
"I'm sure I will so long as I have good neighbors. I'm over the first place now, but it wasn't pleasant to be pipped at the post!	my horse died last week i was devastated when i found out	Oh no, I'm sorry about your horse.  What happened?"
"yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad	I am so sorry! Vets are amazing"
"i am always outside my house beafore my friend gets here	That's very inconsiderate of them."
"i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives	Yeah, that's kind of you. Is he coming early so you don't have to wait all that long to go?"
"i was really happy the day i finished my doctorate	What are you studying?"
"yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end	Well done, you have got to be proud of yourself."
"in science of medicine it was really a fun exppirience	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, and is getting back in a week.  I'm super pumped!	Wow. Where did she go?"
"No, taking a language course to help her graduate studies.  Good guess though :P	What kind of course is it?"
"My wife is coming back into the country after being away for 2 months.  I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P	Oh, that's not good! It's good to get things done, but it can take long"
"Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad, but it's nice to come home to a clean house.	I can just imagine how you would feel if someone mad at you! It's the same thing with my cat! I love coming home to a clean house!"
"i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public	Oh that's terrible. Did it dry very quickly or did you have to use a hair dryer?"
"yeah it is the worst, i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing	I know the feeling! Did you do anything to fix it?"
"I had a bad experience out to eat the other day.  I don't do it too often, so it was a bummer.	What happened? Hope you are ok!"
"The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.	I hate when service isn't good enough! I have had that happen a few times in my life."
"I was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn't watching where I was going and knocked over an entire display.	Haha, did anyone notice? Did it break anything?"
"It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it. My face was bright red.	Oh no! I am so sorry! Was it at least a group effort?"
"My wife has been out of the country for two months and is getting back in a week.	Oh, I bet you're excited and worried at the same time! Has she told you where she is?"
"Definitely :)  It's been a long and lonely summer :)	Why have you been so lonely?"
"I recently moved from California to North Carolina and suddenly realized I knew absolutely nobody. It was a horrible feeling.	wow that must have been a shock and a scary change, I am glad you made new friends"
"My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway, a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly, huh?!	Oh heck, that's too bad. Maybe you'll find a good friend who will help you out."
"The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.	I am sorry to hear that, gas is very expensive where you live."
"The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?	I haven't been to the North in many years, I think it should be included in the annual guide."
"A while ago I drove from Florida to Northern California. It's a long trip, but I knew I could do it just fine.	Wow you must have prepared really well. I've never driven that far!"
"It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East, so kind of knew what I was doing.	Oh yeah? What did you end up doing?"
"Oh no - I'm not a race car driver, lol. And anyway, it's kind of fun seeing different parts of the country, so rushing would (to me) be a waste.	My wife was really sick the other day, she was stuck in bed for most of the day.	oh im sorry to hear that!"
"Not completely sure, maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now, though her appetite took a bit to come back.	That's too bad. I hope she's just sick"
"summer was so boring for me, im really happy school is starting again	Yeah I'm in the same boat.  Was it like this before?"
"not really, i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did	Oh okay, you have some free time then."
"My mom is having weight loss surgery next week, I'm nervous.	That's terrible.  How is she coping?"
"She is having gastric bypass surgery, I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!	Oh no I am so sorry to hear that.  She probably isn't in great health either."
"there is nothing i hate more than losing in something	I can relate. It always feels so disappointing to lose, but I guess even if you do win it can still feel very good?"
"not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me	Really? what race?"
"It has been a wonderful Monday!	Why is that?"
"I found out a got a pay raise at my job, we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in November!	That is great. Where did you find out about the raise?"
"I read in the news about a family who lost all six of their animals in a house fire :(	That's so sad!  I hope they had insurance.  Did they get a new pet?"
"I know, it made me upset! My two dogs are my babies couldn't imagine loosing them.	I feel you man, I have lost 3 so far. It is rough but life goes on and you'll get through it I am sure"
"my dog is over at the vet for 4 days and makes the house feel so alone'	I think you should take him to the vet im sure he will feel better"
"yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back	Where did he go?"
"My wife went out of the country for a couple months at the beginning of the summer, dropping her off at the airport was really tough.	Oh wow, That is a tough break. How did she recover?"
"Not for more than a few days.  It's been a rough couple months, but it's almost over!	Why it's almost over?"
"When my wife and I had to move for her to go to school, we had a lot of trouble finding a place to live until my parents were nice enough to cosign on a loan.	wow, you are lucky to have a couple of people that you can count on like that"
"We are.  They've helped a lot during my life, but this might have been the biggest one.	Financial stress can be a big deal- You should look into credit cards"
"i cant wait to visit my family back home they are so far away i dont get to see them a lo	I understand that completely, I have a few close family friends that live around the same area as me."
"in a couple of weeks i am really happy to see them it has been 5 years	That's so cool! When are you gonna see them?"
"i cant get near spiders, even if i see them in pictures they freak me out	I hate spiders! Why do they freak you out?"
"not really i was just born afraid of them hahah	Okay, so where do you get your fear from?"
"A few years ago, before we got married, my wife planned a party for me for my birthday completely without me knowing.	Wow, it sounds like you two are some pretty lucky couple."
"It really was!  I walked into my apartment to like 15 more people than I expected.	What a day, huh?  You must be pretty happy about that, huh?"
"i hate when my little brother throws food on the table just to annoy m e	That would be annoying, especially since you can see where he is getting it."
"he is like 11 but he does it when my parents are not home it is really anoying	I bet. Is he just picking up girls now?"
"I was stopped at a traffic light when a woman in a truck scraped slowly along the side of my car.	Were you hurrt?"
"Yeah, we both stopped and pulled over.  I think she was high or something, she was really off.	What did you decide to do?"
"i found a little ball of hair when i was eating at a fancy restaurant	that is not good, do you know why it happened?"
"yeah i did, they gave us a refund and we did not come back to that place again	That sounds like you got your money back pretty quickly!"
"I had made plans for dinner and had set everything out and I found out my husband ate all the bread!	Wow, how dare he?? But seriously, I hope you had someone to blame for that."
"It wasn't even garlic bread! It was generic bread to dip in soup!	Ut oh, did you put the garlic bread in the fridge for later? That seems like a waste of bread."
"i feels surprised	Why do you feel surprised?"
"my boy friend gives me a birthday gift surprisingly	You must be real happy with him."
"My neighbor used to have an old beagle - a lovely pooch. He died of cancer just before Thanksgiving. I looked for him for weeks - I miss him.	Oh, that is terrible. Beagle dogs are such lovely companions."
"Yeah. I used to see him when I was out on my porch and he'd come out for a sniff around or a tinkle. He was so sweet and gentle.	Aw, that's sweet. What did you do when you saw him? Did you keep him or try to find him a new home?"
"They sure are. I actually prefer them to some humans I know! Do you have a dog at the moment?	I sure do. Her names April!"
"That's wonderful, that you were able to take her in. Good for you! More people should act like that.	Thanks I really wanted to make sure she felt loved."
"I'm not a very good cook but sometimes my husband scares me with it!	Does he do stuff like this to you, or does he actually like you?"
"He was putting chocolate right into the chilli the other night!	did he get caught?"
"My son came home today and was working on his homework.	How do you feel about that?"
"In 7th and they're doing pre algebra. He said he didn't know it, then proceeded to get every question right!	Well that's annoying."
"I've been training hard for a marathon next week, and I am beating my record time!	oh thats cool.. do you do it every week?"
"For a few months now, but I've been training pretty hard just these past few months.	That's great! What kind of training do you do?"
"I'm very socially awkward and tomorrow i'm going to have a playdate with some local moms and i'm so anxious	Just go for it! You will do great!"
"that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice.	No problem. What did you decide on?"
"I recently went to ruby falls, an underground cavern with a waterfall.	Oh cool! That does sound pretty amazing!  I haven't been to a cavern in ages!"
"Not that particular one, no. I had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down 23 stories.	That is scary! Was it an elevator accident?"
"Overall it was a good time, but i was nervous being that far underground, i need to learn to relax and enjoy things.	I had some hesitations when I was at the gym today, thought I wouldn't be able to handle the weights	Don't be nervous. It's muscle soreness that is worrying you."
"I decided to focus on the music that was blasting, just tried switching up what I play in the gym, it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle	Did your gains go up?"
"Have you ever been in a car crash before?	Yes, I have actually. My husband had one in the driveway."
"I got T-boned once, I'll never forget spinning around in that car, hearing the tires squalling. It was really scary.	Oh my gosh, that sounds so terrifying! Are you okay?"
"My wife has been really sad here recently, I've had to hold her while she cries herself to sleep at night.	I'm sorry to hear that. It's hard to be emotional during a time like that."
"Shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer. We've been to 4 funerals, and the most recent one was really hard on her.	That's hard!  I hope she pulls through.  Did she get a lot of support from family and friends?"
"My bank, which I've had a savings account with for over 10 years has been deducting $15/month from me for ""inactivity"". How about that?	That would be annoying. Did they explain why?"
"Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.	What do you use it for?"
"Yes. They said that they'd been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money. What rubbish. It just amazes me!	Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.	I have. Many years ago. Has it ever affected you?"
"Yes, my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.	That's awful. You must be devastated."
"Have you ever had a new puppy?	not really. have you?"
"Yeah, he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside, but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!	You should take him outside, that might help him learn"
"I store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid. I was storing my last piece in there	thats a smart move"
"Last night I wasn't in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone!	Oh dang! What was it that helped you?"
"I ran into my neighbor's mailbox with my car but didn't stop and leave a note.	I hope there wasn't anything valuable in the mailbox."
"I agree, I felt so bad about it. When I saw him replacing it, I went out and confessed.	Forgive him and let him know how you felt. Sometimes we forget and feel so bad for doing something."
"i'm so stressed. we are struggling financially and i don't even know how are we going to pay rent this month	What happened to make you so stressed"
"thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it's expensive	Oh no! Are you able to repair it quickly?"
"My mom made a pretty awesome scrapbook and gave it to me for christmas several years ago. I recently dug it out and went through it.	That's really cool, what did you find in it?"
"Photos from my whole life growing up, with sections about my relationships with each sibling. pretty awesome.	Wow that sounds like a lot of reading."
"I once was taking a big trip I had been looking forward to and the day before we leave for an international flight a high level travel advisory was issued for the area we were going.	Was it for work?"
"No. We went ahead and went on. It actually turned out to be a great trip with zero incidents.	That's great news! zero is still an accident right??"
"Yeah. Glad we didnt bail.	On your trip? Or home?"
"No. Best I can remember it didnt even rain.	I hate it when plans fall through. I really wanted to spend my time on the water this last weekend.	That is so annoying. Are you able to reschedule?"
"I was going to Florida to go on a multi-day canoeing and camping trip. At the last minute, the two people I was going with backed out, and I simply couldn't afford to go alone.	Oh I'm so sorry, that sounds awful. I hope you made it through!"
"My grandpa always said he was a rockstar back in his day, but I never believed him.	What kind of drugs was he on?"
"I don't know if he was famous, but the other day, he got on stage, bit the head off of a bat, then belted the words to Crazy Train. It was unbelievable!	Haha. I can relate. I once choked on gas while singing Happy Birthday in front of 100 plus people."
"I used to do flooring work, we had to deal with some pretty strange situations sometimes.	flooring is work that needs lot of training"
"well, one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him. was revolting.	Oh no, that's so sad. Did your manager were very upset with the cats?"
"It really bothers me that my son sticks his dirty socks in the toy box	That's a little odd. Why does it bother you that he does that?"
"I guess so haha but no matter what I try to keep him from doing it, it still happens	What does happen in your case?"
"I recently had my hip-length hair cut for the first time in years.	How did you like it?"
"It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut, but it looks much thicker and healthier now.	I'm glad it worked out for you"
"I went around work all day today with a hole in my pants, right on my bottom.	Oh man! That must of been humiliating."
"Yep! No one told me. :( I have no idea how many people noticed or saw it.	How many people are you willing to accept as a valid sample of the entire human race?"
"I paid $1000 for one of those mystery boxes on eBay. It said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items.	Wow! I'd be so excited. I love mystery boxes! What were some of your favorites?"
"I would've happily taken that! Instead, it was filled with literal garbage, like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.	Well, at least you got some Bananas!"
"I had my final exam for Chemistry today!	I am glad you did well. What class was it for?"
"I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.	Awesome! What classes did you take?"
"It can be rough when I have a problem and need to vent to someone	I know the feeling.  Do you have a good support system?"
"You are sweet because part of the problem is when I realize there really is no one to talk to. Thank you	Haha, you're welcome! Hopefully you find someone to share your life with."
"I've been training a new girl at work this week!	How do you feel about it?"
"She's doing great, especially for her second week on the job!	Oh, that's awesome! I bet she gets a lot of flack for being overbearing, but that's good that she's doing so well."
"I've already been shopping for christmas, I'm excited!	Yeah me too. its the beginning of the season. Where do you shop?"
"I know, it's my favourite time of year! Makes me happy :)	What is your favorite part about it?"
"I was just at the casino, spent almost 100 dollars on a single machine. I didn't will anything.	I have never been to one before."
"Haha, yeah I got a little sauced. The worst part though was as soon as I got up, someone sat down and  rolled triple 7s.	What? triple 7?  I didn't know people still did that?"
"I used to get supremely scared when I wanted to go up stairs when the lights were off	Im sorry to hear that. I used to get the same scaredy-cat when I was little. Did you ever figure it out?"
"Yeah, so I would book it up the stairs as fast as possible	Booking it up can certainly make things a lot easier."
"I just got matched up with someone online. It will be my first date in a while.	That's exciting! Have you met before?"
"Yeah, I'm really hoping to make a good impression. Other wise that would feel pretty bad.	What would you do to feel good?"
"Tomorrow is the big day, I have to deliver my proposal to the client.	oh wow, exciting! what for?"
"I have been preparing for weeks, but in the back of my mind I still have doubts.	Confidence is key to being prepared.  Do you have doubts?"
"My boyfriend's cat wakes me up every morning at 4 AM.	Wow, does that cat like to snuggle with you?"
"I love him, too, a lot. But I don't know why he just stands in the hallway and meows nonstop, even when he's been fed.	He might just be mad at you for something or maybe he is just bored? That's really weird."
"Ashe. He's cute :)	I'm finally almost done with my associate's degree! I technically started wayyyy back in 2011, but I just got serious in 2016.	Congradulations.  I am in the process of getting my degree now too.  I went to get one last semester and am about to graduate this one too.  What are you planning on doing after?"
"Thank you. :) I only have three classes left to take. I'm so excited.	Oh wow. What classes do you have?"
"Thanks a lot ;)	Playing hookey can be really fun. But sometimes it backfires...	What kinds of things can it backfire on?"
"When I was a teenager, I called in to the restaurant and told them I had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away. Wouldn't you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!	Aw, that is very sweet. Did you enjoy it?"
"Sometimes I enjoy being alone, but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home.	I get that, being away from home can be very relaxing."
"This was a while back, but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally, he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.	You had a good plan. Did you get to ride with him?"
"I have a beautiful girl friend. But I met someone else.	Oh, I am sorry, I know how that feels."
"I'm trying to figure out how to kick her out of my place.	That is a tough decision to make. Did you already kick her out?"
"I just watched the ring movie for the first time.	What movie is it"
"I can't even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days.	Why did you decide to do that?"
"Once I took a sip of iced tea while I was driving and it went down the wrong pipe. I had to pull over so I could try to breathe again.	Oh no that is terrible.  Do you think you got sick?"
"Yeah it is. I thought I was about to die lol	im sorry, how did it happen?"
"My cashier gave me extra change back and I didn't say anything.	Nice! How much did she give you back for not saying anything?"
"Because I had also stolen some candy and wanted to get out as soon as possible.	Now that's what I'm talking about! You should go ahead and do it! Stealing candy is kind of a bad idea, but at least you wouldn't be the only one getting out."
"A man came to my door with a gun, asking for money.	And did you help him?"
"I did not know him. He took some items from the house as I didn't have any money on me	Oh wow that is so mean. Why didn't you take them back?"
"I like finding little resources or tips that change old habits I've been coping with in what seems like ""1 easy step""	I recently started reading up on my old habit and it actually made me feel more motivated to keep going."
"Exactly, I started taping my mouth closed at night, finally woke up before noon, mission accomplished	You are so brilliant."
"I started taping my mouth closed before bed, and now I'm no longer tired when I wake up, feels like I am born again	hahaha that's good, at least you were able to sleep"
"Yeah, it	Was it a good experience?"
"I use band aid tape cuz it's okay on the skin	Sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time. Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.	That sounds like a lot of fun! Life's never too short, it seems."
"It was, but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived, there was a festival with games, performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!	Wow! You are so lucky! I love going to the fireworks display as well."
"I was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud, and I had a hard time focusing	That really stinks.  Did you end up passing?"
"No, I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible	Me too, we are not meant to be out in public."
"I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!	Did you get into a fight with your bank?"
"That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card, and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!	Oh, that's too bad.  Did they offer you a credit or anything?"
"I went to a bar I used to go to in college, and I was surprised to see an arcade machine I built with a dear friend of mine!	Wow that sounds like a lot of fun. Have you played it?"
"Yes, playing the machine we built together reminded me of all the good times we used to have.	I remember those good times too"
"I hadn't been to the dentist in five years but made an appointment recently because of a toothache	Glad to hear you made it! Did everything turn out okay?"
"I just started to feel a sharp pain in one of my teeth. It might be a cavity or something worse	Oh no! That's terrible. Did you go to the dentist?"
"I can't believe I am telling you this, but I actually camped out to buy tickets for the new star wars movie.	that is honestly amazing, i cant wait to see it come out"
"I'm glad you don't think so. The kicker is, when I got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!	Ooh I hate it when that happens. Did you buy more tickets?"
"My girlfriend and I were going to a big parade with some friends. As we were leaving, she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.	That is really annoying to hear. She will need a cast for sure."
"Unfortunately, it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead, I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.	That is a wonderful woman you have, you are a kind person."
"My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking, but ultimately underwhelming thing	Wow what was it that happened to"
"I guess because furry things don't really scare me, I was like well that was a waste of a reaction	They can sometimes be funny though."
"I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift	The gym is a great place to start though."
"No not really, just seeing how much energy I could summon from within	Could you explain more?"
"There's too many things to think about	I feel you!  Is there a certain reason you think about so often?"
"Yeah, what am I getting myself into	I have no idea, what are we getting ourselves into?"
"I just finally won some money playing scratch lotto tickets.	Nice! How much did you win?"
"Close to $20,000, I think I'm going to spend it on traveling.	Where are you planning on going?"
"I went to a play recently that was unconventional in a really fun way. It actually took place at a pool.	Thats pretty cool. Did you have fun?"
"It was an adaptation of ""The Last Unicorn"". It had parts that took place in the water, and parts that took place on a giant trapeze!	I've never heard of it, but sounds like a fun movie!"
"I got a new puppy. She's really cute and playful	Puppies are the best!  Are you going to keep or sell?"
"I named her Layla.	That is so cute!"
"I recently went to a Steely Dan concert with my lady.	That's awesome. Have you been a fan a long time?"
"Yeah, it was awesome reminiscing about those times when we used to get in trouble back in the day... times were so much simpler then.	It's always good to look back. It's easy to project our childhood onto the past. I hope our kids have that instinct when they get older"
"I just got a new puppy, names fido.	What kind of puppy is it?"
"It is a german shepherd. It takes a lot of work caring for it, definitely needs a lot of attention	Awww, you are a good german shepherd. Do you help other German Shephards?"
"On my way to work, a goose stole the toupee I needed to impress the new secretary, Christy.	Oh man, that would get old after a while."
"No! I am so furious with that goose, that I could wring his neck! I can't get any ladiez with this chrome dome of mine.	I guess he was trying to prove something"
"I was doing the dishes and a huge roach crawled out from underneath the dishwasher.	Oh god. I would have screamed."
"I almost fell over trying to crush it, i forgot I wasn't wearing shoes and stepped on in with my bare feet.	I fell over once doing something similar. It is a bad feeling."
"I was walking down the street at night, I felt like I was surrounded by something unseen.	Oh yeah? What was it?"
"Every time I turned around to try and catch something there was nothng there. Just the feeling of something watching me....	i understand what you mean"
"I had a job interview that I didn't really feel prepared for.	you'll do fine, just act natural and don't worry"
"I did not get it unfortunately.	what did you not get?"
"One time, I smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car.	Was it the smoke from the cigarette?"
"Well, when I went to lift the engine cover, I noticed a dead, rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.	I hate those. They are so gross."
"I went to the store, just trying to get some milk and bread, and I got rear ended by a driver.	That's terrible. Were you hurt?"
"Yeah, it was more of a shock than anything, was not expecting someone to hit you when you are just crossing the street.	That is a good way to look at it"
"I have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech.	Oh, Are you ready for it?"
"I can only dream. No it's more on par with Lord of the RIng's final battle.	Is that a game"
"Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.	Did you say anything to them?"
"Yeah, I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.	Did you get there before it was closed?"
"I thought I bombed my math test but I got a 103 on it.	Oh that's great! A 103 is pretty good."
"I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.	That's great that you were able to get it all done."
"I just found a photo book of me and my family growing up.	That must have been very nostalgic, how old were you at the time?"
"It was pretty nostalgic , how young we all looked growing up.	I agree, those days will never come again. What were your favorite parts about growing up?"
"I finally got to see a baseball game live this last week.	That's pretty cool. I didn't know they were still playing."
"It was the Rockies, no home-run though, it was pretty high up there I felt like I could see the world.	Are you from New Mexico? It's cool to see places from your area."
"When my buddy asked me to help him clean out his grandmother's house who had recently passed, I was not prepared for what we found.	Oh my goodness! What did you find?"
"You hit it right on the money. She was not only a hoarder but a cat lady, and the mix of paper, bugs and cat feces was an affront to the senses.	Thats an interesting mix of items. But, I do agree with you on the senses!"
"I let my dad borrow my car and he got in a minor accident.	Oh, that's unfortunate. He didn't take responsibility for it?"
"Yeah he is fine and my car was not damaged. My insurance premium is probably going to go up though.	Hopefully nothing too bad happened to your car!"
"He said he would cover the extra costs so I'm not too upset	When I bought my new car, I couldn't believe how smooth the ride was.	That sounds amazing!  Did you have to use a special program to get it that smooth?"
"It's a Chevrolet Camaro.	Neat! How does that make you feel?"
"I studied for 7 months to take the GRE exam, it was stressful.	What was the exam for?"
"I did, and I was accepted to my number 1 program, which meant that I was going to be paid to learn!	Yay! What program is it?"
"I have a feeling the really hard work might just be beginning, but I feel exceptionally lucky.	I studied all night for my final exams. I needed to pass them to graduate from college.	That must have been a lot of studying."
"I did. I was able to sneak in a few hours here and there.	Why did you need to sneak in?"
"I left my wallet in a movie theater, and didn't notice till I was half way home!	Wow did anyone call out to find it?"
"I was able to get back in and find it, it was pretty well hidden in between the seats. No harm no foul.	thats cool"
"Some people are just so generous. Really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there.	I agree. I've seen some really good charity work going on lately."
"That's incredible if true, but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast!	Haha oh man that's amazing! That would be so awesome! Do you know who the concert was with?"
"I was so proud of my daughter over the weekend.	Oh yeah? What did she do?"
"She performed her first solo dance in competition, but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.	That must have been difficult."
"It was, very much so, I will cherish it forever.	I'm grateful for the work hours, but bummed that I can't get time off.	yea i know how that is"
"Well, I've worked without a break for the last 3 years, I just want to get away abit.	Well, you could always start a side business.  You could make some pretty penny."
"Right! I'd like to go lay on a beach, or even just the next town over at this point.	I have been extremely diligent in my studies so far, and am participating in two clubs this upcoming year. The future is looking bright!	You sound very motivated! Good for you."
"I am an electrical engineering student, and I am interested in quite a few things at this point. I think after this year, I will be able to get a paid internship next summer!	Wow that's exciting! Are you switching jobs?"
"I am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump.	Why do you have to do that?"
"The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents, so the dump has a line every day.	That sounds bad, did you quit?"
"We have, and we called a city meeting. I'm just beyond words,it has to be corrected.	's all too common these days. |||| NEW CONVERSATION ||| I recently went to a dinner where we were served something unconventional to say the least.	i am sorry that you went through that. what was the dish?"
"I should have known better, as these friends are on the ""crunchier side"". They had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!	Oh my goodness, do you know if they got caught stealing it back?"
"I lost my appetite completely! I will be sure to get takeout before hand if we ever go to another one of their dinners.	my mom is supposed to call me regarding her test results.	oh no. I hope that she did well"
"She had stage 3 cancer, but she was clear last screening a year ago.	How old was she when she got the cancer?"
"Thank you, I have a good feeling about it.	I went to a wedding recently, and something happened that put a damper on it. I felt bad for my buddy, but at least he knows he can trust me.	yea man thats happened to me before. i cried for a couple days afterwards"
"Yeah, his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up, and let him know what had happened.	She should be more careful. I don't know if I could deal with that."
"I am highly upset that I'm the only one concerned with earning money for our bills	It is tough. Do you work?"
"Not much. It's all on me. It sucks	That's not good. What's going on?"
"I love playing old school video games. The music is amazing	I like that too, the sound of the game makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside."
"For me it's happy emotions	do you have a favorite emotion?"
"The micro brewery explosion in America has been awesome for my girlfriend and I, as we love craft beer. Until recently, our town didn't have one though.	How many people are you expecting to have visited this week?"
"We actually don't brew our own, and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!	Oh, wow. That is kind of neat. Do they taste any different than the ones you make?"
"I hate it when other guys look at my girl	Oh me too. I never want to be with those guys."
"She's for my eyes only. At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!	I am sorry,  how does she not pay attention?"
"Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read ""Kitchen Confidential"", or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year.	I'm sorry to hear that. Bourdain was a cool guy."
"He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food, and we all still look up to him.	Wow, I wonder what his motivation was."
"My husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing.	That was nice of them, did you cry?"
"Yes, it was a lot of fun and it caught me off guard. It meant a lot that they did it for me.	That's cool.  Did it make you feel good?"
"I gave twin fawns in our yard some fresh peaches and they loved them.	That's great. I gave my daughters some peaches aswell."
"I enjoy helping the wildlife in our area. It is alway a good feeling to give a helping hand.	I bet that is a very rewarding job!"
"In a week my wife will finally be back from being out of the country for 2 months!	Wow. What are you going to do?"
"She was taking a language course in Germany for her graduate studies.	Oh wow, how do you think she'll do in the course? I'm assuming she will have to work on specific parts of the course, right?"
"I'm moving into another apartment and just told my neighbor I was leaving. He said he was sorry I'm going!	That is so mean. Are you going to move out of the apartment?"
"About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.	Did something happen between you?"
"Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!	Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday, so I had to work overtime, but I didn't even get paid for it!	Wow...I am sorry to hear that.Do you think it was his fault?"
"I'm technically salaried, so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating.	Oh, that would be irritating, too. Do you know anyone who is?"
"I went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it	I don't blame you! It's disgusting!"
"Sadly, no.  There's no actual proof of who it was, but we've seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place.  He did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once, so I'll take that as a victory.	That's cool...if there wasnt any real proof of it then thats good"
"My husband went to a job fair and got a lot of job offers!	Nice! Did he take any of them?"
"He is currently Active Duty Army, but is wanting to go into transportation/logistics.	Oh, that sounds pretty interesting. Has he decided to do it?"
"It's been a great day so far! The sun is out and I'm on my second cup of coffee!	That sounds great. I'm jealous."
"Yes I am, about to make some soup for lunch. This day has been just what I needed!	Good for you! soup is the best"
"When I applied for the job I have now it took them like a month to get back to me with a final answer.  It was pretty stressful.	I know how you feel, they have been known to take forever."
"Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end, but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.	That's very frustrating, I wonder if there's anything you can do about it>"
"A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.	Wow, how lucky! I would love to travel too."
"I know - I wish I could do that. They've been to France, Italy, Croatia and Chile so far - I'm sitting in NC!	Wow, that is a long way to go. What is your favorite food to eat?"
"I would just like to be able to drive to Raleigh without hurting! I fell and broke my hip a while back and can't walk properly.	Oh no I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're ok?"
"One more operation and I should be good. In the meantime, I have to live vicariously through Joe and Helen :)	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, she gets back in a week.  I can't wait!	I bet you're looking forward to it!"
"I really did.  It'll be great to have her back :)	It's always great to have friends you can rely on"
"When I interviewed for the job I have now, they didn't give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview.	That is really bad. What do you think is going to happen?"
"It worked out ok, but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.	Are you still with them?"
"My wife has been out of the country for the last 2 months for school.	Oh no. You must be lonely."
"I do.  She's getting back soon, but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.	Oh, dogs make it tough! They know what they're doing and so they always find a way to get what you want."
"When I interviewed for my current job, I felt like it went well but all I could do was wait.	Did they give you a job offer?"
"A lab technician at a university.	How did they do that?"
"My parents brought my brother a brand new iPhone. He always gets the newest stuff and I get stuck with nothing.	That sucks, your brother has a loyal family."
"I have no idea. He's the ""golden child."" It's super unfair.	I can't imagine anyone would be that way towards their child. I hope you told him how you feel."
"My wife has been out of the country for two months, which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can't help the other.	Oh, I only wish that was me. I also miss her a lot. I hope you feel better soon!"
"She gets back in a week, so it's almost over.	I know that feeling, it is so hard."
"my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! I hate insects. they are so nasty	I would have been so scared. Did you kill it?"
"heck yes i did! I locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work	What was it a?"
"i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season	i hate them too"
"yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them	Rainy season here too, I can't stand it. Makes me want to stay inside all day in dirty clothes."
"Both me and my girlfriend are super scared of spiders, but she made me kill a huge one yesterday.	did you kill it?"
"Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!	Fear is a reason to be scared!"
"I'm going skydiving for the first time with some friends!	Oh how exciting, are you nervous?"
"A little bit, but I love doing extreme stuff like this.	what kind of extreme stuff?"
"The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night!	Oh that sounds horrible. What did you do?"
"It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs!	That sounds disgusting!"
"On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.	What?! That's awful and terrifying! Have you heard back yet?"
"Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.	Oh surgery is scary. I hope everything goes well"
"You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still, I fret about it. I should just get on with it!	I'm about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack	That is nice. Do you have any family over?"
"she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her	What a wonderful person! She sounds wonderful!"
"Cell phones are great, but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable.	Yes, some have some weird off limits like recording your conversations."
"Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline, and it was not an appropriate topic!	ring? what do you mean? if you were in a relationship, that's totally normal. if you're alone... interupting that makes a big difference"
"Of course they did, some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where. I was humiliated,lol.	My dog died today :(	I am so sorry to hear that, you must be going through a tough time right now."
"Yes, she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.	That's so sad. It sounds like you had such a hard time. How old is she?"
"my daughter went on vacation with her friends and the house feels so lonely	I feel for you! Where did she go?"
"they went to the beach for 1 week	Are you happy about that or sad about it?"
"I'm moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can't wait! No more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!	That sounds awesome. Are you moving to a new place because you don't like them or you just are looking for something different?"
"Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?	Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?"
"Eww. Yes, it is loud. Who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? That's nuts!	My wife has been out of the country for two months, and is coming back in a week!	Are you nervous about being apart?"
"It sure is.  It's just been me and the dogs all summer, I've gotten super bored :P	Oh, I know that feeling!  Did you do anything fun with the dogs this summer?  Do they enjoy your company?"
"I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!	It sure is! Waiting for the call back is driving me crazy!"
"I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom. I am so grossed out by all the bugs here!	Oh I am so sorry! Have you tried calling bug spray?"
"Spiders could bite me, which could really hurt!	i feel that with my training lately im going to win my next week soccer game	You should definitley work on your soccer game skills."
"for this specific game for about 3 months	well hopefully you didnt go into tournaments too much and you will be good by the end of it all"
"After my wife and I moved I went through a while of unemployment.  It was really tough not being able to support us.	I am sorry to hear that.  unemployment is really tough.  Is there any way you could get a new job?"
"It's gotten better now, but it could still get even better.  Just got to keep on moving.	moving what? your future?"
"i am really happy for next year i have a trip planned to go to india	That is really something to be proud of. Are you going by yourself?"
"yeah i have been planning this trip for over 2 years	Cool.  Where are you going?"
"I had the most wonderful week recently. My neighbors weren't here and I could do whatever I wanted without them stomping on my head!	That sounds awesome! Did you get to do anything fun?"
"It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.	Oh no. Do they at least offer you gum to help?"
"That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!	Oh no what happened? I hope everything is okay!"
"Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.	Cool. You gonna get a pool."
"I went to work with my pants inside out, and I didn't notice until my secretary pointed it out.	I love that when people do that"
"It was very embarrassing! At least I didn't go the whole day like that.	Oh no. Were you supposed to?"
"The airport was completely empty the other day.	why is that"
"Home, but I thought LA would be crowded even at 4am, it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy.	I can imagine.  I think I remember going to a theme park where people would be feeding people and stuff.  People could even drink wine."
"Made getting my connection super easy, and trust me I was in a hurry to get there. Odd how being alone can make you paranoid.	i cant wait to see my dog back home it has been 2 years since i see him	I bet that is so exciting"
"college, but i will be seeing him very soon i think	Ah, that's exciting! I bet you can't wait to see him!"
"So my youngest went to his first day of kindergarten today.  So proud of him.  Silly I know.	Congratulations! How old is he?"
"I hope so should be home really soon.  Can't wait to hear all about it.  IT goes by to fast!	IT? I don't know what that means."
"I know my oldest just graduated,  It was like it was over in an instant!	A few months ago we were planning our wedding and I couldn't wait until the actual day finally arrived.	Do you guys have a big budget?"
"It was even better then expected. It was very small, but so happy how it turned out.	What did you make?"
"i hate when my neighboors dog poops on my yard and she does nothing, i dont care if he poops if she picks it up	Did you tried to talk to your neighbor about it?"
"hahaha i mean he does not do it often but it is not a bad idea	What is the plan to deal with it?"
"After studying and preaching for a few years, my husband was ordained to be a minister.	Wow, that is a big promotion! Congrats to both of you!"
"Yes it is and he is so devoted to God and living for Him. I was so happy for him.	What a good person. Why do you give him the responsibilites?"
"Thank you.	This morning, my dog knocked down a while box of cereal and it spilled everywhere.	Were you able to clean it up easily?"
"Yes, and to make it worse, when I tried to clean it, she tried to eat, so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.	Did you almost knock her over often that you noticed this?"
"No, she only ate a little bit. I cleaned it up pretty quickly.	There was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it	I love going to new resturaunts.  What did you get?"
"I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive, small, and bland!	What!? That sounds terrible! I've never had a taste for anything so awful. What happened?"
"In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.	You know there are other ways to find the true fan"
"If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.	I respect that"
"I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol. I'm all for earnest discussion, but not at work!	My husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber. He was able to carry so much at once!	I repair things too. We got cabinets and light fixtures. Its not cheap"
"He is! I was so shocked but super attracted to him too!	Who is he?"
"i was really sad when my dog died last year	Oh no! How old was he?"
"yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about	I get that, it probably bothers you a lot."
"A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer, but he got a job and had to cancel.	Did you ask him why he had to cancel?"
"Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.	What if it turned out he didn't want it?"
"I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.	My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday, we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe, have fun, and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call, we found out that she had a heart attack and died.	I am so sorry to hear that!  My grandmother passed away about 10 years ago and it is one of those things that is hard to recover from.  Take the time you need to grieve.  Don't let it consume your life."
"Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.	At least it's not the worst, can you laugh about it now?"
"Thank you.	My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her.	Whoa, that's amazing.  I am so happy for you and the cat.  What did you name her?"
"I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad	Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that!"
"I love to play golf, but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again.	Golf is a wonderful game. It is one of my favorites."
"It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!	wow, its really commendable to see that your willing to take a chance and go through the tough times"
"Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.	Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!	exactly, i cant even imagine!"
"I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.	Wow, that is really cool! I guess it was a religious experience, not a cool thing to do, but really cool!"
"I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.	I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!	That sounds so awesome!"
"I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies.	What movies?"
"I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies.	I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face!	OMG I hate bugs. Did you kill it?"
"I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled!	burgled! That's a new one for you! I'm sorry but I'm really not sure what you'd really call that. I mean you were probably really excited, but what were you yelling over?"
"I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything	You have to be confident even if you don't say the right things. Just focus on the interview and you will do great!"
"a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job, they pay really good money	Oh, I hope you get it too! That sounds like a lot of work."
"I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.	What kind of memories did it bring back?"
"I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.	Aww I'm sorry. When will you see him again?"
"I actually sent her a message through facebook.	That's cool.  What did she say?"
"I guess that's a good word for it.	I came home from work today and my wife had a new puppy waiting for me.	Puppies are the best!  What did she get you?"
"Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day.	Aww! That's great! I bet it's a ton of fun :D"
"It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back.	I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled.	Oh, that's terrible. I would cancel all the things you have saved up until you get it, then buy the dress on demand."
"I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.	That is smart, maybe you can save up and then use the money for something else?"
"I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.	I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!	Oh wow, you might have been tempted to buy even more!"
"It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.	I know it probably hurt a little inside. But i'm glad you realized it and didnt say anything."
"It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!	my son is sick, he got this hand foot and mouth desease, nothing serious but he has a fever	Oh I hope he feels better soon! That is not good hopefully its not the cold."
"i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow	Well at least it sounds like you're taking care of him with some good health care. That's better than some people."
"i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions	Cool. What kind of competitions?"
"honestly, no, it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again	I can only imagine! I was never able to hang out as much as I wanted to. It seems like all the good times have passed by."
"I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.	That's cool. Have you been watching the past tense, because I don't really get it."
"I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!	If you enjoy something very different then by all means go for it! But if you are also enjoying the sport then good for you!"
"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	Oh no, how awful. I'm sorry that happened."
"Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.	What really happened? I hope it was not too scary!"
"Yes, they did.	I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!	Wow I hope they are not pets"
"I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden!	Yikes! Did you call the cops and report it to the city?"
"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	i agree with you there. what is worse is when you hear about someone hurting an animal, and seeing it suffer"
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	Wow, you are quite angry"
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	What was it?"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	Thats scary. I hate raccoons."
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	What a trustworthy friend.  lend me your bank account and i'll repay you"
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	what type of job is he looking for?"
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	That must have been very scary."
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	That was very nice of him. You are lucky to have such an awesome table!"
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	I used to have a drone, I miss it."
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	Could be a fishing boat, I guess?"
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	Yes, I don't like being asked to babysit sometimes either."
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	I get that, like, ""What did he say"""
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	I know the feeling. My dog just recently passed away. It is hard"
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	That is strange. Did he turn out okay?"
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	Wow, what did you do!"
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	What's wrong?"
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	Rotten salmon? Yuck! I can't stand that stuff."
"I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.	You need to sue them because they didn't fix the hotel"
"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	That's smart. Did you get good weather?"
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you were able to get it fixed asap."
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	I remember those days fondly"
"Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.	That's great to hear. Data is so important to have because otherwise you might not be able to interpret it in a meaningful way."
"Criminal and social justice.	I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.	I bet that was a thrill"
"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	What were you thinking about?"
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	I hate being home alone, so I know how you feel. Do you like snowboarding?"
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	that is not fun, but true, it makes it hard to do anything at all on the weekend"
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	That's so true! You sound like a good person."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	That's sad, how old was your dog?"
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	Did you get to do anything interesting on your cruise?"
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	That's great! The fun never really stops!"
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	I bet you were really worried about that."
"She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade	What is her major?"
"I finally had a day of, but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.	I am glad it was nice then. Do you usually like the weather like that?"
"I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.	Did you get a chance?"
"I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious	Sounds really good, were you disappointed?"
"Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.	What exactly happened at the shocking points?"
"I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes	How do you like them? Are you getting a better rate?"
"a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is	Yeah, it sure is. It's insane how expensive health care is."
"I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!	What kind of cake was it"
"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	yes, but you can do it"
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	That's terrible, I hope you are feeling better."
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	Sorry to hear that"
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	Oh no! Sounds like you might have a lot of responsibility to take care of your dog."
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope you find him."
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	I've been there...my wife and I just recently broke up, but I still get so upset thinking about it sometimes."
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	She probably just didn't want to be in your life anymore."
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	Wow! that's incredibly nice! I'm seriously impressed that people can be so generous."
"I will, you never know when someone else is in need!	I completely understand. It is nice to be able to know that someone will be looking after you."
"It is, I have been so blessed in my life!	My husband started college this week!	Oh how exciting, is he excited?"
"Yes, he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!	Oh that is so cool! Have you been to his graduation?"
"I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.	Oh no that's no good! Did they give you fair warning?"
"No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.	That is really bad. Did you complain to your restaurant?"
"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	Ouch!  Did you hurt yourself bad?"
"I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards	Oh no! Did you lose a bet?"
"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	Same here, I don't like watching scary movies at night."
"I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.	Oh man I am sorry to hear that, did you get out?"
"I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.	My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!	You should probably get some sleep, dog owner."
"People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying!	I hate that!"
"I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.	Did you have some left over after you finished?"
"I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.	Yes, that is good, how long have you been doing it?"
"When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!	I know, it feels good when you accomplish something you weren't even expecting to."
"Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.	Yea, sometimes it is nice to get things out of the way. I hope you can save a lot and have a nice retirement!"
"Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!	Are you nervous?"
"I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous.	Wow 3rd grade is exciting, good luck!"
"It really is, you are molding their future!	I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce	that sucks"
"No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.	That's terrible. Hopefully they don't have a kid in the future then."
"Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.	I definitely agree. I've been trying to get one for a long time. How long do you spend using it?"
"They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	Oh no! Have you tried calling your representatives?"
"It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.	My sister got a promotion at work last week!	Thats so good for her"
"She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)	Wow. She must be a hard worker."
"My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.	Wow, that was really nice of your friend."
"Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.	Thats funny how did she wind up submitting it?"
"My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!	I can imagine! But think of all the opportunities and new things to discover!"
"I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.	Oh no! Well, hopefully he opens up to you soon"
"Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?	Yes, but you will never let that control freak ruin your life. It's impossible to let go of those feelings."
"Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!	What game does he play?"
"I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.	I have been there, I loved the nintendo switch"
"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	I bet you were thrilled!"
"I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.	I hear you! Can you tell me what your major is?"
"I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.	Sounds impressive. I need to take a closer look at how well I did on my colllegeometry test."
"Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.	I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made!	Is that good or bad?"
"Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.	How old is she? It can be helpful to give her something before she goes to bed."
"Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!	I always make sure to do that. Makes getting coffee a lot easier."
"Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.	Sorry to hear that, it could have been worse"
"4	I didn't understand."
"Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.	I used to have a bearded dragon when I was little. Did he scare you?"
"My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.	I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday	Wow, that sucks. Did they give you a severance package?"
"Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic	You sound very lucky!"
"I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am	oh yea what was that?"
"Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life!	Oh cool! What's the big accomplishment?"
"I had such a bad cold last week, I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.	That's terrible, are you ok?"
"No, thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still, I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.	I can't stand to see people with such terrible diseases. It makes me want to sink into the floor"
"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	I guess she did something to you at least"
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	Oh wow, that's really interesting, maybe she was just being polite"
"She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.	thats a scary situation to be in.  Did everything turn out alright?"
"Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!	I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.	That is very stressful. I think you will be fine!"
"I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.	I am so with you. My daughter has a lot to learn and it has been a very stressful time. I think you are going to be really great. Just take it one day at a time."
"I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome	haha awesome, did anyone else see it?"
"I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing	What kind of pet was it"
"I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!	It shouldn't be too bad.  When I took the test for 4 years I was always stressed out due to studying so much.  Just study and you'll do fine!"
"That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.	It sounds like you have a lot to study. You will do great!"
"I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.	I am sorry to hear that. Do you think she will ever come back or is it just a bad break?"
"Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?	Oh no no no no no no no! I hope everything is still good! How did you process it?"
"Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.	I completely agree, they are a bit much given how dangerous the place is."
"I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!	Oh geez! Did anyone see it?"
"I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.	yea thats fair"
"Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.	Yeah he smashed my prized antique vase."
"2	I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!	Do you live in a house or a forest?"
"Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.	What are you going to do?"
"I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.	Where did she learn?"
"Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.	well if you look at mbig picture it's pretty easy to draw girls with big eyes and big ears. so i think you will do really well"
"I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise.	It's good you have a good friend that can help you in different ways.  It's probably best to have more than one friend though."
"I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.	It's nice that you have such a great partner like her!"
"I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.	oh wow im so sorry to hear that! I have also been diagnosed with cancer. it is never easy"
"It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.	Oh I'm so glad to hear that! I remember when my mom struggled with cancer. I was strong for her."
"Thank you so much for being supportive. :)	I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.	That sounds scary! What happened?"
"Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.	Oh no, that sounds terrifying!  Did you end up getting shot?"
"Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.	I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.	Oh no. Is it all ok now?"
"Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.	I'm sorry to hear that. You must be very proud of him!"
"Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.	I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	Oh my god. Congrats?  You should probably go see a doctor to help you get back on your feet."
"I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.	Yes there are. If you know you can then why not?"
"Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly	I bet it was so relaxing. What kind of games did you play?"
"Super smash bros is a classic, never gets old, but yeah you're right	I've played that game a lot as a kid."
"I had a job interview recently	How did it go, and where are you going to work?"
"Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.	How come?"
"Speaking of co-workers, one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes, and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.	Oh no, is it treatable?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.	How about a trip to McDonalds?"
"I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me	That sounds lonely! Were you able to find someone to go with?"
"Jurassic World. It was okay.	I've never heard of it! What do you like about it?"
"I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.	did he get a beat down?"
"Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge.	Wow that's kind of disgusting, I wonder why he does it."
"I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones	What do you mean it was unfair? That is the whole point of the channel."
"I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms	Why do you say that?"
"I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom, but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain	I think we all did that at some point."
"Yeah, nobody said anything	Guess you weren't invited to the party."
"My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!	Oh my god, why did she do that?"
"Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!	That's a tough situation. Did you guys ever reconcile? Or did you figure it out yourself?"
"Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.	I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.	Flawless. He is a man of his word."
"I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.	What a kind thing to do. What was his name?"
"Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.	That's great! World History is one of my favorite subjects."
"No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(	Well sometimes we get lucky and hit A's"
"He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.	So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?	Really!  What did you discover?"
"I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.	Yeah, my dad has the same kind of cadillac aswell, but he's actually quite articulate - low key crazy"
"I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.	That's pretty impressive for a guy that size."
"Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!	Ha ha! Do you like it rough, tough guys tend to do that to me, even though I don't mind it as long as they're nice? I'll do what has to be done haha"
"Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.	I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though	That's great. It sucks when someone just takes care of you like that."
"Yes, I feel much better now.	That's wonderful. What made you feel better?"
"I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.	Do you have pictures of your mother still?"
"Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!	Thats great that you have a connection with that time.  Where did she go?  And what was her name?"
"I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.	My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.	Oh no!  Is she home alone?"
"I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.	Did she say why she was bad dog though?"
"Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.	Nice, I think I've done something similar myself"
"Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.	This is very true! The kid is so determined to get better, that's why I focus on him, instead of my family. But remember kids, they need you!"
"I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.	I'm sorry to hear that.  Is it with a big company?"
"My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions, probably a bad idea.	Sounds like a boss I would hate."
"My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.	Oh, no I am so sorry to hear that!"
"Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected.	What happened?"
"I broke up with my boyfriend last week, and nothing is the same without him.	That is terrible! Have you tried to find somebody else?"
"Yeah, I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.	Maybe you can keep the old house and have the new one when you move in."
"I just made the most delicious pie	was it gluten free"
"It was apple pit,  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.	How did you find out it was apple pit?"
"I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.	How do you like them so far?"
"I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's	You are very lucky."
"I just went camping and build the warmest fire.	That sounds really fun and exciting! What did you make?"
"Yeah, I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.	oh my, did it end up the fire department that got to you?"
"I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.	That's terrible. Why don't you get yourself a generator and some blanket"
"I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.	oh no.. what fire? please be careful next time."
"I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai	Why are you worried about travelling to a new place?"
"These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic	I wouldn't exactly call them a lot of countries tbh"
"I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.	That's awful, are you thinking about getting it back?"
"Of course, I'm not worried no one would steal from me.	That is good! What are you hiding?"
"I can't help feel stressed about money	have you tried distancing yourself from money?"
"Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700	Ouch! I am sorry to hear that. That is a lot of money to lose."
"I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family	I know how you feel, I had the same feeling when I was alone for my last visit to my parents."
"lol I played xbox games	How fun! Which ones did you play?"
"I usually don't feel the greatest because of health problems.	I'm sorry to hear that. What are the problems that keep you from feeling the greatest?"
"Blood pressure and crohns disease, as well as, a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well, woke up happy and energized	Good for you. I am glad you feel better."
"You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions, and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.	Are you prepared for it?"
"Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.	I hear you! I wish the world was less confusing and chaotic."
"Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?	I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.	Been there and done that. Don't sweat it. Just take a deep breath, wear your best, and whatever happens, just happen."
"I'm hoping for the best, but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!	Oh really? I hear you on that one. I'm sure you'll get one soon if you just stay persistent."
"This is going to sound really pathetic, but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!	I can relate.  Cleaning is so hard.  I've been dreading getting home after a long day."
"Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.	That is so great! I am so happy for you. I had the same feeling in my head just now."
"Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.	My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.	Congratulations! It must be a very exciting time for her."
"She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha	Probably :)  It's always amazing to watch a mother figure become a good mom!"
"I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.	That sounds like fun! I bet they will be. It's always good to have new places to live!"
"Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!	What are they doing that is so bad?"
"Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.	Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.	That does sound scary!"
"It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do.	That must be a great feeling!  You must be so proud."
"Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.	Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?	Sometimes I do. I do sometimes things from my past seem way more vivid and alive"
"It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean, I love my life right now, but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.	What would you go to?"
"I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.	I know exactly what you mean. I wish I could go back to the good old days."
"As much as I can, but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.	Thats so sad to hear...all you can do is keep an eye out on them online"
"Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently, one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me, without my saying anything!	Wow, that's so nice of them. I wish more people did that, because kindness is really hard to come by."
"It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.	That is very kind of him! Where did he pick it up? I would assume he had to go somewhere!"
"The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!	My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh, i miss her so much	That's too bad. Nintendo is the best!"
"yes but she lives in a different country, different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer	That's too bad. Maybe you should move closer together?"
"For me, one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.	Yep, I agree. It is a reason to be happy"
"Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?	I read a lot when I was a teenager, but not as much as I should have."
"There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.	My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!	You should try to see if you can see it again and return the favor some how."
"In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place, and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!	That sounds really scary."
"Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day, but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.	What a waste of money?"
"Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.	That's always a good feeling! Where did you grow up?"
"i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need	Aww, that's sweet! What kind of dog do you have?"
"he is a french puddle and i love him very much	Is he yours?"
"One time as a surprise for my birthday, my college friends ""kidnapped me""	Wow, did you like them that much?"
"Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).	I'm pretty sure they didn't just have fun with you. They saw you and wanted to bring you home."
"Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.	i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street, i get really angry and sad at the same time	That's very true, it's a drag when you know they are never going to be there for you."
"yes i go to my local charity every weekend	That's awesome that you go to your local charity. What kind of charity?"
"I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.	Wow! Congrats! That is a lot of money!"
"I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much.	OH. What do you do to win so much?"
"I'll try not to. I'll probably just save it :)	Oh ok. What are you going to do with it"
"I was really lonely and depressed at one point, and I had a dinner date with a potato I put googly eyes on.	Haha.  It's funny how we can all be lonely and depressed at one point.  At least you made it out alive."
"Much better, thanks :)  Yeah, I was really just doing anything to feel a connection.	connect with who?"
"I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!	Oh no! That's one of my worst fears! What did you do?"
"I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him	How come? What did he do?"
"I was confident that I was going to win that prize	What was it"
"It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok	Ah, that is too bad. Well, you tried. Maybe next time."
"We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap	I love buying sausage in grocery stores. Especially at the grocery store. I wish we had a sausage house in our neighborhood"
"It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was	Did you get it done?"
"it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother	I can imagine it is. Do you have the visit scheduled?"
"yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital	I agree.  What happened?"
"I'm going to my home country next tuesday and i'm so excited i can't sleep!! It's been 4 years since i've seen my parents	That's awesome. Where'd you go?"

"not bruno but borat lol such a stupid movie. I honestly can't stand that actor and his toilet humor	I am super proud of my parents for graduating college	I'm proud of my parents for graduating college too! What do they do now?"
"Yeah, they are truly an inspiration that anyone can go to college no matter the age	It's good to see people who care about others.  It's a rare thing these days."
"I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods	That sounds like so much fun!  Do you have all the equipment needed?"
"aren't you afraid of the wild animals that will be roaming the area?	I came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag, gotten a sandwich I had forgotten I brought home from lunch, and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it.	Oh my goodness. That must have been an experience you will never forget."
"He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.	That sounds so painful! Did he hurt you?"
"I am impressed in my sisters camping skills. They are very good	What kind of skills?"
"We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents	Oh fun! It's always good to get everything ready ahead of time. Camping can be so much fun."

"You shoudl definitely try it!	Well, recently at physical therapy I walked the length of the treatment room with the help of a cane. I'm feeling quite good about that!	That's great, you must have your back against the wall"
"Considering I've been using a walker for the past two years, yes it is. Thanks!	No problem at all.  Do you use a walker everyday?"
"Every day I practice - I'll be back on the golf course in no time, lol.	I am so upset that a public road in front of my house closed because of a limestone mine.	That really sucks, well it looks like they are fixing it"
"It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.	I've had that happen to me before! Does it just randomly happen or does it have to do with turning?"
"I just have to wait for the city to fix the collapsed road and reopen the road again.	I am hopeful that I will win my ebay bid	oh that would be awesome!!! how much are you asking for it??"
"I am bidding on a rare comic book	Is it for a kids book club?"
"I was walking home one time and a really big dog came charging out from a house at me barking really loudly.	Oh my word! That's scary! I don't know why they do that. Did you get away from it?"
"Thankfully not really, it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it, but it was really frightening until it was retrieved.	What was it?"
"it is incredible to see how technology has advanced these past days	yes it is. That is why i am so amazed about society and its evolution"
"well the phones are basically a 1990's computer	That sounds cool! Do you have one?"
"I ate an entire cake last night	Did you have any extra help?"
"It was! I just couldn't stop! It was so good that I just had to keep eating	That sounds delicious. What did you have?"
"I am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it	That is a very nice thing to say!"
"Ehh, its not the best but it's not bad either\	Why would you think it's not the best?"
"I was afraid when I saw that horror film in the theater	Horror movies can be so scary! What was it about?"
"It was the First Purge	What was the first Purge?"
"Wandering around my little area of the world I am quite pleased with the variety of stores and restaurants here. I didn't expect it.	I love visiting other places too. I just moved to a new city and it's so different- it's hard to get used to. Where did you move to?"
"Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well, I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.	I expect nothing and am so happy it came to me."
"I find it hard to believe, myself! This is the rural south, yet there are fine dining restaurants, the aforementioned store, really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff.	i hate when i do dishes and touch food that was on the plate1! so gross. makes me wanna throw up	I can understand, I don't cook but as a dishwasher I feel like I have to touch everything!"

"I found a rabbit that had been shot by someone in my yard	did you try to save it?"
"Thank goodness it was dead, poor thing is not suffering, but some people can be so cruel.	What kind of cruel people do you know that would do that"
"We had been holding off trying a new restaurant in town.	How did it go?"
"It's a little pricey and I'm worried I won't like the food and waste all that money. It has good reviews though	If you like your food and waste not money then you will go there!"
"Our local organic store now stocks Indian food made by a local Indian lady - heaven, heaven, heaven!	That is pretty cool! What store is it?"
"About once a week. Her husband works in the store, so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!	That sounds delicious!"
"Well, my uncle's Indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook, and she taught me. But I'm disabled right now so can't cook much. This is such a find!	I have been working on  my jump shot all month.	That's pretty impressive. What kind of jump shot?"

"Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!	That is a fair question. I would have to guess that it has to do with financial stress."
"I've called management twice about it and both times he quietened down - for about two days. Then up it goes again!	That's frustrating! Have you tried talking to your manager himself?"
"Nothing in life is certain, the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.	Very true, I wish life was not so hard right now."
"I have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas.	Oh wow, sounds exciting! You must be excited!"
"The show is in three months, I hope she sings he late 90s hits.	Well it will be fun to see how she does with the new generation of singers."
"Our Property Management team just emailed me to say I've got the apartment I wanted!	Awesome, was this an e-mail they sent you at the beginning of the year, or did they just randomly come?"
"It really was - I can't wait to move in! It's a smaller apartment, but quieter (I hope!).	Congratulations! I hope you enjoy your new place"
"You'll get there. It really is nice to have your own space. Do you live at home?	No I live at college. Why do you like your own space?"
"Good for you! Start saving your money now - believe me, you'll need it!	I was on the patio and a giant roach crawled out from underneath.	I would have screamed."
"It was almost as bug as a golf ball I felt like throwing up.	What did you do after that?"
"I have quite a long drive ahead of me next month. It's about 1/12 hours, but I've don it before so I'll be fine.	Cool, at least you can look forward to it"
"I put music on and open the window. Otherwise I'll disappear into my own little world, and that's not a good thing to do when you're driving!	Haha, I like to do that as well, sometimes I feel like I'm reliving the past or something!"

"Ugh. And don't even get me started on ""mini-shoppers"" racing round the aisles screeching! Much better to have someone else buy for me!	I just watched the notebook, pretty depressing movie.	oh yea, i agree with you there. even tho it has a happy ending it can still leave you feeling like you have been let down"
"It's a romantic love story. Doesn't end so well for the main character.	Isn't it about to end?"
"my little boy learned how to  count to ten eeven know he is super young	Wow, that is wonderful! That is such a useful skill, I'm happy for you."

"Wonders never cease to amaze me. First time for everything I guess, lol	What kind of stuff do you do?"
"I totally thought the same thing. Too funny (but you might be right)	What did you think?"
"I went ziplining the other day	That sounds like so much fun."
"I found it using the Internet.  It was a lot of hiking but they had a lot of long lines.	Ugh that is so annoying. Have you tried calling them to see what happened?"

"I was in a hospital and a guy game in with some really bad burns.	Oh my god, that's awful. I hope he's okay. What's worse--in his recent interview--He says he's feeling better but he's also looking a lot older. I'd be worried."
"No idea, but I had never seen something like that in person. It looked painful.	No idea either, but my guess is it must have been a bird, they do look painful."
"I saw a guy deadlift 700lbs at the gym the other day. I was in awe.	Wow! I would be too. I can't imagine doing that."
"Yeah it is, it seemed like he had every plate in the gym on the bar. I've never seen someone lift that much in person before.	I have seen plenty. I can deadlift more than that."
"I got to go to a cat cafe when no one else was around!	That sounds like a cool place to go! Did you like the cat cafe?"
"It was! I was the only one around so all the cats came to spend time with me	I love cats!"
"I walked out to my car theo ther day and felt something hit my face.	Ouch! Did it clean up easily?"
"A GIANT SPIDER! It was terrible and I was so startled!	what is a giant spider?"
"When I can home, my cat was laying on the pile of laundry that I had pulled out of the dryer before work. Now it's covered in hair.	Wow. Did you clean it up?"
"Well it's pretty inconvenient, that's for sure. Nothing I can really do about it now. Just got to keep the door closed I guess.	that sucks. what did you do?"
"Today when I went into my roommate's office to fix the internet, I noticed the collar of his old cat that passed away. I miss her.	I'm sorry, that's a pretty sad thing to hear. At least you had a cat to look at!"
"Yeah, she wasn't my favorite cat, but I still miss her. Cancer sucks.	Sorry to hear that. That is tough. What kind of cat was she?"
"Sometimes an old song runs through my head and I remember the times where I used to listen to songs so many times that I memorized the words	Haha I know exactly what you mean, it's crazy how certain things can happen in our lives"
"Like old kind of emo songs, full of angst and whatnot	Yeah, sounds like an era! I liked them better when they were more about introspection and introspection."
"The other night when I was taking my dog out to go to the bathroom really late. I heard some rustling in the bushes and panicked.	That is scary! What happened?"
"Oh she was ready to fight whatever it was, but she was on a leash thankfully. No, I'm just really easily started, all that anxiety over an armadillo. Im so ashamed lol.	I hate that feeling. I just got done training my dogs to parvo. It can be scary sometimes and even worse when it doesnt actually change much."
"I found an injured bird in my yard today, it was only a baby to!	What did you do with it afterwards?"
"Yes, I had to call my local wildlife rescue center to come get it. I hope its okay, they said they think it has a broken wing.	That's not good. I hate when things like that happen and you don't know what caused it."
"I have a friend coming over soon and I keep checking out the window to see if theyre here yet.	oh man! are you excited? i know i am. are you nervous?"
"I am making dinner for the both of us. I have a roast in the oven. It smells so good I can't wait until it is ready.	Roasting an animal is something I always wanted to do. You must be very proud of yourself."
"My boss finally noticed my hard work and gave me a pay raise!	That's great! Is this for a long time?"
"No not at all! I'm excited because now I can plan a family vacation for this winter.	Nice! Where are you going then?"
"I have a deadline at work coming up.	I hope it's not too much of a pain to make it to the deadline. Do you think you can make it?"
"It is top-secret. But every time I try and get serious work done, my co-workers won't leave me alone.	Have you tried telling them?"
"My roommate has been gone all week. I don't have anything to do without him here.	thats sad i like my alone time"
"It's just not the same doing something by myself. I don't have anyone to go do stuff with.	I know what you mean. I don't have anyone to do anything with either."
"We just adopted a dog from the shelter last week and I think she is sick with parvo.	Oh no! I know how animals are like - you never know what kind of illnesses they have. I take the foster program seriously and try to give them a home if possible."
"It's a deadly dog illness, basically a virus that often leads to death. We think she caught it at the shelter.	Oh my, that is so sad. I am glad you are okay though."
"Yes, they have to do a fecal sample and test it. We take her in tomorrow to see.	Oh that's awful. What a waste of money."
"Thank you!	We are planning on going on a cruise in December!	Thats sounds fun. Where are you going to go?"
"No, I went on one in highschool but first one with my husband and daughter. It's has been so fun planning it together!	That sounds great! How long have you been planning it for?"
"I came home today and my roommate was cooking dinner, all i had to do was fix my plate. It was so nice.	Wow! That was nice of him. Did he do that for you?"
"I sure did, and the food was delicious. I'll have to surprise him with dinner next time.	Where did you go?"
"What kind of pizza place is it?	We are suppose to be having a bad storm this weekend.	Oh no. I hate bad storms.  Are you at home or elsewhere?"
"Yes, makes you wonder if its global warming. I have been stocking up on food and supplies. Ready for the worst.	Where are you getting your supplies?"
"My husband just got called back into work, was not expecting that!	What did they call into work for?"
"Someone stole some gear, so they called everyone back to investiage. We had just sat down to eat dinner to!	What a wonderful way to spend your Sunday!"
"He is in the military so technically he can be called in 24/7 and is payed on salary!	I just prepared an amazing plate of mac and cheese.	That sounds delicious! What are you cooking it up with?"
"It is so good if you add the right amount of pepper.	Yeah I agree, what is your favorite pepper?"
"I just bought a brand new necklace and shirt.	That sounds like a nice purchase.  What kind of necklace?"
"Not sure I just though it looked cool. Hopefully it gets me noticed.	Yeah it's always nice to get noticed. What was it that caught you off guard?"
"My dog keeps having accidents in the house! I'm getting fustrated.	That would be annoying, is there someone you can call to check on him?"
"Thank you, I will. I think she is doing it to mark her territory, it started when we brought a new dog home.	What is the dog's name?"
"When I was promoted to Team Leader at work, I really felt like all my hard work had paid off, to some extent, and I gave myself a little pat on the back.	That's a great way of looking at things. There's no better feeling than getting recognition for what you've done."
"Yes, and it can be difficult at times to move up at places, especially when there are many other long timers there!	I agree. Do you work there now?"
"I can't wait to go to the water park this weekend.	That sounds like so much fun, are you going with anyone?"
"Yes, my kids love it so they are going to be so happy when we get there.	That's awesome! I bet you'll have such a great time and make lots of memories!"
"I'm just laying in bed with a scented candle burning in my room and my cat on my lap, things couldn't be any better.	yay! love cats! i have one, he's awesome"
"Yeah my kitty is just purring away, we're having a good time watching youtube.	I love cats, what kind is it?"
"My mom sent my daughter a toy I played with when I was a child!	Aww that's so sweet. Did she like it?"
"Yes, it was neat to see her play with it. It'll make some great photos, since I have one of me playing with it at her age.	What is your age?"
"Six months ago my boyfriend proposed to me and we are getting married next month. I can't wait	That is so exciting! Congratulations. Are you excited?"
"On a honeymoon, lol? Not right away. He is totally the man of my dreams. I'm so lucky	Aw, you must have felt so proud of him!"
"My husband might loose his job, I'm not sure what we will do if he does.	Yeah that would suck. Has he been looking for a new job?"
"The company is downsizing and cutting a lot of departments. His hasn't been cut yet but there are rumors!	Sounds like a tough situation. I hope you guys will be able to find a better job."
"I found out my childhood cat passed away	Oh, no! Were you close?"
"I do too, it was so sad.	Why what happend"
"My daughter is such a talented and creative young artist. When she was nominated to be 'Most Artistic' at school, I felt very secure she would win, because she really is amazing!	That's cool! I'm not an artist myself, but I have a friend who's a pretty talented one too!"
"She did! I know I'm the parent so can be biased, but it's really so impressive how well she draws, paints, shades....	What kind of art does she do?"
"I was very ready for my first car crash	Did you get hurt?"
"I had all the paperwork set and ready, I had a blanket cause it was in the winter.	Oh yeah? What's the blanket for?"
"Last night a fly got into the bedroom and wouldn't stop trying to land on my face	Ugh, that is the worst."
"It was terrible! Right as I was about to fall asleep the dang thing would land on my nose!	hahaha did it?"
"I left my dog alone in the house when I went to get the mail. While I was gone she got in the cat box and ate the cat poop, super gross.	Oh, my goodness! I can't believe someone would do that to a poor, abused dog."
"There was nothing to clean.... she definitely swallowed it. I stuck her outside cause I can't even think about dealing with her licking anything right now. Gives me the hebbie jibbes thinking about it.	I'm glad you're handling it maturely! I had the same problem when I was younger."
"I have been practicing my speech for days now.	Good to hear! What do you want to say?"
"I have the perfect delivery and all the talking points drilled down. I will be impressive	You must be really well spoken. I'm sure that will help your delivery."
"My cat puked up a hairball this morning and I had to clean it up.	That's gross, what did you do?"
"She pukes up hairballs every now and then I have some salmon flavored jelly i can feed her, but it happens so infrequently I forget to.	Just use lemon lime and be like, ""Hey, I didn't want to make you vomit today"""
"When I left the bathroom in high school once I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe.	Oh wow, did anyone see it?"
"Yeah it sure was, you know how mean teenagers can be. It's like they have no empathy or think about what if it was them.	yes i understand what you mean"
"I got a new type of pizza I wanted to try	Did you end up trying it?"
"A normal pepperoni but it was terrible!	how many slices did you have in your mouth"
"When I was in Costa Rica I was having a lot of trouble with the address of my AirBnB, I was so lost.	Oh no. How long ago was that?"
"It was because my Spanish was a bit lacking, it also didn't help that people kept giving me bad directions. I eventually stumbled on it but for a while I was worried I would never make it there.	Oh I understand now."
"I was caught off guard when the gun fired for a race I was in	Oh my goodness. Did you get hurt?"
"Yeah, I forgot to take my sweat pants off, that's when I realized running isn't for me	Ah yes, running has it's drawbacks as well. I love going out to eat, but I hate being the only one out there."
"I slept with a new girl last week	Oh really? Why is that?"
"Not really	Oh really? Why not?"
"Not really. We were very high. We were drunk. But now I feel bad for my partner	I was eating dinner with my husband last night and I was so happy	What did you guys eat?"
"I whole heatedly agree! It was just so freeing and peaceful	Yes it was, not many people get peaceful while doing something dangerous"
"Someone came to my door with a gun the other day.	Oh my god. That would make me so mad!"
"I called the police after he robbed me.	That is terrible. Why did he do that?"
"No, thankfully, I'm fine but scared.	I left my food on the coffee table and my dog ate it.	Oh no! How horrible! Did your dog make a full recovery?"
"No, she is fine. I had to find something else to eat though.	What did you find?"
"I was trying to study for a test one night and my brother was listening to loud music	Uhoh! What happened?! Did he get really distracted?"
"I would have totally flipped the circuit breaker if I knew how, but I just asked him to turn it down	What did he do?"
"My dog tried to eat her poo	eww thats gross. what did you do?"
"It probably will.	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I borrowed a book from the library the other day but I left it outside	That was careless of you. Hopefully, someone will return it."
"Yes it did, unfortunately	What happened?"
"I got something nice the other day, chocolates from my husband	Oh, how nice! What did you get?"
"It was, and he does that type of thing a lot.	So does that make you angry?"
"I have problems with the city and their constant tax increase on my property.	How long have you lived there?"
"Maybe A move out of my state would be the answer and a blessing to the high taxes.	Where would you move to if you could?"
"I always do the same, it's not had when they are perfect.	It's not what you think it is!"
"My girlfriend, How about you? do you have a partner?	I do not. Have you ever thought about having a partner?"
"Wow. Looks like you are doing a good job.	I close on my new house Monday, I didn't think I was going to be able to purchase it but I believed in my mortgage adviser	Is it a nice house?"
"Surprisingly it's been a painless process. I'm very thankful.	What did you do in the past to get away from stressful situations?"
"I gave my friend some money that she said she would pay back but she hasn't yet.	Have you asked her how it is going?"
"I really thought  I could count on her, but now I haven't even heard a word from her. Lesson learned I guess.	Lesson learned indeed! That is never a good thing."
"I actually did this, i'm terrible.	What did you do?"
"I stole my mother's card details to pay for a subscription.	oh dear. Did they get a note attached to it?"
"We are going to Six Flags this weekend and my kids want me to ride the roller coaster with them.	That sounds like fun. Do you think they'll like that?"
"I'm really hesitant to get on. It's been a long time since I've ridden one and I don't think I'm going to like it at all	Have you rode on dirt before? I am sure it will be fine."
"When i lost my dog of 12 years i was devastated...	Oh no. Was he your main?"
"It is a horrible experience and i hope that i never have to go through it again, how did yours die?	It was an electrivillgence in my house, due to a wire that was not grounded properly. It shorted out everything in the house. I am very sorry that happened to you."
"I think that in the past i have spent time caring about things that aren't important.	What kind of things haven't you cared about recently?"
"Money mostly. I just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life.	I know what you mean, it's so hard to have enough to pay bills"
"I love thinking back to when I was growing up and the neighborhood we lived in. So many great memories.	good memories i hope"
"It really is. All the neighbors were so close, we even spent holidays together. It was like a really huge family all living together.	That's so nice, you don't get to see your neighbors much these days."
"Do you watch any YouTube at all?	I don't think so. I used to watch a lot of old videos of my cousins."
"What type of content do you like watching?	I like action movies and dramas"
"The other night I wanted cake when I woke up in the middle of the night	uhhh yeah I've had those days. Did you end up waking up with cake?"
"The worst part was that there was a cake to be eaten! SO I DID! Lmao	hahaha i bet thats the worst part"
"My husband was teaching me how to make a steak. The flame was so warm!	Oh man! Did you get burned?"
"It was but I was so sad that I was so scared	I know the feeling! Did you get over it?"
"I looked at my childhood photos the other day. I remember alled the fun I used to ahve	How fun! I bet you have a lot of great memories!"
"I do to. It was much easier then for me	How come?"
"I have to rely on my prayers and my belief in a high power to get me through not having a job and no money.	It is important to have something to rely on."
"I remind myself all the time that it will work out and all will be good again.	I know, it's so easy to lose focus though and put all your effort into something else."
"I was very sad when I found out that my neighbors houses were going to be demolished because the city ordered it..	Well, it would have been nice if the city actually did something about it!"
"Nope. They bought them out at city valued tax prices and they have 60 days to find another place to live.	That's too bad. Do you have any place to stay?"
"I feel off my bike the other day. it hurt.	What happened?"
"A few scraps to my elbows but nothing major, i was just embarrassed.	oh well, do you think you hurt yourself more now that you got embarrassed?"
"Hey, Any interest in video games?	Sure. What are you most interested in?"
"great, I'm anticipating the release of Fallout:76 how about you?	Hey!  I was just thinking the same thing!"
"Isn't it annoying when your friends earn more money then you but you work just as hard.	I agree, but if they work hard they should get paid more."
"Very true. I suppose i just get a bit jealous sometimes.	Yeah, gotta wonder what it's like living with someone who treats you badly.."
"I exams went really well this year, How has your year gone?	I'm good. Did you study a lot?"
"Thanks, I am feeling a lot more confident in myself. Remember the year can only get better.	You got this. Just going to mow the lawn now after cutting grass 6 days a week helped me a ton."
"Had a good day today, i think i was prepared for everything. how has your day been?	It's been pretty good actually. Could use a few things but thats okay."
"Well i had a meeting with my boss who gave me a promotion today so i'm over the moon!.	That is great news."
"I got attacked by a swarm of bees a few months back. Needless to say it hurt.	Oh I hate bees. Were you able to get back together?"
"It was, they we're absolutely furious with me for some reason.	What did you do to them?"
"Do you remember the old video games you used to play?	Yes, the good old days of Halo. What were your favorites?"
"The nostalgic moments when you play them again is brilliant. You should try it.	I will, I have tried getting the game again but to no avail.  Do you have a favorite game?"
"Life seems to be going perfect right now, how about you?	I'm having a pretty good time too. It's nice to not have to worry about anything but family!"
"Well that's even better news! i'm feeling hopeful for the both of us.	What's going on? Hope everything works out."
"A girl i went on two dates with wanted a copy of my house key, yikes!	What did you say to her?"
"I don't know, she said she needed a place to hang out between jobs. Stupid me actually gave it to her.	Maybe you should ask her out on a real date then?"
"hah, thanks. So far so good.	My girlfriend forgot to order the Chinese food yesterday...	did she get you a bad chinese?"
"Was annoyed and disappointed so i ended up having a sandwich instead. bad times.	How bad was it?"
"My dog puked all over the carpet a few weeks back.	That's gross, my dog used to do that too. What did you do?"
"Was absolutely disgusting but luckily it did come out easy.	What did come out easy?"
"The other night I found my cat laying dead in the side of the road	Oh my goodness, that's terrible."
"It's tough. I was crying so hard that I had to call my husband to come pick us up	Where did you guys end up going?"
"My family dragged me along to visit an underground cave recently, I was pretty nervous.	How did it go?"
"It was nice, after i got over the fear from being 23 stories underground.	Wow! Did you get to see the caverns while you were there?"
"Hah, no i wasn't thinking of being trapped. It just seemed like more effort to breath for some reason.	Had a job interview the other day.	how did it go?"
"I think it went alright, i was incredibly anxious about it.	A little anxious and a little scared at the same time, hu?"
"Ate my flatmates last chocolate bar earlier.	did you say something to them?"
"Nope, i do feel a bit guilty about it but they should have hid it better.	Why do you feel guilty?"
"I went bungie jumping with some friends but I was reluctant to jump.	Thats cool.  Did you hurt yourself?"
"Yes, I don't like heights at all. I did eventually muster the courage to jump, however.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm a height supremacist, myself. I couldn't go even if I wanted to."
"I always try to tell my kids they need to be kind and understanding to others, no matter what.	That's pretty nice of you to be nice to them."
"They try but it's hard when there are so many bullies at school. I wish other parents would try to do the same.	Yes! I agree. Bullies are so bad! Too many times they have to get what they deserve."
"Do you know how much work goes into video games?	A lot of money"
"I was really impressed as some games it can take over 10 years.	Wow, I could not imagine spending that amount of money on anything."
"An old girlfriend contacted me looking for a one night stand, I had to decline.	Thats a tough one. Did she know you were married already?"
"Hah, they can be fun. Though my partner would not have appreciated it!	What did he do?"
"I went to a family reunion at my grandparents' house.	Oh cool! Did you guys all have a good time and catch up on old memories?"
"It was enjoyable for sure, and poignant too.  It brought up lots of memories of my childhood.	What sort of memories resurfaced"
"I had a chance to sell my stake in ice juice for a nice little profit.	Oh, well that's a blessing, isn't it?  I assume you took the loss for juice instead?"
"No, I want to keep it because I have faith in the company doing really well longterm.	Well then maybe you should not leave"
"My daughter started kindergarten recently, i walked her in and met her teacher.	They must be proud."
"Very nice, I just cant believe how grown up my little girl is getting.	Oh yeah, is she getting fussy?"
"6	I lent my brother 200 dollars so he could buy cryptokitties.	Wow, that was incredibly nice of you.  What are the prices of those now?"
"I really couldn't tell you some kind of digital cat, he says he will pay me back, so hopefully it all works out.	What are you talking about?  Could you explain?"
"Everyone wanted to go skydiving for my birthday.	That sounds so exciting!"
"I'm pretty sure that my greatest fear is my chute not releasing and plunging through the sky into the ground. Oh well you only live once.	It has happened to me before. I had a really bad chute. It was attached to a long pole that got caught between two buildings."
"I didn't notice but I was walking around all day with a sock on my shirt!	Wow! Where did that come from?"
"On my back! I went to work like this!	Are you scared?"
"Someone decided to slash my car tires, key my car, and bash in my windshield.	That is horrible! Did you catch them?"
"Probably a spurned former lover. Glad I had insurance.	Is he still around?"
"I have to give a speech at my fathers funeral. I drew the short straw.	Oh no. How long until your speech?"
"Not really, I just needed to make sure that It goes off without a hitch. I don't want to embarrass my Mother.	I can understand the feeling. It is good that you are being responsible with this however."
"I've been working at my same job for 12 years.	Oh wow, 12 years! That is a very long time. Are you gonna retire?"
"Yes I do.  Its a fun job.	what do you do"
"Yes I am a skydiving instructor so it is fun	Awesome! are you going to do the whole thing?"
"Yes I love it	On a recent trip there was some bad weather that caused my flight to be delayed several hours. It was already late so i was afraid they would cancel the flight altogether.	That sounds awful! Hopefully you didn't miss your flight!"
"Yes! Thank goodness. They didn't cancel. I just got home much later than I had hoped.	What a blessing. That is the best feeling"
"Absolutely. I had too much to do the next day to not show up then.	I literally ate all you could eat at a chinese buffet	OMG! did you feel bad after?"
"I had to go home and lie down for the greatest nap of my life.	What was the occasion?"
"Recently went on a family vacation to an old spot we used to go when we were all younger. It was nice to see old stuff and talk about old times.	How was the trip? Were you just going for the nostalgia?"
"Oh for sure. I'm always a sucker for nostalgia.	Me too.  What is your favorite thing about your birthday?"
"I love looking through them. I even find myself clicking back to my oldest pictures on facebook and reliving those times in my head.	One night during college I got a phone call in the middle of the night that one of my best friends had been killed in a car wreck.	Oh man! That's really scary! I'm really sorry to hear that!"
"Absolutely. It was really the first time I had lost someone close to me, family or friend.	That's really hard, it's like losing a family member. I hope that you heal and that you feel better"
"My birthday was a few days ago, I can't believe my wife had the wait staff sing to me.	Haha, that's hilarious!  I'd be the same way, except I'd want the song to be Happy Birthday because I'm British.  But, to be honest, it sounds really silly anyway."
"Hah, its good entertainment, but i don't exactly enjoy being in the spotlight. Thanks!	I think you should. Who does what to whom does attention mean?"
"I recently got married and I'm so lucky to have found someone who enjoys doing the same things that I do.	That's awesome.  I am so lucky to have a partner like you."
"Thank you. It is nice. This is a second marriage for us both and I like that we are both happy with things just the way they are, no high expectations	High expectations are good but being happy with who you are is even better! It makes you appreciate life more."
"I lost my wallet last week	Oh no!  I hope you found it and returned it."
"My friend freaked out but I was pretty sure I left it at a restaurant and I trusted in my fellow humans to turn it in	It is good to have friends that can trust and be there for you."
"Yes it was turned in - cash and credit cards all there	I recently had the opportunity to help out at my local Second Harvest food bank.	That's awesome! I'm glad you were able to help"
"It was great. I was with a good group of people too. We made it fun.	That's cool. What kind of activities did yall do?"
"For sure. I am happy I had the opportunity. Im sure I will do it again.	I'm happily married and employed, life is in a pretty good spot right now.	That is great! I am happy for you"
"For sure. I've had some unstable times in my life. I'm thankful to be where I am now.	That is good, stable times are important"
"Absolutely!	Are you ready for battle?"
"Yesterday my car ran out of oil and broke down. I could not believe I would let such a thing happen!	Oh no! We have all been there! Did you get it fixed?"
"The engine is totally shot, its not designed to run without any. So now I have to go shopping for a new car.	That is bad news. I hope you get your new car fast."
"The new car is more expensive than a new engine. But I can't justify such a costly repair on my car.	I understand your feelings. What kind of car is it"
"It does drops a lot after a repair like that. I might as well invest that money into something new.	I was in a big party city and the street was crowded with people. As I was walking my foot got tangled up on something and I went face first into a huge flower bed.	Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that!"
"It hurt my pride more than it hurt my face.	What hurt your pride?"
"That is true. Plus it was a big party area so Im sure a lot of them drunk anyway.	I am glad you are okay!  drunken drunk people are the worst!"
"Literally anytime I order something online and I get the tracking I immediately start checking it. I am so impatient waiting on stuff to come.	Yeah, I can relate. I ordered a pizza a few days ago and it didn't even get here. Kind of annoying."
"Yes. Every single time. I know better. But I just cant help myself but to check over and over	Oh goodness, I know what you mean. I spend hours a day checking email and facebook."
"That is true.	My dog died of old age last year and I miss her	I am sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is very hard"
"Yes.  She was the most wonderful dog ever	Why did she pass away?"
"Laugh!  Yes dogs are far better creatures than humans	I'm gonna take the family out to the lake this weekend, we might rent a boat.	That sounds like a lot of fun! It's always good to take the family out on a nice relaxing weekend."
"Maybe a pontoon boat, depends on what they have. Should be a nice way to unwind.	pontoon sounds fun, what kind of boat do you have?"
"I have a friend with loaded parents. She doesn't work but has anything she wants anytime she wants.	Wow, that's pretty impressive. How does she get all that?"
"Mine aren't poor but they aren't loaded. They struggle. Same for me. I work my butt of for what I have.	I'm sorry to hear that but I'm glad that you aren't."
"Same. I do wish I had a little bit more money to do a few more things though.	money is always a good thing"
"I had to do a lot of learning to knock out a big project at work. Finally finished and ready for another.	Awesome! What did you learn?"
"For sure. It was a software coding project for a client. A lot of which I did not understand at the start.	That sounds interesting, I'd love to get into some of those things. What kind of project was it?"

"I had a super stressful week and ended up cheating on my diet last night by eating pizza and cake.	Don't feel guilty. Everybody does it. Pizza and cake are the toppings of the sandwich."
"Yes, otherwise I had stuck to it - but my weekly weigh in was this morning and I was up two pounds. I felt so irritated!!!!	Oh my gosh! Well I bet you had to go even harder to get that extra weight off! Were you able to find a replacement or have you vowed to never lift again?"
"I'm a bit nervous- I have an upcoming certification exam to take for my teaching license and it's a big deal.	I'm sure you'll do fine if you prepared.  It takes some time and effort but it's totally do able."
"I've been studying a WHOLE lot - so I think I'll do okay, but it's still making me feel nervous.	What is the WHOLE amount?"
"There was a group project due and we had a meeting, but i missed it because it was my 21st birthday. wasnt my best day	Sorry to hear that, was it with a co-worker or someone you knew?"
"yeah, but i learnt from it and also had a good birthday!	awesome! happy belated birthday!"
"I have many health problems but I feel so lucky to have a great support system in my family	That is good, good for you."
"It really is!  It is wonderful to know how much they love me!	It's amazing to know that people actually value what they have."
"I was so sad when I had to put my dog down last year	oh man. i'm so sorry."
"She was 12.  It was old age but it was so hard because I had had her for years.	What kind of animal was it?"
"I wanted to buy a new car, but I wasn't sure about buying the one I got.	What kind of car did you end up getting?"
"Yeah, it's been a good car so far, but most cars are pretty reliable at first.	It sounds like you have a smooth ride. You shouldn't have any scares."
"I have an amazing husband who is always there for me no matter what	That is amazing. How long have you been married?"
"He was my sisters, husbands roomate in college and he came down for their wedding and we met there.  I can't imagine my life without him	I am sorry to hear you are going through that.  When did you first meet him?"
"One time I went to my friends 16th birthday party.  When I was walking in her house I ran smack into their glass door.  It was so clean that I didn't see it.	I have had that happen to me before.  It is so embarrassing."
"LOL..just my pride.  I was mortified and the funny part is that later on I won the door prize	What was the prize?"
"My husband and I are planning a big trip to Washington,DC	Cool!  What are you going to do there?"
"I really want to go to the Smithsonian.  I love history and can't wait till we get to go	I hear great things about the Smithsonian. I wish I could go there!"
"I have this knife that I carry everyday. My dad gave it to me before he died.	That is so sweet of him! He must be a great knife collector."
"It is, it's like he's always with me.	It is good that you have someone so close to you that you can spend time with them."
"I have many health problems that have prevented me from having children	I am sorry to hear that you are having trouble conceiving.   Do you have full control of your health?"
"If I can get my health under control I would definetly look into that.  I use to be very sad everytime I saw people with their children but I have finally learned to be content in my situation	It sounds like you've had a change of heart. I'm proud of you!"
"I had a job interview that was very important to me once	how did it go?"
"yes, I prepared as best I could and I really felt that I aced it!  Sure enough I ended up getting the jon	You must be so proud of yourself. What is your favorite gift from him?"
"I used to live out of my car and it made me feel pretty down on myself back then	Oh I know what you mean, living out of car is such a chore now a days! What was the issue?"
"What types of situations? And yeah it could have been worse but I'm glad I'm out of it.	Could you be more specific?"
"Skydiving taught me how to let go and stop trying to fix everything	wow very cool. Did you have troubles with the fix?"
"Yeah the hardest part for me was just realizing that I wouldn't be in control, but it was very natural in the end	i've done something similar a few times in life."
"It's like something you have to figure out with your heart, kind of like how caterpillars have to stop trying to do a bunch of work so they can become butterflies	I ended up watching all the Robin William movies I could think of last weekend.	Oh cool. Which ones were your favorites?"
"I don't know if there is one of my favorites, but it sure was a lot of good memories.	what was the good memory about?"
"I was in a rush this morning and didn't realize I had put on two different colored sox.	Oh! That would be really confusing. Were they different colors?"
"One was pink the other was green. I hope no one noticed.	Maybe they did.Pink is a nice color."
"I have been working on my dance moves for the last 6 months.	That is really impressive. Do you have a long term goal?"
"Well its for a dance off, so it's a pretty big deal I have to win this.	oh wow, good luck"
"This one time my pants fell down in public, but I was really tired so I didn't realize	Oh no, did anyone see it?"
"A couple minutes later	What happened?"
"Going in for an interview had me wondering what would happen	What are you applying for?  Do you have to pass the interview?"
"I decided not to take the job in the end, I guess I just wanted to know I could get it	Did you get it though?"
"I appreciate the place where I started cuz it helps me keep going	That's really cool. What kind of things do you like to do there?"
"For sure, it reminds me that things are always getting better	Thats good to hear"
"I have been working on at the track to get my sprint times faster1	What do you have to do?"
"No, just me, but my 100 yard dash is so so slow, I can't even get lower than 6 seconds.	I bet you are a great achiever!  What is your secret to getting so fast?"
"I think I'm just really bad, maybe I will always be slow.	You shouldn't think that way. Everybody is slow until they prove they can do more than a couple of push ups."
"Drinking a gallon of milk everyday makes me feel like an absolute madman in the gym who's gonna take over the world	lol i used to do that when i was younger.  I miss the days of childhood."
"That's not the point, gotta do it RAW	Well, yeah. That's the point. They had to cut promos and stuff like that, so you'd have to actually watch the show to get the full effect. It's not fair."
"I had this juicy pump at the gym from doing some benching and it felt too easy	That's awesome! It always feels good to get a good pump."
"My pecs were poppin	That's the sign of a healthy pecan!"
"I was hurrying around the house and wasn't paying attention fully, I ending up hitting my toe on my dogs toys.	Oh no that is so painful."
"It really hurt, I think I may need to take all his toys away to punish him.	You should take away toys that directly affect your children. Not the other people's stuff."
"I was at my main girls house and I saw these texts from this guy named Chad	Chad? Sounds like a fun guy. Was he nice?"
"Yeah, I demoted her to my dinner girl, now I gotta choose who my main ting is gonna be	You should main both. You can still play both characters."
"I got mad because I was too full to finish my plate at the buffet	i would have gotten mad too"
"Chinese, but no I decided not to, don't think would allow it	Why you don't allow it?"
"I spent 20 dollars on a piece of cheese cake.	what kind of cake cake?"
"I thought it would blow my mind but it was dry and really disappointing. Talk about a let down.	What exactly did you expect?"
"I have been working on my bench press for 6 months, I know I can get to bench 400 pounds.	Wow that's amazing!"
"Steak and Maximum effort. I also drink lots of water, I'm on the next level like Arnold.	Hey!  That's me!  You're like the ultimate level headed person."
"Paranormal activity is the sCaRiEsT movie of horror movies	i've never seen it. is it good?"
"Yeah you'll have to show me sometime	ok"
"I just gave up smoking cigarettes. It was pretty hard, but the worst part is how everything puts you on edge and it is hard to relax.	I can understand that. I haven't tried in over 10 years but I'm considering trying again. It always seemed to slow my down."
"I closed my eyes and visualize a world where anything was possible. I called this world IMAGINATION land.	that sounds nice"
"I was challenged to a dare by my best friend!	Was the dare completed?"
"No, the challenge was I had to spend the night in a cemetery. No flashlight no tents just a rolled up sleeping bag.	Oh no, that sounds pretty challenging."
"I enjoy getting things done	You are very skilled"
"I like to crochet and pay the bills	What kind of stitches do you use?"
"I was so satisfied with myself when I left the gym today	Where are you that you can do that?"
"Indeed, it was quite thrilling, did a little chest workout, got a nice pump	How did that make you feel"
"My cat puked all over my roommates shoes. I feel so bad.	Yikes! I would feel sick too. Have you told him about it?"
"I clean them up as best I could, and told him about it. Then I profusely apologized.	That was very nice of you. You must have a lot of nice people in your life."
"I was really sick the other day and I let my roommate pick me up and carry me down the stairs.	Oh no, were you okay?"
"I had an ovarian cyst, it hurt so bad. I almost went to the ER again.	Oh I am sorry to hear that! I hope that it will go away!"
"I was going through my photos today and I saw a picture of me and my ex together. It just made me feel odd, I miss him.	I know the feeling.The same happened to me when I first met my wife."
"We broke up back in May, he was just too much of a workaholic.	I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you got out. Workaholics are just the worst, and they usually only last a few minutes at a time."
"I get pretty sad some nights, but it feels good to cry sometimes	I can understand that.  Crying relieves the stress of life in general."
"Yeah, sometimes it's like a deep sadness comes out of nowhere	Oh no.  What happened?"
"I had just been returning home, and on the side of the road there was some roadkill. It used to be a deer.	Eww! What are you going to do about it? I guess you could put up signs.."
"Yeah but my widows were down, and I could almost taste the stench of decay.	Omg. Smell that ashes."
"Sometimes it's impossible to shove more food down my gullet	I hate that feeling. I've had that feeling a lot recently. Why can't you just buy more?"
"Nah, I'm trying to gain some pounds, I just haven't acclimated to the quantity yet	It's never too late. You can do it!"
"I just watched JFK's speech, 'we will go to the moon' - reminds me of what I admire in the US	That is a very good speech."
"It's really moving, wonder what the next big goal will be for humanity	wow. that's a very complex subject and you are very ambitious."
"The litter of puppies had been born!	I love puppies"
"All of the puppies survived, truly a lucky amazing occasion!	That is so awesome, I love puppies!"
"I was totally caught off guard as a kid when the entire yard was covered in Easter eggs	What did you do to take the edge off?"
"My dad, but he wouldn't admit it! haha	Does he not believe everything you say?"
"I was a little nervous to eat some cloves of garlic for the first time	cloves make me so nervous too. I hate eating them"
"I wasn't sure if it was going to make me sick or not	How was it?"
"I accidentally left a book I borrowed from a friend outside	Oh no! How embarrassing! Do you think they will react?"
"I did but it was ruined from the rain.	Ah, so it was a draw then?"
"I forgot to take some water bottles out from under my cart and pay for them at the store. I didn't realize I didn't pay for them till later.	oh no, did they notice?"
"Hopefully I don't get bad karma for my accidental theft!	oh you think so?"
"I attended a ball recently, one of the girls had the most stunning dress.	Oh that's lovely! Did you get a chance to see it in person?"
"No way, her dress looked like little diamonds had been stitched on every inch of her dress. Not many girls can compete with that. Diamonds are forever.	I would've loved to see that"
"I had to schedule an appointment with the dentist after not visiting one in five years.	Oh I'm sorry. Were you worried?"
"I do not have insurance. I went anyway because I had a problem with one tooth.	That sucks. I hope it was a simple fix."
"The internet has been there through thick and thin for me	Its a tough life, have you tried to block it?"
"True, it's a great resource to have	What is it good for?"
"Seeing animals sleep is very relaxing	I can imagine. Watching them sleep is one of my most treasured possessions."
"I don't know, I guess I'm just tired	Oh, I am sorry to hear that. You can take a nap or something."
"My dog got hit by a car.	Oh my, that is terrible! Are you okay?"
"Yeah. He didn't survive. I really miss him	That's too bad. What happened to him?"
"I remember not having any responsibilities as a kid	Thats a good way to be as young as you were."
"Yea, those were the days	What do you mean?"
"I found an old photo album of my family. It really brought back memories.	You must have some really good memories of that."
"It's kind of a bittersweet experience	Yeah? I think it is kinda neat that you can experience that with a friend."
"I had a tough semester but I just saw my grades and I'm pleased with the results.	That's awesome, good job!"
"Yeah, it was a huge relief for me. I am so glad to be done with this semester.	Congratulations! Sounds like it's a lot of work but in a good way."
"I should not have been so quick to let my teen take the car, but she was so excited.	Was her ride a newer model?"
"Well, let me just say that the pole made it out alright,lol.	how on earth did it make it out alright?"
"She is, and now my car has a very crude imitation of a red racing stripe down the side!	After a gym workout I'm always ready to get back and hit a new PR	That's fantastic! It's good that your body is preparing you for a given task, it's a good sign that you're using your body's natural capacities"
"I think just knowing that one day I'll be able to do things that are unimaginable right now, and I know I can do better the next time	You sound confident."
"My stomach made a loud noise while I was in class taking a test	Uh oh!  What was it?!"
"I just pretended like nothing happened, but i'm worried everyone thinks it was something other than my stomach	What exactly happened?"
"I felt pretty good leaving the gym today, hit a new PR on overhead press	I bet you were so excited."
"I like to try my hardest!	Try what?"
"I felt like I could do anything after I finished meditating	Meditating is great and relaxing! I wish I could do it too, but money is tight right now."
"I try to go longer everyday, I was able to go 50 minutes yesterday	You must be very proud of yourself."
"I caught my boyfriend texting his ex	Oh my goodness! Are you serious? That's awful."
"I think he will dump me soon. He would rather be with her, I just know it	Whoa whoa whoa... what makes you think that?"
"My friend has been working with me on the weekends to get my tennis game on the next level.	That is impressive! What level is that?"
"yeah I can consistently serve with power and accuracy now. I feel almost decent now.	how long have you been serving?"
"A while back I caught my partner at the time being dishonest to me.	That is a scary situation. I hope everything works out."
"We were together for a year and a half and we had a child together shortly before I found out!	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that!  How did it end?"
"High school was a great time, but those days are long gone	Why do you think that is?"
"No bills to pay, going out to eat with friends all the time, pretty fun	thats great.. I hope you guys have a nice life together"
"Around 4 months ago, I had major surgery that caused me to be immobile for a few weeks.	Oh my gosh, I hope you are doing good now!"
"Well, I had lots of support from my family, but I felt afraid of getting back into the swing of things for fear of failing. I felt so vulnerable.	Well, I'm sure you will do great, it's just the thought of being alone makes me apprehensive too."
"I love going to the gym because I feel stronger	It's good to be healthy!"
"Probably half a year, been the most consistent in my life, how about you?	Not too bad. How about you?"
"It's tough to talk to my parents, but I try to talk about things we don't disagree on	Yeah, parents can be tough.  Do you call/facetime them?"
"Anything political or religious really, or relationships	I'm afraid to say, even I can get my panties on full blast in a supermarket. What about you?"
"I had my dog for 13 years before she passed away last year from cancer. It was devastating!	That is so sad. I am sorry."
"Probably not for a while. She was a great companion, but I don't think my heart is ready to bring in a new dog quite yet.	Aww I know how you feel, I have one dog and one cat, and it's hard to bring in new companions.  What kind of dog are you getting?"
"I was horribly wronged by someone I thought I could trust. The feeling was devastating, and I've always struggled with forgiveness.	I know how you feel. It is hard to be wronged by someone you thought you could trust."
"They were dishonest and physically cruel. We have gone our separate ways, but I truly hope they can learn to treat others better.	I hope so too. That does sound like a difficult thing to deal with."
"Last month I came home from work and noticed my cat wasn't feeling well, so I rushed her to the vet. I had to put her down.	Oh no! I'm so sorry! Losing a pet is hard, especially at this age."
"I know, I just really miss her. Poor cancer kitty. I loved her so much.	That is sad, hope you find peace of mind with her."
"MY roommate got a new cat last week, and we finally let them meet today. I was so nervous and worried about it.	That makes sense. Have they been roommates long?"
"It went okay. My cat bopped him a little and growled a lot but no real swipes. So better than expected I guess.	That is good, did you teach him?"
"When I was pregnant with my first born, it was considered a high risk pregnancy. It made me very worried and anxious throughout.	Oh no! I'm so sorry! Do you have these issues now?"
"I had to have emergency surgery in the end, but being able to hold my healthy baby was the greatest blessing I could have asked for.	I can only imagine how joyous that must have been! I'm happy you were able to help your friend."
"I'm so happy summer classes are officially over and I'll be able to relax for a week!	Yes! Enjoy your week off! I am sure you will  have a great time."
"I'm not even sure what to do with all this time! I guess I should relax or have some leisure time, but everything in me says to try and be productive even on break. It's that school mentality.	I think you just need a break every once and awhile.  Maybe you can go for a run or something?"
"My sister came to visit from out of state. It was the first time we've seen her in nearly a decade!	That's great! I'm sure she will have a lot of fun. Do you guys have a lot of catching up to do?"
"Yes she lives on the other side of the country. We had a nice dinner, but my boyfriend is a loud chewer and a sloppy eater. It was quite embarrassing!	I think that's normal! How long has it been since you have seen him?"
"I just bought a new dress and I can't wait to wear it this weekend.	Oh nice! What kind of dress is it?"
"I'm going to wear it to a party. Everyone will have their eyes on me!	That sounds very exciting."
"A few months ago I could barely walk up a flight of stairs without having to catch my breath, but I bit the bullet and have been training.	thats good, it feels good when you can walk"
"Wonderful! It's definitely hard work, but I continue on, even on the days I don't want to. Today I discovered I can now comfortably run an uphill mile and I feel very confident!	That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that you're moving forward at a decent pace"
"My boss told me about a potential job opportunity and I've been waiting to hear if it's going to happen	Cool! What would that be?"
"A little bit. I am mostly excited about it though	What's the big deal?"
"I was very prepared for my final exam. It was so easy.	I can only imagine. You must have studied hard."
"If I'm being honest, I made an answer key from the quizzes we took this semester. As they say, work smart, not hard.	Well that's a good thing that you made an answer. I think some schools don't allow you to do that anymore."
"My cousin was swinging recklessly on my hammock and ended up breaking it!	oh damn! that's not cool at all"
"I was very upset, especially considering how long it took me to get it set up. I loved laying in my peaceful hammock to read.	You have to admire the patient. They put in the work"
"I received a phone call the other day from a friend I hadn't heard from in ages.	oh, did you alive?"
"We reminisced about old times. It was very nice, indeed. It was nice hearing from him, especially during some rough times!	What was funny was that he had nobody to talk to and you could just hear him breathing in his general direction."
"I have a weekend of nothing but relaxation planned for this weekend.	Nothing like the weekend to kick back and have some good relaxing time. Sounds like a plan."
"I have some leftover roast in the fridge so I don't even have to leave the house. I'm going to watch a lot of netflix and MAYBE do a little laundry.	I say watch Netflix while you do laundry! lol"
"I keep having these dreams that I am out in public and somehow my clothes disappear. It's awful.	Have you thought about seeing a counselor?"
"I hate those dreams, I feel anything but free. They're really uncomfortable and make me nothing but a ball of negative emotions like anxiety as I spend the majority of the dream trying to find clothes and get away from people.	I know what you mean, I had those dreams too many times when I was younger."
"One of my friends recently bought a house. I really wish I could afford a house.	If you have a job it might happen."
"I'm starting to feel like I will never be able to afford a house. They're just so expensive. And the market has been going up here about 5% a year for the past 10 years.	You can always buy a trailer and put your home on it."
"I ended up staying at home for the holidays	That's very relaxing. What did you do with the time?"
"No all my family lives out of state. I didn't feel like traveling, but I just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark.	Did you watch LOTR while you were at home?"
"I bumped into a friend from middle school. We chatted for a while	That is cool.  Did they have a good time being together?"
"Before 9th grade. I moved away that summer. Seeing her brought back a lot of good memories	Was she close to you at that time?"
"I had a doctors appointment at 9 am and they kept me waiting for almost 2 hours.	Ugh, the wait is the worst. What did they do?"
"It was terrible I ended being late for work because of their horrible service.	Ugh! Time to switch companies."
"The past few months have been terribly rough, but I think I can say that they have made me stronger.	That's great to hear."
"Thank you. I hope that I can move forward and at least learn from these hardships.	You can, just take it one day at a time. But you will get there."
"I really hate when people can't hold themselves accountable for their own actions and decisions.	I know the feeling. I can't stand it when my friend acts superior to me."
"Absolutely. Yet, these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you, even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.	I know right? You ever let go of someone who is putting you in a position to be guilt ridden?"
"I received a very odd message today. It came from a person who I blocked online, but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group.	That's the worst. You're either a shapeshifter or a con artist."
"They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish, and it makes me very anxious.	You should go to their house and confront them"
"I'm going rock climbing with some friends!	That sounds so scary!"
"I have done some climbing indoors for practice, but never done a big climb out doors, so who know how it will go.	It will be fine! as long as you have an understanding partner and are safe!"
"I keep having these really weird nightmares at night.	oh no, what do you have dreams about"
"I'm usually in a big city that I'm familiar with, and roam around in the dream until I get stalked, jumped, and sometimes very hurt.	That could be an interesting thing to experience though"
"Today I was quite impressed with my endurance during my work out. A few months ago, I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath.	Wow that is impressive! It must be relieving to not have to work so hard to keep your cool!"
"I sure have, but it's such hard work. I make sure to work out, even on the days that I don't want to. It's definitely taken a lot of will power.	Will you be able to quit your bad habit?"
"I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.	I bet. Being grateful is always good."
"It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty, but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.	I'm glad your surgery went smoothly! What kind of surgery was it?"
"I just learned my first trick in ice skating, a triple spin twirl kick front flip.	That sounds so fun!"
"I never thought I would have the balance to perform such a feat. I think I can no qualify for the Olympics.	Balance is important, so your not that fat."
"I just started college again, and while I'm doing great in school, it has lead me to feel very lonely with a lack of social life.	I can relate. I just graduated college and have a family of my own, but I miss my classmates and my roomies. I think it's important to stay close to them."
"That sound like a good idea if they weren't online classes. Next semester I have a few on campus courses, so I'm hoping I'll be able to make at least one new friend.	Online classes make it so hard to make friends."
"This upcoming semester will be my first time taking 5 classes at once. I'm pretty worried that I may have taken on too much.	I'm sure you'll be okay! Start small and work your way up!"
"I'm not sure. The more I think about it, the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby, so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.	Well what do you think is going to happen?"
"I adore my girlfriend. I am getting very serious about not leaving her side.	That's awesome!  How long have you been together?"
"Thank you. Do you have a romantic interest?	I do not"
"Summer in the South calls for many unwanted visitors of the insect type!	Yeah, bugs are gross."
"Mosquitoes, and those dreadful flying ants. They're everywhere!	Oh I hate flying ants! I always bring a spare set with me for those!"
"Lately I've felt proud of my success as a newly single mother. It gets lonely sometimes, but I can honestly say I've been doing everything I can and more.	Congratulations on your success and I'm sorry you're struggling."
"Thank you! I definitely have a drive to feel strong for them. I hope some day they can realize my efforts.	They can if they want to keep their promise to you."
"I have a plethora of amazing friends. One of mine recently drove me from Georgia to South Florida	Well, that sounds very exotic. Perhaps you could invite them over for a picnic?"
"It is an 8 hour drive! Florida is a very long state	Oh wow, I am sure it will be worth it though"
"I recently totaled my car. There were no injuries but I feel absolutely terrible	oh no, that is horrible"
"It was very wet and I took a turn at too high of a speed.	Oh no! Are you alright now?"
"My mom and I haven't always had the best relationship. Recently I've had to tell myself to let her in more. It's been challenging.	I am sure she understood. It must make you feel good to tell her you felt that way"
"Thank you. I know that, even though it's challenging, I need to be patient in order to improve our relationship.	Patience is key.  It will make all the difference if you truly love someone."
"I have had the toughest time getting my pet rat to get along with others. She's always been very aggressive!	What's wrong with your rat?"
"She's never bitten anyone, thankfully, but she gets crazy with other rats. To my surprise though, I've recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!	Oh wow, she is very friendly then"
"This past month, I was able to visit Six Flags!	i love taking my kids to six flags. it is always so much fun."
"It was amazing. The last time I was at an amusement park had to have been over a decade ago!	Did you go on many rides?"
"The other day I noticed my pet has a growth on her lower belly. I fear it may be a tumor.	Wow, did you do anything about it?"
"She's a rat, so her body is very frail. I'm sad that she likely will not make it. She's been with me through thick and thin.	I am sorry to hear that. We are all affected by disease and death so I know the feeling. I hope she makes it."
"I let the girl of my dreams slip away. Now I am alone.	Oh my, why did you do that?"
"I hope so. I think that time heals all wounds.	I hope so too."
"I recently went to the pool and lost my suit. My trunks were in the water without me!	That must've been embarrassing!"
"I was not, unfortunately. People saw everything!	what did you do? what all did you see?"
"I let a romantic interest slip through my fingers. She's now with somebody that I despise	Ouch, that's unfortunate. Was she aware of it?"
"I think so. I have plenty of time and life goes	Right, well that's good.  It's hard to plan for when things are busy."
"I feel great right now. I have a new album coming out and it feels liberating to be done!	good for you, what album is it?"
"I am very excited. It is almost an hour and a half long	Oh wow, an hour and a half for what?"
"I can't wait to travel. I am going to Madagascar soon!	I've heard it's beautiful! Have you been there before?"
"I have! I actually grew up in Saudi Arabia	Wow, do they have sandstorms?"
"The world is savage. I believe that the right individuals can take us to a better place in the future	You believe that?"
"I think so too. There are some kind and great people in the world	I think everyone is kind to some extent."
"I went walking in the woods one night. It was pretty scary out there	where were you going"
"No, everything was fine, but it was a chilling experience	What was chilling about it?"
"I caught my dog trying to eat my nephew's dirty diaper that my brother left on the couch	ohh no! were you able to discipline him?"
"It was really gross. I had to keep my dog from licking my face for a long time after that.	Well, that's your fault for licking his face that much."
"I recently remembered a sweet memory of my aunt who recently passed away.	That's very sweet. Remembering loved ones is always so touching"
"She would give hundreds of dollars of school supplies to kids in need each year.	I am very sorry to hear that"
"She did! I fill stockings around the holidays and go around on Christmas giving them out to people who have to work. :)	You must really like your family! That was very nice of you to do."
"My daughter and her family are coming this Thanksgiving. I'm already preparing for their visit.	Well, that's exciting! Hopefully, their visit will be peaceful."
"Not too much, just really exciting. I'm planning everything even though it's months away, even the menu.	That is exciting! Are you excited about it because you are putting a lot of effort into it?"
"My mother in law was recently placed in hospice and is not expected to live much longer.	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that! My mother in law is getting pretty old, and it's hard to know how long she'll live without the assistance of her family. I am wishing her all the best and hope she gets better."
"She's 87, so she has lived a long life, but she has Alzheimers, and it's really sad to watch her lose her mind.	Yes, it is sad. I have lost both my grandparents battle cancer."
"That's a great way of looking at it. I should try to keep a positive attitude towards it.	It is a great way to stay in the know. I do it as well."
"I was driving home from out of town really late one night and was exhausted	Sounds like a rough trip. Did you take the train home?"
"I did get home safe but it was scary because the roads were two lane and lots of 18-wheelers were heading in the opposite direction. I kept thinking I would swerve into their lane and collide into them	That sounds like it would be a scary experience!  Was anyone hurt?"
"I've been trying to be extra supportive towards my husband.	That's good to hear! How's he doing with it so far?"
"Yes - so true. His mom is dying, and he is working long hours on top of it. I feel really bad for him.	He has to work because of his mom, thats not right."
"My friend who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit. She married a very wealthy man and I was a bit envious	That's cool though."
"She drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world. I wish that were me some days.	hahahahahaha, is that a good thing or bad thing?"
"I was at a get together recently and a friend's husband was flirting with me.	Uh oh. I'm sure you beefed up the difficulty on the encounter."
"I didn't know what to say to her, and was afraid she wouldn't believe me and it would cause her to be angry at me. It's a bad situation.	Maybe you should've offered to show her the door."
"When I was in second grade, I wet my pants in the middle of class.	Oh no!  I hope you weren't the only one!  Did anyone else see?"
"I know! I was super afraid of my teacher, and was scared to ask her to go to the bathroom.	Wow. Why did you think she would do that? Were you scared she'd pee all over you?"
"She was really mean and always yelling! I didn't want her to yell at me. I'm much older and wiser now!	I want to trick my butler into thinking he won the lottery. I've taped the local new's winning lottery numbers and I'm going to buy a ticket with the same numbers and give it to my butler	Ooh. That's a good idea. Do you think he'll get the hint?"
"I'm not sure he likes being the target of pranks, but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin	Oh no.. is there a way you can get revenge on your cousin?"
"My friend just took her kids to Disneyland and I feel a little bad about it.	Disneyland? I have never been! Why would you feel bad about it?"
"I'd been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years. I'm happy for her- just wish it could have been me.	Where are y'all going?"
"I won a trip to Washington D.C. a few years ago	How cool! How was it?"
"I had a blast. I met people from all over the country, visited many historical sites, and learned a lot about how government works	that sounds like a lot of fun! what was your favorite part about the trip?"
"I'm looking forward to my best friend's surprise birthday party next week!	Hey that's great!  Where are you guys gonna go?"
"I'm really happy about it- she's a great friend and she's turning 40, so it's a big one!	That's awesome! Hopefully she'll still be nice to you."
"About 20 friends, surprising her at her favorite bar after work.	My 25th high school reunion is coming up and I'm excited.	Doors open at 8?"
"Honestly? There was this girl who really treated me poorly - I can't wait for her to see how successful I have been!	Oh that's nice. Yeah people seem to forget how nice and supportive they are in those situations."
"A hurricane hit my city. The first night I thought the wind was going to tear the roof off the house	Oh my gosh! Was your house okay? Any damage to the property?"
"It was my third. Luckily we didn't lose power for more than a few hours	That sounds scary!  Was it long?"
"It damaged the roof and the fence. We lost power for six days during the first hurricane I experienced	Oh goodness! I am so sorry! Do you have people you can call to help?"
"I am loyal to my principles, that is why I do not eat meat, because I love life	I do not believe you"
"If I already have 10 years of vegetarian	Well then hopefully you won't have to worry about not being able to eat meat again. vegetarian helps"
"I healthy physically and spiritually	My daughter recently broke curfew by three hours!	What did she do?"
"I was super angry, yes! I ended up grounding her for three weeks- one week for each hour she was late.	That's not fair! grounded her for three weeks... how come you couldn't do that?"
"I have a certification exam coming up and I think I'll do well.	What is the certification exam for?"
"I think so- I've studied quite a bit with my husband and others.	That is good, I am sure you will have a good time together."
"Education- teaching license certification	Hello ... I confess that when I see my daughter's eyes, my heart suffers.	it's sad to be apart"
"They are sick	What are they sick about?"
"Relax, they are things that happen	My new manager gave me a pay-rise!	wow! that's great! you deserved it"
"I feel very grateful that he has been so generous.	That is very sweet. Have you always been so grateful?"
"My partner left me the other day.	Oh no! I hope you find someone new!"
"That's fine, its not your problem. i just feel very lonely right now.	Why do you feel lonely?"
"I just moved to a new city and I don't know anyone	Have you tried going out to meet new people?  My husband and I moved a couple of months ago and we are pretty hit or miss."
"Yeah, it's hard though. I hate to go out by myself. It's hard for me to meet new people	Same here. Did you do anything fun to do at the bar or club?"
"I took my final exams a few weeks ago and I was sure I had done well, but I failed.	Aww, I'm sorry. That really stinks. All you can do is try your best and try not to be so hard on yourself. We all make mistakes."
"I don't know what happened. I studied and passed everything else. Now I have to retake the class and I'm upset	Can you retake it?"
"My sister kept playing a few seconds of a song over and over again on her laptop last night. Now it's stuck in my head.	That had to be annoying. How did you fix it?"
"It drives me bonkers when she does that	Yeah - does she do it out of rage, or just being curious?"
"I saw these 4-color Bic pens in the store the other day. I remember when I was young and getting one was like Christmas morning!	Oh man! They are so fun! Did you buy one?"
"Yes! My mom used to always get me one each year before school started. Those were the coolest pens in the world!	That's awesome!  How old are you today?"
"I'm optimistic that my house is going to sell soon.	That's good to hear. What will you be selling?"
"Only a week- and 17 people have seen it already, so I'm feeling good about it selling quickly!	That is a great number! I am really looking forward to the new Avengers movie."
"My best friend was going to travel from Wisconsin to see my this summer, but she ended up not being able to come.	Oh no :( Maybe you guys will be able to make it up for each other through other upcoming events?"
"Nothing- I still haven't seen her. I felt pretty let down - but hopefully I can make the trip to see her soon.	Why didn't you see her?"
"My sister threw up the other day and made a huge mess.	That's no good.  How did she clean it up?"
"Fortunately no- she cleaned it up. But she had just had spaghetti and it was floating in it. It was so gross!	Wow, yeah it is. I'm sure everyone has had their time to mess around with some crazy pasta stain removers or something."
"I was livid when I went to work the other day and saw my car was broken in to	Did you inform your boss?"
"I heard it was happening in other areas but didn't expect it here because we live in a nice neighborhood. So frustrating	Yeah, it can be difficult especially at night. I hear gunshots all the time in my neighborhood and I don't see it coming."
"Every year when the kids go back to school, it brings back so many memories of when my kids were going to school.	Did you get to have a play date with them?"
"I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly	It really does, doesn't it? Any plans to grandchildren?"
"So everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints, and I ate the whole thing for breakfast.	Uh oh. You may want to hide the donuts."
"LOL, I swear it was like I sat down and they were gone!  Probably gave myself diabetes. So not going to be able to eat the rest of the day!	That's horrible!  It happens to me all the time too with fast food.  Did you go on your cheat day?"
"Sigh, I have no self control, definatley need a veggie or two today now! Probably should knix those form the pantry	My father passed away in November, it's made me feel empty ever since.	I'm so sorry to hear about that. Losing a loved one is definitely one of the hardest things in life."
"I didn't think it would hit me hard. I felt like I was prepared.	Are you self-employed?"
"I surprised my girlfriend with Chik-Fil-A breakfast this morning when she got off work.	is that a sandwich?"
"She works nights, and had no idea I was coming. I knew she had a bad night so I wanted to do something nice for her.	That's nice of you. You both should be happy with each other."
"I recently was laid off from my job. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm trying to stay positive that I will soon.	Oh, that is so terrible! I am so sorry. You must be so worried. But at least, you will be able to find something and do something to show your support."
"I keep looking and applying, but still here I sit. I know it will happen when the right one comes along though	I'm sorry to hear that."
"I lost the book that my friend let me borrow. I feel so embarrassed.	That's such a bummer. If you really like the book, you can get another copy. But you're right, that chapter would have been a little difficult to find."
"I'm trying to find a new one, but this one was rare and hard to find.	I am sorry, I am sure it will come up"
"My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.	Oh that's so sad. Did you talk to them at all?"
"I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.	Its okay, I got you. How have you been doing so far?"
"The older I get, the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling I have. It is nice to just enjoy being alive.	Awww that's nice. I wish I felt that way when I was younger."
"Those examples are definitely the simple pleasures of life. It makes me want to go outside and listen to the birds and smell the flowers.	i agree with that 100%"
"I went swimming the other day and when I jump into the water and came back up, my bathing suit top was pulled over my breast and I was wandering why everyone was staring at me.	did anyone notice?"
"Yes I did realize fairly fast why everyone was staring. I looked down and seen my breast exposed.	Oh no! I hope it wasn't too embarrasing."
"I think my cat likes my new girlfriend more than he likes me now.	Oh no! Maybe you should ask him!"
"Yea he loves to sit on my lap while i work, but prefers her side of the bed now when he sleeps.	That must make you feel good"
"My grandfather passed away not too long ago, i received a bunch of items he left for me.	Sorry to hear about your loss. Take care of the items you have treasure."
"Some interesting antiques, grandfather clocks, and a lot of items related to his work for the house of representatives. Interesting stuff	I like the antique items as well"
"I had to let my dad borrow my car the other day. His truck is in the shop.	Did he make a mistake?"
"Yeah it has. And, he took good care of my car, as always.	That's great! What kind of car is it?"
"I ca not believe what happened the other night at my friends house, I'll never show my face again.	What happened? Hopefully nothing bad..."
"Sure, I fell asleep on the chair and had a dream, in my dream I went to the restroom, so yeah, I peed right there in their chair.	hahahahahahah how did that make you feel"
"Yes, it was not fun, but good to know I am not the only one.	I enjoy helping the wildlife in my area where I live. I give them a helping hand. I give them water, birdseed, my left over food. The animals love watermelon and cantaloupe.	That is really sweet of you!"
"I just have the small non dangerous type of wildlife that I like to help Birds, rabbits, squirrels and such. No big bad bears!	Non dangerous animals are great. I bet you are a nice person."
"We got a new puppy! We took him in from our father in law.	That's awesome! Where did you guys get him from?"
"Its a long hair chihuahua and a short hair chihuahua. He has the most adorable under bite!	I have a pit bull. Have you ever owned one?"
"I found out my wife was having an affair, the worst part is i knew the guy and welcomed him in my home and was kind to him.	Damn that sucks, I'm sorry to hear that."
"I'm learning to live my live without her, it's tough. Some honesty would have made the way it ended much better. Thanks for the kind words.	It is tough. But, somehow, when we get through it, it's worth it."
"I went on a soda fast for two days so that I could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking. I am addicted to soda so it was hard. I made it though and I was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days.	Soda is so addicting. I try to avoid it at all cost. How did he quit?"
"Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.	UGH I'm so sorry. Do you have any sweet tooth? Sweet tooth issues are the worst."
"No, they suck!!	I recently had an argument with a friend. Even though I talked ot her about it and let her know how I felt, my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband. She thought I was being two faced, which lead to a long discussion. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.	I know how you feel. People do things like that to hurt someone, it's sad."
"Yeah, I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter, even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..	It's funny how one mistake can alter the whole lesson!"
"That's good advice. Thanks!	I found huge box full of my old cd's recently, found a ton of old pc games i used to play, reminded me of a simpler time!	I know that feeling, it's a great feeling when you get a new game you wanted to play for a long time!"
"I did, i played a few sessions of age of empires and i plan to play some command and conquer red alert tonight before bed, still great games.	Sounds like a good night. I have never tried those games."
"I got turned down for a job I really wanted.	Oh darn that stinks! But you can keep trying, there are plenty of people out there with great careers who have also been turned down!"
"Thanks.  But yes, I was really dejected.  I thought I'd interviewed well and had a good enough resume.	I'm sorry to hear that.  What stopped you from interviewing?"
"When my wife left me, i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest, I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic	It is a difficult position to be in. But you must give up for your family and your work to succeed. How did your work help you in this situation?"
"Well, Like the saying goes, get busy living or get busy dying. I'm not sure if i'll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!	It's good to have hope."
"I bought a 20 foot boat. I believe it will be able to handle the large lake that I will be taking it on.	Nice! I have never been on a boat, but would love to!"
"It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions.	Wow! That is a lot of money!"
"It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy.	Maybe both of you should go with her."
"We should have a lot of fun this summer with it! Makes up for all the hard work saving up for it.	I completely agree! What are you planning to do with your extra funds?"
"I like like loaning money to friends. It can ruin friendships and sometimes doesn't get paid back.	How long have you loaned them?"
"Yeah, I meant don't like, sorry. I recently lent some to my friend with no expectation of getting it back because of her hard situation. I actually got it back.	That's awesome! I'm glad you got it back, that was a very nice gesture!"
"Last summer, my dog went missing. We looked for him everywhere and called all of our neighbors. No one had seen him.	That is absolutely terrible, I am so sorry!  My dog's name is Smarty, what is your dog's name?"
"After a week of looking for him and checking the shelters, a neighbor found his body under her house. He had gotten under there and couldn't find a way out. I was so heart broken and so were my daughters.	that is so sad. i am so sorry to hear this"
"I try to skateboard with my kids everyday. They love it, and it makes me feel young again.	That sounds like a lot of fun! Maybe one day you can make them ride it!"
"It can be scary some times, but its worth it.	How so?"
"My daughters 6th birthday was recently, unfortunately her mothers side of the family didn't show up, even though they all rsvp'd	That stinks :( What state is she in right now? Did you try calling them?"
"Hah yea, she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her. They grow up fast.	I know, my little sister is the same way. Sometimes it's nice to take some time for the self-aware to kick in."
"The other week, a friend of mine told me there was an opening where he worked and to get him a resume. I took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else.	What?! Did he do a great job, by the way?"
"It would have been nice. Less pay, but I would have had to work less. Oh well, guess I'll try harder next time.	yeah there's nothing worse than someone less fortunate than a person with more money... i mean more money but less hours!"
"The other day I was running late. So, I jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house.	hahahah.. its a classic running mistake. Well done!"
"I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains. I apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes.	Did you call him to complain about the shirt?"
"I have MS, and sometimes I have bowl problems.	Have you gone to a doctor to get tested?"
"No, I've tried science remedies. I like those kinds better.	Hmm I've never tried those.  What type do you like better?"
"My son got a remote control car for his birthday. Its really cool.	Do you have a go to car for remote control?"
"No, his grandpa did. But, after he went to bed, I went outside and played with it for a while.	You must have some sort of calming affect on your life. Did you get a good do over it?"
"Someone broke into my car the other day, but they didnt steal anything.	oh that's horrible. that really sucks"
"I know! I feel both violated and kind of sad because I have nothing in my car worth stealing.	Are you going to buy a new one?"
"There was an elderly lady at my church who was blind and could not hear well so you had to talk really loud for her to hear you. She was very faithful about coming to church so our preacher picked her up and took her home for every service. When she needed help, we took turns helping her.	That's good that you were there to help her!"
"When I saw that she needed help, I always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker. I liked helping her. She recently passed away and I miss her.	I'm so sorry to hear that. At least with public assistance you can still give her a hand."
"Yes, she loved everyone she met. She would say she couldn't remember everyone's names, but she loved them anyway.	I took my son to kindergarten the other day. He loves it so far!	Thats amazing! So you have taught him well."
"You bet! He made a girlfriend on the bus by talking about Zelda.	What a random person. Talking about Zelda?"
"Lately, my family and I have been very blessed. We are all happy and healthy. All of our major bills have already been paid for the month, and we have been going to a three week long revival at a local church.	Wow, that's amazing. I bet you really feel blessed. That's great you have good family."
"We have just been trusting in the Lord.	That's good to hear. And trusting is good! How has that been going?"
"Thank you.	I was looking at some old pictures of my kids' first day of school from 4 years ago.	Ohhh I love those memories! Were they happy memories?"
"It just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes.  My youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in 7th grade.	Yes, it is very quickly and the years fly by."
"And tons of pics!  I try to take pictures of everything.	I couldn't believe Aretha Franklin passed away last week.	Aretha has been dead for awhile."
"Sometimes you think people will be around forever, their aura is just so...legendary.	What do you mean?"
"I just finished eating dinner.  We had red beans and rice and with sausage.  I'm as full as a tick!	Oh man, that sounds good. What are your favorite foods to eat?"
"I had to soak them for 3 hours.  I think that's what makes that meal so satisfying - the wait!	What meal was it?"
"I do the same thing!	Found out some bad news today about my kids custody case.	Oh no! How did that make you feel?"
"Yeah, it really is. Due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father.	Is it a big deal if they are estranged?"
"I think I aced my supervisor exam!	thats awesome! good job"
"I should know something by tomorrow morning.  Hopefully they tell me right away.	What do you think it is?"
"I have all my kids' things ready for the first day of school tomorrow!	Thats a great feeling. Its like school starts already lol"
"I think I am.  I tried to do as much in advance as I could.	What stopped you?"
"My daughter is in 8th grade and just started school a little over a week ago. She is already being bullied.	That's really tough, I have a partner who's in 8th grade as well, and I've heard that can make the bullying even worse. Is she trying to say something to you about it, or are they just being mean?"
"Yes, and will again because it didn't help. I try to cheer her up with hugs, goofy moments, and whatever else I can think of.	Aw, that's sweet, I hope she gets better"
"I had a chance to cheat on my wife once,	Did you?  How did it go?"
"I did not. I left there quickly. It was not something I would ever want to do.	Good, that's what we call betrayal."
"My dog got very sick and lay in bed for a couple weeks.  I was so concerned.	So sorry to hear about your dog. What did you do to take care of him?"
"She did get better eventually.  During that time I tried to tend to her as much as I could.	That's good to hear. What helped her?"
"My roommate recently got a kitten, and he went out of town so I am watching over the little bugger.	That was so nice of you to do that for him."
"I love cats, I have one of my own. I haven't been around a kitten in forever so it's a real treat. I also don't have to sleep with the little brat at night either so it's especially great.	How old is the cat?"
"I had a solo competition last week for cello. I was well prepared and knew my music well. I felt great walking into that room.	That is really cool.  Did you win?"
"I have been playing the cello for 5 years.	wow that is such a cool hobby"
"I slipped and feel at work the other day. Several people saw it. I wanted to just crawl in a hole and hide afterwards.	oh no. were you okay?"
"Just my pride	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
"My ex and I broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork, like 70 plus hours a week.	Wow, why would he feel that way?"
"He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.	He sounds like a real winner.  How long has he been with you?"
"My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it, we've been getting along great since we broke up.	I would be worried, but I think it's for the best."
"The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much. He decided he didn't want to leave after all and wants to keep working 70+ hour weeks every week.	Ah, so basically he's determined to be the best at whatever he does... regardless of what other people tell him to do"
"I came home today and the food I had put in the crock pot was ruined. The outlet must have died and the food sat in there all day not cooking.	That's annoying, especially when there's nothing you can do about it."
"Yeah it was pretty terrible. I had to throw out a TON of food, and to add insult to injure I had to go eat out tonight.	That is a real bummer. How many people are you expecting to have there?"
"I let my friend babysit my kid last week.	I don't think babysitting is a very responsible thing to do especially when someone is like my husband. I hope he did a good job."
"Awesome. I usually have a hard time letting anyone watch my child but he had a great time with her.	Its always nice to watch someone special when they are little!  How old is he?"

"I was out walking by the lake over the weekend and there shore was just covered in dead rotting fish.	ewww that's gross"
"I don't know, that's what I would like to know! The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped, and they died. I imagine it was pollution.	I can imagine. What caused the pollution?"
"I have a really big game coming up this weekend. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league.	Have you ever tried it before or is it completely new to you?"
"I just don't want to embarrass myself or my team. I'm so scared i'm going to make a fool of myself.	Don't be too hard on yourself. You are the best you can be."
"Several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches.	Oh no!! That is so scary! Did you ever get them out?"
"I had to get 2 stitches in one of the holes and 1 stitch and all the other holes. He was a big dog, a little over 50 pounds.	Oh, I am sorry to hear that.  You must be very lucky.  Did he get hurt at all in the stitches?"
"Last year I made a bet with my friend and he lost, so he had to buy me a Nintendo Switch. I was so great.	What a nice friend to have! Was there a special occasion?"
"I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet, but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.	That's awesome! What kind of switch is it?"
"I am visiting my friend this week.	ok"
"Yes, I mean I promised her I would  and some things came up but I know I gotta stick to my word and make this happen.	well sounds like you did well, did she trust you?"
"Oh I know I can't. She had lots of plans for us.	One time when I was little and playing hide and go seek, my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us. After a while I realized that we were going to be in trouble, and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way.	Oh wow! That must have taken quite some courage. Did you guys get in trouble?"
"Yeah I guess they were, they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin, even though I was 7 and it was his idea.	Those parents need to find better people. How old is your cousin?"
"So we are moving and I'm having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me. Thinking I should keep it.	Maybe you can get a new one for Christmas? Maybe you can make your own clothes!"
"Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.	I understand, it is sometimes nice to look back."
"One of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of 25.	Wow. That's fantastic. Good for him."
"Yeah I know, I'm really amazed and proud of him. To be honest as proud as I am I can't help but to be a little jealous too lol.	Why do you feel jealous"
"I stayed at a friends house for the weekend a while back, and when I got home my bedroom was destroyed	Was it a bad argument?"
"My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it	I would be too! How old are they?"
"Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me, because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.	I can relate to that, i used to get stuffed animals a lot as a kid, its not for everyone"
"I hope so, I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I just wish I had someone here with me right now.	I am sorry to hear that. I get that you are lonely. But, I am sure there is someone out there for you."
"My husband and I celebrated 9 years Saturday. It was such a good day of quality family time.	That is a wonderful cake day.  Do you get to keep the tradition going?"
"Yes I love a good day of relaxation and family time :)	yes! i hear you! I also love a good day of relaxation and family time!"
"Yes, dinner :)	I went to the zoo last month, I haven't been since I was a kid. I went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos, however I couldn't help but feel bad for the animals the whole time.	Maybe you should go again soon."
"The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it.	Have you tried talking to them?"
"I won an essay contest and I get to go to Washington DC for free!	that sounds really awesome!! you must be so excited.. anything special planned?"
"I wrote about social security reform. Kinda boring stuff lol but it'll be fun to visit all the sites in DC	That does sound interesting. I bet it'll bring back a lot of memories."
"We are moving. I'm so pumped for new adventures.	That's awesome! adventure sounds like fun"
"Yes, a new state. I am just imagining all the fun things and new things we can do.	Yeah, I'm from Kansas and currently in Florida. I can't wait to move to another state. It will be great."
"When I was in middle school there was this boy that sat in front of me in 8th, he was always trying to get me to kiss him before class started.	That is creepy."
"No, the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.	Oh that makes sense, in a way.  Yeah desk antics can be a real eye opener for sure!"
"I've been out of a job for a while but someone I know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field	Well that's great! I've always wanted to be a treecko specialist."
"Statistics. I am going to help a real estate company build models to predict house values	That sounds cool.  I wish more people would do that so more people can benefit from this."
"So a friend and I entered a drawing at the mall and she won. I wish I could say it doesn't sting a bit that she won.	thats awesome"
"A weekend trip to Gatlinburg. I would of loved that.	That is nice. Where in Canada?"
"She is but she's taking her husband :)	I saw  man swallow a sword	oh wow thats a new one"
"Yes I was. I thought it was pretty intense to watch	Who did you see?"
"I've been packing, packing, packing and cleaning.	CANT WAIT! Are you going on vacation?"
"Moving, not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.	Being ahead of the game is great! I just moved to a new city, and have been checking to see if I have made any friends yet."
"Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.	Oh no! That would make me so angry. What did you do?"
"Huge dent, I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.	Oh that really sucks. Did they stop?"
"I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy.	Aww that's cute. How old is she now?"
"Oh man, I sure was. And she was so excited to get out of that box.	What happened inside?"
"My brother isn't very good with money but i just lent him some	That was very nice of you. What did you get him for it?"
"Yeah I don't do that often, but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time	What did you owe him?"
"I just can't believe some people. I watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today.	That's horrible! Some people have serious issues."
"I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.	Its hard to be kind and careful these days with all the craziness going on. It makes me feel both bad and kind of disgusted to be in a dangerous country."
"So we are waiting on some news to move. I feel like it will be this week that we find out.	News to move? Like a new home?"
"Not sure yet, waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.	I understand.  I am sure you will find the right one."
"So I interviewed for my dream job last week and I didn't get it.	That's too bad. Did you try to get any notes from the interviewer as to why you didn't get it?"
"I really hope so. I was really wanting that job.	what kind of job is it?"
"So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.	That's gross, did you say anything to him?"
"Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.	Gross!  What happened next?"
"I am so ready to find out where we are moving to.	That is awesome. Are you moving everywhere?"
"I don't know where I want to go, just want to know where they are sending us :)	OK, Where are they sending you?"
"A book I borrowed from the library got rained on and now it's destroyed	oh no! the library is always such a mess"
"Yeah. I feel pretty bad about it.	Oh no what did you do?"
"I found my dog's old toy. It brought back memories of when I first got her	Aww that's really cool, did you end up keeping it?"
"I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog was she?	She was a boston terrier. I will get a new one soon. She was really abused."
"After months of job searching, I finally got a good offer	Good, where were you applying?"
"I got a job in statistics	Well congrats. Statistics is a very hard thing to learn."
"I have a final exam that I've been studying for for days.	That is so hard!  Do you feel prepared?"
"I think I will do really well. I feel prepared for it.	What makes you feel prepared?"
"I stupidly lent my car to a friend.	Why did you do that?"
"He got drunk and took it for a joyride. It didn't end well.	Oh my! I'm really sorry to hear that. Did they give you a ride home?"
"Even though I could've gotten more money at another job, I've stayed with my current employer. It is a good place to work.	That's really good! I feel like money is the most important thing in life."
"I work in public relations. I create campaigns for companies.	Sounds like a sweet gig."
"I recently did a very successful one for a medical company.	That is great, what was it about?"
"I just had a job interview that went really well. I'm expecting a call pretty soon.	What job did you interview for?"
"It's a statistical analyst job.	Oh, so you're like the Harvard of Statistics."
"I recently moved to a new city. I left behind some good friends.	That sounds nice!  How are the friends?"
"That's very true. It'll just take some time.	I know. Are you having a rough time?"
"Last week I was at the grocery store picking up body wash. There were so many to chose from, but I couldn't help but buy my trusted brand that has served me well for so many years.	I love buying body wash. Did you have to wait long to buy yours?"
"Yes, why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well.	I agree, but sometimes it can be frustrating to try something new."
"I have to show some brand loyalty!	I have so much to do today, but it's raining. I'm OK with just staying at home and doing nothing.	Rainy days are perfect for being at home!  What are you planning to do?"
"It sucks. Maybe it'll be dry this weekend.	What will happen this weekend?"
"My dog I had for five years just passed away. He was hit by a car last night.	oh im sorry to hear that"
"It is just so sad to have my loyal companion taken away like that.	Who is taking away your companion?"
"His name was Han Solo, I am a huge Star Wars fan. My wife thought it was a dorky name, but I loved it.	I'm ready for hurricane season. I have my kit ready and everything.	Wow, that's impressive! Where are you that it's gonna be a season?"
"South Alabama, near the Gulf.	Oh nice, do you go often?"
"I have been sick the last week and my wife has made my chicken broth soup every day!	Yum! That sounds so healthy and herbs. It's the perfect amount of healthy soup."
"She is such a blessing to me and spoils me so much.	What does she spoil you?"
"Yeah, I try to treat her the best I can, can't lose someone that amazing.	When I go out to a restaurant, I order gluten free food items.  I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not, my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.	That's pretty smart of the restaurant to do that. It makes you less likely to get sick, I suppose."
"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	That's awful! I hope you can get that figured out and not have that aggravating gluten issue."
"Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.	We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!	Were they different colors?"
"I was concerned they were the wrong drink order, we lined them up and talked to the server and together figured out the syrup bag must be going empty!	Oh no! That would make me so mad! Hope everything worked out for you guys"
"While cleaning out our closets, I always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be.  Last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make ""jean purses"" out of someday.  My kid is 14 this week!!!	That sounds like a great memory to have! Hopefully the jeans didn't fall apart in the washroom or you had to send them back to the maker?"
"It definitely triggers some emotions!  Then I'm torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging.	Those emotions are hard to fight. What is the issue with keeping it longer?"
"My wife made me pancakes for breakfast. I have a full belly and feel rather happy now.	Mmm, pancakes are a favorite of mine!"
"One of my favorite breakfast foods. She also made some thick sliced bacon. She treats me so well.	That sounds so good!"
"For sure, no other woman I would rather have.	Ok but do you want to be with a woman that is less of a manly look or one that is more ladylike?"
"How can I complain when she gets up early to make me such a great meal!	It must be some secret menu you've been sneaking! Don't tell her!"
"I told my brother that I was planning to propose to my best friend, but I hope he keeps it a secret!	Did he even know?"
"He lets things slip once in a while, but this is a pretty big secret so I have confidence in him.	Oh really, what things slip away?"
"I have a friend who is struggling right now in her business.  I'm trying hard to be there to support and cheer her on.	That is tough!  Has she talked to you about it?"
"RIght? Even if I can't directly affect her business, I can help keep her spirits up to weather the storm!	that is a great thing to do, i would also do the same"
"I saw my neighbor bought the car I have always wanted. I wish I was in a a better financial position to buy one.	I'm sure you'll make enough to get one eventually. What kind of car is it?"
"Subaru Brat, best car ever made. Its like a car and a t ruck all in one.	I love Subarus. You would have to be a really big fan to have one though."
"I know, it would look perfect in front of my double wide mobile home! There is a used one on the corner for $350. But that will take me months to save up.	I hear you. I always try to go for the used items. Sometimes thats the best option."
"Yeah, or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big.	oh yea.. or you could join the lottery and win big!"
"I am in the process of potty training my daughter, but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper. The other day, we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service.	Oh that's annoying! They should train her more, it's really not that hard!"
"It was not one of our best moments. Luckily, she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.	I bet that was a relief."
"I ordered a new toy for my son online for his birthday.	That's nice of you. Was it for a special occasion or just because?"
"No, not yet. But, I can't wait to! He's going to have so much fun with it.	What type of animal is it?"
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December. i can't wait!!!	That's great! Where are you going??"
"I hope so too. I have wanted to go on a cruise for so long. I'm happy were are able to go this year.	Cruises are so much fun. What are your favorite parts about it?"
"We are going with a few friends, so they booked it and we got a discount because they are returning customers.	My dad called me one day crying out for help. I had to drive over to his house.	Did everything turn out alright?"
"He had fallen and bruised his ribs. I had to take him to the hospital.	oh my word! are you alright? did they find out who did it?"
"Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities, I have been in a rut lately. Last week, during revival, for the first few nights, everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit, but I couldn't for whatever reason, and it made me feel bad.	Have you talked to your pastor about this issue?"
"Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.	Wow, sounds like you really put your faith in Him."
"Thank you. He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.	Sometimes I wake up at night and eat junk food.	Hey junk food is delicious!  What food do you like to eat?"
"Yeah but I feel bad afterwards. I like to make peanut butter and nutella sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies.	Nothing wrong with that!"
"We had a birthday party for my son the other day!	That is so fun.  What did you guys do?"
"He's 6. It was so much fun to watch him open his presents.	Wow he must be a great guy to open presents and give them to."
"I was the captain of the volley ball team in middle school and high school, so I signed my daughters up to play. since they had an interest in it too. When we got the practice on the first day, the coach said that it was her first year coaching and she asked me if I would help a little.	She must have done well then"
"I was very excite to help. I miss playing very much, so being able to play with my daughters and show of my skills a little was great.	how long has it been since you have seen them?"
"A couple years ago, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with MS.	That's awful. Did everything turn out okay?"
"Yeah, I was blind in my right eye, and my left arm was numb.	That's a bummer. How long did it take to recover?"
"My friend has been sick a lot recently and I am worried about her.	Aw, I hate to hear that. I hope she feels better soon!"
"Yes.  She has been vomiting and having diarhea a lot	That is horrible news. What is wrong with her?"
"Yes.  It has just happened on and off for months.	I am sitting here chilling out with my cat on my lap.	Is your cat very old?"
"Yes.  My cat is relaxing and always sleeping	Is it a cat snatcher?"
"I had a job interview last week	Cool. How did it go?"
"I am not sure yet.  I was very nervous	Why are you not sure"
"Next week I think	I spent a weekend at a lake house all by myself.	I hate weekend trips where you are the only one there."
"It was fantastic.  I found it so restful and peaceful just to get away from it all for a while.	I am glad you had a nice time. What did you do?"
"I had a get together recently, One of my friends brought someone who couldn't hold their liquor.	Oh, wow. I bet that was embarrassing."
"Heh, well they projectile vomited all over my carpet, it was gross.	Oh no! I bet it smelled great too!"
"Me and my daughter went to the skate park the other day.	Did you have fun?"
"Yeah we did. She can ride up and down the ramps much better than I expected her to.	That's really awesome! I hope you gave her some tips for improvement!"
"I've been out of work, and my dads been helping me financially.	You are so lucky to have such a caring dad!"
"No, I am filing for disability. Theres no way I can ever repay him	What happened? Maybe you can talk to the disability office."
"I had to meet my new physical therapist this week.	What did you have to do?"
"They seem ok. I just hate having to meet new doctors.	I'm sure you will meet good doctors"
"This is the first time ever that both of my kids have been in school.	Ohh, nice.  Well that's good!  Neither of mine started school until 13."
"Yeah, it's just too quiet lol.	i know right"
"Recently my family had a trip that was very disorganized. Basically drove a long way to hang see my family for a handful of hours.	That is suckying"
"Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.	I feel ya! Sounds like you made the right choice, hu?"
"That is true, I guess there is that to be thankful for.	I had to wait in line at the store the other day for 15 minutes!	I have never waited in line at a store."
"Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.	I hate when that happens, especially when it's not your turn to cash the check!"
"I had to go to my brother in laws funeral last week.	I'm sorry.  It must have been really sad for you."
"I'm ok. It just hit me hard seeing all those sad people.	It's a hard thing to see. All you can do is try to be happy for them and try to look at the bright side of it."
"I have some friends who are traveling all over Europe this summer	That's cool, where did they go?"
"I am!  I would love to go myself.	That's great.  Where are you going?"
"My and some old friends from college recently got together. It's always great to see those guys again.	It's good to reconnect. It can be hard to do so when you've been away for so long."
"Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.	yeah i hear you! in a ideal world, people would all be in one place"
"No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.	Do you want to talk about it further?"
"My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.	Lol. Well, you got a free trial by lawsuit. May be she will get a divorce."
"I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.	Sometimes people have difficult situations. It will make you feel better to know what is going on."
"Oh, I've tried...	This weekend I saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color.	How was that for you?"
"No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.	Well, its better to prepare for it then to have it escalate by the time you see it"
"No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.	Wow, sounds a lot like my girlfriend. Gets on my nerves too."
"I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently, but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.	That is such a shame. Hopefully you can go visit her soon."
"We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.	That stinks, maybe you can try to make some new friends?"
"The last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes, shoes, and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school. There first day was yesterday and it went well.	Good that you planned it that way."
"I'm home with my toddler, so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.	Yeah, I have 3 kids myself. I have to do this as well. Hopefully they don't go to bed so soon."
"Recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back.	How did it go?"
"Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.	I can imagine. What was the issue?"
"My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.	I'm sorry to hear about your grandpa.  Do they have any family out there to help?"
"It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.	I hate when people argue in front of others.  Especially when they are acting ill.  They make you SO angry.  Did he get better?"
"Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.	Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends.	What sport is that?"
"The memories are awesome and I miss playing.But I wouldn't trade the life I live now to go back,	I completely understand. I think the same about my girlfriend."
"I am going fishing at my favorite spot tomorrow. I know I am going to catch something!	That's cool. I don't really fishing but I have a couple friends that love to."
"Blue catfish, they get so huge. I have a secret recipe for stink bait that works well!	Are they a trophy fish or are they just curious?"
"Oh I will, fried catfish is so amazing. Especially beer battered!	I am going to play dominos tonight	That sounds fun. What are you going to get?"
"Well with some locals at the local brewpub	That sounds like a fun event.  What kind of beer do they serve?  Also, are the taps good?"
"Yes I think I will do well even though I just learned last week how to play!	my family came to visit recently, i always get so nervous about people visiting.	Why are you nervous? It's not like you don't know them."
"I have to make sure the house is clean and that everything is in order before they arrive, nerve wracking!	Yes I hate cleaning houses for people."
"I have a birthday coming up. I really hop I get the gift I am asking for.	what gift are you asking for?"
"Thank you, I am hoping for a new camera. It is about time to upgrade.	What kind of camera do you have"
"Thanks, I really enjoy getting out and photographing nature.	My dog go into the trash can and drug it all over the house. I am so mad right now!	Dang, that's a little harsh don't you think?"
"I know, it is going to take me all evening to clean up!	Are you working on it?"
"He is usually good, but this time his naughtiness got to him.	I am going camping this weekend. I got my tent, sleeping bag and tons of food. I think I have everything I need!	That sounds great.  I am camping next weekend too.  What are you most excited for?"
"Oh I will, I am ready for whatever the elements throw at me!	Do you have a party?"
"It will be a blast, I just love roughing it in the outdoors!	The other night i heard a sound like someone was breaking in my house, i was pretty scared.	Oh my goodness. I would be freaking out."
"No, it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating.	oh no!! that is so annoying!! did you have it happen often?"
"It has been raining a lot lately, I am really trusting the seal on our doors to keep the water out.	That would be a good thing if it wasn't so expensive to get the seals done."
"I know, it really starts too pool up by our house. It is getting kind of scary!	How many people live in your area?"
"Yeah, really don't want to deal with a flooded home! Would not be good for my family.	I bought a cake from the store and it ended up tasting terrible.	Oh no! Did you return it?"
"No, I ended up just suffering through it and eating it.	Oh no! How did you end up doing that?"
"Yeah, I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me.	I was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently, I bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better.	I bet you were nervous. I know I was when I had my first interview."
"Yea, it made me feel better about myself and my chances, or maybe i just like spending money	What are your chances?"
"I love chocolate cookies because my grams would always make them for me.	That is a wonderful reason to love cookies!"
"Nothing beats cookies made by grandma. Except for the oatmeal ones. Too healthy haha.	Oh man, don't you hate those! I love my Aunt's cookies, but I just can't eat them because they're so expensive."
"Only if it has raisins to sweeten them up!	I found an old picture of when my oldest daughter started kindergarten 11 years ago.	I bet that was a happy memory. How old is she now?"
"It is!  In it, she's just standing with a huge smile on her face and a Hello Kitty backpack.	Aw, that's so sweet! I wish I could have some time like that with my girlfriend."
"I've been teaching my young daughter to play video games with me, she's such a quick learner.	That's really great that she's learning to play video games, it's always amazing to watch video games develop over time."
"Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them, It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence.	i grew up on racing games."
"It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.	OH I get that is a Dean's staple. Was that a recent addition to the grocery store?"
"I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!	Oh yes, I have tried lots of different brands. Which brand do you like best?"
"Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!	I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.	oh thats awesome!! good job!!"
"It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!	Wow! That's awesome! You must be really smart!"
"I try to.  But I'm glad all the effort is being recognized!	I put in to get a promotion at work, and I should know something either way by tomorrow.	Is there still time to get it?"
"On the one hand, I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.	Well, you still have all the power to do what you want, doesn't it?"
"I work for a medical supply company.	Oh wow, what kind of doctor does your work?"
"Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.	You would think they would be more compassionate after the fact."
"I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!	i agree with you on that one! humans are animals after all!"
"Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.	When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup	Oh I remember. They must have been so excited. Was it your first time watching it?"
"So good, genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!	That's great! Everyone is having a great time these days."
"But yeah - school started for the kids today and it was weird how quiet it was once the bus pulled away.	Oh, school is starting soon, I'm sure they'll have a good time. I'm still in college, so I have lots of free time. Although, I only have 2 kids, so I get a bit miffed at times."
"It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.	At least you have the kids. The quiet part is totally worth it!"
"Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!	Thats awesome,how old are they?"
"I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years, after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!	Gross!  I can't believe that didn't get cleaned up."
"Yes indeed, there was even a frog under there! So bizarre!	I really do like frogs"
"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	That is horrible! They should be in jail for the murder of many innocent animals."
"Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.	I've never had any luck getting my animals trained.  You have to train them yourself or they'll leave."
"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	True. Are you an animal person yourself?"
"And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!	I totally agree with you"
"My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.	Well that's great that you have someone like that to talk to."
"I am, too!  I'm glad he's doing something he loves.  At this point, I'm just waiting on the text to see which team he made it onto.	Do you love the letter box or do you love the cat?"
"I'm so glad the kids went back to school today!	Yes! I heard kids can be extra productive now days!"
"Yes!  I can go back to having ice cream for breakfast!  I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the, ""Mom, you always watch this!"" comment!	That must be so nice.  Where do you get your ice cream?"
"How old are they?	13 and 16"
"Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL	My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.	Oh, dang!  Well, maybe you two can bump into each other occasionally if you're both really busy?"
"On the one hand, I hope so but on the other hand, I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD	Oh I know how that is.  I had to get out of a bad relationship with my ex because I couldn't take it anymore!  What happened to your other partner?"
"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	I hope the neighbor was able to find the dog!"
"He was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me, the neighbor finally came out and called him home. was intense.	did he bite you? or was it a little bit more of a growling"
"The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.	Oh my gosh I'm so sorry! I love animals!"
"She was under my house, crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.	I am so sorry for your loss.  That is so sad."
"And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad, but I take comfort in those things.	My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked. A few days later she was playing no problem!	That's awesome, it's nice to know they can still lead a dog to learn"
"Yea, i was pretty proud of her, especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid.	Yea, more complicated is a good thing lol.  Do you have kids?"
"I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.	oh man, sorry about that, did you try calling the school or your aunt?"
"I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!	Why did you have to do that?"
"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	That is very fortunate. How long did it take to get to this point?"
"Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.	That's good to hear that you have a supporting cast like that."
"When my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy	I am so sorry to hear that, I hope you can find the peace that you deserve"
"hah, i hear ya. I just got so used to all the commotion i suppose.	Yeah i get ya. It gets old after a while"
"When we were kids, my sister and i once stole a blank check from our mom to order a pizza, we got caught.	Wow! Why did you guys do that?"
"My mom noticed the charge and found a the missing check from her checkbook, i'll never forget the look of dissapointment on her face!	oh wow, how did she react?"
"Oh yea. grounded for a long time.	I just saw a movie I had been looking forward to and it was terrible	Sorry to hear that. What was the movie?"
"It was the new Jurassic World	That movie was so good!  Did you see it?"
"My coworker forgot to turn in the paperwork to switch our on call weeks. He ended up costing me $250! I'm so mad!!!	damn that stinks"
"He's such a worm. I can't stand it.	What is a worm?"
"Working from home can be difficult when people won't leave me alone to get work done.	It sure can be. How long have you been working there?"
"I love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video, gonna pull my hair out.	I am sorry about that! My daughter is the same way."
"I have a big date coming up and I can't get these butterfly feelings to go away.	Nice, butterflies are great"
"Yeah, I really think she might be the one. I hope I don't screw it up.	What are you going to do?"
"Thank you, I am looking forward to taking her to a nice place to eat!	I bit into an apple and found a worm. It was so gross.	That is awful. Did you kill it?"
"Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple.	Well is it alright if you bite it whole?"
"That is true, I should be thankful for that.	I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs.	What did you do?"
"They really startled me, the female did not seem happy to see me.	I do hate when that happens"
"Yeah, thankfully I was able to get away. It took a while for me to catch my breath.	I got a new dog recently, he is the best. I am so thankful for him!	What type of dog is it?"
"He is a male australian shepherd. His name is charlie, he is super cute!	Thats amazing. You must be a wonderful parent."
"Will do! He is super cuddly and loves to follow me around!	There was one piece of pie left in the fridge. Instead of sharing it, I ate it. I kind of feel bad.	There must be some guilt involved.  I would share."
"It might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone. I look super guilty right now.	Hahaha I can see how it would make you feel guilty, but I think she's probably hiding something! Maybe a gift? Maybe you have a surprise for her?"
"I could, I might have to buy her some of her favorite chocolate.	I was at the park today and almost stepped on a rattle snake. I almost jumped out of my skin.	I would have passed out!"
"Me too, that would of wrecked my day. It was so close! It haunts my thoughts even now.	What happened?"
"It might take me a little while to get over my fear and go back to the park.	What is your fear?"
"For sure, wouldn't want to relive that experience	I just got a bonus from my job. That money came at the perfect time!	What type of money?"
"It was a really nice bonus too, they were impressed with the quality of work I have done this year.	That's awesome. I wish I could get a raise.  Good work."
"Now I will have to work even harder and try to earn a larger one next year.	I was going to go to the movies with a bunch of friends. But they all bailed on me and now I have to go alone.	That is terrible, you shouldn't be bailed on."
"I hope so, but I am really missing them right now. I didn't want to go alone.	Where did you go? Something fun?"
"It is hard to find reliable friends. No one seems to show up anymore.	I was out photographing butterflies and took the most incredible photo. I am really happy with how it turned out!	I love butterflies! I always look for the best ones."
"The butterfly was yellow. It was a tiger swallowtail. One of my favorites!	Wow! I have never seen a tiger swallowtail. What is it made of, I wonder?"
"I saw my dog try to eat a dirty diaper one time	oh wow that is disgusting"
"Yeah, it's nasty. I wouldn't let her lick my face for a while after that.	yea i wouldnt either. but i guess we all have those moments"
"I was trying to take a nap, but my cat kept on trying to play with my head.	Oh my, did you scare the cat or something? I have a cat who likes to play with my hair, and I always end up pulling his hair out with my toothbrush."
"I usually love mine, but not when it is keeping me from sleeping	yes i know how that feels"
"I just had a job interview and I'm waiting to hear if I got the job.	That must be nerve wracking. I hope you get it."
"Me too. I'm feeling pretty nervous about it	Why are you feeling nervous"
"I was on a plane ride and we went through some pretty severe turbulence	That must have been frightening.  Was it a long flight?"
"Yes it was. I was so afraid we'd crash	Oh no. Did the crash end up being okay?"
"My cousin and I tricked my butler into thinking he won millions in the lottery. I feel so bad.	What a nice and gullible person. Why did you feel so bad?"
"Only a few minutes.	... before it's over"
"Someone came to my door with a gun, asking for money	That is not good, did you say something?"
"I didn't have any. He came into the house and stole some stuff	What stuff?"
"Our cat had to many health problems, so we had to put him down.	Oh no, I am sorry for your loss."
"I had him for 17 years, he lived a full and happy life, but I was not ready for him to go.	I'm sorry, why didn't you want him to go?"
"But they make your life so much enjoyable while they are around!	I went to do karaoke with a guy i'm dating and I discovered he's a really talented singer	That is amazing. I have always wanted to learn karaoke."
"He's kind of shy about it. He had to get really drunk to perform karaoke	Oh wow, that is surprising. Does he shy away from the alcohol?"
"I had to do a research project and present it to my professors to graduate. Thankfully I passed!	Hey congratulations! That's awesome! Which course were you presenting?"
"I worked many long hours. It was stressful but I'm happy to have done well	It sounds like you did a great job."
"My sister has been playing a song I dislike over and over and over	Why do you dislike it?"
"She does it more because she likes it than to bug me. It's going to be stuck in my head for weeks	You should confront her and if she says no just leave it"
"okay.	Not going to lie, it took me a while to get used to your use of the keyboard."
"That is great! What will you be doing there?	im studying biochem at the moment. hoping to get my foot in the door with a job some day!"
"I accidentally slapped someone in the face while I was playing basketball.	Oh my god, why did you do that?"
"No, I think she was just a little shocked by it. I felt so bad.	It's okay though. We all have our moments."
"I let my friend borrow my car. He's an international student and only has a permit.	How come he didn't get a license?"
"I was in the car with him. He just wanted to practice driving and he didn't have his own car.	What happened next, did he wreck?"
"I am at a cross road. I am trying to decide my major in college.	Are you worried you won't pass?"
"I was thinking about graphic design. Or, I was going to do something practical like Nursing.	oh yeah i love graphic design too"
"I guess you are right. I really like sketching and painting. I can use my creativity side.	I've been trying to save money so that I can help my husband with the Christmas shopping this year.	That's a really good idea. It's really hard to be frugal when you're struggling to meet your bills."
"Well at first I was a little discouraged because I wasn't making that much. Things have picked up recently though, and I feel I will be able to help him a good bit so I'm feeling better about it.	thats great that you feel more confident now. he is lucky to have you"
"I had planned to take my daughter shopping a few weeks ago. We were all really excited, but the plans fell through.	that is so sad. what did you do?"
"Yes. We were able to go about a week later, but the closer it got to school starting back I started to stress. Everything is good now though.	Oh yea I remember that feeling. Life gets so much closer as you get older."
"I check in with my partner to see if we are okay. I ask him if there is anything that we can work on to make the relationship better.	Is there anything in particular that you both are struggling with?"
"I don't want to have problems. This is why I check in with him.	Good to hear that you are checking in with him. problems won't happen."
"When I go out with friends I really have to be tight with my money. Times are really hard for me financially?	i know how you feel... It is tough"
"I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much. I sometimes like to leave a tip if possible.	What is your take home pay?"
"I find it appalling how my husband's family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away.	sorry to hear that. what are they doing?"
"Yes, it is. They are all being really selfish and childish. My husband is staying out of it, but I can tell that he is getting fed up with it.	Has he talked to you about it?"
"I have to run several errands for my father-in-law today and he wants them done before my mother-in-law get into town, which is at some unspecified time today.	Wow, that's quite the workload! Is it for a work trip?"
"Yeah, I'm ready to get everything done so I can relax. I can't start on the errands until I drop the kids at school though.	That must be a lot of work!"
"I really do miss my mother. She has been dead for about 15 years now.	Oh my that must be heartbreaking."
"It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.	It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me."
"Yes, it is. I know that time heals.	But it takes a lot of time to get it over with."
"My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings. So, I would have to let go and let them fly.	That's so sweet of you! I need to teach my kids to play soccer so badly"
"I have 23, 20, 17 and 14. They are doing stuff that I question but I don't want them to not tell me stuff.	You're really putting a lot of pressure on them to not tell you anything, aren't you?"
"When I was in labor with my third child, they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital. The nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor. In the 2 minutes it took for him to get to my room, my heart dropped and I started to panic. He told me that the baby's heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency C-section right then.	Oh my gosh, I think I would have passed out! I'm so sorry about your lost!"
"Yes, everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.	It is scary to think about but it is alright to be happy! How are you today?"
"Yes, they do. I ope your boy is all good now.	I finally beat level 150 on the crucible today in my favorite game Grim Dawn.	Wow that is great, I have yet to even reach that point in my game."
"PC all the way. I've been grinding devotion points all week.	what are your plans for the weekend?"
"I just found a hello kitty pot in my daughters room filled with water and old flowers.	Aw, that's cute. How old is she?"
"It's not cute, and she's nine. By old flowers I mean, it's a green, stagnant slush with mold growing on top.	you are right. It is very bad"
"When I enter the bus, I fainted. I think that I got overheated.	That's terrible. How did you get back on the bus?"
"Yes I did. It was so hot outside and I did not have much to drink.	Oh, I feel you. I don't drink but I am a big coffee drinker. How many cups do you drink?"
"I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends	Oh, dear. Hopefully it wasnt too bad of an experience."
"I fell down, and apparently said some embarrassing things.	Oh no! Are you okay?"
"My daughter is graduating from college. I cannot wait until she finish.	I know you are excited, but is is is a pre-school type thing"
"Yes, I will. She has been under a lot of stress.	Good for you. Stress is a bad thing for a relationship."
"Two years ago I got diagnosed with MS.	Awful! What caused it?"
"Its a disease that attacks the nervous system. It was really scary to find out I had it. I just went blind in my right eye one day. Two days and several test later I found out I had MS.	I am sorry to hear that."
"I found out that my daughter is moving out. My youngest one told me so.	That is so hard, I am so sorry."
"I feel really sad because I felt she should have told me.	I'm sorry, how come?"
"I let my sister borrow my car. She is a new driver.	Sounds like a great time"
"Well, nothing. I'm sure that she will be a responsible driver.	Yeah? That's good. If she's careful we can't be sure of that."
"I think that I will do good on my test.	What kind of test is it?"
"It is tonight. I studied really hard.	Studying can be a huge help in achieving a high grade. What are you studying?"
"I heard a song that I hadn't heard in awhile. It reminded me of my high school days	Ah, reminiscing can be nice sometimes"
"Yes, it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when I was young.	oh yeah? i can imagine it was a great time"
"My dad dies when I was 33 years old.	Sorry to hear that"
"Thank you. I was crushed, and it left me with questions about my own mortality.	I hope you have learned a lot from this experience."
"My mother fell and injured herself. I wanted help and comfort her in any way possible.	I hope she's ok."
"Yes, but bhe bruised her wrist, and had a concussion. I wish that I was there for her when it happened.	Did you call 911?"
"I had a nice meal and my favorite beverage after work	That is awesome! What did you have?"
"It was a skirt steak with avocados. I was very satisfied.	skirt steak?"
"When I started a new job. I was nervous about proving myself all over again.	I bet you were! Was it a promotion?"
"I did, but I find it hard to trust people. Especially at work.	I'm sorry to hear that. You're right though, it is difficult to trust anyone ever.  Especially in an office setting."
"I am trying to quit drinking soda and I have prayed to God and asked Him to help me. The problem is I am addicted to soda and Its very hard to quit. When I do manage to skip a day, the lack of caffeine causes horrible headaches.	Have you considered getting Him to fix your drinking?"
"It just makes me feel bad, that no matter how many times I try, I still give in to the temptation.	Thats the worst, especially when you just want to cuddle and feel good."
"Yeah, I think that's what I will have to do. Thanks for the advice.	I went on a job interview. I'm anxiously waiting to hear if I got the job.	Good luck! I hope you get it!"
"I still need wait another week.	what do you mean? do you have a vacation coming up?"
"A drafter.	I just went to clean my kids sink a few minutes ago. I found a bunch of toys in the catch and I am mad.	That's a good find! I guess they weren't toys themselves, were they?"
"Yeah, all the toys are out. But, they got some explaining to do after school.	Like what"
"I couldn't sleep last night. I ended up staying up till 2am and eating a large amount of Shepard's pie.	Well, at least you're not feeling too depressed."
"Combination of stress and new meds I think. Maybe I can get back to my old scheduled soon.	I hope it works out!"
"I saw my crush talking to another guy.	Was there any reason that made you do that?"
"I was a little upset, but it wasn't my business. I let it go.	Are you okay?"
"When I went to the store the other day, I seen a guy all tweaked out on drugs.	I've seen worse. I hope he was okay."
"No, but he seemed a little unpredictable, so I used the other door.	How come, what happened?"
"Holding each of my children for the first time was amazing.	Did you cry?"
"Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.	EXACTLY! What do you have to think about that?"
"I forgot about my grandmother's birthday a couple years back. I felt so bad about it!	Was she upset about it?"
"Absolutely! I called her the next day and made sure to visit her. :)	That is awesome.  Did everything went good?"
"She did. :) It ended up being a good visit anyway!	I was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day, and I found all my old paintball gear.	Well thats exciting!!!  How old were you and what kind of paint were you using"
"No, just me. But, I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.	What are you going to play?"
"I went skydiving last summer with my partner. It was so scary!	No way! That sounds like a lot of fun. Were you afraid?"
"Absolutely! I've always been scared of heights, but I'm so glad I made myself.	My husband is the same way. Once you get over the fear of heights, it's actually not that scary!"
"When I was a kid, I had a dog at my grandpa's. He gave it away because it wouldn't hunt.	Your grandpa must have a lot of animals."
"I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.	what happened"
"I tripped and fell in front of some people.	oh my, did you hurt yourself?"
"No, only my pride was injured.	Oh no! Did something happen?"
"I recently dug up a necklace my grandmother gave me when I was young for a birthday. I hadn't seen it in years.	i bet that was a nice surprise"
"Yeah, she passed more than five years ago and I had forgotten all about it. It brought back so many memories though!	That's good, how many memories did you have?"
"I just won an award for best yard in the neighborhood!	Congratulations! That's great! Do you have a nice yard?"
"I did, mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off.	It sounds like you were a very hard working person. That's great!"
"It is, it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards.	I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends, it should be so much fun!	I do not like bbq"
"We often throw around a frisbee for a little bit, but we never get too intense with any sports.	I understand. Frisbees are fun. But, maybe, too much so as to call the cops"
"Me too, there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!	Old friends are the best. Especially if you like to drink wine and have nice chats."
"I snuck some candy out of my daughter's snack stash. I feel bad because I had been trying to diet.	You can always get some more before she gets to have them."
"Otherwise it's been pretty good- I've managed to lose 12 pounds! Just wish I could let the sugar cravings go.	That is awesome. Keep it up. It will get better."
"My childhood friend gave me a watch for by birthday a few years ago, I lost it in a move recently. I'm pretty upset by it.	I bet, what type of watch was it?"
"I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!	Well that's always a plus. A little peace of mind is always nice"
"I let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day.	That sounds like fun! How'd she do?"
"She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.	That's really neat!  What kind of car is it?"
"It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.	That's really rough.  Were you able to get everything settled out?"
"It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.	Oh no, are you guys still talking about it?"
"I was feeling really down for a few weeks and my sister knew. She drove hours to come see me and make me feel better!	It's great that your family is helping you feel better. I'm sure that helped you a lot."
"Yeah it was really sweet of her and made me feel so much better!	Why?"
"I was recently on a long international flight and we hit some really bad turbulence.	Oh no! Were you able to stay still?"
"I didn't, but I was really nervous for a little while. My wife didn't handle it quite as well.	Oh, no I am sorry to hear that! I hope everything turned out alright though."
"For sure. And it was a great trip.	I screwed up plans for a date night with my wife. We ended up having to cancel and she was really mad about it.	Was there something that you could have done to make it up to her?"
"We did and I made sure to not screw that one up!	Oh, Congratulations. You must be very proud of yourself"
"Me too. Who knows what would have happened to me if I did it twice.	I was able to go back home to my parents for a few weeks recently. It was wonderful to relax in my childhood home.	I bet that was so nice. A bit of nostalgia, huh?"
"They loved having me around again! Our ten year old dog wouldn't leave my side.	That's good, ten years is a long time! I feel bad for the dog that isn't around anymore."
"I've been thinking about buying some new, softer skateboard wheels.	Neat! Have you ever thought about buying some for yourself?"
"No, they make rough pavement feel smoother. I think I'll just keep the ones I have for now though. Just have to deal with having a rough ride.	Yeah it takes quite a bit to make it feel smoother by yourself"
"I took my dog I've had for years over to meet one of my husband's sisters the other night.	How'd it go?"
"It did not go well at all! She pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home.	Well, accidents happen and we don't know what caused them. Usually, if you don't have a fault there shouldn't be a mess at all!"
"Yeah, I think it might've been too much on her at once. I was pretty embarrassed.	I had to take my daughter to the doctor the other day. She was very sick.	What happened?"
"It was just the flu. I got her some medicine, brought her home, and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.	That sounds nice. She was lucky to have you."
"So my sister is getting married in a few weeks.	That's great for her, but I hope you're one of the bridesmaids!"
"Absolutely! The whole family is flying out, we can barely contain ourselves.	Wow. What are you going to do?"
"So my friend adopted a new kitten very recently.	Awe. What breed?"
"Oh, she is absolutely adorable! I'm so envious, I haven't been able to adopt one yet.	Aw, don't worry about it.  You can adopt puppies too!"
"Bought a new car a few months back. Couple nights ago we had a big storm roll through. I thought for sure it was going to hail all over my new car.	seems like alot of storms could possible happen at once! were you well prepared?"
"Nice! We have a garage, but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.	Aw that's frustrating. It feels like you need a garage for your car but are left with nothing."
"I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker. He is a programming wizard. He easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods I had never even heard of.	That's really awesome. I'm glad it turned out well. Did the co-worker get any credit for the effort?"
"That is true. I usually can keep up, but this guy is on another level.	What kind of level is he?"
"I had a meeting with my bosses the other day to discuss finally getting a promotion.	Oh, that's nice. Are you happy with the results so far?"
"I've been working there for a couple years now. I'm feeling pretty good about my chances! Haven't heard back yet.	Oh thats great hopefully you get a raise"
"I feel so good about knowing I am going to win the race on Sunday. The race is for my favorite charity. When I win the race I get to give my winnings to my charity of choice.	That's very noble of you. I'm sure your hard work has paid off."
"Yes, it is my local animal shelter. They will be there to cheer me on!	That's awesome!  I hate to see animals that are in stressful situations.  We just got our dog and he's so stressed."
"My wife has had a trip in mind ever since I've known her. She recently had a big birthday so I surprised her with the trip. We went and she loved it. It made me happy to see her so happy.	That's nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?"
"It was just a trip to the west coast. There was a handful of things she's always wanted to see/do. So we did all of them.	I bet that was fun"
"Not yet. We try to take one big trip a year if possible. We just got back from that one, so we will start plotting out next year a little later I would imagine.	I live in Florida. When I go home once a year it is a grand occasion.	I'm in Florida too, I love it there. What are your plans?"
"I grew up in Alabama. It is not far from Florida but still I get so thrill when I can go back to see family and friends.	I can imagine it must bring back a lot of wonderful memories."
"My sons first day of school was the other day.	What did they do?"
"Very first. I was so nervous till he got off the bus.	What happened?"
"I have a test coming up that I've been studying for weeks for.	Well good luck on it. What subject?"
"It's a Japanese language test for college. I feel pretty good about it though, been going over and over it every night.	Is it a difficult test?"
"I had phone interview for a job. It went very well	That is great to hear. What kind of job is it?"
"Thank you. I wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand.	It is always good to be prepared."
"I saw an old movie. It reminded me of my younger days.	oh thats cool"
"Yes. It's almost like a time machine. Fond memories.	I can imagine. It seems like there was a time machine almost every where."
"I lost my job because my company didn't pay rent at our location.	That's awful. Did they offer to cover the cost of the rent?"
"Not very well. It makes me so angry. So I go work out to relieve the stress.	Maybe you could look for a new job?"
"Recently my wife left me home alone with the dog all weekend while she was gone on a girls trip.	Wow. You think the dog would enjoy that?"
"I missed her while she was gone. We have a mixed breed rescue pup.	That's wonderful! What breed is it?"
"Our computer system at work is goofing up a lot, but the development team just keeps saying there's nothing wrong.	have you tried looking into bug fixes"
"Sometimes. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things I need to do.	Do you use a lot of software?"
"Me too!	Every time my kids go to grandma's they get to eat all kinds of candies, and get new toys.	They must be so happy. How many kids do you have?"
"Yeah they do! Some times I wish I got to go visit grandma's like they do lol.	what a horrible feeling that must be,  are you ok?"
"I was really happy when my nephew was born, Sadly i was informed he had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.	That is sad,  I am so sorry.  But happy either way!"
"He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy, but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.	Thats good. Its always good when life just seems to work in certain ways."
"I bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price. They didn't.	Ouch, what a bummer. Have you looked on analyst?"
"Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.	And make sure that you take out an emergency emergency, or go into debt for it."
"I came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor. He hasnt done that in ages.	Oh no. Were you able to clean it up yet?"
"Thanks. I dont think so. He has seemed fine otherwise. I've watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine. He is a mutt from a local shelter.	What is his name? Maybe you can track him down"
"Yeah. I love that goofy animal.  Hope he's ok	I work for a software company. I have been trying to learn a new language for some stuff. I knocked out my first task like a champ.	That's great! I bet you were exhausted after though."
"Well I have the opportunity, but rarely have the time to really devote to it.	Why do you think that is?"
"Yeah i get that. I work for a startup so things change pretty rapidly around here.	I landed an ollie on my skateboard for the first time in 14 years yesterday.	Oh that's legit! How'd it go?"
"Yeah it took a lot of practice.	And who are we talking about?"
"Next week I am off work and going to the beach.	That sounds fun! The beach is always a good time."
"No I am going with my wife and her family. But we all get along great so it should be fun.	That sounds fun!"
"Amen. It is much needed. Ready for some sun and a drink with an umbrella.	I wish I could be like you."
"Not too long ago, I took a trip on a plane. The airline lost my whole suitcase!	Oh that is really frustrating. Was it an important trip?"
"The whole vacation! I was so upset! I didn't have anything to wear for the duration.	Where did you go?"
"We usually don't do anything big for birthdays but my wife got me an apple watch this year.	That is a nice gift for a newlywed lady!"
"Yeah i really did not see it coming at all.	What did you see coming?"
"My boss and I went to lunch and had a personal conversation about some life issues.	Are they not civil to you?"
"We just went to a local taco place. It was a good conversation.	That's cool. Are you gonna go back to that place"
"It was more about just some personal life stuff. Not too much really.	I came back from a trip recently, got called in the boss's office and was given a decent sized raise.	That's good, do you think it will help your boss's business?"
"Absolutely. I certainly won't say no to that.	What do you mean?"
"Budget is kind of tight lately and I am really afraid my wife's aging car is about to bite the dust.	Oh wow. I've been there. It is harder the older you get. But being financially prepared is super important."
"I may have to if that happens. We are making it now, but if the car goes it will be pretty tough.	What type of car is it and how much is needed to fix it"
"It is ok. We are probably too proud to take help anyway. We will make it.	Yes, maybe you should help them with something else instead."
"So I recently went through some old boxes and found some of my childhood dolls. It brought back a lot of memories!	Oh I bet! Did you have a good time looking through them?"
"Absolutely! I remember having so much fun with them dressing them up. My sister and I would play for hours.	I know. I still play with my little siblings. They are 5 and 10 now."
"So, i may be in the market for a new laptop or a repair at least, thanks to a little mishap.	What happened?"
"My daughter tripped on the cord and it smashed on the ground, not sure if it can be saved. I was pretty angry.	Oh no that is so annoying!  Are you going to get her another pair?"
"I woke up the other morning, got ready and drove all the way to work. Just to find out it was a holiday and we had the day off.	oh man, was it full of holiday vibes"
"I know, but the extra day of work was nice. Especially since I wasn't expecting it.	Do you plan to make it up to them?"
"It was wonderful. I ended up being twice as productive since I got up early.	That's awesome! It's hard to get up early on a Saturday morning!"
"My new job is starting tomorrow. I'm feeling nervous, but really optimistic about it.	That is good, positive thinking can go a long way!"
"It's a job they opened up for graphic design! I'm super excited to get started and learn more from them.	Wow, congrats, what sort of stuff will you be doing?"
"Going to my son's first pee-wee football game tomorrow!	You must be excited! How old is he?!"
"He thinks he does.  All I can think of is a bunch of Tiny Titans in helmets running around like chicks in a barnyard.  *chuckle*	Dude. That would be cool to see."
"I put in a job application for a new job. I am fairly certain that my credentials are enough to get me the job.	You must have confidence in yourself."
"I was, I go in next Tuesday. I am pretty excited for them to give me the job.	Well good luck! I hope it goes well"
"Me too, we shall see. Now the waiting begins!	I got a call about job with a good company that is in my line of work.	oh cool, what is your line of work?"
"No, but I have the necessary experience, and I'm optimistic that it will work out.	Awesome! What's holding you back?"
"I went to the petstore with my dog and he had an accident in front of everyone. He had the saddest look on his face.	oh no!! did anyone see what happend?"
"He did, the clerk walked over, told him it was ok and gave him a treat.	That's good. I'm glad it went well for him."
"I had a video job interview. That was a new experience.	Oh that sounds exciting.  Do you think it went well?"
"I'm not sure. It was a little awkward and stressful.	What were you doing in the meeting?"
"Sure, that's ok. And thank you.	You are most welcome. Do you have any opinion on me?"
"I've been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and the pain is horrible. The problem is that the medicine that my doctor wants me to take has side effects worse that the pain.	Oh man. I am sorry.  Have you tried anything new?"
"Maybe, I haven't been back because I can't afford to go right now. I've just been dealing with the pain.	Oh no, I hope you get to feeling better."
"It suck.Hopefully we can both get coverage soon.	My son got picked to be on the soccer team that he was on last year!	Wow, congrats to him. Is he very good at it?"
"He is!  Especially since last year's team won the Opening Day Tournament and then won the Regular Season title!	That's so awesome!  What type of tournaments?"
"Yeah!  We had a group of really talented kids, and some very good [and patient] coahes!	The other day, my three year old didn't know I was paying attention to her while she was playing with the dog. I overheard her trying to teach the dog how to count to ten.	Oh no, teach the dog how to do tricks! That must have been aggravating!"
"Yes, I thought that was pretty good for a three year old. When I asked her about it she said they were playing school. Haha.	That's pretty mean of them. Were you mad?"
"I'm very proud of her.	Oh yeah?  Good for her!  How did you feel when you found out?"
"I babysat and worked odd jobs all summer when i was younger to save up and buy a sega dreamcast.	I love sega, did you play it a lot back then?"
"Yep, i've never looked forward to something so much in my life. I still have the dreamcast as well.	I understand how you feel! I dream of playing Super Mario Brothers on it every night!"
"I'm gonna need your support here, because I'm going through something a little bit rough, okay?	I'm sorry to hear that, I hope things get better soon."
"I'm 29 years old and I woke up to find that I'd wet the bed last night. I'm...not even sure how. I didn't drink a whole lot before bed or anything.	oh, that happened to me too! i am surpirsed that there are still people that aren't 29 years old"
"Should I see a therapist or anything? Is this indicative of some deep-seated problem that I'm not aware of?	I think so. Could be a side affect of something you're doing wrong."
"My Uncle Jebodiah is always looking out for me. He recently told me that he had a special concoction that if I drank it, it would cure my herpes.	Drinking any form of alcohol will almost certainly cure your herpes."
"Listen, my Uncle Jeb wouldn't do me dirty like that. You may call it """"""snake oil"""""" but I call it the miracle cure this world needs. After all, it worked.	wow, you must be very educated and experienced to know that"
"My cat was kept overnight at the vets recently. I was so worried!	Oh I bet! I have a dog that's a bit of a hoarder too, but I just love cats! Why do you think it was a big deal?"
"She's fine now! They found out it was something minor after x-rays. I was so relieved.	Minor problems can still happen. That's good to hear she's doing better"
"My car broke down on a busy highway the other day. There were so many cars zooming past me, it was scary!	That is so scary! I hope no one was hurt"
"My brother had to pick me up. He had to pull up behind me on the curb. It felt dangerous!	Oh my,  were you nervous?  What happened next?"
"Look, can we just be honest with each other for a second? Having ebola shouldn't mean that I have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions.	I'll admit it, that sounds pretty selfish of you."
"I saw one, and he said if I gave him $25,000 he would clear me for flight, but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.	That is lame.  That is a lot of money.  I hope you can find something cheaper."
"I am obsessive about being ready for anything	Are you prepared for anything in life?"
"I don't know.  I just see stuff in the grocery store and think I like that food and buy it because it is on sale.  Even if I already have it!	Have you tried calling your grocery store to ask about it?"
"My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer.	Ouch! I hope she's alright now!"
"She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.	Oh wow that sounds scary! How do you heal from that?"
"It was swallowed whole, unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't have it, and neither will I.	I forgot about plans that I had made with my mother over the weekend.	Why did you make the plans then"
"I called her right up and we rescheduled! I felt so bad though.	Oh no! I hate it when that happens! Did she say why she didn't come?"
"I was talking to a British friend of mine and trying to explain why our president feels compelled to tweet	Ah. Well then it is quite interesting. I suppose we can take it that he does feel that way because he is a former president."
"They think someone needs to take his phone away	Have you ever had that happen?"
"I was looking through the attic and found a box of childhood toys. They brought back so many memories!	I know the feeling of bringing back old memories. You're right it makes you feel good to look back."
"It was nice to find them all and think back to those simpler times	i agree. It's such a shame that we have todays world and am only live in it's present day form"
"The last trip I took to Chicago was by plane.	Oh that sounds exciting. I love going on vacation."
"I had! I love chicago.  The flight is nice and short too, though I wasn't feeling well.	It's lovely. What are you eating for your chicago meal?"
"I think my electrolytes were off, I actually fainted on the plane and they made a whole to-do about it.	My university is posting live stream of students moving in and I was reminiscing about when I studied abroad in college	What university is it at?"
"I studied in Venice Italy and travelled all over Europe	That sounds very interesting. What did you learn there?"
"I won a storage shed auction last Monday and found my grandmother's old glass eye in a steamer trunk inside of the shed. Really reminded me of her and how much I miss her.	I'm sure it was a great glass eye. Did you keep it in a safe place?"
"Rita May. She used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon. Those were such good times.	Oh that sounds so funny. What did you do?"
"I'm pretty excited for the upcoming Halloween season.	Me too. I love halloween."
"Well In September, Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events, after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.	Oh how exciting. Sounds like a fun time. Halloween is my favorite holiday."
"I was loyal to the same company for 10 years.	That's good. I assume they're no longer your loyalty?"
"Nice. I wasn't rewarded though. They laid me off.	Lol.. what? Everything was fine when you got your paycheck?"
"I told a lie to my mother.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What was the lie?"
"I was about school. And I eventually confessed.	Were you in trouble?"
"I got a job after a long period of unemployment.	That is great!  It is good to be rewarded for hard work!"
"Yes. I was very happy to be gainfully employed.	Did you enjoy your job?"
"I was in a car accident. Both cars were totaled.	Oh no! That's tragic, did they have full coverage?"
"They were running from the police. It was nerve rattling.	Why were they running from the police?"
"So my family surprised me this year with a party for my birthday.	That's so awesome. You are very fortunate"
"They got me the new shoes I've been wanting. I was so elated and had such a good time!	Wow! That's awesome! What kind of shoes?"
"I had a job interview. The guy really knew his stuff.	Nice, were you nervous going in?"
"Yes, really smart and easy to talk to.	Are you best friends with a partner"
"I don't know yet.	Our power went off the other night. We were without it until morning!	That is the worst. without the power for a couple days?"
"Someone crashed into the power line I think. It was so quiet and felt pretty spooky.	Oh no! Are you ok?"
"I bought a raffle ticket for a charity where I have a 1/500 chance of winning a car	Oh! That's exciting!  I always win things!  What is the prize?"
"Yes.  They were $100 but they only sell 500 tickets.  And the money raised goes to breast cancer research	I'm so sorry to hear that. How is the research going?"
"jumpfortherose.com	Someone helped me move.	oh thats good"
"Yes, and I paid them with beer. I was thankful because I had a toe injury.	Did it hurt very bad?"
"I bought a powerball ticket last week but did not win	Sorry to hear that. Will you be able to buy one more time?"
"I would have bought a new car and a house perhaps.  But I lost :-(	Oh no what happened?"
"Yes.  Maybe next time I will win!	I spent Saturday night playing Lord of the Rings Online.	that is amazing, it has probably been one of the best games ever made!"
"It is good, but I sometimes wonder if I'm trading real life for a fantasy world.	I do too, but it's not that hard to change the outcome."
"I am so mad that our politicians won't do something to stop Russian hacking	I agree. That is so scary."
"Yes.  The Republicans just don't seem to care about our country any more and I am so mad that Putin owns Trump	I agree, they are a disgrace and I am sick of it."
"My goldfish died.	Oh no, I am so sorry. How long had you had her?"
"For 4 years. I'm bummed.	4 years? why is that"
"Not yet.	I had an unprofessional job interview.	oh. was it a high paying one?"
"The receptionist ignored me, and my interviewer was not prepared.	Oh no! That's terrible. Were you able to follow up about what happened?"
"My computer crashed while I was working on a project.	oh man! that must've been super annoying! are you alright?"
"I did. I hadn't saved, and I forgot to set up autosave. It was very frustrating.	Did it make you angry?"
"My favorite team blew a big lead in the playoffs. It was like drinking sour milk.	It's so hard for sports fans to have expectations like that, I'm sorry."
"I hate when teams choke. It makes me sick.	i do too"
"I woke up this morning and my eye is itchy and my right eyelid is drooping	Did you go to the doctor?"
"yeah I am going to see what it seems like tomorrow - not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what	What something? Scratched? scratched out?"
"Yeah I will if it does not get better quickly	Me and my family went to see a magic show for the first time today.	Ooo, was it a good one? My family loves watching scary movies."
"I didn't catch his name, but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat. Classic trick, but I'll never forget it!	What movie was it?"
"I have a job interview tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it.	Cool. What kind of job?"
"Yes. It seems like a great opportunity.	What opportunity do you see?"
"I scored well on an aptitude test.	That is always good.  What was it on?"
"I had a few drinks. I felt good.	Drinking isn't my forte but I'm glad you're feeling better. What kinda drink did you have?"
"So today my mother brought over a whole week of meals to help me out.	That was nice of her."
"Yes, she's always helping me out! I am so thankful for her she's an amazing mother.	You are so lucky to have someone like that in your life. You are very lucky."
"So I moved away from my parents not too long ago. It's been a big change.	That can be quite a change, adjusting well?"
"Out of state. I'm by myself now, so it's pretty quiet! I miss them a lot.	I hate being by myself."
"My oldest child needed braces but her health insurance wouldn't cover the expense. It was close to 4000 dollars and we did not have that kind of money at the time.	Are you able to donate the money to the kids need homes?"
"Yes they do. My aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn't has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help.	That's very kind of her!"
"I was sitting on the couch after a long day taking care of work and all the mommy stuff the other day.	That sounds relaxing. What did you guys do?"
"It was! My family was happy and together. Chatting and watching tv. Everything just felt right.	That's great. I feel like I have a new family member"
"My husband used to work out of town in a different state Sunday through Thursday.	What does he do now?"
"Yeah, he does work hard. Even thought my children were with me and we kept our usual routines, I was miserable when he was gone. I would cry after he left every Sunday. Luckily now, he has a job where he is home everyday by supper time.	That's great that he's working so hard! What type of work does he do?"
"We really are, he brings out the best in me.	I didn't have a car to get to and from work, so my parents actually let me just keep theirs for a bit!	That was so nice of them!  I wish I had parents like that!"
"Yeah it was so giving of them to leave it to me for so long and helped me a ton!	Why didn't you leave it longer?"
"While driving today I went past my grandma's old house. She passed last year.	Oh, how is she holding up?"
"Oh for sure. Good feelings, but I also miss her so much.	What happened to her?"
"I went outside to get my paper this morning. Someone had ran over my mailbox!	oh no that is horrible"
"No, it's completely demolished! I'm feeling pretty annoyed.	That's no good, are you going to complain to the landlord?"
"My sister is a journalist and she got her first big story published in the paper today!	That's awesome. Which one?"
"It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her.	What a big deal! What will you do if you don't mind me asking?"
"So my partner gave me the biggest surprise this week.	Congratulations! How did he give you the biggest surprise?"
"He got us a trip to Hawaii! I couldn't believe it, I am so elated!	Oh, wow. How much does the trip cost?"
"I finally went and adopted a cat last month and go way more than I expected!	Yay! I love cats. Congrats! What kind?"
"Well it was only supposed to be her, but we found out she was pregnant! She popped out a whole litter of adorable.	I have had a litter of puppies.. Not always a happy thing!"
"I had to leave town last week and that meant leaving my pets who are my babies. I needed someone who could take care of them properly.	That really sucks. How many pets do you have?"
"It is very hard! The only one who I'd let do it was my sister and she did an amazing job.	I am sure she feels the same as you do. I am sure she feels the same about you. What happened?"
"So I finally decided to take my dog for his first dog park visit.	That sounds exciting! What do you think will happen?"
"It's hard to tell! He refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play.	That's sad, is there anyone else that can take him?"
"Im embarrassed to admit I forgot to pick up my brother from worth the other day after agreeing to	oh, how long did it take?"
"Ha ha, he was a little miffed. He got over it though when I stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! I felt like such a jerk.	haha I'm sure he'll forgive you! It's a tough situation!"
"I finally took the plunge and decided to go back to school this year.	That's awesome. Going back to school can be both exciting and scary."
"I start next week! I was super hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I'm making myself do it.	Good for you.You will be better then you think."
"I was going through some stuff and found a box of jewelry my grandparents had gifted me through the years.	Oh that's lovely! What did you find?"
"Yeah, it really made me think of them and old times.	Do you have any memorable times with them or were they mostly happy memories?"
"I recently had a shop fix my car. They worked so fast!	That's good. Sometimes when shop fixes are good they don't take long."
"I was able to go home, but I realize now that I didn't even have to	Wow! what a wonderful feeling"
"My husband is going through the process of quitting smoking on top of dealing with drama from his parents. He is having a hard time.	I'm sorry to hear. How do you cope with the drama?"
"They aren't being supportive at all, but that's not surprising, that don't support him very well in anything. I just wish I could make it better for him, but I can't	Why don't they be supportive?"
"I have some great friends. One of them drove me to the airport tomorrow	That is really nice! What state are you in?"
"Yes I am, they are great	Who are you talking about?"
"We just found out the person working in our accounting department has been stealing money from our company for years.	Oh no, that's terrible. I hope they get fired."
"Yes, it just makes me sick to my stomach. You think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind. I don't get some people	Have you ever thought about working on social services?"
"I miss high school. My girlfriend was the best	I felt the same way.  Are you guys together now?"
"That's great. College was also fun	I didn't have to go to college!"
"I recently bid farewell to a good friend. I miss her	Aw, I'm sorry. How long had you been friends?"
"Thank you, that means a lot. I will see her again	You bet. Hopefully this is a relationship she'll be happy with too."
"I lost my car keys. I'm such a fool!	I'm sorry to hear that! Are you going to replace them asap?"
"That's pretty funny, and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!	You got this bro! Keep it up!"
"I came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over. I've only seen him with a friend over once in my 3.5 years of living here.	I bet you had a good time?  Did you guys have some good times?"
"Yeah I sure was, he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.	That is how it is though, hope it works out for you."
"One of my co-worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor. It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor.	Is the supervisor female?"
"Yeah I figured it was, so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.	Thats great.  What is he or she like?"
"Man there aren't many people I would give my last couple hundred dollars to, with one notable exception.	Why is that?"
"My buddy Stefan. He used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters. We sold them and netted $2000 a piece!	Wow! So he made a ton of money off of it. That's crazy!"
"I finished first in a race. I feel like gold	Nice! What kind of race?"
"Yes! It was my first victory. All my hard work is paying off	Congratulations! What game did you play?"
"Some of my friends told me that they had a big surprise for me. They know I hate surprises, but I complied and let the blindfold me and drive me out to the location.	Oh wow, that must of been a nice surprise!"
"They had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together. It was a flying lesson at the local airport.	What was the present?"
"I found an old photo album at my grandma's house that had pictures of me when I was a kid	thats so sweet i love looking through old photo albums."
"Yeah, it did. I really miss the 90s. Everything seemed a lot simpler in those days	I miss most of it as well, things were so faster. What were your favorite parts about the 90s?"
"When I was in middle school, I had a friend come over to ride horses with me. After riding my mother pressured me to get on a horse bareback I wasn't comfortable riding. She made such a big scene that I got on to make her stop.	wow that was brave of you.  Is she still riding?"
"Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents, it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.	That's really rough, did she eventually get to say something about how bad of an accident it was?"
"My friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him, but I haven't been rollerblading since I was a little kid. I didn't want to roll into a car.	well that is a very adult decision to make. You should of just gone."
"We went, but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.	Uh ohhh! Well maybe next time it will be better! Haha"
"My husband is on the road a lot, I hardley ever see him.	What road does he be on?"
"Yes, its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.	i know what you mean i wish i could enjoy alone time too but we all have busy lives"
"I have an interview for a job that I don't feel qualified for	That can be nerve wrecking. What kind of job is it?"
"I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard	Try to do some pushups or situps"
"I'm moving in a few months to a new state, I'm starting to feel nervous.	I think you'll do great! Are you moving for a job or house?"
"To my husband hometown so it'll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family.	Getting back to your hometown is the best.  Are you guys going for a vacation?"
"I saw a dog get hit by car today on the highway.	poor dog"
"It was pretty tramatic, I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No, I was on my way to work, I couldn't stop :(	Aw, poor dog, did you do anything to stop it?"
"I can't even begin to tell you how nervous I was about my first tattoo.	Oh really? How come it was so hard?"
"Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood, and my pain threshold was low at the time. It turned out great though, and now I have several!	oh wow, do you ever feel like you are getting lightheaded"
"I love my husband! He has been so sweet this week!	Aw, that's awesome! It's great when someone shows they care about you. I bet he appreciated that!"
"He knew I had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and Taco Bell! It's the little things :)	Love taco bell, have you enjoyed it recently?"
"It's been a great week!	Glad to hear it, what's going on next?"
"I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting!	Congrats! What will you be doing at your new billet?"
"Music is a powerful thing. Sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place. You know what I mean?	Oh yes I know what you mean. Sometimes music can transport you right to the next beat."
"Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.	I am sorry for your loss.  I can also imagine being in his shoes."
"I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories.	That is awesome I love stuffed animals"
"Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.	Aww, that's so sweet. I love animals and feel so lucky to have one! My cat's eyes always point in opposite directions though, they are always flipping through the pages lol"
"My dog got hit by a car.	sorry to hear that. did youanked his phone"
"He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.	Oh man! I am so sorry. What happened?"
"Some random guy was in my backyard, I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.	Wow what did you do after?"
"Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first.	That's annoying.  Why did he not ask first?"
"My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.	Sorry to hear that, are they okay?"
"My siblings and I are managing, and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.	Family comes first, and sometimes it is more urgent to do that than just manage. Why did she left?"
"I've got a week off from work. Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.	You deserve this week off!"
"I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time	Oh me TOO! I love that show. I used to watch it with my dad when I was little. I can't believe it's still on and still brings back good memories."
"I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.	What are you going to study?"
"That is what I was thinking at the time, but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.	Are you a teacher?"
"I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.	that stinks"
"It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.	Oh no. How did you manage to do that?"
"My boyfriend is sick. He can't eat much so I made some soup for him	That's thoughtful. soup is good for all"
"I made chicken noodle soup.	I love chicken soup. What's your favorite soup made with it?"
"I had a meeting last week where I gave a presentation over the wrong documentation and no one said anything until after the meeting.	Oh, wow! That is embarrassing!"
"After I figured out what I did, I sure was. Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.	That sounds so delicious and relaxing."
"I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend.	That's really great that you have this preparation in place. Hopefully all goes well."
"It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.	Sounds like a good job.  Are you nervous?"
"I caught my boyfriend texting his ex	ohh wow. Did you confront him about it?"
"It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her	Does he ever stray from her?"
"I know I broke up with my ex, but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.	Why did you break up?"
"We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial, i think he does too.	I have had trouble with that too. Is there any reason why?"
"I can't wait to see my final grades. I think I got all A's this semester.	I bet you did great!"
"On Monday. I'm going to treat myself if I did well	Good for you. We need to treat ourselves every now and then. What are you doing to treat yourself?"
"I was very upset when I found my kitten today.	Awww!  I'm sorry to hear that!  What happened?"
"No, I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.	Oh no! Are you ok? What is the plant?"
"I cried a bit, but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out.	I enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion.	That is nice, how come?"
"Not really, I take my daughter to see them, so many of them have no visitors at all.	Maybe you could invite some of them to visit?"
"She likes to bake, so we take them what she makes :)	Awww! that's sweet of her. What kind of cookies does she make?"
"She is pretty good for an eleven year old, better than I was.	That is good! How did you get her so good?"
"I had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her, as well as get off my chest. I know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her.	Sounds like a lovely surprise. How long have you two been friends?"
"Yes, I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!	How do you reward yourself?"
"My son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us. I was anxious and nervous waiting to see if he was accepted!	I can understand how you would be anxious. That is great news though that he is getting into a college!"
"He did! He's in his 3rd year, going to be an Aerospace Engineer, so we are very proud of him.	Wow, that's amazing!  3rd years is a very long career.  Do you get to have kids?"
"My sister passed away several years ago. She took her life, and my mother and I found her right after she did it. This was very painful, traumatic and hard for us all.	I'm sorry. My sister had the same thing happen. She was sick for a couple weeks, but then recovered and was fine after a couple days."
"It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile, she was in denial. But, it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile, as she was my only sibling and we were very close.	I can definitely relate, i was very close to my mom as well"
"When my son first started college, I felt so much love and affection, but it was definitely hard to see him go! I was very proud though.	College changes everyone. Some go way more places then others."
"He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's focused on science, engineering, etc. He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer. It's great to see him go for his dreams!	Amazing! So Alabama is the Alabama of the north?"
"We went on vacation a few weeks ago and went to the beach, It was so relaxing and great. I really enjoyed the time with my family.	Oh I love the beach. What did you guys do on your vacation?"
"That's great! I'm sure you earned it, just like we do. It's so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!	I sure did. It felt so good to get away from that rotten world."
"I am looking forward to next week! My husband has been out of town on business for several weeks and comes home next weekend!	Cool! Are you excited to get to spend some time together?"
"I am going to cook a special meal and see if he wants to go out, just us two. I know he will like that.	That sounds like so much fun!  What is the special meal?"
"My husband has been out of town a few weeks for work but is coming back next weekend. I have a surprise night planned for just us. I am optimistic and sure he will really enjoy it.	It's good to have someone you can trust, but make sure you let him know how you feel!"
"Thanks! We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.	It is so nice to have someone that always has your back."
"My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!	I know the feeling. My daughter just went back to high school. It's a change, but a welcome one."
"Yes, very. But, time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!	Well, you can't help it. I bet he is full of energy now."
"I was promoted to a Team Leader and I felt very secure I could do well at the job. I had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role.	That's great! It's leadership - not necessarily skill - that makes the difference."
"Yes, thank you! I had worked very hard through the years, and I felt that I earned it, and would do well at it.	What kind of work do you do?"
"There was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him. I was so mad, beyond angry!	wow! what happened after that?"
"Yes, and she had two children of her own, similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle, that made her mad! Can you believe that??	Oh I'm so sorry you had to experience that! That is infuriating to hear"
"Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.	Oh that's exciting! I bet you were super excited! Is she starting any special classes?"
"It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing.	Well thats a relief! How did you do?"
"I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!	That makes sense, planning ahead is much better than not being prepared!"
"I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.	Oh no! Did you forget your spouse's wedding anniversary, too?"
"One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me, while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!	Wow! What did you do?"
"I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....	That's sad, you should've done something, but you didn't."
"The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.	Who was it?"
"No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.	If they are still there tomorrow, call the police."
"I was trying to ignore the fact that my 50th birthday was coming up but my family decided to throw me a surprise party.	50th birthday is always awesome.  I would have wanted everyone to be happy and not care about the past.  Congrats on winning the family contest!"
"It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more	That is good, you should look at old pictures"
"A few weeks ago, my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things, and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.	Oh that's terrible. Are you guys still talking now?"
"Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later.	I'm the same way. But if it's said during a heated argument, I tend to back up my words more closely."
"One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.	I would have been terrified too. Did you figure out what it was?"
"Yes, and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But, luckily, it turned out to be my shadow!	What happened to your shadow?"
"There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	That is very considerate of you."
"Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it.	I'm sorry to hear that. Are there any shelters in your area?"
"When my children were born, it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.	That must've been so exciting!"
"Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.	Congrats! Its nice to have a child that is healthy and well."
"I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.	I can understand that. I believe that you should stay true to your values."
"Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.	I totally agree with you. If there's one thing theists do it's completely ignore the fact that there's a big difference between someone being motivated by race and someone motivated by sex -- and I'm no convert...but I do think there should be some recognition for both groups of people."
"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!	I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.	Oh, that sounds stressful. Glad to hear you're doing okay though!"
"Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.	I had a car accident and I don't regret it one bit. You just got to live with it. Just keep your head up and it'll be okay."
"I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.	Thats great! what kind of diet are you following?"
"It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them	They sound like such good people!"
"A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!	Good on you for getting a good education and taking the test!  I didn't know you could get a natural born US citizen."
"I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!	wow thats awesome!"
"Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!	I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	That sounds wonderful!  Were they people you knew personally?"
"It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?	Naw, it's just something you do when you're really busy."
"That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!	It must be quite interesting to have all that to keep track of. Do you have siblings?"
"I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.	Hopefully they won't be disappointed with you. It's a tough life, but it's good you're handling it the right way."
"When I was entering the store it was really slippery.	slippery wow.. sounds like a bad experience"
"It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.	Oh geez, I hope you weren't hurt."
"I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.	I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.	Oh no! What was the secret?"
"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	That's too bad. Are you going to ask her to move out?"
"Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.	I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.	Oh, that's bad. What part did they announce?"
"I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.	What was the lead in the movie? Did you like it?"
"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	That is awesome, good for her!"
"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	That is a very nice thing to do, so kind of you!"
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	You will have a great year.  Do you have anyone closer with you?"
"I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!	Congratulations on that license!"
"My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.	That really stinks. What are they coming over for?"
"I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*	Sounds like a plan.  You seem like a good person.  Do you have a back door?"
"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	That's a big blow. Surning a home is hard work."
"We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.	It's wonderful to have a good brother. Sounds like you have a great family!"
"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	Aw, that's adorable! I'm happy for you!"
"Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)	Oh, okay. I'm feeling a bit empathetic now. Is there someone special that you are waiting for?"
"My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.	That is great.  Sounds like an amazing accomplishment.  What university?"
"I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!	Teenagers are extremely talented. It is a good thing to be proud of."
"Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.	Thats always a good thing. directions are always better than being lost."
"I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.	Sounds like a plan"
"I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.	Aaaw, I'm so sorry! I can imagine it was hard to be all by yourself."
"Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.	Sorry to hear that"
"Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!	I'm glad you made it. That is a tough stage in your life."
"She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!	Wow!  That's a shame.  I hope that the medical bills are really high for the hospital."
"I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before	I just got one too! Its amazing how portable it is."
"I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.	Nice, have you been playing it a lot lately?"
"My father passed away 2 years ago, but my mother lives in my neighborhood now. I'm so thankful she lives close by and still here with us. She's such a wonderful mother.	I am so sorry for your loss.  My mom is also getting older and it feels like she was just a baby a bit, yet she is always there for us no matter what."
"I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.	yes we do lose them at a young age but it is part of life i am sure! i will pray for you all the best"
"I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!	Clams are good friends."
"The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...	That sounds so annoying!  What do you usually do to relieve the thump?"
"Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!	My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it	that's awesome where did you meet them"
"We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor	How long has it been?"
"I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten, with no collar, in a window well.	Oh my goodness! I would have walked right out too! So sad. What did you do?"
"We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!	That's awesome. Foster kids are so amazing and amazing pets. I'm glad you took the responsible decision and took care of him!"
"I felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself	Aww, a baby bird? That's cute, did you feed it?"
"I did not, I was little but I think I put it back into a tree	Haha, were you in the woods?"
"Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving	Was it a difficult class?"
"Yep, had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out	That's always a blessing.  online classes are convenient and you can do what you want with your time."
"I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!	Oh no, did something bad happen to her?"
"I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :(	Its okay, as long as she is happy! How long has she been away?"
"You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???	I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party, not my greatest moment	Were you trying to hide from your spouse?"
"I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret	Dress up buddy!"
"I had some trippy nightmares as a kid, now I don't really have dreams	Oh no! What happened?"
"Yeah, it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me, pretty weird	did it say something interesting?"
"I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards	thats a good way to look at it"
"No, I was scared to get charged, but I stopped after that	Why were you scared?"
"I was at a meditation retreat last year for 10 days and I can say that I experienced a better feeling there than I could ever remembe	What was it that you experienced?"
"Yeah, thankfully there's an app for that - Headspace (no I am not sponsored)	Headspace sounds like an amazing service. I will definitely have to check that out!"
"I am really looking forward to going away for the holidays.	That's cool. Where ya going?"
"I want to go see the Harry Potter land at Universal, the kids will love it.	That's sounds amazing! I wish Universal would do that but I think they are still under Disney."
"They love the films, plus getting to ride Hogwarts Express, score!	I'm really hoping my acceptance letter shows up in the mail soon.	When will you get the letter?"
"Law School, I'm pretty sure I got in to my first choice, but you never know.	oh thats cool."
"Thank you, fingers are crossed.	I just ordered a new cookery book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. I want to delve in and try lots of new recipes!	That sounds exciting!  What types of food do you like to cook?"
"I'm vegetarian and cook all sorts of different cuisines - Indian, Italian, American. The only cuisine I'm not good at is Chinese. How about you?	I'm a complete beginner. I like to make vegetarian food often as well. I also try and make vegetarian sushi sometimes."
"Have you heard of Mark Bittman's book How to Cook Everything Vegetarian? That's the book I'm waiting impatiently for!	I witnessed the most epic bottle flip in the history of bottle flips at my school	What was it?"
"Yee yee, it landed on this little ledge that was super high up.	That's pretty neat. What kind of ledge was it?"
"My little grandson just came home from the hospital. He was born premature and weighted under 2 pounds.	I am sorry to hear about the loss.  My grandmother was just over 300lbs."
"He is doing well, thank you. And we are so thankful everything is ok. It was touch and go for awhile	What happened?"
"I love my girlfriend. She would never cheat on me	That's awesome to hear, that must make you happy. How long have you been together?"
"I hope to make her my wife some day!	That sounds so nice and romantic."
"My sister spilled some milk on me. It set me off!	That sucks! Is it milk that you can't replace, or is it something that you can?"
"It was indeed a mistake. My clothes are fine now.	That's good to hear."
"I recently did not pay my rent. My land lord has been terrible at providing services	That's very irresponsible from him. I hope you had someone come over to fix it!"
