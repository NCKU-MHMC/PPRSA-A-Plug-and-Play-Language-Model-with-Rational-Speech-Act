"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	That is terrifying! I know for sure that you will be fine and that they almost lost a loved one. They are such bad people!"
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	Well that's all we really know about him."
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	Well, I went to Venice with you!"
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	Yes, his license was revoked."
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	I'm sorry to hear that, it must be hard."
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	Yes I think that's a good thing, you can learn to embrace the distance, you can love the unknown!"
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	What concert was it?"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	That's awesome. Are you going because you want to go to see them or because you just really like U2?"
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	That is so terrible. I am so sorry for your loss."
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	That is terrible but they will be okay no?"
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	Oh no! I hope he's okay now."
"i was singing nursery songs :)	Ooh, that's nice of you! How old are you?"
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	That's good that you are hopeful. What's wrong with the economy right now?"
"thank you so much!	No problem, I'll talk to you tomorrow about spring cleaning at work."
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	Geeze, did the nanny died?"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	I protective of my kids too. Always watch out!"
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	That's great. Where did you guys move to?"
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	I have been there. Ik basically lived in your house for a whole year. How come you were not affected?"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	Oh no! Did he get fired?"
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	Yeah but what a random occurrence. There have been plenty of times I've cheated by taking cool pics of weddings."
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	Oh wow that's a really steep discount if you ask us. Maybe you can find a local Apple store and get one for 399 usd."
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	Empty bowls are usually a terrible feeling. I hope you find enjoyment in your new bowl of noodles."
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	I am sorry, you sure are loved and needed"
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	Well I hope it wasnt too hard for both of you! I'm sure she'll be happy to know that you are there for her."
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	That is awesome, do you love that baby?"
"i totally agree with you!	Good! I wish I could agree with you more. I have tried, and it's not fun."
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	I feel the same way in general"
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	i heard a while ago that changing diapers for a living is crazy hard work, and takes a lot of dedication"
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	Athletes always seem to have their own set of rules. Glad you're not his parent."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	Some people need to ""grow up"" I would say! I really don't like the idea of children who watch TV all day or play games all day. They need to ""grow up"". They have so much development to do on their own when they are young. I'm glad they are learning and feeling responsible for themselves but I wish they would let their kids do what they want whenever they want"
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	thats terrible"
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	The phone conversations can be a timesaving appendage when you don't have a written record. It's well worth retaining the conversations, for they can provide closure and context for your relationship."
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	I know that feeling well, my sibling is my best friend and I miss him like crazy. Is she able to come over more often?"
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	That's a real testament to your fertility."
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	Yes, love is love. There's no better feeling than that."
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	Oh yeah just everywhere you needed it. The ATMs I worked at had WAY too many machines. It was crazy!"
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	You went from being scared and depressed to being positive in one day. I'm glad you're doing great now."
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	What did they do?"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	I'm so sorry to hear that. My parents lost mine, so did my siblings, and I lost mine, soaks it all in air every once in a while."
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	Well that is great. Where do you think your intuition is leading you?"
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	That is wonderful. Leadership is all about trust and having a good time. I am sure you will have blastas and have a blast!"
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	ylee you must be very lucky, how old are you"
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	OMG! Was she like, ""What did you study""?"
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	I'm sorry that you feel that way. Maybe you should try to hang out with some of the girls and see how they feel about that."
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	I'm sorry you have to go through that. Have you thought about trying to get along with people?"
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	It's so great you still have those memories of that time. I wish you a lot of luck in raising them the best that you can."
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	That is so cute! I had a little girl like that when I was a little. cocoon in a sling. Thats so sad."
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	Yeah, I have never had the hot dog with ketchup and mayo."
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	I am sorry, that is awful. Did you talk to the manager?"
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	Ah, so this is where my orphan story ends."
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	I am sure he will now respect you for it."
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	That's good to hear. I hope it does and that you guys are able to be together."
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	Mom always has that last bit of information you need to make a decision responsibiliteseous"
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	that is true, but it is difficult to look back and be ashamed, it is very normal to feel that way"
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	Ha ha! I bet it's not as bad as you imagined. We all make mistakes."
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	I am so sorry to hear that, it must have been so hard. Friends aren't made in heaven or earth. I hope you find peace of mind."
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	That's great! I like to think that my own leadership has been inspiring as well! What company do you work for?"
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	I would encourage you to be confident and to take things day at a time. Not to be so hard on yourself."
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	I try to stay active. Also, create lasting habits that will help you in the future."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	Wow, that is crazy, has she moved recently?"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	I'm sorry it has to be that way."
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	oh wow, i bet it was an amazing experience, did you enjoy yourself and glad you did that good!"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	ohh that is a nice name it makes it stand out"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	How interesting! I bet that was a blast you both enjoyed!"
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	oh, I am glad to hear that, after everything that happened, it would be really hard to romantically approach someone again?"
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	That's so sad. Are you going to be able to keep up with her when you have kids?"
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	I'm not sure I understand how that is possible. You must be very confused."
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	Oh yes, I have to think of that--even if it's in anger, it's never a good strategy to let that fuel it. Anger is never a good way to advance the cause of any cause"
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	That must've been embarrasing. How did you find the cat?"
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	I'm sure she learned quickly that her grades need to be up."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	I have never been! I think it's very small and the rides are not very fun. Did you have a good time?"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	That's pretty neat but I know how it feels, especially if you don't visit often. I was wondering if there was anything you could do to bring something back to that special memory?"
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	That's wonderful to hear from someone you've only had a very short time with. Did you guys communicate in a normal way or in tongues?"
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	Nice. I hope you can help him find the car he wants!"
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	I do like to organize my house sometimes, it's kinda fun."
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	Oh boy, I'm worried I'm going to have a baby. My daughter is due in a few months, and my son in law's due in a couple of months. What are you doing to try and get those kids' leases lined up as soon as possible?"
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	I don't respond to those, too busy lol"
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	It would be so easy if everyone was on their phones it would be terrible. Maybe have people write down things like, ""Hey, how are you doing today, if you could call someone or try to do something, what would you want to do?"""
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	I'm sorry to hear that. How did it turn out?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	You should talk to your boss and let him know what happened."
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	How did you cope?"
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	That sounds awesome. I bet you had a great time."
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	Yes, I agree. I guess a lot of people think that they can do it all, or that they are the only one capable of something."
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	Exactly, I think a lot of people learn from their mistakes and move on."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	Were you able to tell him how you felt?"
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	Sort of like when you have to get prepared for a new job or something new comes up... be like, ""I guess I will try to be nicer next time"""
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	I guess he wasn't very nice, hu?"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	That's good to hear, it's crazy how some people will know your name before you even know them!"
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	What are you considering acting on?"
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	I hope you feel better!"
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	Beautiful. It's in the genes."
"Are your kids adults now?	Yep. They're in their 20s. What are you doing to pass the time?"
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	It's so refreshing to find someone who feels the same way as you! It's a confidence booster!"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	I'm sure it is! Did you at least make a bunch of copies?"
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	We know what you mean. In times of stress my partner has decided he wants to work more hours and earn more money, and it irritates me."
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	Oh I *hate* to hear that! My parents *didn't* like me taking in welfare when I was younger. But now that I've made enough to be able to get a job, I feel *glad* that I've made the choice to work. The sacrifices I make *can* *be* made again if *needed*. I'm *relieved* to hear that"
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	Oh, that's unfortunate. What happened?"
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	oh myww. that's cute. are you guys related?"
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	You must be so excited about it. Will you be spending a lot of time in the sun?"
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	That sounds awesome, Miramar is beautiful!"
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	Oh I am sorry to hear that. I hope things go well for you on the bright side is the plan. Just be patient and you will see!"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	Ugh I would be so upset, can you send her a message?"
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	I hate that he would do that"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	Well I'm glad you managed to stay okay!"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	You should. Li is a goldfish. What happened?"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	Oh no! That's such a horrible feeling. I'm sorry! Hopefully she pulls through and we meet at your place tonight!"
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	why what happened?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	Did you confront her about it?"
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	No. I just kind of shrugged it all off."
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	Oh wow. I bet it was loud!"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	of course you were. who even knows haha"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	oh my goodness, that's terrible. i loved him so much."
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	I love diamonds, very exotic."
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	you are so thoughtful"
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	That's great! Chicks are so intuitive about reproducing."
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	Think so! I think so too!"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	I do not remember."
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	Well at least you are okay, that is a good thing to know!"
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	I'm glad you're okay! I hope you weren't hurt!"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	Wow, that's terrible of your friend. I'm sorry"
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	Oh no! What did you do with all the food?"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	of course i had that happen to me as well. my kids needed lots of things from both me and my husband but when they needed help the response was always the dealership. so when one doesn't work or isn't available we resort to the other!"
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	Did she come out of it? I feel bad for you."
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	Well I hope at least she's found another job that a lot more guys seem to want, like a maid or someone else takes care of their kids instead"
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	oh my goodness, this is something that can only be described with amazement and astonishment! I truly feel your pain"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	that is very nice of mom, she has taught you a lot"
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	That sounds awesome! Where are you going?"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	I always love a beach that is cool and tropical, and the gulf is no exception! I hope you have a great time and are able to find the time to get to your destination."
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	Oh wow. If she was determined like you I'm sure she will get a good one eventually. Good to hear that she worked hard for it."
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	That's awesome. It sounds like she's making good decisions as well."
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	Yeah, I've actually seen that happening a lot. Very annoying."
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	It's hard to not be around when you're not supposed to be. That's good."
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	That is so cute. I bet it was scary thinking about it."
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	That is wonderful to hear"
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	That's so cool, I'm sure you are full of life vibes!"
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	I have done both. I also do taping for some things. Are you a graphic designer?"
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	I could not agree more. I have worked in some of the largest and most prestigious companies in the world and never once have I found people necessary working with me that I trusted or challenged. It's so frustrating and puts EVERYTHING OFF!"
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	It is difficult to stay committed for too long - even if you feel like you know your role and your role only has one type of person - and that type doesn't tend to change easily."
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	I did the same with Halloween. I loved the speed of the news cycle and the speed of the news cycle meant I loved any time the news cycle was moving in that direction. Such a beautiful moment to grasp and cherish."
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	Well, I never tire of watching movie reels, and it's always a classic. I'm sure it brought back a lot of good memories for you."
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	I bet you got everything you wanted! What did you get?"
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	I would have too if I was you. It's amazing how much thought and planning goes into a perfect Christmas dinner."
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	The worst part was the baby crying. I'm so sorry."
"Did they give you any feedback?	They didn't really comment on my game but they did question the way I play the game. I tried to give them feedback and they would typically give me criticism and negative feedback. It can be hard to differentiate the two though."
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	Yep. There's nothing worse than throwing away those who love you."
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	My sister and her husband are so exciting! We hope they have it all figured out, too."
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	Wow! Congrats again on your friend!"
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	I watched some Netflix. Why is that?"
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	I have never watched any of the dreary German shows. That is very odd."
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	Oh I've never heard of that one. I'll keep my distance."
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	wow. it is always good when you are prepared to go to court to prove yourself. i could not ask for anything better than that."
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	Wow, that's pretty good. It must've been quite an unemployment check."
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	That's always been a pain for me, getting to work in the worst traffic I've ever seen. How aggravating!"
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	That must have been infuriating. I can see why that made you feel angry."
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	Well I bet you're calmer as you are now"
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	kids will kids play that same. the older they get, the less they care"
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	That is great. What is her major?"
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	It's hard to keep up. Friends are there for a reason, you will always be able to count on them"
"I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.	Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.	That sounds so disgusting! I would have killed to have any leaf on my body!"
"I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.	A hoses or a hose barb? Maybe you should get a new shower head."
"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	That's wonderful! I bet everyone who signs up for that gets a puppy!"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	What grade did you have?"
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	Your parents are really awesome. They must've been very grateful to you."
"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed	That's a good thing. My parents wanted me to have a good childhood because they believe it's in my blood."
"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.	I read that once, it sounds like independence is a great thing!"
"Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married	5 years seems like a long time. Do you ever think about getting married?"
"My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.	I wish I could get a decent job doing something else. It used to be much easier because I had a side hustle."
"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.	Yeah, those types of things happen, it's just an accident at times."
"True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future	That's always an important relationship to have, be careful not to overthink it."
"I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path	It's exciting to hear you're set for a new adventure. Best of luck!"
"That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?	You can't really do anything about it because it's inside of you! You have to love it and give it your all daily to keep it going! You need to love and give your all daily to keep it going!"
"You could chat to them and complain!	but they will ignore you"
"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.	Wow! Did you get on your feet? Where are you staying now?"
"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	That's great. You must be very happy about that!"
"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.	Sounds like she's a ball of energy!"
"I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.	Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood	I used to live in Meridian Tenn. When I was young my parents would take us and my brother to Toy R Us. I still love that feeling of excitement and childhood memories being redone."
"I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era	Oh that's neat. I've never done that. I think the best part of the conversation is when you start to get really personal."
"The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.	Wow, that is some time traveling. Do you feel nostalgic about it?"
"Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.	oh, i understand"
"How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.	I was a college student in the 90s. I can't believe it's been 40 years! Those were the good old days."
"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	Well I agree that it's probably best if you aren't in one. Maybe finding a new one is a good idea."
"Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?	Of course! As an adult, I reconnected with my kids through playdates.net and facebook events. I do a lot of face time with them and it makes all the difference to take the time to spend with them now."
"I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.	Well I wish you all the luck and best of luck with your plans next weekend!"
"Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.	sorry, i believe that you are over exaggerating"
"My parents keep taking my money	That is not a good way to keep it. I think if you say anything it is to them."
"They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.	oh yea i know how that feels"
"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!	It's just as bad as you say. Kids under the age of 18 don't understand that! I had a colleague do laundry for me when I was pretty young"
"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)	Oh, okay. So you guys are really into The Office. How long have you been together?"
"The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.	I still have not had the courage to cut my ties with them. It took me years to realize that they weren't making the right decisions for me."
"She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.	That is scary, I hate falling asleep to animals"
"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.	What made you to name your daughter after her?"
"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	Do you know the name of the flower?"
"A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.	Ouch, that's tough. You know how that goes, huh? There's only so much you can cary, eh?"
"We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!	Did you in any way compensate them for their assistance?"
"Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind.	The way I see it, the universe is just so kind and interesting that it just wants to be with us no matter where we are in the universe."
"Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.	Yes, I had one. It was amazing."
"That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.	Every year sounds like a great year! It's a goal we both set to ourselves. But, I'm happy for you! It's rewarding to both of us."
"Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops.	It was raining hard one night and the power shut off	It happens sometimes, I know a family that has had it happen to."
"Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles	Oh that's a plus. Maybe you can find a lighter you like and keep them around."
"One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam. It was hard and I studied all night.	I am sure that you passed! Why were you nervous?"
"I ended up actually getting a 98%!	I would be proud of you!"
"Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.	Do you have any pets?	Yeah I do actually. What is your favorite"
"Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff.	My cat does not like to bang into things. He used to do that with books, but now he just gets up and walks. Is your cat an old fogey?"
"My son graduated.	I bet you are proud."
"Highschool.	oh thats nice, good luck"
"One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.	That must have been very hard. I lost my daughter a few years ago and it was very hard."
"I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.	I understand exactly what you mean. I try to spend time with my family and friends even if I have to travel."
"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	That's really impressive. Think of the opportunities it opens up for!"
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	Wow that sounds like a really smart guy! I would love to meet him because he sounds like a really cool guy!"
"I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.	Oh well that's a good thing. I guess it was a bad thing that she found you in a litter. I'm sure it'll be okay one day."
"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..	Who is ""she""?"
"No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.	Sounds like a great strategy. Well, I hope it works out well for you guys!"
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?	No, mostly music. An escape to be honest. What was the first song you ever heard?"
"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..	I used to live in a very Bible belt area and we'd get lynched for the same thing."
"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	How sad for you! My cat Cell belonged to my sister so I got to use her trickset tricks when she was little. I still have her and use her tricks set n controls everything in tricks :)"
"It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(	Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Did you lose him again?"
"Thank you. I appreciate that.	I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.	A little dog die isn't such a big deal. I had a cat die about 5 years ago and since then has been fine."
"The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha	Yeah, the heat makes you queasy pretty hard."
"Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.	Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends, so gross.	oh snap!"
"Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it	Well, that's good. It would have been stressful if it wasn't for you."
"You don't care for sushi that much?	I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!	That's quite an imaginative move! I wish you all the luck in the world."
"I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!	Absolutely! Thats great! I'm glad I was able to help you."
"My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.	now what do you mean exactly? are you scared of him?"
"I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.	I don't think he would want to join the military if he doesn't like the lifestyle. I hope you both live a happy life together!"
"I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.	That is crazy! You have to think about all the options in life. Thats what makes it all so hard to think about! :)"
"We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha	that is so cute! i have a dog and a kitty"
"I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.	elf love is unconditional i think we all have our moments of it"
"I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.	If I were you, I'd keep trying. Maybe this time, it works!"
"I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.	Oh, when is the date?"
"I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.	I hope she does, and that you meet her in the future!"
"I am very lucky, my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?	My birthday was in August."
"Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!	Oh yeah...I love getting love from my friends. Why do you say you like it?"
"For sure, maybe you need new friends!	5	huh?"
"I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.	I'm sorry to hear that. How did it make you?"
"I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.	Oh my, what happened?"
"Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt, though.	What acid was it, and what color? I can't remember."
"Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?	Cold chocolate plus a marshmallow? Yes I do I love that combination"
"Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha	I should get that tonight!"
"I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.	I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me, even to this day.	That's a great thing to have going for her. To be able to care for you so well."
"I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.	Well that's good of you to be able to do that. Sending good memories is the best thing you can do."
"You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?	The lights didn't go on. The refrigerator didn't open. Finally, the dog ate it."
"But you failed the exam? Did you revise?	I under-illiterated. I will know when I am good and when I am terrible when I have to read comprehension on a test."
"At least you know for next time eh?	My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.	That's very kind of her!"
"She's amazing. Do you love your mom?	I do. I miss my mom. Why did she pass?"
"I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.	Thats a bummer, hope she sees youogood lol"
"It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month, so I will likely discuss it when she returns.	I hope she is open to it, I'm sure she is happy for you!"
"That sounds tough. What do you do/	I'm an interior designer. I make pillows, collars, etc. I'm not sure what I would on the average person."
"That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.	I am trying to get a side hustle. You can get some side hustle done if you want to."
"Fair enough. As long as you look after your back""	I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.	Hopefully you do well this semester. What are you studying?"
"Environmental engineering! I enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.	Oh I see, good luck with that then!"
"I watch so many scary movies that I haven't been able to sleep alone in years due to fear.	I feel you. I thrash about on the internet trying to find a good movie to watch when I feel like it, I think it's called ""Hellboy 2"""
"I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.	Is it related to the Jack In The Box beetle?"
"I've been telling myself that for years, I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?	I love animated movies. What are your favorite kinds of food?"
"What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?	I just watched the excellent scary movie called ""Girl in Black"" by AndrÃ¡s Klug."
"Donald Trump is now the president. It makes me feel bad about life.	I don't think you that much though, I am a very content person in my life."
"I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him, too.	sound like a sad day right"
"I am now going to be a master's student. I will got to he University of Florida	Wow, that's a lot to take in! So exciting. I wish you the best of luck!"
"Environmental Engineering is my major. I enjoy it.	Oh, well that marine engineering sounds interesting! I hope you do well with it!"
"I have been feeling very faithful these days. My lover treats me so well.	Well that's a blessing and a curse! On the one hand you have someone who shows true love and on the other you have someone who isn't faithful."
"He is really nice and provides for me well. He is also very sweet and very respectful.	It's nice to hear that a dog has a caring and loving owner. I hope your friend recovers well!"
"Do you like to go through old family pictures?	I do I think it is fun sometimes but I don't know for sure. I do like to look at my family tree though."
"Absolutely. I love to hear my mÃ¡mÃ¡ tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.	That's so sweet. Family is so important"
"I also love to look through the old scrapbooks my mom made when I was a baby and young child. I find it's so funny to see what you looked like as a child.	I recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another. I am incredibly jealous of him.	Then you have to let that guy know that you're ready tozai"
"I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.	Good luck! I am sure she will come around. Kids grow so fast."
"How long?	I don't know, I just play video games all day long lol"
"About what exactly?	The wedding planning!"
"Now that is an interesting perspective!	My mother recently went to the bank for me. I love her so much.	Oh my, I am so sorry. I hope she gets her money back!"
"Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!	I agree! I guess I can't help myself! Sometimes I wish I could be cool like you!"
"My father almost died. His recent health problems have been devastating.	I'm so sorry to hear that! I know how precious those are!"
"It is tough, but I think I will make it.	I hope you do, that's a very proud moment."
"My friend bought a new car. This makes me so jealous!	oh honey, what kind?"
"It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.	I hope so. I think you are very lucky."
"I recently met a new person that I am very fond of. I want to give her my love and care.	That is wonderful! I meet some people in life that we don't know much about. But it is so nice to meet them now and give her all the love and care"
"I am very happy, too. Do you have someone special in your life?	I have a brother named Christian who is a wonderful person. I also have a sister named Juana who is a wonderful person too. Do you have a special bond with anyone?"
"My family is very loving. They care about me so much.	That's wonderful. You're lucky to have such a caring family!"
"I agree. I hope you are also close to your family!	At least they are able to help you out!"
"I stole my friend's Pokemon card when we were 7. I still feel guilty about it.	Why did you do that?"
"Yes	You are excited about this or??"
"I one time lost my trunks in the pool! People saw me in a way I didn't want!	Well, it's funny you say that. Sometimes people make a trap by means of which they one time lose their belongings."
"I covered my body and then went to the bathroom and got a towel!	aha that's a very interesting story."
"I recently graduated from college. I loved it and now I feel great about my life!	That's awesome! I went into finance and found a lot of debt to pay. It was painful, but I'm glad you did well."
"I agree. I am thinking about moving to the West Coast of the USA.	That should be exciting, I could not be where you are living right now."
"we went for a doctor visit because she was	I hate when doctors tell you what to do. Do you have a problem?"
"sorry lol. because she was ""late"". but she told me the result was negative, not pregnant. so then we went to a furniture store just to browse	what did you buy? i did not know pregnant women usually have second opinions"
"well here's the thing. We are married. Been together 5 years. So as I'm walking around looking at stuff in this store, I notice a bookmark hanging off the ear of a wooden rocking horse!	Having the whole house to your self sometimes isn't as good as it may seem!	Yeah, I think you need a lot of people to make it work. I'm sorry you're going through that."
"My whole family is out the house for a few months. I'm going to be so bored with no one around...	Mine is going through that exact process right now. I went to Mexico for a few months, and got to see all of my family! So bored :/"
"I have a huge chance to win a PS4!	Really? What does that mean?"
"There's only 2 other people in the final round! Winning a PS4 will be awesome!	What is winning a PS4?"
"My son really needs to cut down on the amount of sugary snacks he has!	Yeah, I know! Kids these days, they can easily have 20 or 30 sugars a day! They really shouldn't even be consuming snacks in the first place if he's going to be putting them in!"
"Well, my wife gets them on deals, so likes to hoard them in the cupboard.	That would be stressful I know, but like I said you got this on good terms."
"the house is very quiet now that she's been gone for four days visiting with her family	That is so sad, you must be sad and not able to focus on anything else. but you will get over it, i hope."
"because she hasn't seen them in almost 2 years. Misses them	I in turn, miss them. But I'm sure they'll come around, wouldn't want to wait."
"In the middle of the station, on my new suit, a seagull threw up on me!	That is hilarious!"
"I was! I had to travel all the way home with a huge mess on me!	Haha! It happens to the best of us. Were you able to get them all dressed home?"
"Paddington Train Station.	I can't believe someone half my age got promoted instead of me!	well, age is aessingroying"
"Have you ever missed out on a promotion?	No I haven't. Did you get a raise as a result?"
"My wife cried quite a lot at her mothers funeral. They had a very close bond.	Did she have a casket?"
"Unfortunately she passed away, hence the funeral.	Oh. Gosh I'm sorry for your loss. That's so hard, so sad."
"Getting this new job should be easy. I am easily the best person that applied.	Sounds like you made it happen! Hard work is required to get any job."
"CEO of Apple. I figured they need a Steve 2.0 to take them forward!	I agree. If they are truly talented like Steve, they should be the new Steve."
"ok, so after 5 years and the baby, there was disconnect. Things like not sleeping at the same times, not even hardly talking. Just avoiding each other really	That is normal, you never really connect with people that way, hopefully after this baby you will have a chance to reconnect."
"plenty lol. kicked them out long time ago. now with new wife of 5 years haha. but point is, i never cheated even during those 8 months of feeling alone, heck, BEING alone	Yes be happy in all situations. You deserve to be happy."
"as bill & ted would say: Excellent! {guitar}	That's what I do, I do it like 5 different keys to different notes. Awesome!"
"My son is such a rascal! He took my car for a joy ride!	Yeah, that is pretty sweet. How old is he?"
"He's only 13! I didn't even think he had that in him!	I guess so, it's just something we're not supposed to talk about yet."
"My brother...Dating an A list supermodel... I don't know what to think!	That is absolutely wonderful! Models are pretty and desirable I think."
"He's dating Kylie Jenner. Have you heard of her?	I have not, I would be very surprised. Is he a regular guy?"
"Justin Beiber.	Have anything to tell me about?	Nothing really. I'm sure you sound like a very interesting person."
"Oh wow, I can imagine. How old was it?	It was a little over a year old"
"That's rough, but I'm sure you can get past that.	Starbucks always get's my order wrong!	I don't think I know what I am supposed to do when my order is Starbucks but I feel bad for them if it happens more than once!"
"They definitely are expensive. What's your favourite drink to get?	The most expensive drink is probably vodka."
"I'm so happy for my son, went to his graduation from Harvard last week.	Oh that's wonderful. What a proud moment!"
"Thank you! Looks like there's going to be another Doctor in the family!	whats the name of the one that will be next?"
"My pizza I bought fell all over the floor on my way home!	That's awful. Did you eat it all?"
"The pizza was from my favourite pizza shop as well! Quite the sad moment.	that is sad, you should visit that place more often"
"I was getting keys out of my pocket, and then WHAM, right on the floor. The pineapple slices were the first to fall on the floor.	Why does McDonalds always get my order wrong! I said no lettuce!	That's a great way to say no. I've had a few in my life."
"Sometimes I think the management don't even care!	they are just doing their job better"
"I ate so much of my wife's cookies, but she shouldn't make them so irresistible.	Yeah she is pretty crazy."
"She made me pay twice what they would have sold for at the bake sale. The cookies were for charity, you see.	Oh wow... I'm sorry you didn't get your money back."
"Just my luck I step into a huge pile of dog mess...	That sounds terrible. Did you ever get to pick through it?"
"That is true, cow poop is much worst! But I was wearing brand new Gucci flip flops!	Oh well that's a good thing then"
"The key to making good chicken and rice, is following the recipe precisely	I do not thik chicken well unless it is cooked very low and I cook cook it for a reason."
"You've got to cut up all the ingredients, and put it in small containers, before finally cooking all at once.	I definitely agree that all the ingredients are necessary for good cooking, but I think you should try to keep separate the prepackaged and the fresh ones!"
"we asked the doc to put the ultrasound in an envelope so we could record our reaction to the gender reveal. I was very happy when I finally saw it!	I can see why you were. I still do not know how I would have reacted if you told me during a baby shower that you were doing."
"thanks. no mistake about it, it's a boy! lol. Takes after his father ;)	hahah you have some really great boys then"
"Holy Moses!! don't quit trying :)	My son failed his exams! Can you believe it! I don't know what to do!	Oh no! Those exams are really tough! Hopefully he didn't study too hard or anything."
"He spent all his time playing football instead of studying! I warned him about this!	I hope it does not happen again."
"Without prayer, I don't know if I would have passed that important test!	Did you talk to your teacher?"
"It was a test in Numeracy, so counting 1 - 100. I've always found that difficult, but god made it possible!	Amazing! I am glad you are studying! I am studying too for Chemistry."
"Hey! I saw a blind man play a guitar once. Was so surreal and I was so impressed	That must have been so cool. Do you know that player today?"

"we were 20 mins from the airport and the car broke down, overheated and would not start !	I would get yourself a generator so that you can at least get by for a little while longer."

"My son was just born, my first boy after 11 girls!	That is so cute! I bet you are happy and proud."

"My best friend is doing 30 years in prison. I miss my good friend.	That's awful. What happened to him?"
"I can't visit him. I've had to flee the country. We were robbing banks together, and he got caught with half the cash. I'm currently in the Bahamas.	Oh my, I hope he is in a better place now that you're there. Sending you my way."
"My son worked for many years to be a footballer, he finally signed a pro contract!	Oh, I wish I had son to try out for the teams. He always seemed to break out of the group."
"He's just joined Juventus. Can't be more happy for the lad.	That is great, I am sure he will do well wherever he goes."
"4 months later he will be here. It has taken me around 3 months to save up enough money to be ready for him when he's born	Hope you have a loving, healthy baby boy! I am sure you do!"

"I know! This one was absolutely huge, almost human sized. Chased me for a whole hour. The more I think about it, it might have been the batman! I shouldn't have stolen those diamonds!	Dang. If I had known you had that much money I might have decided to steal it as well. But I didn't. Maybe when you look back at that he was just trying to help you!"
"Every day I thank God for my blessings. I'd be in hole right now if it weren't for HIM	Have you been thanking God for long?"
"especially since he takes care of us even though don't deserve it	I guess you should tell him that and he'll come around"
"Once during an important school sporting event, my entire sports team was counting on me but mid-way through my event, my shorts fell down and I tripped	oh no! how embarrassing!"

"When I was younger, my dog died. He was getting up there in age, but he was still on the young side. Later, we heard the pet food we had been feeding him had been recalled because of similiar fatalities.	sorry about your high hopes for your dog"
"No, they just had a recall. Apparently they didn't clean out their machines properly when making the food, so it got contaminated.	That is not good, are you going to get your machine fixed?"
"Seeing people who have less than me just makes me so grateful for the blessings I have been given	It is a great thing to be grateful."
"absolutely! Always give to people who have less than myself :)	I do that as well"
"hiding for almost 2 years but I'm still not over my paranoia that one day I will have to pay for what I did. Don't ask what it was	I had the same thing happen a couple years ago. I'm still trying to piece together what happened."
"no way. I just pray she can forgive me. I could never admit to this sin. Jesus save me	I totally hear you. I love my wife and I and I am eternally grateful for what she did for me."
"When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So, when he had his back turned, I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.	Wow, that sounds pretty funny!"
"Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.	Did the smack that did good?"
"after she got her 1st job and new car, she started doing girls night out. Out until 3am one morning. I checked her chat history and sure enough she had kissed another guy >:(	oh wow, now she is banging 3 random guys a day lol"
"jealous isn't the one I felt. I wanted to rip her apart lol	Oh I get you. I hate it when other people's marriages are threatened."
"My dad always worked his ass off at a job he didn't like in order to support us, doing a lot of back breaking work as a caretaker. He even had a second job at Wal-mart for a while. I have no idea how he managed to do that sort of thing.	Kids can be one of the most underappreciated contributors to a family."
"Yeah, especially because we were single income. My mom homeschooled my brother and I. I think he took only a handful of sick days his entire time working, had something like 600 days saved up when he retired.	my brother is in his early forties and works in a Nike sweatshop in finneapolis. he also makes a decent salary at 32 he work very hard"
"I think he got 3 weeks a year, only used like 5 days.	Wow you lucky kiddo! That's a lot of time to plan ahead!"
"my instincts are never wrong. I found out her lies when I checked her facebook chat history.	oh no! that's terrible. i'm sorry."
"she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t-shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other. Made me so mad	Dang! Thats a good question.Shes a really nice person. Why would she do that?"
"I never thought she would tell anyone and make it seem like I did something wrong. I didn't force her	That is very surprising of you.I had an affair happen with a relative of mine and now i dont even think about them"
"ye and so I had to leave the country because of her	oh no! why did you have to leave?"
"Public school really sucks sometimes. Making boys shower all together. I didn't want to but had to or else fail PE	Oh hahaha I've been there. Gets old quickly."
"yes. Well it was a long time ago but I haven't forgotten	I'm sorry you missed out on that connection."
"My mom homeschooled me when I was little. I was in public school till first grade, but after that I was homeschooled. Did take a semester in grade 11 though to make sure I was up to current standards.	That is really a no brainer, you need to be up to date if you are going to be a good student. I am still awaiting grade 12 though I am hoping I will make it that year also."
"Really? I didn't even know that was an option. Then again I'm 25 so it may not have been available then.	Yeah it's a pretty common mistake people make when they're younger. Hopefully it paid off and you've since made changes to cut down on those gas bills."
"I still haven't got over it. Brandon Lee RIP. I was 17 when I found out he died during filming. I visited the area he took his last steps a couple years ago	oh my condolences for your dear friend"
"Now the remake is well on its way. Maybe it can lift this depression I feel if they stay true to the story. Jason Mamoa isn't bad looking	He sounds like a good Jason Mamoa. The voice is alright."
"I had to adapt to life. I had to change to survive. Now I feel better	Im happy for you. Adaptation is the best."
"I am reminded every day that I can survive anything. A friend gave me a special bracelet (paracord)	Its good to have a friend in this world. I wish we can get away from this world and be free of having to worry about money."
"I recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years.	Oh no! Is your friend upset about it? I'm sorry, but if someone is infidelity in your words, you need to get that person out of your life!"
"Very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way. It makes me think less of her as a person.	I agree, it is hard to be in a relationship with a person that has those kinds of emotions for more than a short period of time."
"I was sucker punched when I was 17. The guy broke his hand and fled the scene. I saw him one time after this riding a bicycle but didn't do anything.	Wow, I would be pissed! Have you ever been jolted out of a rage by something that happened at 17?"
"I wasn't confident. Now I regret not punishing him.	You'll understand when youare trained."
"I recently completed my masters degree in education at almost 40 years old. I feel really pleased with myself.	That is quite an impressive feat! What degree did you complete?"
"Thanks! It was a huge challenge, and I'm SO glad to have it behind me!	Yes, it sounds like it. Congrats on the graduation!"
"Being a mom is great, too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks!	Aw, I'm glad you're being honest! My kids are always telling me how wonderful it is to be a mom, and I'm grateful for their confidence in me taking care of them."
"I feel happy about the new house I have and that I can work from home. Thanks be to God	Thats great! thats what the week is for right?"
"It took me 9 months of determination and sacrifice. But worth it.	well done buddy"
"I blamed myself for her fall because I wasn't close enough to prevent it. I took care of her for months afterwards.	That's awesome! I'm sure she wholeheartedly misses you and your laugh every now and then!"
"I was distracted by the sound of running water.	Oh no! Did you get bitten?"
"I can't get enough of music today. Especially all my songs/bands from when I was in my twenties.	That is cool, I am sure you are talented"
"Its true though, they can't make good music these days. Not in ANY genre.	i agree! the bad rep really hurt their sales."
"I get paid today and I'm getting this new game I've been waiting on to be released!	Oh wow, I bet you're excited about that. What game is it?"
"I'm thinking about getting FarCry 5. I pre-order for the early release! I'm really excited about it.	I recently got into FIFA and have been playing it pretty well so far, so good for you!"
"Hi, I joined a firm 6 months ago and then I got a promotion for Junior Manager	That's great, Junior Managers are some of the most demanding jobs out there, do you enjoy it?"
"yes, They thought that I have some extraordinary talent and that is the reason I got that position	talent is certainly something to be proud of, wow I am very impressed"
"Maybe yes, Haha, Now I am looking for a Manager post and then become a senior manager	That's a great idea! I bet you'll enjoy your new position and it will help you along your career."
"Hi, I have applied for a driving license thrice and I have failed in all the thee	Have you ever passed? I can only imagine. If you've ever passed, you probably tried hard and it will come easily."
"Yes, I am a little uncomfortable driving backwards. I just can't do that.	I don't blame you. It's just got to feel a little weird, I guess."
"every time I try not to hit that cone but those are so close.	can you move or see in the dark?"
"I still can't believe my life is where it's at, especially if you look at the past few years. I would never believe you if you told me I would be here.	Life is a rollercoaster! I wish I could lie down and just let it go! But I get really nervous and anxious before a crash even has a name! So, I really wish you the best!"
"Well, for many years I was an alcoholic, working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!	That's incredible! I am so happy for you! How is being a first year going?"
"It does. I worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests, and I couldn't believe when I passed with flying colors!	That's awesome. I am sure you were very proud of yourself."
"Yesterday, I was standing in a lift and a man next to me whispered in my ears that your zip is open.	what? did he say something realllll?"
"It was just very creepy situation	Yes, I dont blame them either ha"
"lol thats funny	My hubby lost his job a couple of months ago but he has an interview this friday so i pray he will get that job	That's a good thing. I hope he gets it."
"armed security	you want to go inside?"
"I stayed alone at night in a office due to excessive work and was much scared.	That sounds terrifying!"
"no, I was on a 10th floor and security was down. I was scared even with a single noise.	oh yea i can imagine"
"I have been awarded with a degree in marketing.	wow, congrats, are you excited?"
"it took 4 years but at last got it	That's a long time. I'm so proud of you!"
"Yeah,  I have  a job that I was looking for and now I am really enjoying my life.	Hey, have you ever been in a car wreck?	I have actually, once."
"I was in one about 2 years ago. No one was hurt, but it totaled both of our cars.	That's terrifying! I hope it wasn't too costly to repair!"
"Have you everr been in a fist fight with anyone?	no i haven't but i would be more scared of them if i did"
"I got in a fist fight with my step father once. It wasn't a fun experience as you can imagine.	How did it turn out?"
"Have you ever played and old video game called Everquest?	I have wonderfully played but no Everquest honor I know"
"It came out in 1999. I used to play it when i was a teen. I installed it the other day and had a good time playing.	I only used to play it when I was a teenager."
"Have you ever eaten at Hardee's?	Yes, I have had there many times. I have always been a fan of their biscuits."
"I like it too, but I'm not a big fan of their new sliders. They're so tiny, and just one of them cost almost 2 dollars!	That's too bad, I always try to get shorts at department stores. I like the brand's new sliders, but I'm not a big fan of their new colors."
"Have you ever had a sleep paralysis dream?	Yes. It is so terrifying."
"Yeah, in mine I saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me. I've never been more scared in my life.	That is pretty scary! I went to see it with my daughter a couple years ago and the shadow was terrifying! I swear, I would have passed out if I hadn't gone to get dressed!"
"Have you ever rode on a roller coaster?	I have watched thrill rides but not really been coaster riders."
"I hate riding them, but i used to machine components for their drive chain when I was a machinist.	They really do. Manufacturing places like to make money from you, if you work there long enough."
"A while back my friend's boyfriend tried to get me to have an intimate relationship with him. He knew I had been married a very long time, as well as he was in a relationship with my friend. I turned him down flat, as I love my husband very much.	No I think you know your husband really well. There is nothing wrong with having a relationship as long as you are happy with the person. I hope you find someone"
"Yes, I let him know that was wrong and disgusting. I couldn't believe he did it!	that's horrible, i'm sorry that happened to you"
"Yes, as I am honest with him. But, I didn't want trouble.	I'm going overseas and I think I packed everything i need!	Where are you going?"
"Going to Kazakhstan. That's where i was born. My parents still live there and i miss them so much	that's over aï¿½ hours away, kz"
"Hi, My girlfriend was recently let go of her job, but she put so much work in to finding a new job and got one with better pay!	That's great. When is she getting a new job?"
"Yes I agree, she was so happy when she found out the job was hers	that's a great sign, you should be proud of her"
"She wasn't really fired, her position was no more. Schools don't have much room left for Home Ec teachers. Sad	That is so sad. That must be tough."
"Yeah she has a passion for teaching. These kids will be great to work with.	So about a year ago now, my girlfriend decided to surprise me with a puppy!	That is so cute! What kind of puppy was it?"
"Yes, so nice!! It was the best thing that could've happened! It's a German Shepherd!	Yep, they're really well mannered dogs. They know when you're trying to be annoying, and lower their guard."
"There was this one time I was fairly drunk at a bar and this attractive girl was trying to make moves on me, but I did my best to ignore it all.. Having a girlfriend and all.	I have dated a few, but I have a thing for dogs. Thats about it I guess."
"I was very proud definitely when I woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!	that is the most amazing feeling i could ask for. you have to be proud of that!"
"There was this one time my girlfriend and I had plans to meet a Longhorn steakhouse for a date.. She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.	ah you coudnt have been that frustrated! my gut always dies when u see someone eating outside today!!"
"Yes, she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!	What did you do after she realized it was your fault?"
"I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!	i know right! how long have you been on this island?"
"i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long... but i'm a mom so i don't sleep in. ever	Oh, well that's just the worst sometimes. I feel for you! You have to have a plot and then tell the kids what happened... and then have them do their part to keep the lights on."
"I had to cancel a trip to see my brother after it started snowing heavily.	well, why did you cancel?"
"Yes, when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous, and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.	I would be very nervous too. Driving in the winter is not fun."
"It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.	Wow! I'm glad you made it out safely. There's always a camera somewhere."
"When my parents got divorced when I was a kid, it was one of the hardest things for me.	Oh I'm sorry to hear that. How did it affect you?"
"It does definitely get easier over time I suppose.. Now that I see my life I guess it was for the best.	That's a wonderful thing to hear. You must have been very young when she left."
"Just the other day my girlfriend and I were getting ready for the beach, but right before we left it started to pour rain.	Oh no! It's the other way around, right?"
"Well, when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!	Wow! That's a nice distance! I hope next time we go."
"There was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family.	That made me feel jealous, how did it go?"
"Yes, the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.	I assume you were very surprised. It's always nice when you have a surprise party."
"There was this one time I stole a shirt from my friend, and I feel pretty guilty about it.	Why did you steal it then?"
"Because I really liked it, and didn't think he'd care.	Ooh, well the cat really liked it, so it seems you got the promotion on film. Congrats!"
"My girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week, I was very lonely during this experience.	Did you make any friends?"
"I mainly just played video games and watched tv.	Video games are so relaxing do you plan to go on vacation anytime soon?"
"I moved to a new apartment and they didn't accept my dog breed, so I had to give her up. :(	Oh no! That's so sad. I'm sorry I can't help you."
"Because here in my area in Florida, there isn't too many options for me.	That's a shame. I have a friend who has a college in Baltimore that has a lot of options."
"My mom doesn't have a ton of money, but last christmas she made sure to get me some awesome things!	That's very thoughtful of her!"
"She got me a brand new laptop I had been wanting for gaming!	That's a great gift"
"I went on this ride at the beach called the Slingshot.. It shoots you super high up in the air.. It was so teriffying, I had so much faith in the ride I wouldn't die!	Wow, that sounds amazing! I would be really scared if I rode it too"
"It was seriously so scary, I almost pooped myself!	mia, you are lucky you are not deaf!"
"There was this time I went to the bar with my girlfriend and once I came out of the restroom, I saw her talking to some guy!	what did do??"
"Well I get super jealous and angry of course.. But in the end it was just a work friend.. Oops!	Oh that would make me angry too! Well you should tell him that - it is no good if he does not believe you!"
"My dog randomly got up on my couch last week, and just started peeing.. Like what!?!?!??!?!	oh my god, that's funny. what did you do?"
"Not since lunch, so it's actually been about 4 hours.. I hate living on the top floor!	You deserve a raise, raise you do what?"
"I finally graduated college last year, it felt like it took SO long!	Woo hoo! That is a great feeling!"
"Yes, I am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!	Good luck!"
"My girlfriend saw me kissing another girl, who was kissing ME at the bar.. I was very drunk..	Oh my! I am sorry to hear that. Did the girl want to go on their dates?"
"No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.	I always like to remind myself to take the long view on things like that."
"There was this one time I was driving down the road, and this guy on a sports bike popped a wheelie.. It was so sick!	Wow, that is nasty! You must have screeched and cried!"
"I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!	I know its probably way to late but I think you should try it"
"When i was younger, I came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead.	That is so sad. What did you do after finding your pet dead?"
"He was very old, so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!	oh thats sweet"
"My dog chewed a hole in my carpet 2 weeks ago.. I was very disgusted to say the least!	Oh no! Is it a dog or possibly cats?"
"Oh dang, I guess I can't complain too much then, that's brutal!	Yes, that's true! I have never once watched a hazing incident on camera."
"I have to go to confession at the church... i was a little mean to my mom, sometimes its difficult to be always nice	I completely understand. It's a very emotional time for many people."
"Well yes when i shouted and i inmeaditelly apologize but i feel really bad	Just be sure to write down what you did that makes up for it."
"We walked, we ate ice cream, we rode a bike, we laughed a lot, we enjoyed the outdoors, we were exhausted	That sounds really great! I can imagine it was really enjoyable!"
"I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul	Oh, no! Time that you didn't use?"
"Sometimes one gives priority to work	The world is very beautiful	It is. But we do have to face some problems."
"Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice	I think a lot of people miss out on all the great natural beauty that is available to them because they don't seem to care much about resources used for human consumption."
"People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life	I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.	its a trap everyone makes, thats why its hard to change someone's opinions. you can't trust anyone"
"Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself, is it?	No, it is not fair in a healthy way, but it is totally fair in a unhealthy way. Just keep at it and don't even think about the unhealthy way it comes into your life."
"As a kid, I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.	tornadoes are definitely terrifying i grew up in texas and we had some as well"
"That's the thing -- NO! I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!	Sometimes you just have to ""grow up"" and realize that things you used to fantasize about don't make any sense to someone you were ""able"" to provide a basement for. I hope you get that new idea that's ""right"" for you!"
"My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said ""You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that."" For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)	That is so wonderful and worrying about the future is good :)"
"I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated, really.	I remember those days were tough. There was never a time to get back out in the sun."
"Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.	That's a good way to go about it I think."
"I do look at that as a strength, in anyone. Being able to say ""I'm sorry"" and ""I made a mistake.""	I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!	That is great! Where did you guys moving to?"
"I highly, highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.	Thanks, I'll get on that as soon as I can, the issue of culture shock is very real. I was raised in Europe, so I always had my eye out for an opportunity like that."
"i would fear my gift	What gift did you receive?"
"my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me	An awesome an phone! I bet that was a lot of money!"
"yes but its a valuable gift to me	Yes. What is the reason you're giving it back to you?"
"yeah but this gift is definitely different for me	I have such an amazing husband! He works so hard so i could stay home with our baby	Oh! That's such a great thing! I hope you're able to keep the baby during this time! You sound blessed."
"he is an armed guard	Oh wow, that's not good. What has he done?"
"I have a pretty bad vision so i'm so scared to drive at night	Oh no, any specific reason that you're scared of driving at night?"
"yes, i even have glasses but because of astigmatism i don't see good at night even when i have glasses on	That is a bummer. Have you thought about getting one of those portable, flat screen computers?"
"It seems like today everyone in the grocery store was in such a rush. Hurrying around!	i know, its the fastest growing way to go about life these days."
"Yes! They cut in front, and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it	I would ask them to stop, but at that point you just hope they will get the message and stop."
"I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible	Well, you should just abandon the baby and adopt an adult if you don't like them."
"i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible	yes it's horrible!"
"I love being around them and it's great to see them each year.	It's lovely to have your back. Have you been around them long?"
"O I'm sorry, my niece and nephews, only seem in the summer. Do you get company during the summer?	No, we get supervised by my husband and we ride bikes or skateboards in the summer. So, I can barely go to the beach! :( Do you ever ride a bike in the summer? I wish I could get outdoors and do that!"
"My kids are going into 7th and 8th grade in a couple weeks. They really are growing up well	thats awesome that they are learning so fast"
"My oldest daughter has some learning disabilities so I'm really proud of how she is doing. They're both growing up so fast	That's awesome that you are proud of their progress. I have a daughter who has Asperger's and uses a a a Spelling Bee occasionally."
"i paid all my bills today, i feel so relived and good	That's great! It's the attitude of, ""Well, at least it was done today!"""
"rent and electricity. we've been struggling financially so it's such a relieve to pay bills	I can't even imagine paying so much rent! Congrats in a lump sum!"
"I studied so hard for my bar exam so that I could become a lawyer. I prepared for almost 3 months straight!	What was the exam for?"
"I did pass! It was a rough 3 months, but once I got there, I felt like I was ready.	That's great! I have been there. Did you get a promotion?"
"I was about to book a flight for my baby and i and i was so surprised to find out i didn't need to pay for my baby'sticket	Oh wow! That's not always the case. I just had a surprise for that, too. Did you know they had other options if you didn't?"
"i know! now i can spend the rest of the money on something cool	yo hopefully you will have another chance at it"
"my husband called me a punk today for no reason. and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn't even understand why	now that is a strong word, but i can't imagine him not understanding the word meaning"
"no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes	identical in every way except personality"
"When I was younger, I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive, because i didn't want to get into an accident.	Oh no, how did it go?"
"I tried to tell myself that, but my dad got into a really bad accident once, and it has scared me ever since.	That is happening too. Dad-less are more often than not, and they do not get to make all the calls. They need someone to lean on when they need to lean on"
"I recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches.	oh that sounds fun"
"Yea, i put them in a glass of water for a week or two and they grow their own roots, wasn't expecting much.	Nice. They really are resilient."
"I do yes! and since the method i used is working, i have tons of tomatoes!	That's sounds great!"
"Around town it seems like traffic has been horrible lately. Driving around town is just crazy.	uh, what about you? You in town?"
"Yes, exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!	I don't have any but I would be mad if I had to deal with them. They should be more ashamed of themselves!"
"A few years ago, I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other, so we met up in person!	that is so cool, how did that work for you"
"I'd say it's going pretty well, we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?	By meeting a neighbor! Or maybe you and someone you knew crossed paths at a bar? I bet that would give you a little bit of chills!"
"OKay. I care for everyone	That is great. Good job."
"Thanks, I hope I am. You sound like one too	Crescent"
"because you gave me a compliment, which I feel is a genuine one	I recently had a one night stand with a woman from my past. It caught both of us off guard	ohh, wow. That's interesting."
"Yes, it was a very interesting time. I wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations	Well that's good. You can still have communication with her."
"My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!	aww that's pretty cool. I'm actually in one now but I want to go to college myself."
"She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.	I agree. It's a shame that some people can not only find success, but also live successful lives only through degrees."
"I walked my dog outside, and she still pooped in the house! Ugh.	She's a dog, you know. Maybe your dog hasn't had enough exercise or food in the day or something."
"Yeah...Even though I take her outside, 10 minutes later, she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?	hahaha you probably did it on purpose"
"I think being with my husband makes me a better person	Aw, that's a good thing! Makes sure you don't stray far from the right path."
"Definetly, he's my best friend forever.	That's something I hope you can carry on forever."
"I really don't like when things happen when noone is home.	I am sorry to hear that! I have felt that way before."
"Like stuff falling off shelfes because a dog runs into them! Hah, crazy I know.	Yeah, no doubt, poor pupper."
"I really love my life right now.	That's wonderful to hear!"
"Nothing really! I just love that I can work at home and have time to clean or cook whenever I want.	Well that's wonderful then! I wish you much success at this new vocation!"
"Right? And no having to interact with others unless we choose too.	I prefer it that way"
"So i just got home and all of my friends were there for a birthday party i have no clue! can you imagine my reaction?	What happened?"
"Well the party was for me, hahaha they really got me on that one!	Well happy celebrating with your friends!"
"Its not fun being reminded of things you've forgotten.	yeah that's part of being human. it's part of life and part of learning."
"Owed money to my mother in law for something, $15, she reminded me in a less then nice way.	Oh.. $15? That's a pretty significant amount of money."
"Exactly, especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.	I went to San Antonio the other day, was great to see that city.	I love Texas, what did you do there?"
"O really? What's your favorite thing there?	My favorite thing there is the dog park with the turtles and bugs."
"I just got back from my graduation! can you imagine after 5 years i graduated with the highest score of my college in the past 20 years!	Wow, congratulations! What a wonderful day for you and your friends! I hope you have a wonderful career ahead to which you all trained and prepared yourself."
"Yes! i studied so hard, can you imagine how i feel? i cannot believe it!	I'm glad You'll get another shot at this, good luck!"
"I hate the sight of someone throwing up. My nephew did that the other and day and man.	Oh wow, thats nasty! I've known adults that do that! I would get him to the doctor and get him on vino!"
"Yea, he had eaten to much sugar and well, it didn't end well	That's too bad. What kind of sugar was it?"
"I came home from work and step barefoot on one of my sons legos, i was so pissed!	aha, that isn't something I ever thought would happen in this part of the world! Sick!"
"Yes, i was so mad i always tell them to pick the toys up.	Did you get your money back?"
"My mother in law got to eat Qdoba today, one of my favorite places I haven't had in awhile	He must like Mexican food!"
"No way. queso all the way! They don't have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did.	Ah, well I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been a very expensive mistake."
"Yesterday i watch on tv a kid who could speak 4 different languages at age 3, i was in shook!	That is so cool! I think kids these days are always amazed by what other people can do."
"Well they are called wonder kids! i was in wonder, i also read about one who just graduated from college at age 11	Oh, wow. I bet that will help you when you get older. Congratulations on that. That's a very tough area to deal with but worth it in the end."
"My husband is quite impressive to me.	Oh wow, how interesting. What makes you say that?"
"Yea, he's become the best manager in his market in just 3 years.	That's really good. Is the job being filled by someone else?"
"This afternoon i went to my sons soccer game and he scored three goals! happiest dad ever!	You must be a great parent! I am a soccer mom, but I do not play the game."
"Yes! i love him so dad, but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play, he dedicated the three goals to me!	hahaha, you must have some great teachers, who's the older one?"
"I was doing a presentation for work, and tried to tell a story about something kind of related to break the ice.  No one laughed or even really cracked a smile, so it put me off for the rest of the presentation.	I'm glad you have that confidence in yourself. Sometimes the best way to get people to laugh is to surprise them!"
"Yeah, and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking, but at least should have gotten a chuckle.	Ground breaking is a funny thing, I got a few thousand though from Groundhog day."
"My wife went to Germany to attend a language course at the end of June.  I've been mostly spending time with my dogs while she's been gone since we recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	Do you guys write a lot together, or does she only write for a few employers?"
"That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me, I should look into that.	That would be a wonderful idea! I'm sure you are knowledgeable. I'd love to be able to help you with that!"
"Something I did not expect from a neighbor, this morning he gave me some beautiful flowers	Oh, that's very sweet. How did he do that?"
"It was a nice gesture on his part. But I do not know	Yeah, I really hope that the IRS does not take advantage of that and that you get on your feet soon after paying your back."
"But beyond that. Small gestures make others' lives happier	My neighbor has a really annoying little dog that she always brings outside when she's smoking.  It barks constantly at everything and she doesn't try to keep it quiet.	That does sound annoying. Has it barked at you yet, ma'am?"
"A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically, but this one is just terrible.	Awww I feel bad for the poor pupper!"
"This morning my husband received a call, he got nervous, I think it was a woman ... difficult	Aww, that's a little strange. Could be a man trying to reassure her... or it could be something more."
"I think so ... I'm a little worried, because of the situation	That's understandable. What's the problem?"
"Thank you for your solidarity	I have a great picture from my wedding where my friends and I are in a circle having a shot, makes me want to go hang out with them again.	That's funny. I've never been a huge basketball fan but I definitely know where this is going."
"Yeah, we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to Graduate school.	Oh. She could be studying now if you guys were able to patch things up"
"Yesterday, a difficult day, the anniversary of the death of my mother	I am so sorry to hear that. How did she die?"
"Thank you for your solidarity	You are welcome home."
"seven years .... I miss her	I went for an interview for a job I really wanted and ended up waiting a long time before I heard anything.  I managed to keep my spirits up for a good long while.	It's always tough waiting, but do yourself a favor and go to Vallino to do it this weekend! You'll have the support of your family and friends along for the ride. You can do it!"
"I did actually!  It's a good job, especially since the market where I am isn't great for my field.	That's good to hear. You can only get so big in glass towers."
"My daughter is angry with me, she says she does not need me, because I scolded her	Oh no! I'm sorry, is she allowed to say that?"
"She is 9 years old but she is a very focused girl	That is very exciting for sure"
"that's right ... but I think I've surpassed	Hello, tomorrow I have the cooking test and I feel safe. I am sure that I will approve with an excellent rating	That's great! That means you trust me completely with the safety of your baby. I love when mothers are that confident."
"have my own restaurant	That sounds like a lot of fun! What kind of food do you serve?"
"with work, effort and clarity in the goal ... I will surely arrive	I'm so happy i made enough money yesterday to pay my bills!	Oh, you made a plan?"
"yes, such a relieve!	I know the feeling. Work all day and not get to enjoy any time too much."
"Sometimes we have angels, called friends, I'm happy because God sent me mine	God is always faithful, that's amazing I'm happy for you"
"We are 12 years old, but we have had difficult moments, but we have overcome it	That is a great outlook to have... although we all have had our bumps in the road!"
"That's right ... I'm happy	my son behaved badly with his friend, I treat him badly, I had to punish him	Ah, that's too bad. What happened?"
"He is 12 years old, but he must understand that friendship is something sacred	I'm impressed he trusts you like that."
"he hit him and said a bad word	When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. It was so fucking annoying	Aw man, I know how that is for a reason. It's like you were out of the room when he did it, bro. I'm sorry you're sad."
"I do my best but sometimes that's super hard. I guess that's just one of those things everyone got to deal with.	It is a really hard thing to go through. I really hope that you will get a second chance and be successful."
"You too, thank you!	I went to a job interview a few days ago, and I feel like I totally rocked it!	how come?"
"Thanks a bunch! It pays much better than my current job, so I really hope I do, but I think I got it in the bag.	Yeah, its always nice to get what you've got when you get a promotion."
"I went through some of my old stuff yesterday, and I found my security blanket that I used when I was a kid!	i used to play with such a young i couldnt even imagine how kids feel"
"It really did. It kinda made me sad, because it was all tattered and dirty. I ended up washing it.	That is so sad, I am sorry for that"
"You know, I see all the back to school shopping and I think parents have their priorities mixed up.	Yeah, I have mixed feelings about that."
"Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor.	I completely understand. I have kids of my own and under armor is a big no no."
"I found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road, and I nursed him back to full health. Poor thing.	That's amazing! Was the kitten your cat or did you foster him?"
"I did! His name is Alphy.	Sounds like a big baby! I'm sure he'll be around forever."
"It's hard as a parent, when your kids are teenagers and have to handle their own problems	I think it is when my kids are teenagers that it starts to slip away. Just try to keep a cool head and remind them of what not to do when they get into trouble. It's not easy, but it will gradually get better!"
"I know, they mommy in me wants to just jump in and fix it all like I used to	but you are right, it is very important to bond with your kids these days and it will be for a long time"
"My wife called me this morning and told me she scored a new job with Microsoft!	That is awesome. I don't know about you, but I have been in a few different tech companies."
"She is so excited. She's even making more than I am.	that is good. i hope she stays for a long time"
"I felt bad my dogs ears have been bothering him. We had to finally take him to the vet yesterday.	Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened to you dog! I took his insurance policy, but it's totally rip to get him another dog"
"Yeah, it was ear mites and he got medicine for it. You can tell he isn't feeling good from side effects so I've been babying him.	Side effects can be interesting. I had a patient who had one of those and it was terrifying. She was always in a bad dream state, couldn't sleep, and had horrible body memories. It was terrifying!"
"I bought a chocolate bar for my wife at the store, and I was going to give it to her, but I ended up eating it...I feel bad.	You shouldnt have. You cant do that to a friend."
"lol I didn't tell her...Should i?	sure, you should of also told her, you are the father of her i believe"
"Don't you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn't do? My boss got mad at me for someone else's mistake.	Oh no! That's terrible. What happened?"
"Yeah, that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.	I bet! Hopefully you learned that it's okay to have different take on things. It's in your head."
"I'm taking a vacation and going on a cruise to Alaska next week!	Wow, so far away! I'm jealous! Have fun!"
"I've never been, so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.	That's no fun! There's nothing to be scared about. We've all been there!"
"Hello, I think I will not forget the beauty of her hair, the sweetness of her lips and the clarity of her eyes	That is very true, and I think everyone can relate to that"
"she died ... my mother	That is terrible, I am so sorry"
"It is true...	Hello, I never imagined the violence that can unleash a dog attacking a bird ... I was impressed	Oh wow, a military type of dog wouldn't be surprised."
"in a big dog ... in the park	That is scary! I would be scared too!"
"I did not have the strength to control it	My poor neighboor is suffeing a lot without her husband	That's too bad. At least she has you to help her through this difficult time."
"He passed away from cancer.	Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that."
"I enjoyed my day the other day, found out something good! Newphew may come to live with us for ayear.	Oh happy for you! I'm happy for you too!"
"11, he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.	wow, thats a long time. you should tell him no10"
"I lost something of my mother in laws the other day, I feel so bad.	Oh no! That is such a shame. What did you lose?"
"I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear, it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!	That is a good idea. Perhaps she can borrow your sweater for a couple of nights?"
"I may do that!	I was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award	Yeah, that's always a weird thing. I'm guessing it was for your work on the game?"
"Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for	Wow, that's awesome. I bet you worked really hard. I also highly recommend your work."
"I appreciate that. Thank you	Wow! Congrats on your new job! I can understand why you are apprehensive, but it sounds like a good opportunity.	Congratulations. I am very proud of you. Excellent."
"No problem! Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.	That is good. I am glad there is no problem."
"I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!	of course i know how you feel"
"I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?	Oh yes, and yes it is, but it is by far the easier process. You have more time to prepare"
"It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!	I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.	Some don't care if their kid is sick. They will donate nutrients even if you have to feed them."
"It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.	I wonder what that woman looked like to someone who doesn't look like that. Embarrasses you, but it's also fun."
"I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.	I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever thought about setting up a system to have people whisper at you?"
"Well, for the most part it's my family. My husband, kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!	That's a tough situation to be in. I hope it all works out for the best."
"My daughter is a teenager now so we don't spend as much time together as we used to.	I am sorry. At what age do you think your daughter will be able to have children?"
"Yeah, luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I'm really looking forward to this trip I have planned next week.	Where are you going?"
"I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.	Oh wow! That sounds really exciting!"
"I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend, and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.	Roll in the dirt? That's not safe for a bath."
"It WAS. Since she was wet, the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.	I am so sorry that happened to you!"
"Been having a good day, relaxing on my couch watching Netflix. I got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap.	That is nice of your cat, does he do that a lot?"
"Yeah, it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.	good times"
"I had a job interview yesterday. I was really nervous before it started.	You must've been really nervous to even do this. Is it what you wanted to do?"
"It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room, then we took a lab tour afterwards.	That sounds like a real neat and tidy job. You guys must have spent a lot of time preparing."
"i am very faithful	thats good"
"yes my behavior refereed to people	Well, that's something. Coyote or human?"
"thank you	I hope you get married!"
"nothing	What a bummer! Sorry to hear that."
"thank you	I hope you get married!"
"nothing	well that is good, congratulations!"
"i am going to garden	I don't plant gardens. Too busy picking weeds."
"thank you	I hope you get married!"
"It was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake	what did you do?"
"placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it, so they gave me something else without telling me	what did they give you? tell me...did you get a refund?"
"Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen	I hope so too, hopefully this is the beginning of a better city for you."
"I really was distraught	I can understand that. What happened?"
"yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok	I can relate I have two sisters and a brother and it makes me uneasy as well. I don't like feeling as though I'm the only being in the world."
"it made me proud he was my rep	is your dad a police officer?"
"the president represented us at this association	What was the association's last meeting about?"
"International Ceramic trading	It has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation. No one to talk to.	Do you have a lot of unanswered phone calls?"
"I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.	Oh, no. I thought you said no one was close to you."
"I can't wait to travel south to get my favorite take out. Can't find it here.	you need to look for a restaurant that specialis in your town"
"About an hour. But it'll be worth it.	Fingers crossed! Applause when you win!"
"I'm quite happy with where I live. I have 3 swimming pools to use anytime I want and also a gym.	That's pretty nice. Do you have a lawn?"
"Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.	I hope you have a great retirement ahead!"
"I have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing.	He must be very excited to do that."
"It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up, go to work, etc. but I was wrong about that!	Did you catch up on your life at home?"
"Yes, last week. Thank you!	It was a long 3 weeks but I'm so happy it's over and she's back now	I'm sure you are both relieved."
"She went to visit her family	That's great! How is your sister now?"
"It was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother	I am so sorry to hear that!"
"Thank you for your solidarity	I am glad to hear that."
"thanks	We knew she was pregnant, but didn't know the gender yet. Imagine my shock when I saw the ultrasound for the gender!	aww that is so great. I had never even realized we even had a gender anymore!"
"Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met	Wellfa like i, you are lucky."
"Even though there are plenty of flirts around, I remain loyal to my wife.	awww, what a weird relationship. Maybe its time to find a new wife."
"It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one, which was 5 years ago now.	You have a great mom! I'm sure you have learned a lot about each other as you've gotten older!"
"My friend got a new truck, I'm really envious of him.	ohh don't worry, there's plenty of other people out there who would love a new truck!"
"I agree, if I work hard I could buy that truck.	That's a great attitude. I wish you the best of luck."
"I should, I just need the drive to get out there and do it. I need to stop wasting money.	Hello, I feel that today is going to be a wonderful day .... I will enjoy it	Happy Birthday! It's always good to see those emotions in someone."
"If I really like to be positive, despite the difficulties	It's OK to face difficulties in life. We all have them."
"so it is ... a big hug	I have been looking after my wife this week. She has the flu	Thats awesome of you, have you taught her how to use a machine?"
"It seems so. Sleeping all day today lol	That's how I like it though, to relax."
"This morning and I saw a tree, I never detailed it, but this time I saw it beautiful ... I realized God exists	That's so awesome. I've been searching for a tree in my backyard and I just think God doesn't exist. There's so much weirdness in the universe."
"I gave thanks in spite of the difficulties	That's great! I always try to do that when I feel like I'm going to lose everything."
"thank you for your comments	Today I realized that my daughter sings wonderful, I enjoy it a lot ... I was impressed	oh wow i am also a singer, i can also dance"
"she is 9 years old ... she is a nice girl	Wow, you really shouldn't be ashamed of your age, that would be a waste of time and energy"
"that's right ... thanks for your comment	Hi, I feel bad because I've realized that I do not love my husband, but I do not have the courage to tell him	Well, you have to love your husband in this situation. You don't even have to like him."
"You're right	A little precaution is all you need, I hope nothing bad happens!"
"thanks	I'm looking for a new job, and I'm feeling pretty good about my options.	Are you nervous about whether or not you get the job?"
"There's a lot of openings for tech jobs lately, especially technical support.	Is there any way to get a good tech support job?"
"My wife just went out of town for school for 2 months.  I don't really know anyone here, so I don't know what I'm going to do while she's gone.	I guess the most important thing is that you both get enough sleep."
"I'm sure it is great for her, but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.	I understand that"
"Hello, I made a serious mistake. I made a comment without bad intentions of the elders. I related them to the dinosaurs, and my father heard it ... he looked me in the eyes ... and he told me that you too could be one of them ... I felt bad	ohh true, but as long as you keep to the spirit it should not be a problem, are you happy about it?"
"yes, but I feel like a cockroach	You may want to put straw in the toilet bowl."
"thanks	I'm supposed to be on a diet, but I couldn't help myself and I ate three chocolate bars.	I love chocolate, what kind of chocolate bar was it?"
"But I'm supposed to be on a diet! I can't lose weight if I have no self control :(	oh i know what you mean"
"my husband lost his job a couple of months ago and yesterday he finally got a new job!!	Oh, wow. It's great to hear that things are moving in his favor. Good for you, husband!"
"He is such a hard working man! He works so much so i could stay home with our baby	i hope he finds something that will make him feel loved"
"I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.	OMG. I bet that was so frustrating."
"Ugh, that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.	That's good! What color is the car?"
"I lost my favorite hoodie somewhere. I'm so upset. Like how could i lose a hoodie? it's so big, did i just leave it somewhere?	oh no that's horrible! are you thinking about trying to find it?"
"I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it	oh yea i can understand that"
"I'm going to see my parents in 3 weeks!! I didn't see them since 2014! I'm so excited	hachi means ""great"" in hirinese"
"no, with my little baby. they've never met my son, they can't wait	That's so cool! Is this their first child?"
"My wife had been out of the country for 2 months for school.  I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.	Was she very excited to see you?"
"Yeah, it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	I hope it gets better for you."
"I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.	I'm sorry, are you alone?"
"No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.	That's absurd! They should be the one to fix it not you."
"Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!	my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing	)"
"she did, she didn't say anything but i know she heard it	I am glad you won't have to say anything again."
"My girlfriend went on a week trip with her friends, and left me alone to fend for myself.	That sounds lonely. Did you do anything to relieve the stress?"
"Mostly been playing video games, but it's so boring without her.	I'm sorry you don't have a girlfriend, you should look one soon!"
"Hello ... I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not, the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth	Internal growth, that sounds right. Are you going to be a better person then?"
"For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it	I'm sure it was a difficult process for you but it paid off!"
"for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible	That is true. You have to make the best of the situation."
"condition the mind and spirit	Thats what we do. Enjoy our moments and remember all the good times."
"I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.	I am so sorry to hear that.It is so hard to lose loved ones that have such a part in your life."
"yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort	That's what family is for when you can't be with them"
"I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some.	I had plans to move from Florida to California, but I'm starting to get cold feet...	Sorry to hear that. Why are you getting cold feet?"
"Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.	Oh no! I'm sorry. I was worried that you wouldn't be able to resist the taste of Nutella."
"today I think today is a day to learn, to hug, to smile, to make someone happy	Awww, I love learning things today. I always have to go back and learn things for myself. How sweet."
"that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that, to my children I kiss them, my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something	That's so sweet. It's great that you devote time to your family."
"It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile	I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends, no husband, no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life	i can understand that"
"not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward	social out"
"My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.  I can't wait to go pick her up at the airport!	I can understand your befrugalty, but I hope that you will have the patience to wait for her return with you."
"I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.	Yes, she said she wanted to do this for a long time. I hope it goes well and you have a great time on the date!"
"Germany for a language immersion course.	I am so thrilled to be able to go on a short but long overdue vacation	That's great! Where are you going?"
"A short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water.	Oh, that sounds amazing! How's Mother Nature?"
"Down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks. It is around the current river	I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.	oh damn.. i would have been extremely mad also, if they didnt have a problem with you guys meeting up at the last minute.  i would go ahead and get a catering company also if i ever meet with one"
"Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.	She must really like you because after the party was over, she would give me a big hug and said ""that was very nice of you""."
"I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.	The past is a funny thing. Did you enjoy it?"
"The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.	delivery girl is the worst, but delivery boy sounds worse still."
"Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.	how was your day?	It was great. I had a great run this past week. Found a new hobby?"
"yeah good. whats your name?	I'm named Alexa. I love talking to her."
"oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend	hello how was your day?	It was good. How long were you asleep for?"
"yeah fine great day	happy birthday! you must be excited to share this wonderful experience with your son"
"yeah nice to talk to you.	I wore wrong pair of socks to the college. But, no was there to spot it. But, when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes. At, that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes. They made a fun of me. That was very awkward situation.	Wow. I wonder how the college would react to that"
"My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.	I hate when that happens, even if it is a good meme. Some people are so into the sounds and visuals of a live concert that it can be overwhelming to maintain a clean and organized space."
"ohh	I went for a job interview, and it seemed to go pretty well.	That's good to hear. Did you get the job?"
"It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.	So far so good. I'm sure they will knock off at least one more before the summer is over."
"I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.	Oh, that sounds lonely. How did it go?"
"Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.	At least you seem to have figured out a way to get around it. I'm sure it'll work out for you one day!"
"I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.	How long did she have to fly for? Did you get a refund?"
"Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.  We just moved recently and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	Do you have a job hunting friend?"
"Germany for a language course.	I almost got in a fight in a drive-thru lineup.	Nah, those are kinda sad. How did the other guy fare?"
"No, the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.	Ah, so theres no problem then! I never argue with people, I just let it go"
"Yes, afterwards I regretted the confrontation.  I thought I could have easily been shot.	I got on a stranger's boat by accident at the marina.	oh no! I hope your nerves were relaxed and you were waving at the people on the boat!"
"Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off, but I sure felt stupid about it.	Yeah, I'm sure he didn't even notice! At least the cat felt bad about it, right?"
"Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.	I was looking at old pictures from my first ""adult"" apartment, and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates.	That's cool, what did you do?"
"It can, but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore, but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.	I can imagine. When I got hit, I thought I would never walk again. I was wrong."
"Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to. I was in a house full of people screaming and yelling.	That does sound stressful. Did you have a good time?"
"My friend and her mom were fighting about money, and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.	were they able to calm them down?"
"I hope so too. I plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this.	I had a job interview today and i think it really well.	oh yea im guessing u had a good time?"
"The interviewer told me that I was his favorite interview so far. And I think my qualifications are a really good match for the company.	I am sure the interviewer is going for your soul with those eyes. You will fit right in!"
"I saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so I called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog, but it turned out I was wrong.  Whoops.	oh no! sorry about that. did you apologize to the person?"
"Yeah, I don't like calling people out in general, don't know what made me think to do it this time.	Did you call him out on it?"
"I'm surprised the police are going to let they get away with it.	Yes. they don't take breaks as much. Accidents happen all the time"
"I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.	That's unfair, what orders do you have coming up?"
"My test results come back today. I do hope everythings ok.	how long did it take you to get in?"
"I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.	I am sorry to hear that, is there any chance of a cure in the works?"
"Absolutely! I'm just over-worrying because I've always been so healthy. Just a little stressed out.	I went back to my home where I grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me. I had so many fun times with my best friends when I was a child.	I bet it was a great time when you were a kid."
"Playing outside in the summer time. Many fun summer times. Swimming holes, icecream, catching fireflies.	i have never been out in the sun i stay indoors"
"Me too!	My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.	How much does it cost you?"
"Thanks, now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.	yea all the hard work they put in, it's almost always forgotten about"
"The more problems I have to deal with, the more faith, and faithful I become. I am stronger in my faith when bad things happen in my life and around me.	That's very true. It sounds like you have good people around you."
"I was told once by a dear departed friend that ""what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt.	That's a good thing! I hate insurance companies who skulk on us. We actually helped start the Alaska Airlines Healthy Lifestyle campaign back in the day."
"yeh to that	I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well, but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.	that isnt good, are you going to explain this to them?"
"I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.	It can happen sometimes to the unexpected. Just wait and it will come in stride"
"I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.	I definitely would, thank you for what you do."
"You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.	I am sure he did a good job."
"Okay, I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.	I just got a puppy, but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.	That would be a major sacrifice! But it is so rewarding to watch babies grow up, you should do the right thing and give him a loving home while you go back."
"Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.	That's a good idea! He will learn eventually."
"Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.	I completely agree"
"If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.	I agree. In those instances, it is best to speak to a police officer."
"My dog disappeared while I was away at college.	that is horrible, how did he get lost?"
"My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.	Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. That is such a shame."
"Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.	I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!	Wonderful! How long has it been since you've seen her? That is a very exciting time."
"Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby.	That is good that you are happy for her though. She is 6 months? You got this."
"Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors!	oh thats good"
"Oh cool! What kind of doctor?	Well, you've got to be careful, she could just get a different doctor and you'd be out of luck."
"Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.	Yea. She is very lucky to have a friend like you."
"My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.	That's amazing. Nursing is a tough trade."
"I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.	that is so sad"
"Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.	What made you think life could be worse?"
"A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.	Oh no! I hope it didn't spell disaster for ya"
"No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.	That's great! I'm glad it was just a trifle!"
"I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.	Oh yeah? Did they die a horrible death?"
"She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.	Oh, I didn't know she was that good! I'm glad you got to see her this year."
"Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.	Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!	I have had those feelings as well. The freedom to do what you want and the money to do what you love. I think we are all missing out on those moments if we are content to just stay at home."
"Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!	That's true. Mine was sunnier then too. mine was a 20's car with tinted windows"
"That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.	Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time, but now I worry that they will come back.	Oh no that's terrible. Did you catch them?"
"Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.	Oh, I am so sorry to hear that! Your apartment is probably a lot better now!"
"I woke up this morning, and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.	Wow, that's brutal! Were you out at the time?"
"I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.	ohh, that's bit scary. I hope it all turns out for good."
"I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well, but I guess not.	Oh no! That stinks. I am so sorry. Were you able to get it after all?"
"Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.	Well that's good. Sometimes you have to ""grow up"" and learn!"
"Last week, my pants fell down in gym class. The elastic strap holding them up broke.	Oh no! Were you able to free them? That can be embarrassing!"
"I ran out of the gym crying, and the whole class pointed and laughed.	Oh no! That's the worst, crying in class can get really bad."
"I love my cat, but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.	oh my gosh, is your nose so bad that it makes your cat itch?"
"She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles.	Must be some really disgusting things she does. I dont think people should be shamed for who they are."
"I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!	that's wonderful! so nice to hear"
"We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to, and we will be seeing the ocean as well!	That sounds like a lot of fun! When are you going?"
"I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.	Oh no! Did you have to call a cleaning service"
"Yes, it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.	I am sorry you have to deal with that!"
"I won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy, proud	Awesome. What was the prize?"
"It was for a chess competition.	Oh wow, you must be pretty good at the game. Why did you get the part?"
"They gave a cash money of 200$. Isn't that cool? Have you won any?	I have a coworker that will not stop talking. He mostly talks about himself	That is interesting. What does he normally talk about?"
"Yes, it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people, but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.	That is my biggest pet peeve! I am not a very nice person after all!"
"I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.	You must be my roommate, lol. I'm guessing you don't live with me anymore?"
"Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be, so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting, I guess.	Was it a high hopes thing or did you lower your expectations?"
"I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around, and people laughed at me.	Oh no! Are you hurt?"
"That is good advice. I feel better about this.	it's good to find people who like you. you're lucky to have that"
"I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.	thats nice to hear, is she busy?"
"It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week, not 20 years ago.	Wow that's so sad. I'm glad you had such a good time."
"I just saw the craziest thing! A baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!	Ooo, that is so funny! I guess it was not unusual then"
"She couldn't have been older than one!	hahaha I bet she was scared"
"I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly, it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do, even though I put my best work and most effort into it.	That's unfortunate. Is it something that you would ever want to talk about?"
"It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.	That's great that you have such a great group of people around you!"
"That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!	I'm worried that if my Aunt doesn't answer her phone, I won't be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend.	That would be a very interesting situation to be in, and I'm sure you'll be able to work it out with her. If you don't want to risk it, you can also tell her the keys to the house are with you, and that you won't go back and ask her."
"Yes, I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.	Aw, that's too bad. What do they match up too well?"
"I am always suffering due to lack of money and I wish I could be rich someday	You could be any rich person out there"
"That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks	Yeah, you are so vigilant. You should try that when her back is turned."
"ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair	Yea thathess getting on so fastirish,ust be unfair to the many that have worked so hard to get here."
"That is so true. But to lead a happy life, money is necessary to some extent.	I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.	I'm sorry to hear that. How are you holding up?"
"Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere.	Mine sites can be scary, mine lining sites are even scarier. We bought our house there!"
"I feel sorry for me too!	Just cherish on time for your teacher and everything will be fine!"
"They are very helpful and I always will be faithful to them	That is good. If they are being helpful to you, then you should be loyal to them."
"Yes, what about you? Do you feel likewise?	I do hope that things will get better for you."
"Do you follow any particular denomination?	I'm so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend. I was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up	that's great you have that good friend"
"yes, and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money	It is always nice to have someone in your life that you can count on. I hope you are better now!"
"I saw this kid on a skateboard the other day.  I thought he was gonna wipe out hard, but he pulled off some kind of multi-flip jump thing that really shocked me.	That is impressive! How far away was he from you?"
"I know, right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid, made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line, never managed to do anything else.	Good for you. Are you doing well in life now?"
"I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!	That is so nice of you, I'm proud of your ability to parent."
"I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them	Yeah, that's good to hear. Sometimes it's hard to judge other people when you're in the same situation as them."
"I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(	That is so sweet! I hope he is doing well!"
"I know he will, i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky	I am sure he will turn out to be a wonderful dad."
"I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.	That doesn't sound fun! Did you guys get in contact with the police? I've never had to deal with a crazy animal!!!"
"Yeah, I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one, but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.	That's good, it sounds like the smaller one is just really sweet."
"I just recently finished potty training my dog, that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.	Has your dog trained to do that?"
"I can imagine a rescue, generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get, can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!	Right on! I had a friend that got her puppy a couple of days ago. It's a rescue, but she was so sweet and sweet and sweet!"
"My dog started looking really sick and in pain, but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet, so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.	Oh, that's awful. That's heartbreaking. Are you going to get him fixed?"
"Yeah, he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing, but he got medicine and rest and is good now.	Oh, I see. Well he's feeling better and hopefully toasting you for it."
"I was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life. It was great . You ever have any of those moments?	I certainly haven't in a long time. There's always been something up in the air."
"I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?	I'm glad you love the little things! I know we can't control everything but trying could make a world of difference!"
"Oh I can agree with that completely!	I interviewed for a job a while back that I was waiting on hearing about.  I felt like it went well.	oh that's good, finally some good news after such a long wait!"
"A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!	That's exciting! A little anxiety is always good, but I'm positive you'll turn 25 this year! Best of luck!"
"Have you ever had to file for disability?	I have. It must be very stressful."
"I've had to recently. Its been really tough.	I'm so sorry! I know how you feel!"
"Do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?	Not really, they are pretty annoying though"
"My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first, but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.	I played that game when I was a child. It was okay."
"I've had to help take care of others before as well.	That's very nice of you. What kind of pets do you have?"
"Yeah, I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.	I am sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better soon."
"I failed my driving test twice, but I was really encouraged and did better the next time.	That's great! I'm sure you passed both times. Why did you fail?"
"I agree, I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.	Exactly, and you will end up with a great score."
"I once went a restaurant, and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen!	No way! I would have screamed! I don't understand how people love going to restaurants"
"I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out, how can a place like that operate!?	Well they obviously do. You should definitely make their job easier by making them call you when something like that happens."
"Do any of your kids play any sports?	Not that I'm aware of. I watch but I don't do much else."
"My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.	She's very fun! How old is she?"
"I was so late for work one day, I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!	Wow! That's a pretty bad predicament to be in! Were you able to walk out of the shower without putting on your pants, or were you still late?"
"I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on, I was so in shock, even the neighbors saw. It was bad.	did you tell them you gave them a beating?"
"I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.	i bet you were very annoyed about that."
"The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.	i agree. it's a shame that people can't be replaced quickly."
"I was so excited when I got my new puppy, it was awesome!	Aww, congrats? What kind of puppy was it?"
"I agree with you, the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions, positive ones of course!	I also cherish those moments, the joy of introducing a new member to a really great family."
"Those were simpler times, I wish I could go back and relive those days!	I know how you feel. I love memories like that."
"Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.	That is true for me. My kids were a bit younger."
"It was great, so much time running around outside without a care in the world.	I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child.	That must have made you feel so proud."
"My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest, was the one that released the most gas.	oh that's interesting, what did you do?"
"I'm sleep training my toddler, he never slept in his crib before. He is crying and it makes me feel so bad	Oh no! How old is he?"
"how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry	Im so sorry, yes that is breaking. I wish you all the best with your divison!"
"I just got back from my vacation. We stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there, it was so much fun! We really had a blast!	Nice, I love vacation time! I hope you had a lot of fun."
"It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years, due to personal reasons, so you can imagine how we felt when we went!	Wow that's awesome. You guys will always have those memories of you and each other."
"As I look at my 21 year old son, I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!	I was 22. My parents drove almost every weekend."
"Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.	Yes, it was so exciting. It is such a happy memory."
"I want to go on a vacation next month but now I cant.	That sucks, where are you going?"
"Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.	that sucks, well you can always have a late night together and be happy"
"My son is in his last year of college! We are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!	That's awesome! What makes you excited?"
"He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.	That's pretty awesome! what does he want to do Â®"
"We took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!	Nice! He must be feeling better than normal. He always seems to overthink things and doesn't know what to do next. I'm sure he's been having a lot of fun trying to figure things out right now."
"I hope so. Do you have any kids?	No, I don't. But I wish I did. Do you?"
"I went to the flea market last weekend!	Did you find anything interesting?"
"Well, kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies, haha.	Old Beanie Babies are so nostalgic. You're reminiscing back to childhood!"
"I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s.	I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.	ah must be a good child then hah"
"haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol	That's unfortunate we do that stuff to kids but it's good she wants more. Hopefully the money can be seen as a reward for her."
"My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!	Oh no! We all have had those moments! Is the baby okay?"
"It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.	I hope you got a good look at it before you left. You could tell it was OK."
"She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!	My mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital. I was so concerned, but she became better after a few days. Such a huge relief!	That's great to hear! I know how important food is to her."
"Thanks, she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it, so it could have been much, much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!	That is awful I am so sorry!"
"I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.	That's horrible, was the cat friendly?"
"The cat appeared very relaxed, but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.	That's so good to hear! Cats are some of the most compassionate creatures. I hope the trust grew into something great!"
"One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.	oh man, how terrifying that must have felt. i can imagine how you must have felt!"
"If that wasn't frightening enough, I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!	That is really scary! I am so sorry you had to go through that."
"I didn't force her into anything. She seemed to know what she was doing anyway	Oh that is good! I am glad it worked out well instead of a disaster!"
"I wish it never happened now.	yes exactly, put the blame on yourself"
"she was 8	Oh, wow! She's pretty young for adragon. That makes sense, but I guess all you can do is try to help her along"
"A little while ago, my friend went on another beach vacation. It was her 3rd one for the year. My family and I hadn't been on vacation for several years, due to issues beyond our control, so I begrudged her trip a bit.	Oh, wow. That's someones vacation. I'm sure it's a lot of fun."
"Yes, true, I know they tend to let bills go for things like that, which I don't do.	Yeah, put off on payments can become a burden."
"I am so happy it's a boy	Ah nice. Is this the first for your family?"
"He'll be here in about 3 months	You got this guy. He's going to start making money right out of prison."
"Hey, I just started the keto diet!	how is that for you? what are you eating?"
"It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first, but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.	I just got an iPhone and I already trying to read on the go. It's so convenient."
"Thank you, I wanted to be completely ready, so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.	Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy	Yes I think I would have went with his mother and his father and his aunt and his cousins and his nieces and his nephews and his uncles and his aunts and his cousins and his uncles and his aunts and his cousins and his cousins and his cousins and his nieces and his nephews and his nieces and his nieces and his nephews and"
"I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha	True, he's clearly a Silencer. But at least they have a bright future ahead of them if they continue to train and get good at hitting their gaps in the schedule"
"I just had my Sweet 16 party...	That's awesome. How old were you and what was the cake?"
"Well, about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...	Do you live with your mom anymore?"
"A BLUE one! I'm so devastated. I don't know what to do.	I recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out 6 years ago.	That's a big accomplishment! What made you want to study?"
"I was scared about it at first, but so far I have all A's. I must say, I'm proud of myself!	Congrats! Good luck this upcoming summer vacation!"
"Over the past year I've been on a weight loss journey of over 100 pounds.	Wow that is great! That is achieved over a diet, so you must have a lot of healthy stuff to lose that weight."
"As well as exercise and diet, by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.	Those are two things I've heard are hard to have in life. I hope you get them in life sooner than later!"
"I never liked milk growing up, because my family drank skim.	Oh. I was raised mostly beer. I don't like it because it is too sweet."
"Well, first I tried whole milk, and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk, and I like it!	2% is pretty good I believe. I also used heavy cream in place of butter."
"I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.	I am happy for you"
"No, but I am satisfied with my choice.	I am so glad! I am sure pizza is a great food and you deserve to be."
"I just got back from our vacation, but the drive there was so nerve wracking. There was heavy rain and traffic, and some nighttime driving. Had me on edge	There's always the next adventure. But, I'm anxious to get back to earth."
"Yes, well, it was just one of those things I know, but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.	Thank goodness it wasn't more serious, I hope it wasn't too bad."
"Recently, I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.	oh no, that's bad. how long has it been since you last spoke to him?"
"It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.	I hope it works out for him and you"
"On my recent vacation to Florida, there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving! It was such a hassle!	Oh that's annoying! Did you make it out of it without any regrets?"
"I wanted to pull my hair out lol. But, knew once we were past it, there was the beautiful ocean on the other side...finally!	See, it's such a beautiful thing when we can separate the wheat from the chaff and realize that the difference is very real. Makes dealing with people much easier!"
"Robby got me flowers today.	Oh, that's so nice of him!"
"Yes, how could you forget? It was a nice surprise, but then he said.. ""happy anniversary.""	Oh. Does he still cheat?"
"Thanks, but I'm so embarrassed that I forgot!! D;	dad caught me kissing my half aunt	Oh no! That is terrible! Did you break up with her?"
"I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her	Oh god. I was about to say the same thing. I guess all you can do is just hit them a few times and hope they don't land another blow. But better safe than sorry!"
"Me found cave.	Did you enjoy it at least?"
"Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.	Wow, I think that story is true. Wow! I am truly a sorry person."
"Me miss BC. Me miss wife.	One of the scariest, yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that I was going to have a baby.	Oh i bet! It must have been so scary and exciting!"
"Oh, we were totally unprepared. In fact, my partner and I were working out of state in a compromising environment. We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!	Oh yeah I can imagineans. That is to good to hear! I hope there was no surprises missed!"
"When I was pregnant, I felt ill until it was over. The doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby.	What happened to you?"
"Usually the sickness stops within the first few months, so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all, I had a healthy, bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.	I'm glad you survived and am glad your future looks bright."
"When my dog passed away, I felt so helpless. She was old and suffering and I felt angry that there was nothing I could do other than put her down.	I can't imagine what you must have felt like thinking that thinking. It's very hard to lose a pet."
"She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough, I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.	i hope you have memories of her"
"I had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him	I do not like to sit in the front with my wife. It gets uncomfortable."
"I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted	OK, now I understand. You probably wanted her not because you were desperate, but because she wanted you. I hope you find someone more deserving of your love!"
"My son is in college and about to return for his Junior year. We have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs.	Dang, that's quite generous of you! There's a whole world of difference between being able to do that and them taking advantage of you. I'm sure that your son will appreciate that!"
"We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!	Absolutely! I'm glad you feel you weren't let down! I'm always happy to help as much or even more."
"After a long few months of being a hermit, I went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!	Are you going to stay at the shelter?"
"It was definitely exciting for me! I haven't been able to play with a dog since my own passed away.	I had a rescue dog called ""Tootsie Rolls"" when she was young. I miss those soft, cuddly snouts."
"I've been feeling a bit blue and overwhelmed lately.	Why is that?"
"I could definitely use one! However, I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!	I am sure you will be able to enjoy your little friend very soon!"
"These days my skin has never looked better. My diet is good, my family life is good, I've got good grades. Life is good!	good vibes keep flowing in the good ole United States"
"Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water. It's amazing how much the little changes can impact.	I guess diet and water are not bad together!"
"I flew all the way to New York City to buy a designer dress for the prom.	oh wow! i was so excited for you. was it your first time flying all the way?"
"I am, thanks, but I wouldn't go there... Becky STILL managed to get the same dress as me! I am so mad!	Yikes! I would be too. I would have said so right then and there. I am sorry you are going through that."
"I just love playing retro games. Takes me back	Yeah! Are you a NES gamer?"
"Oh yeah? Cool. I like the old Sega Mega Drive games. The music is just classic on those games	Those games were definitely played when I was a child."
"One night, I was home alone, when suddenly, I heard a loud BANG!	I bet that was scary"
"It was a ghost! I ran into the kitchen to investigate, and I saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window.	WOW! That must have been scary for you! Can you feel your ghost?"
"Recently my daughter was voted 'Most Artistic' by her peers! She is so talented and we feel lucky to be her parents.	Wow that's great. I really wish my daughter would be talented like your son. How old is she?"
"Yes, she has a natural talent, but really puts much practice and time into it.	Even if you don't put in as much time as she suggests, you can still make a difference."
"what does that mean?	It means you are ready to go. That means you are awake and thinking ahead."
"this has obviously gone all wrong somewhere	Yeah, have you tried talking to your boss?"
"5	A year ago, I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.	Oh, that's so sad! Was the kitten okay?"
"I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat, Muffin.	Thank goodness she is yours again. How long did it last?"
"I'm proud that she traveled across the world all by herself. 2 big suitcases and all	That is an amazing accomplishment!"
"Wife. And she was 6 months pregnant to boot!	Did your friend get a little jealous and left you?"
"There was a storm the other day, close to our home. There was a tornado warning near it, so I was afraid and nervous!	Oh wow, that sounds scary! Have you actually gone to see it? I always fear going to see tornadoes, even watching youtube."
"Yes, it luckily passed our home, but you just never know!	I'm so glad it didn't affect you too much."
"My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend, I'm really happy for him. :)	that's awesome, congratulations to him, how long have you guys been together?"
"Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money, but still wanted her to have something nice.	Do you know what the ring symbolises?"
"I can't wait to get a new car soon	What kinda car?"
"I want a compact SUV, like maybe something like a Toyota RAV4	Those are great cars, always looks great in the road."
"not yet ready for the baby, need fix up his room	Oh okay. That makes sense. I like kids but I'm not ready for the baby. Maybe you should try and MOVE the baby to a different room."
"Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!	I'm sorry! I'm sure if you stayed with it a little longer it could be just a matter of time before you gave up."
"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	Oh okay, sorry to help him out, but I've never even heard of an A before either. Where did they get their information from, and how hard would it have been to check to see if they were shipping to your area?"
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	That does sound horrible. It's just the taxman coming after you. You should definitely expedite the situation"
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	Oh, that is not cheap! But surely it is good value?"
"It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it	Just talk to someone that you trust, you know?"
"Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired	Do you think you will enjoy it?"
"It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again	I'm saving up for my own apartment now!"
"For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies	So, were you promised your own place?"
"Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!	Oh I'm sorry, did you guys have a fight?"
"At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently	MUCH BETTER! She is a lucky lady! I am sure you will both come around to liking it again."
"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special	Did you later find out that she had an affair on yours brother"
"I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant	Your babygirl will be great. be careful."
"Yes. It's a boy	Are you excited about it?"
"My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business.	That's unfortunate. What did you do?"
"I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.	Sounds like a stressful day. Did you find another job?"
"I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him	That would be nice."
"In the club	Do you like to socialize with your friends?"
"I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to	Oh yes, so you feel bad for her? Yes, you are a good boyfriend and will do whatever is necessary to support your wife."
"She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew	Smart move by you."
"I know I will save the money I need for the baby	I am sure you will be able to do that"
"Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday	That's good to help yourself along"
"I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out	You need to be more careful next time."
"Kinda. I thought it was a secret	Was it? If so, good"
"it was brutal	I bet. I would be the same way. I didn't get into college so can't vote."
"i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.	I smell a rat."
"yes. homeless for a bit	Oh, I have met a few like that. But, they usually live on the street for a while."
"i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye	Friends come and go in life, what really matters is that you develop good ones."
"it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her	Probably would. That's a terrible thing to do."
"i was heartbroken when my dad passed away.. still not over it.	I know what you mean. Dad's can be like that, it's so hard to lose them."
"5 years..	I'm really happy for you."
"i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition.. she seems like a born artist	That is great. Does she dabble in any other art?"
"yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her	Everyone wins when two people are able to work together successfully."
"i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents	ummm yeah that can be hard to swallow. What did you do?"
"yeah, but still.. that feeling never went away	That's okay, you will find someone who will be worth marrying."
"i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere	That's a good thing. Where do you go?"
"well, i guess women are more detail oriented	I get that, I guess that makes sense."
"i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her	Why? Have you been together long?"
"yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me, i escaped from there right awat	Wait a minute. Did you?"
"my dog passed away earlier this year	oh no! i'm so sorry"
"yeah.. but its too soon i feel	Oh then go out and have fun!"
"some guy drove past me so fast last week.. i was furious	Oh that's awesome! I wonder how you would have reacted if he hit you?"
"yeah.. i barely escaped!	haha thats good you survived at least."
"1	What about 1?"
"soory it was mistakenly typed.	It happens I suppose, but there's many, many other places where it shouldn't be. Hopefully you'll remember your mistake soon and will be less nervous about it."
"how was your day?	I'm taking the California Bar exam to become an attorney in February and I'm sooo nervous!	I hope you do well! If you're nervous, don't worry. I've hveds do well legally too."
"I played a video game when I was younger, called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and it made me want to become one!	Was it a fighting game?"
"once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life	That is no good. How did she get into that situation?"
"yeah that really sucks.	It really does, especially when they try to blame you for it."
"I fell down at work, and my khaki pants ripped open.	ooh no! Are you alright?"
"I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.	Oh, I see. Well, at least you survived."
"My grandpa is coming to visit!,5|5|5_5|5|5,	sweet! i bet you are thrilled about that"
"He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!	That sounds like so much fun!"
"I ate a gas station burrito for lunch. It was not very appetizing. Actually, it was absolutely horrible.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	Burritos are nastier than tacos. I had one as a kid and it was just the head."
"Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.	That's terrible, but unfortunately people have to work in something like that. It's not easy losing a pet, either."
"how was your day?	It was great. How did you enjoy it?"
"yeah its an another good day	Good for you. I hope it be another good day for you."
"oh how was the climate there/	I'm not sure I've ever been in a completely dry climate. It's always a mix of rain and snow."
"I managed to accidently flash a dozen people	Whoa. Did you actually see them? Or were they counting on you?"
"it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like ""oops!	I have had that happen to me before, but it was just the breeze."
"Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive	i have always more trust on my girlfriend	ok tell me why"
"yeah i do. i love her a lot	I am glad you have a pet to keep in touch with!"
"what about you?	I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.	That's wonderful! Your nerves are very healthy. Just don't stress about it."
"Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.	Good luck, and thanks for the great job!"
"I get to go the the zoo tomorrow! They opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal, the sloth!	I love the sloth! I am so jealous! I hope you have a great time!"
"They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!	Wow that sounds very exotic."
"I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!	That is really disgusting of them. I hope they get the help they need."
"Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?	If you think I should then you should. I don't know who did it but I hope you catch them."
"i have been more happy	thats a good summary i hope it stays that way"
"happier now beacuse i have been built a new house	That's a good thing."
"Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.	I know what you mean. It's crazy how much everything now costs."
"I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal	It's a good thing! My daughters age really is getting to me. I barely keep anything to cover them in theirs :)"

"nope iam a street racer	Do you win often?"
"i feels happy	thats cool"
"because i built a new house	Well that's wonderful! You must be so proud of yourself."
"i have been more happy that i have bought a car	I am sure you are. You can save a lot of money if you do."
"audi q7	Wow, that is an awesome car! Ive had one before myself as well! Price is insane!"
"My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.	That's wonderful. I bet she is happy you are enjoying your new life together."
"She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version.	i love the watch, i have it, and i upgraded to the quartz version, i wanted that too"
"I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.	That takes a lot of effort! I graduated college in 2008, I never had to put in a day in college."
"I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.	I am sure you will find one and if you do you will thank God that He has one. Just keep working and I will pray for you"
"I am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that I just finished. I took the final exam yesterday, and I am not sure what score I will receive.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	Oh, I am the same, final grade I get isnt that important, all that matters is you deliver"
"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.	are you hoping to do well on that course?"
"I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.	Oh no! What did you do?"
"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.	Well, that's too bad. Maybe this friendship will last a lifetime."
"My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away.	I'm sorry to hear that. It's hard to watch kids grow up without me being able to."
"The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off	That's so sad. Do you miss her?"
"I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.	oh thats disgusting"
"I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.	I wouldn't go back either. There's a lot of those types of restaurants all around."
"I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.	Yeah I visited when I was a child as well"
"Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?	I am not actually related to my grandparents. My family is mostly made up of my great grandmother, and my great grandmother's great grand parents. Are you related to your grandparents?"
"I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone	Thats awesome, looking to keep them in the loop?"
"Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.	Those were the good old days!"
"We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave.	oh well it must be lonely for you as well"
"Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?	Yeah, did you check on the dog after?"
"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	I hate doctors, they're always either very drunk or very hungry. What did they do?"
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	i understand. i hope that all goes well for you"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	That's so awesome! I wish some one took the time to do a thing like that."
"Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?	I have. It was called ""The 3rd grade"" and it was called a cruise."
"I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.	I could never afford to go, I grew up in a very close family and was very close to our families. I felt you."
"Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.	What did she do?"
"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	Docs are sometimes hit or miss. Is this once you've had them do it 3 or 4 times?"
"I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	i would just make sure that there is no drama between us and only talk to him as a friend"
"Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	I really hope he has learned that no one is trying to sit on your lap!"
"I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious.	Great, are you sure you are prepared?"
"Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.	That's great that you're studying. I hope that you'll do well."
"I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it!	That is wonderful. Do you have a favorite restaurant to eat at?"
"We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?	Im not a good at diving. I could sure kill it at a pool."
"One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!	Wow! What a surprise! I bet you wanted something more and forever gift!"
"We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!	Thats sweet though, hope he doesnt take too long :)"
"It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?	I know right? It was a present from a dear friend when I was a baby."
"Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top	Kay Jewelers? I've never heard of them...but those sure are expensive pairs of diamonds."
"I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.	that is too bad, what did you end up drinking?"
"I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.	That sounds scary! I'm glad you are okay...but I really hope you don't have to go through that again!"
"I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone	Oh man! I hope it goes well! Have you confronted him about it yet?"
"I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution	I agree. I don't know enough about dog poo to say I'm comfortable."
"sure ... thanks	My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.	I am not even close to my sister. I know that I have many good brothers but I try to not to let mine know how I feel."
"I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?	Depends what your job is. I think you should tell them but only if they meet your standard."
"My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.	ohh, that's good to hear!"
"Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!	That's great to hear. I hope you had a good day."
"Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.	I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me.	That's so sad. I'm sorry."
"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.	im sure it was not! you should take steps to reduce your chances of repeating the mistake!"
"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	That's great! Your company should really appreciate your loyalty."
"Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.	Hey that's a moneymaker!"
"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	That's awesome! Old memories, hu?"
"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.	I wish you the best of luck with your payments."
"A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.	Oh that's awful, did you call out to anyone, like?"
"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.	Can you spoil any future games you're planning?"
"Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy	Sounds like you have a very good relationship with the earth!"
"Especially when you feel something special by nature	i agree completely"
"I hope this feeling increases	My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.	Sounds like a plan. What are you planning?"
"We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.	That sounds so fun! I bet you're having a blast planning it"
"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.	Truth be told, I'm still friends with someone who was burned by a camp stalker. They were probably disappointed in you, and now both of you have stories to tell. I'm sure you'll both will be more careful in the future."
"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	That's his right as a citizen of the United States! he can do with it wht he want!"
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	Yeah, I would have said the same thing. If your boyfriend is bad you should just say so without hesitation."
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	that is a weird day haha"
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	I'm sorry that happened. That's no fun at all. Hopefully you learned a lesson from this?"
"I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!	that is disgusting! i hate that happening"
"I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!	I can't imagine how bad that is going to be! I hope you're able to manage it though!"
"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	Oh wow, that's amazing. Maybe you could watch it while you wait for something in particular?"
"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?	You can try watching some TV shows or browsing the Netflix. Both of which I find guilt free."
"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	That is not a good idea. I am bad with food and probably wouldn't understand."
"Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.	Okay great! I would say the same thing to you."
"I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.	That is great, where did you all go?"
"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.	I hope you feel better the next time you see each other!"
"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	That's great! How are you doing?"
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	He should be ashamed of himself."
"Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.	That's a good thing. At least we have some money to spend."
"Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!	yes all the best"
"My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness	always good to have friends"
"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering	oh i here it coming ð¤ sorry about that haha"
"Thanks for your comprehension	Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.	That sounds scary, were you and your family okay?"
"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.	I'm glad you were able to make it out alive. You'd be hard pressed to find another car or dog to pit against you."
"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	I am so sorry to hear that, I have a friend who has this disease too"
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	I don't know if I could do that. My girlfriend says it is safe though."
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	oh my goodness, that must be very difficult. i'm sorry."
"one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel	i am soo sorry to hear that!"
"is that he loved her	This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.	That's bad but seems to be localized to baking soda. Not a lot you can do really, until it gets deeper in the ground."
"Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.	Oh no! Did you clean it up? The puddle is ole Chippendale."
"I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.	That is terrible. How did she do?"
"We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.	That's unfortunate. Are you guys still friends?"
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	That is very rash. I would get on that alarm and make sure my credit card is ready."
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	It's become so normal for people to do that nowadays, that it's kind of annoying. Even I have learned to call people names when they violate my space!"
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	Yeah, I don't think they're subtle. I think they're loud and obnoxious."
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	Yes and I'm sure you would be more than happy to move if you could."
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	Older people don't afford very much for orthopedic care, do they?"
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	That's great news. I wish you a speedy recovery."
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	I had a fall 3 years ago. It wasn't my fault, just happenstance. It's different now though."
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	I would bring a friend or relative over for pizza and cuddle up with my baby. They are worth every second of suffering."
"The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.	i know. it's so hot and humid here. it would be cool to see them move around a bit."
"I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.	That's a positive attitude! I would love nothing more than to be able to mow my own lawn!"
"Writing speeches makes me nervous	I'm sorry; I'm not sure how to respond. Have you tried talking to a teacher?"
"Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience	choosing the wrong career could kill you right away"
"True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say	I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days, but they always bring back fond memories	I am not a fan of remakes either."
"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!	Is that an adaptation of a true story?"
"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	For example in the movie 13th it was a 13 year old who was framed for the murder of his college roommate."
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	with all the advances that people are making with their life I would say kids can be just as smart as adults."
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	That's great. What kind of job did you get?"
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	Oh, I have never tried that! I will have to try it out!"
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	That does sound like a nice change of pace. I'm glad you have found one that good."
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	That's always a good thing. I hope your boss rewarded you for working hard."
"Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day	I am glad you are happy!"
"Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!	Wow! How kind!"
"Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing	Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking	Ouch, I always do that. Does anyone know where you are going?"
"I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill	Haha! That's a wisest move. You'll be more afraid of the consequences, I think."
"Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed	When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks	That's disgusting, why would you ever want to do that??"
"Yeah, I'm not good with confrontations	Me either, I don't like people getting upset over nothing."
"I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong	I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!	Wow that's amazing, congrats on the good news. So you must have done well in the interview then?"
"Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!	Well that would be nice if your boss was telling you what to do!"
"How long have you been there?	I have been on the job hunt for about a week. I have three days."
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	I believe in myself and my abilities! I have done great things in my life and would never change it!"
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	100 Dollars sounds like a lot, did you have to pay anything else?"
"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.	I wish you luck. I bet your husband bought a nice car if you know what I mean."
"If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*	I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!	Oh that's great! What made you so confident"
"I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*	Oh wow! I thought there was a limit to the amount you could buy, but maybe you could put off paying it in full until the following weekend?"
"I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.	That's cool! It's nice to be appreciated!"
"I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.	So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.	Aw! You'll make him get one!"
"He kinda gave me the ""Mom, really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*	That's funny. I kind of did the same thing with my mom when I made her lunches one time. Her reaction was, of course, disbelief."
"I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].	Haha. Well as long as he's hungry enough, that's what he'll be getting."
"It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD	Yeah, it's a cruel game to play. You never know when they'll cancel and then you'll have to play that again."
"I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.	oh man that is a bad feeling"
"No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.	What are some things you could have changed tomorrow?"
"Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*	You're such a naughty girl!"
"Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!	My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.	what did she do?"
"I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.	was she expecting a stranger?"
"Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.	I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!	you must have been well prepared for it!"
"I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.	I certainly understand the concerns people have about the Boy Scouts of America. I would be more worried about global warming. The BSA has a long history of supporting renewable energy and combating climate change. I would send them a letter of concern if I were you."
"Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.	I broke up with my boyfriend last week.	aww, are you really sorry for breaking up with him?"
"Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.	I used to be that way too. There was no real social environment for me. Now, I meet a lot of cool people!"
"Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.	I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!	Oh awesome! what will you be getting?"
"I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL	LOL. That's funny."
"This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!	I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!	wow i am happy for you"
"15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?	I want to be a dad one day. I wish i had children like you."
"Ah, make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)	Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is, it	I hate having to deal with fines. What do you do if it's a high amount?"
"Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!	Well it seems like that's actually been a great decision on your part!"
"The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!	Oh Disney Fashion Police! I bet you are excited, and anxious for the new years resolutions."
"It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks.	That's great. I wish I had a basement so I could do something like that."
"The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.	What might have been causing your troubles?"
"It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving.	That sounds horrible! Are you going to sue?"
"really didnt want to anything for days	I'm sorry you feel that way."
"I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it"".	That's terrible, hopefully the admissions committee at your school has an affective way of handling that"
"it is indeed. wont happen again though	I was attending a conference and heard the minister speak. he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district"".	Wow, i wish i could be like that"
"it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now	Well I'm glad it makes sense and not make you angry anymore. I am sure you will be happy when you get to the next position and your pay will go up!"
"I feel uneasy because I don't know if I will be able to save enough money in time	Yeah, that's a tough situation. I do hope it gets better, though."
"Baby is due in less than 3 months	Wow, that's pretty soon. You must be so proud of him!"
"I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me	I hope the results back are good!"
"5 months to find out !	That's a pretty long time. I'm sorry you don't have one."
"I tried so hard for that exam, when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!	That's awesome! Good for you, I'm sure you will do better next time!"
"thanks. now onto bigger things	quit complaining and concentrate on getting what you want!"
"starting a clinic	it was the grand opening for our restaurant. The whole town was there. almost double the number of people we were expecting	Was it a nice restaurant?"
"thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town	Oh wow! That would be quite interesting."
"I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this	You should reevaluate what you value and what you don't and be open to possibility. Once you are that young you will see many more possibilities"
"Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym	What ended up happening?"
"I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change	wow i hope it works for you!"
"Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.	Yosh, I usually eat something different everyday too."
"I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline	You must be a tough cookie! I'm sure you'll do great!"
"I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing	Oh really. I just ate small portion of rice, I think. I think I might be hungrier than usual today!"
"the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls	that is scary to hear, i hope they have fixed everything"
"Last week. we're in temporary housing now	Are you still living with her?"
"I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!	I understand! Dont you dare leave him out in the rain! May as well call an ambulance if it gets dark!"
"I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.	That's too bad. I bet you were really worried."
"I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.	Oh, I'm sure she missed you. Do you have a place to stay for a while?"
"Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.	That sounds great! What was it about?"
"I can't find another way to earn money	I see, what you should do is look for work online."
"I just want to work from home	I understand that, that is how I made a decent wage before the internet"
"I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now	awww. don't be anxious. you will be fine"
"You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap	I have no idea where you'd find one. I'm kind of broke myself."
"I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials	That is a great way to be a parent. Being so organized is so helpful."
"I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back	Yes its rough but I hope one day you can enjoy having a boy in your life."
"She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.	Height is not the only important thing in a relationship.Weight is not the only important thing in a relationship."
"Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors	What happened if I may?"
"I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding	I agree, we all have our faults. Sorry you felt that way."
"I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again	oh that's ok? i completely understand"
"I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.	Oh tricycles are cool. Did she enjoy owning them?"
"She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.	Oh no! Are you going to have your portrait taken of her in a few days?"
"I did so much practice running in preparation for my 50 metre sprint race at my school!	That's awesome. 50 metres is very tough."
"I do! I am so motivated to win and I believe I am one of the fastest at my school.	That is great! Is there any way you can improve your scores?"
"I feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro	Yeah it's always a nice treat. I used to get sick when I played themeto my grandma. What platformer was your favorite?"
"Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation	Oh ok! I thought it might be a problem with the game. Hopefully it isn't for anything game related."
"I was so scared of going onto the train!	Yeah I would be too. What happened?"
"No but I hate going in objects that travel fast, I really did not want to go on it.	I don't know what you have in mind. I definitely don't want to go in them!"

"I can't seem to feel happy but I'm not depressed	Well that really stinks. Did you try to look for a cure for it?"
"I just feel kinda stuck in life	It's tough, but I think we all feel that way when comparing ourselves to others."

"I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.	I am sorry to hear that. You may resume most jobs now, but you may never get a promotion. Know that you are good at what you do and they will come around."
"I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.	oh cool, I love looking at old photos"
"Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young.	Oh you must have been so happy that day!"
"I got a letter from my parents this past Friday with a wonderul surprise in it.	What was the wonderul?"

"When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything.	I see. I think that if you stole money it is most probably to buy the food, not that you did it on purpose. Why did you need the food then?"
"No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now.	17 years!! That has to be a really tough age for him. I have to deal with my mom who is 93 and has had some issues in the past, it is tough!"

"I'm taking my wife out this coming weekend to dance.	Oh, how exciting. Are you planning on having fun?"
"We haven't been able to go out in quite a long time.  Family and life stuff just gets in the way sometimes.	Yeah, sometimes life just seems to want to drag out, and it's hard to concentrate on something if you're tired.  I think you guys should try and think of an opportunity to try and get out there, rather than rescheduling your birthday!"

"I had to leave the house for a bit, before I left I gave my kids instructions on what I wanted them to do around the house.	onto some puzzles they werent so good at, so i figure if theyre easy they might as well get the job done"
"I figured they would just goof off.  However; when I returned all chores were comples.  I was pretty impressed.	Wow, it must have been quite a pain to go through with all that maintenance."
"i found a bunch of dead mice the other day	Dead mice are nasty. Did you put them in your food to make them sick?"

"i was so furious when i found out that my best friend and girl friend had made out	Oh no! What happened?"

"A big brown roach crawled across the floor in my direction last night.	Don't kill it. Don't try to. It's a cute name though."
"Yes, but this one didn't fly.  He just decided to go under the chair I was sitting in.	Oh no! I hate when friends do that! Did he sit on the chair next to you?"
"My bills and mortgage payment is coming up soon.  I not sure if I can cover them all.	All right, that's a lot of bills because you probably never take time for them. Do you have any special tools or computer labs you can use to help you out?"
"I am working hard to make sure I can cover them.  Hope fully this month of work is better than last month.	That's a really great attitude. It seems like you know what you're getting into when you go in to interview. I'm sure it'll be fine."

"I kissed a mutual friend of ours. I lied when she checked up on me. It was a one time thing, i did not wanted to hurt her.	Oh, I see. Well, trust me when I tell you that even if it is one time, she will be upset if you lie when she is worried about you."
"I once lied about kissing the most popular girl at my school. and my friend found out about it	oh no, how did they react?"

"It is ok.. She passed away few months ago	My son and I went to the track yesterday to run.	Did you have any luck at all?"
"No, but he did end up puking all over the parking lot afterwards.	Oh, that's not good at all. Was he in your car?"
"That is really cool. i bet it felt nice watching those	Those competitions are some of the most fun I've ever had."
"I envy people who can dance really well	i know the feeling. i used to wish i could dance. no longer wish i can do it. all I want to do is learn to dance."
"I was stunned with fear to find a rattlesnake right where i was about to step into last week	Oh man, that must have scared you so much I bet. I am glad you are ok."
"I stood there speechless for a moment, turned back and ran for my life!	I don't blame you, but that flu can be really bad."
"Needing some extra money, I used the spare change in my car to buy a scratch off ticket.	Nice! The scratch off tickets are very expensive so if you go with the right people it can be a great investment"

"I am so angry to see so much fake news floating around in the media	Aww, I don't believe the Fake News is the real deal. The Data is the real deal. Why do you feel that way?"

"I have a lot of stuff coming up due this month.  I also have a lot of purchasing goals as well.  I am confident I will be able to meet all of them.	Yeah, that's awesome.  It's a lot of stress to sort through all of that, but once you have set a goal, it's much easier to meet it."

"I felt so proud when my son got good grades in school last month	wow. proud of your son, hu?"
"Oh alright then, feel good	i feel alone whenever i think about my dad, he passed away last year	I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have close friends and family that you can talk to about these issues?"
"yeah.. i know.. memories still haunt though..	Its okay, you will grow and learn from these mistakes."
"I was really nervous when my girl asked me to meet her parents	Oh really? How'd you handle it? I bet you were happy for them and your friendship has really grown!"
"I was really close to running away, but i somehow managed to pull it off	Oh wow, that is luck, but i'm sure you worked hard for it."
"my friend bought a big house and i'm happy for her but at the same time i'm a little bit jealous	That would be hard. You must be so happy for her, but her big house is a little bit special."

"I was so mad when i found out my cousin asked out my girlfriend once	That sucks! My cousin and I were friends in college, but she wasn't one of ours. I bet you were mad!"

"It was really awesome dude, the full show covers it all up	I love concerts."
"I took my daughter out to the skate park today.	That sounds like fun! How old is she?"

"My sister recently paid off her house. I felt so envious of her as I've been trying to pay mine down.	Aw, that's about as far as my family has gone. It's nice to have reliable debt but I think family should always pay first."
"I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal, and I genuinely am pleased she did it!	Absolutely! I hope all that hard work pays off for you!"
"I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating.	Oh girl, it's an understatement. How did it change?"
"Yes, but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly, it was more about my own insecurities than about him, you know? As I grew more into myself, the jealousy loosened its hold.	that all sounds really great. I hope you have a more mature relationship with him now"
"My daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us.	Oh sweet. So exciting! What part of ""oh welcome"" made you happy?"

"I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were.	I've been there. I know how it feels."
"Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own ""vision"" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know?	yea its hard to not put everyone in their place"
"I've definitely worked through that! Happily, it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)	I recently met up with a friend I had not seen in a while. I want to see him again soon and I think I will!	That sounds fun! What are you guys going to do?"

"Thanks again. I have lots of support so I am fortunate	I've felt so incredibly sad whenever we've had to say goodbye to any of our dogs.	Awwww, my girlfriend's cat used to roam the neighborhood a lot, and one day she told me she was going to get a new cat, and she wanted to get a relationship going with a cat, and I was like, ""No way, you can't do that with a cat. You can't even have a relationship with a pet. That's not how it works. So"
"I know -- I needed to just come out and say ""when we had to put them down"". Always age or illness related -- but man, SO tough.	I love animals and all that, I'm sorry to hear that. I know you're in pain, but it's unimaginable."

"i guess they worked harder but	haha they sure were worth it!"
"I went on a road trip with some friends. We had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping, too!	Nice! The beach is always a nice trip."
"Yes, sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more.	I gotta say, leaving some things to chance is a terrible strategy. You should try it this weekend and see how it goes!"
"We paid 600$ for a cruise, but they canceled it with not refunds one week before. so mad	well i am happy they changed their mind about it"
"we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company, so they dont know what they're in for	Oh, so then what were you doing before now?"
"I had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago. I wonder if I will see her again any time soon.	I hope you don't have to go anywhere, it would be unpleasant."
"We went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends.	Sounds like a lot of fun! I'm in the same boat! I like to take time out to visit my grandmother in the nursing home."
"I live alone. Sometimes it can be hard with nobody around.	I'm sorry that you feel this way."

"Summer can be over in July for teachers sometimes. Are you a teacher?	My roommate eats my food sometimes. This makes me so angry!	That's not fair! You should report him!"
"I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.	That's the one everyone seems to like but nobody uses. I think the slow cookers are awesome too. They're so convenient."
"I recently lost my sister to breast cancer. She was very young and has left three little girls. I have been devastated.	That is so tragic, we always love our siblings but it is hard to lose them so young."
"My parents health has deteriorated rapidly, and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.	Oh my goodness! That's so awful. They're probably in a nursing home. That's so scary, because that's nursing home. It's not something that's easy to recover from. But they're in a good home, and I hope that they get better."
"It's why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own.	I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can't always get what you want.	Ah that's true. But that's life. We all make mistakes."
"Life is not fair, but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with	yes, i can only imagine how hard it is to go through life alone."
"I'm a little anxious about an upcoming move. It's to a *very* different state with a *very* different climate and way of life!	Oh man! I would be so scared! Do you know what temperature it will be?"
"We've been great with change, including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot, and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man, those looooong winters!	Yeah it gets cold pretty bad under here."
"Ha! Not likely in the city....but hey...who knows! I WILL use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski.	Cross country skiing is definitely something I would like to try!"
"The economy has been doing well. The future looks bright.	So good! What do you have planned?"
"Hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations.	That is a good thing to hear. I wish you all the best in life."
"My sister unfortunately will not seek help for her alcohol problems, and she will not even admit to them. I am extremely sad apprehensive about what might happen to her.	That's happened to me before, my sister is incredibly messed up. I try to stay away from alcohol but I'm constantly telling people about my problems."
"I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention, but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.	Yea that can be stressful, I'm sorry. Do you think it will work out?"
"It was still so unexpected when my husband and I -- who were open to getting pregnant -- found out that we actually were!	oh wow! congratulations!"
"Oh, that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day, Halloween, visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.	The place has evolved alot over the years, and the animals are really creepy!"
"The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful, in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!	Ah! Oh wow! That's one of my favorite things in the world! So pregnant? That's interesting! Sounds like you had a wonderful pregnancy, too!"
"The horror film I saw last night can cause nightmares. It was so scary!	I have never seen that and I know what you mean. There are a lot of scary movies I don't scare too much lol"
"I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.	roses and he twin brother have swords. they are the oppressors"
"My daughter was accepted into Harvard. She starts in the fall.	wow that is a biggie!"
"She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!	That is terrible. What a stressful job to do. I hope they have had insurance at least."
"My friend purchased a new car. The ride is sweet!	That's awesome, what kind of car?"
"They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.	that's a nice ride"
"I graduated college recently. I'm so glad!	That is awesome! I went to college for a few years, but haven't been out yet."
"I majored in environmental engineering!	In that case I'm sure you did great, congratulations!"
"I cheated on my girlfriend recently. I feel horrible about myself right now.	Why did you do that?"
"I plan on coming clean at some point, but I'm not sure how to break the news.	Just tell them the truth. If it makes you feel better about it, I would come clean anytime."
"I can not wait until some of my family come in to town. They will be coming in to town in two weeks.	I hope you all have a lot of fun. If you guys are having any fun in the meantime I'm sure you'll enjoy the visit of your family in no time"
"I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.	awww that is awesome that you were able to see them that long ago...that is a sweet place to land"
"I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.	I know what you mean. I still spend a lot of time with my high school friends."
"Yes, I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.	I understand. I hope you feel better soon."
"I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!	Yeah I love scary movies! What was it?"
"A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.	Awww! Is she your daughter? You must be proud."
"I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary	You are so lucky! I also cherish my anniversary every year on the 30th. What is the occasion?"
"Yes, it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.	That's great! Are you a bride or a groomsman?"
"I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.	sorry to hear that. I rescue dogs, so I feel your pain"
"Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much	Companionship is so important, and oftentimes, we don't even realize that we have ones that are so important."
"I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.	What is his policy on the world?"
"We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.	well maybe you can work something out"
"Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!	Awww, that is too bad. Is it something that you can recoup?"
"Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.	It will get better. Heal the right things and it will work out fine."
"Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions	Oh wow! Where did you go?"
"No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance	Oh, well glad you made it back safely."
"I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight.	Sometimes teamwork is more beneficial then alone."
"Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad!	It's *weird* how we *see* the *same* people in the same places all the time. But that's *our* fault for not *reflecting* in a different way, I feel."
"I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.	i have also got some sort of bee in my back yard since it looks like someone is up to no good. is this something they can handle?"
"I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.	Yeah, taking care of the lawn is a whole other animal. It sounds like you might need an adviser."
"Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing.	You are a brave man. I am glad you are being well fed."
"It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!	Yeah, I'm pretty sure of it. I hate big storms too."
"Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.	I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times	Sounds like a lot of fun! What horses did you have?"
"A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse	Oh man! I would have given my aunt a big hug!"
"Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work.	The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.	Trailing half is the worst, but you did alright."
"I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.	That's a shame, but you won't know until you try"
"One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.	Why were you nervous?"
"Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.	I am glad you didn't puncture your ankle."
"My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!	That sounds like a beautiful trip. I wish I could go on vacation. Take some time for yourself and see how you feel."
"I am, but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here, bored stupid! I know, I'm being selfish.	Yeah, I know how you feel. If you don't find something new to do with your time, I wouldn't take your call!"
"I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.	I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!	Wow! Welcome to the OTHER side of the country. I have no doubt you will have a blast."
"Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!	I... may just move to Germany. The people are more cordial there."
"I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate	It's a lot of work to stay still in meditation."
"No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy.	Zen and carefree life are the perfect combination!"
"My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis	Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.	Oh no! What happened next?"
"Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.	Thank goodness it was nothing serious!"
"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	Uh oh, that sounds terrible, but yeah, sometimes you've just been screwed by people who think they know what is best for you."
"Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.	Emotions run high very quickly. If you have a job offer it's best to back out of it now"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.	I'm so sorry! You must have been exhausted. How did you do?"
"Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.	It was a good idea. I'm glad that nothing bad happened to you."
"I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!	That is so nice of him! I wish I was able to meet like that"
"Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.	That's cool. I love my new neighbors as well."
"Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!	Yes, I do love golf and will be traveling a lot in the future."
"I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.	I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.	That's awful! I imagine it would have been quite an experience. I hope you made it out okay by the end of it."
"Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck	I hope you don't need any doctor's help to treat it."
"Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!	So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.	Wow! Did you get mad at him?"
"Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.	I am sorry, it sounds like you did the right thing."
"I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.	What's your favorite memory?"
"Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha	you still have the same choices as child?"
"I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.	hahaha so you are a machine?"
"I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.	That's so nice! I wish I had a loved one who worked in that type of field!"
"I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.	I guess its a personal loss, but at least you did the right thing"
"I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!	Oh my, did the other woman report you to the police?"
"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	Sort of rude but maybe he had no idea what he was getting himself into."
"Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!	I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.	That's so frustrating! Do you not have the same amount of money?"
"She won $5,000 and never offered to share.	millionaire! wow! she must be a very smart girl"
"I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.	That's great! Did you study better than expected?"
"I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.	i can see that! it's always good to get in the groove of things"
"I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.	Yeah - that sounds amazing!"
"Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on	Sounds like a lot of work, hopefully you can enjoy your new house."
"I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!	That's scary! I can't believe people are still doing that!"
"Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.	Im glad you didnt lose either of them. You were lucky that no one was home."
"Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!	My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you feel at home?"
"Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?	No, I have always wanted to immigrate to russia"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.	I hate when that happens. What did you have to tell the professor about?"
"There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.	That's not good. Did you get in trouble?"
"Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!	You don't honk in traffic to me either? I think its rude."
"Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe	Yeah, If you're not careful a lot of things can go wrong."
"I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.	That is great! Are you excited about it so far?"
"I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?	I did go to college and was very accepted but in college part time so far and in sororities I've accepted but still a bit nervous about it."
"I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.	Oh no! Did the house get covered in snow?"
"Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!	Please do because there's nothing worse than waiting for the worst to happen! As long as you're happy and all, storms are a joke. I hope you're using protection wisely."
"I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.	I was really sad to hear of his death, I lived in MÃ©xico and New York for a long time, worked in the US for a long time, went to Japan a long time, had friends in all those places, had great restaurants in those places, studied abroad in those places, been to those places, had great cookbooks in those places, visited those places, had great travel"
"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	Exactly. The only way to fight this disease is to create more awareness about it."
"It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.	My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.	Good job! Happier days are the best. It's good to work for your boss that's been working hard."
"I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.	Great job, glad you didn't get fired!"
"I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!	What kind of amusement park! I've never been there!"
"I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?	No, I used to live near one called Tomorrowland. It was amazing."
"I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.	What does this account hold?"
"That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.	That's a wonderful attitude. keep strong!"
"We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.	That sounds wonderful! You must be proud of her for doing that."
"Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.	I do believe in Santa Claus. He rules the children."
"I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.	oh no. did you have it inspected? i hope it wasnt an allergy issue."
"That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!	it might make you feel better that it happened to you now, and you will have many more good memories with your dog in the future!"
"I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.	What shows do you like the most?"
"Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.	ah the sadness is partly your fault. take more chances and let the tears come."
"Nah, I don't get to to bad.	I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!	Oh, wow! That sounds like fun! That is a very interesting venue - sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa?	I went to Williamsburg. There are a bunch of beaches there."
"Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.	Oh yes, kids are easily scared by pretty much everything. I try to teach them about food handling and handling open carry but they aren't listening. Maybe you should bring a special treat in case they don't get it."
"This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.	oh thats pretty gross.. how did he manage to do that?"
"Not even a little.	Oh, well that's okay. I know how it feels to be cheated of something."
"I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.	That's a good dog! They are loyal like that."
"Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems	I love dogs, I had a German Shepherd when I was young and never knew what hit me. I had a Labrador also, she is so gentle and sweet."
"I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house	Wow that roof must be tough"
"It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.	I'm so sorry to hear that, I hope you're able to get it fixed easily!"
"Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.	I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.	That must have been somewhat interesting."
"Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.	That's of no concern to you?"
"I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.	That is great! Are you excited about their arrival?"
"No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?	That is so sad, I wish you the best of luck."
"I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.	Aw I bet you were impressed! How old is she"
"She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.	Awww. That is great you gave her that"
"You know you could still do it. I know you can.	Absolutely, whatever it takes."
"My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.	Oh wow! My kids would be so generous! I bet you feel special about that."
"He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!	That's great you had someone to help him out."
"You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.	Are you applying for another one, or you went through with your first one?"
"It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.	You are very cautioned. Good luck"
"I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.	Oh no! What did you do?"
"Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.	I guess that means it was good"
"Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.	Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.	That's wonderful. How long has it been open?"
"It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.	Wow that sounds like fun. I love collecting things from my childhood."
"I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her.	That's so sweet. You guys should celebrate her birthday in a big way!"
"I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!	Oh I know that feeling. I was just saying this was the worst for me. I can't imagine moving to a country like that when I have a kid and it's out of the question. Is it a lot of work to get to work every day and being away from home. I can understand that. And I'm not even talking about the cost. I just know it makes you homes"
"It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!	That sounds great. I visited my family a few times when I was little. It's always great to visit!"
"Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!	I actually just came back from Amsterdam, and I cannot wait to go to that giant metropolis!"
"I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.	That's so good that your family was watching over you! It's really hard to get better when you have great care."
"Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.	That is so great! I am happy for you!"
"I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.	That is true, i have been in that place too, lot's of people will tell you anything to avoid responsibility."
"We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!	I hope so too, there is so much opportunity out there if you work hard enough"
"Me too! <fist bump> ;-)	So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.	Are you happy for him?"
"He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.	Who is he going to?"
"I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.	That's the worst, especially when you have to walk away from it all alone."
"I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?	Yes, they don't care about anyone but themselves."
"You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.	I'm really sorry. I know how that feels."
"She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.	I'm so sorry to hear that. Was she awake most of the time?"
"I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.	I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.	You can always go back to school for a job. Don't let hate get to you."
"Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too.	I understand the importance of making some money though"
"One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.	That's awesome. I assume she's going to major in something and want to make sure she makes the most of it."
"She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year.	That's really exciting. Is she a girl or boy?"
"June and July are very busy, June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.	Well, that's pretty cool. Well, I hope you have some rest in the last month of your month!"
"So much for relaxing during the summer?	I guess you will have to find another beach"
"Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.	I skied in a plane once."
"It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.	That's a good way of thinking of it. I find it can make you more focus during difficult times."
"You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.	Definitely! I'm sure it will be a great experience and you will thank me later!"
"I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food	I am very impressed with the food too! What did you have?"
"I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all	I love recipes! I always hunger for some fresh food!"
"I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.	I'm sorry, I used to have migraines myself."
"oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great	When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. That is extremely hard and requires a great deal of trust and courage. How did you end up helping her?"
"I was and she was had a full recovery.	Oh wow! It sounds like you and your sister are the perfect match."
"Me neither, my mom means so much to me.	Sounds like a great mom/pop shop."
"Do you get to see your mom often?	Not that often. I think she's in another state. But I'm not sure."
"I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!	Cool, what is your favorite car?"
"It was blue with white racing stripes.	Ohhh, that should be pretty cool."
"Same here, they are pretty expensive.	My dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day. Now I have to throw them out.	That's unfortunate, I guess he has to sometimes. I guess we don't know for sure how old he is."
"This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.	Yeah, I got a little jealous and I threw my phone into a trash can."
"My wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner.	that's wonderful! what did she make?"
"She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert.	That sounds like a nice dinner"
"Thank you! What is your favorite meal?	My favorite meal is whenever my daughter consumes all of the forbidden fruit."
"Me too, do you have a favorite flavor?	My long term boyfriend and I broke up recently. I'm so lost right now.	I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling?"
"I know, it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together.	I know being with your partner for so long is the issue. You should cherish the memories you've made together"
"My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry.	That sounds great! What did he make you?"
"He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.	That sounds good. My husband loves potatoes."
"I got a promotion in work. I am so excited for the raise and added responsibility.	Good for you. Will you be going back to school?"
"Thank you, I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.	Wow! That's alot of hard work. I'm sure yours is well deserved."
"I work in the military	My daughter can say so many new words, love to see her thrive!	I just love to see kids doing fun things."
"Yes, thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?	I do. I will be 70 in February. Yes, you will be fine."
"I've got all of my bags packed, passport ready, and i'm not even leaving for vacation until next week.	Are you coming to the US?"
"I'm going to Japan. I'm so excited, I've never been.	Wow, how exciting! I've never been outside of the country either. When do you go?"
"So my parents took me out to dinner for my birthday tonight.	That was nice of them. What did they do to celebrate?"
"Thanks! I had an awesome time. I went to a sushi place and it was delicious.	oh nit"
"I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had, haha.	haha that's cool, they must have been very wealthy"
"So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!	That is nice, what kind of ride?"
"It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?	I visited the parks and got to visit with some of the animals :)"
"It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.	Aw, I'm sorry you don't have family! You are lucky! I have a familiy, too!"
"That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!	Well if you guys went you would be happiest as a family and that would be a lot of traveling!"
"Whenever we moved abroad, I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.	That's a good thing! Where did you go?"
"Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.	Being financially stable is important, but having fun and being adventurous are two totally different things. Definitely something we should all strive for!"
"Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive! We've lived in Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Zurich -- Alaska may be next. (And Italy is awesome, by the way!)	It's my brother's 16th birthday in a couple days and he's probably getting a nicer car than I currently have. I'm 24.	That's awesome! I wish I had a good vehicle to drive myself. I don't want my kids to get a bad car."
"I certainly am! Of course, I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.	I hope it is! Now you know and you can be more careful!"
"So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore. Score!	That's awesome! I want to marry a 16 year old in the not so distant future. they are so much more mature and responsible towards this age"
"Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?	I have a brother, but he's pretty young and kids are not something we do yet."
"I saw somebody I hadn't in years. It was a nice meeting.	That is always a nice surprise"
"Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.	yes your mom is in a better place now"
"I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!	I can understand that completely, but I would be very nervous about that as well. Maybe you should try to find a new home first."
"Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?	I think I can, though I'm not 100% sure. Sometimes my mobility gets a little restricted because of work, etc. I think visiting is a good way to go and it's always nice to see the country you're visiting too!"
"I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman.	That sounds like it would be interesting."
"I respectfully told her I was not interested, I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.	That is very good of you to say. I am happy you had that training."
"I recently attended a play. My friend's acting was significant!	That's awesome, how did it feel when it was over?"
"I am very glad that I went and supported him.	Yea, it's good to see your close friend gets some support from you."
"Sometimes when I'm driving home after a holiday, such as christmas, I get an overwhelming sense of being alone.	I think that's a good thing! Take your time and let your mind to rest."
"No I haven't, but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!	Good luck!"
"So I recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe I found and it turned out great!	Wow that sounds good!"
"Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.	I see, you must be feeling a lot better. That's wonderful that you feel so confident."
"I recently completed some additional training at my job. Perhaps a promotion is on its' way?	Im sure its a great time is you're reeading up."
"Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.	I was thinking the same thing. Good for you for staying on top of it!"
"I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!	Wow congrats, congratulations to you on both counts! Is this your first?"
"I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.	thats good"
"So last night I was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone.	Really? What were they about?"
"Yes, I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?	yea i can't relate to that, my parents were really messed up when i was a kid"
"I'm ready for football season to start, NFL preseason started this week, and I can't wait for regular season and I'm really looking forward to the NCAA kickoff!	Oh nice. I didn't know they were still around. Always nice to see what all the fuss is about."
"In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama	I hear that, I can't wait to see them play."
"I visited the BMX park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike, it was insane!	I haven't been to a BMX park in a while, have you? Was it too much to see?"
"I agree, years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV	Yeah people die every day in this game. Im sorry but the game ended and he was one of the few that survived. I would be EXTREMELY nervous too"
"My car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop. I think I'm going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks.	That's very nice of your friend. It's always good to have a friend who you can rely on for your things."
"It was just the carburetor, which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.	I'm glad you were able to get it fixed, it would have been an easy fix for you. I hope the problem goes away for you!"
"I was so set on getting an A on my math test that I studied so hard to do good on it. I studied for days!	I bet you did great on it"
"I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.	That's great! I'm happy for you. Sounds like you've done well in the class."
"My friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago, I'm still in shock.	That's so terrible. I'm so sorry for your loss."
"They've been really closed up about the whole thing, I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time, I could not imagine.	I wish they would let you in on what is going on. I recently had a friend who had their health compromised and had to be on life support. It was really distressing to be in that position"
"I realized yesterday I was pregnant, I was in shock!	wow thats great! you should celebrate with a drink or a meal"
"I am still in awe, I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.	Wow, that's pretty awesome. What have you been doing in general lately?"
"When the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area, I was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood.	i love how social media makes us worry and prepare for the worst! but honestly i am glad it looks like it has stopped"
"I had an emergency generator, extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.	Is your home okay now?"
"I stole a candy and drink from the gas station once, I felt terrible about the whole ordeal.	oh wowo did you get caught"
"I was 17, at that age I should of known better.	It's hard to learn that fast. I hope you learned your lesson."
"My friend has had the flu, and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.	It's GOOD that you are there for them. The flu can be miserable!"
"Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well, just whiny.	No no, try not to let his quirks make you feel less than welcome. I am sure he'll eventually get his act together."
"I managed to get on the A honor roll at my school, I was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing.	Congratulations. You must have worked very hard to get to that place."
"I'm just happy that I got it, it took a lot of hard work.	That's good. Work does that to us."
"The last time I hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie.	Oh yeah? I forgot, what movie?"
"Yeah, it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it, making fun of the movie while it was on.	that's a good way to start"
"I remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview.  I was sweating and couldn't stop my leg from shaking.	That's a terrible feeling. How did it go?"
"The interview went well and I ended up getting the job, so I guess I worried for nothing :)	Congratulations. I hope you can find happiness at work."
"The other day I had to take my dogs out before work, but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so I couldn't get out.	Did you ask your neighbor to let you dogs out? I'm sure she was just being nice."
"She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work, but not this time.	Uh oh. Maybe she's trying to show you something?"
"I was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and I fell to the floor. Everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor. My face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up.	are you ok? is your chair leg okay?"
"Now I can laugh, but when I was on the floor I was not laughing, I just wanted to leave.	oh no.. I am so sorry you had to experience that"
"My son is 16 months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork. I've been trying to teach him for a couple of months!	That's great, I remember that as a kid I had to teach myself to use a typewriter. I was terrible."
"He is still very messy but he really enjoys eating like a big boy	Oh you sound like a great parent!"
"When my wife and I started dating, our second date ended up lasting like 12 hours.	Wow. That's not fun. Did you laugh or cry?"
"Lunch, a zoo, my apartment for a while, and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P	i'm sorry about that! we all need a break after this month though"
"Years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure.  I found him in the kitchen in the morning, he did not go easily :(	Sorry to hear that my dog can be so sweet. Losing a pet is never easy, I know that for sure."
"Yeah, he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.	Well I'm sure he is in a better place now!"
"I remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail	I just found out that I am going to graduate this year! Yay for you! What store did you work at?"
"Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one	LOL! You were right! I should of been scrolling through facebook looking for a competition like that. Good job though"
"I realized that my bus that I ride to work in every day is a revamped school bus	Oh no! Do you have any complaints? I would have been very upset if I was riding your bus. How did you do?"
"Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is!	Yeah - I had no idea. I hope your grandpa is ok."
"I broke up with my girlfriend last week and it was really hard	I'm so sorry. Are you okay."
"Yeah we where together for about 2 years but im getting over it now	I'm glad to hear that. I've been through rough times by having to split, so I can relate."
"I was out at dinner with my family, and when coming back to the table from the bathroom I somehow accidentally sat down with a different family.	Oh man that's embarrassing. I bet the other person was really mad at you."
"Yeah, it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P	How old are your parents?"
"We are getting our son to go back to college in a few days and it really made me stop and think back to him when he was smaller, and how time flies by so fast!	That's really moving and kind of bittersweet. It's funny how time flies, but I have to drag my son's college along with him. Is he happy about that?"
"I know, that's about how I felt too! I think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!	Haha yes they are so cute when they are little"
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped and fell. There were so many people around that saw me hit the ground. You can imagine how I felt!	That happens to all of us, it will get better"
"I scuffed my knees a bit, but I was okay. I was also with a person that I really liked, so that made it even worse. But, I jumped up super quick lol	Oh knock yourself out...I hope you're not going to have that happen again!"
"i stold some spare change from my parents	Oh, that is very nice of you!"
"maybe like 19, but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner	I think parents who invite their kids to family functions is a good thing. It shows that they care and are happy about their kids."
"Yeah i told them as well	My sister passed away several years ago. I really had a hard time with the grief and couldn't really relate to anyone that tried to help me with it.	I'm sorry to hear that. That is a very difficult thing to go through and I am glad that you had friends and family that were there for you through it all"
"Yes, I'm sure you can relate as well. Ironically, that was the same age that my sister passed away. She took her own life, which my mother and I found her, and it was very hard for us all. But, I couldn't burden my parents with my pain, I felt.	That's a tough one, I'm sure. It's something my parents go through daily and it's so sad. They're always like, ""You'll be okay, don't worry about it"" and I try, but it's hard. Not being able to help them makes it even worse. :( I hope you can all that you can and keep having great conversations about the value of life"
"Having a good job is something to thank	I agree. I had a great job before I started work."
"to life God to that higher energy	That's awesome. Is there a god?"
"Nobody ... that's why I'm grateful	Yes, that would be me. I admire people who work hard and take responsibility for the family."
"I'm an administrative assistant for a construction company	That's impressive, how do you think your doing today?"
"I was devastated when I lost my phone	I feel your pain. I had the same thing happen to me."
"I did but it took a while	That's too bad. I hope the next time it will work out!"
"I was surprised when my family threw me a surprise party	Was it a surprise at work?"
"I turned 34	That's a good age to have kids. How many do you have now?"
"i didn't see my parents since 2014! I miss them so much. it's so sad that i live in a different country	I bet that is hard when you are away from home. I am sorry that you have to deal with that. Was this an event that occurred recently?"
"actually in 2 weeks! I'm so excited about it. I'm going there with my son! They've never met him	Have them meet your son before they meet your daughter! I think it's a great experience. They will grow up to be so great!"
"I was annoyed when my favorite show wasn't on	Oh, why couldn't it be stopped?"
"I ended up watching Impractical Jokers	i have never done that much tv"
"I love when I need to show someone how to do something and everything goes off without a hitch.	I am like that too"
"Fortunately it's usually just not having the best answer for what they ask. I've learned and prepared a lot more this time.	I am glad it worked out well for you!"
"I tend to know a thing or two on occasion.	I am taking a long overdue and much needed vacation this week. I wish i didnt have to fly.	oh, sorry to hear that my friend.. where are you going"
"I usually do pretty good on short flights. Longer ones make me a little nervous.	Oh I get that, but I have had really good ones too"
"I hate turbulence too.	I didnt think to invite my sister to a party I recently helped put on.	did she turn you down?"
"No she wasnt. In all fairness it was a group of people I never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with.	She's not the type to go out of her way to do that. Somethings just seem natural"
"you are right. Guess I know better for next time.	My sunday was great. All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.	wow. good for you"
"I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.	It's pretty frustrating right? Have you thought about trying to grow anything else in your yard?"
"ouch! I would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way.	The grass is always gonna be greasy that's for sure."
"My husband has to travel a lot for work. It can be hard on a marriage, but after almost 23 years of marriage, I have faith he is loyal and faithful when he does.	That is a real bummer. On the positive side at least you have a strong support system."
"He is an iron worker, so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings.	You must be proud of him as well. He can do whatever he wants."
"I've been married almost 23 years, but many years ago, my husband was acting a bit too ""chivalrous"" to a female acquaintance of ours. He said he was only being nice, but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice', which made me feel a bit upset.	That sounds terrible. How did you respond?"
"Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.	Yea, well i hope it wasnt too bad for you afterwards"
"My niece is super talented lately.	What does she do that is so cool?"
"Art, she was accepted into a special program for high school.	That's amazing! You must be so proud of her."
"Mostly drawing. And she's in advanced level classes in most subjects.	One day my 10 year old daughter came home crying after she got off the bus. A teenage boy purposely tripped her as she was getting off and she got hurt. Needless to say, I was very, very upset!	That's terrible. Does she seem okay now?"
"I actually knew his father, so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.	Sounds like you have a very good friend."
"I really dont like my husbands job right now.	What is wrong with your job?"
"Retail, but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks	That's such a hard trade-off to make."
"We are hoping with in a few months.	Each year my husband usually gets a bonus this month or next. It's not promised, but it has happened for several years now. I am really wishing it will be this year too!	I'm sorry to hear that. I know how important these are to your marriage, thank God for you to be able to share these days with him!"
"Well, we have college tuition, just got back from an expensive beach vacation, etc. So, if anything replenish some savings, right!	Hey. That's a great time. Enjoy your new found wealth!"
"I hate watching movies that are full of gore! I just saw one today and so gross!	I know what you mean. It is very gross."
"Yes, I was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off. yuck!	that is awful! i know how that feels"
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	There's usually a reason why; you just have to keep looking. The bonuses are usually really easy to find."
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	I think you are doing a great job - even if you don't know it. I hope you find someone soon that you really like."
"He is a welder and iron worker, so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel. He has earned it!	I've been married a long time, but my husband is gone quite a bit for work. I feel a bit by myself at times because of this :(	A bit lonely, huh? Maybe you should get out and do something you really enjoy!"
"Luckily, my children still live at home, but it's not quite the same. Plus, it won't be too long before they are ready to move out	yea i gona miss my kids as well"
"My youngest child started high school this year. It really made me think back to her starting kindergarten, and how time really goes by. I can just see her learning to read!	Thats wonderful. Kids grow up so fast. I remember when my daughter did her first year of college. I thought she was going to start taking drugs."
"Yes, it really is bittersweet. But, the older they get, the easier it is to think back to the younger days!	I relive every single game with my son"
"I was so scared when i heard a gunshot sound while i was walking through the streets the other day	Oh my, what is happening in that neighborhood?"
"No, i felt it would be better if i dont go looking for it. i managed to get the hell out of there	Good, I am glad you are safe."
"I feel so sad whenever thoughts about my dad come to me, he passed away last year	Thats so terrible. I am sorry for your loss."
"He had terminal stage brain cancer.. we did all we could, but..	oh my god, that sounds so sad. im sorry for your loss."
"i felt really good about myself when i got a new job at a reputed firm	that's a great feeling how did you feel"
"i was so angry when i found out my girlfriend kissed a friend of mine	That's terrible! How did she know it was a friend of hers?"
"i have not confronted them. still thinking about it	Aw I'm sorry, you should do it! I bet it'll be over in no time!"
"I went to the beach last week	Nice! How was it?"
"yeah. so much memories of me and family spending time in beach came to me	That is nice. You should cherish them."
"I was so furious when i found out a coworker badmouthed me to my boss	Oh no! Did you confront them about it?"
"Yeah. i outperform this person, and he started throwing shade on me out of pure jealousy	jealousy is very real thing, thanks for doing this."
"I went to see Hamilton last month in NYC	That is a great show! I loved it!"
"It was such a stunning show. Lin manuel should get a grammy for this	I just discovered Lin Manuel's The Running by Neil Gaiman. I am really going to love this."
"I was so ashamed when i threw up in public the other day	Oh no! What happened?"
"Yeah, i felt like i was coming down with something. i rushed to get a cab, but i couldn't help it	Harsh. Are you alright now?"
"My girlfriend asked me to meet her parents next week	Oh that's nice of you. Is it your first time?"
"I am not sure to be honest. i am feeling so nervous about it	Don't worry, you'll be fine! We've all done embarrassing things before. Don't be nervous!"
"i felt betrayed when my girlfriend kissed another guy at a party	That is really messed up. How did you find out?"
"Nothing. She was drunk, so i let it go. I still feel disappointed	It happens to the best of us. I hope it's not too costly to clean up!"
"I was really upset when my daughter went into labor and I couldn't be there.	Oh no. Did she end up being okay?"
"She lives in another state and wasn't due for several more months. Everyone is fine now though, so it has turned out to be very joyous.	that is great, glad it worked out that well"
"I was in total shock the night my fiance proposed to me at a concert.	Oh wow! How long had it been since you'd seen him?"
"They started playing one of our special songs and the next think I knew he was down on one knee. I said yes, of course!	What a lovely thing to do, I hope you blessed the ceremony."
"I admire my boss because he does not act like a boss. He acts more like a friend and he is so down to earth.	That's very pleasing to hear, I wish I had a boss like that"
"He is not just friendly, he is a good leader and knows how to treat his workers.	That's an excellent thing to have in an area like coal country. Mine was co-opted by the mines worst, rude workers."
"I remember when I was a kid and in the summertime I used to catch fireflies and place them in a jar by my bedside at night.	I once fired up a campfire and set the entire thing ablaze. Nothing could put it out, and I'd never get to use the matches again. I love camping."
"The fireflies would blink in the jar all night long.	Oh? What was in there?"
"I'm so tired this morning, I went to bed early, but it seems when I go to bed early I wake up more tired. It aggravates me!	I understand that, I have been tired as well. Its better to get a good nap instead of going long walk."
"I hate it! I feel more energized when I get 4 hours of sleep than I do when I get 8!	i know right. we all need hours of sleep to function optimally"
"I'm in contract to buy my first house, fingers crossed closing goes well and I close next Friday!	That's wonderful! Do you have a title agreement in place for the house?"
"I'm definitely excited. The house just now got built and I saw it for the first time last Monday.	Nice! I hope it's a nice purchase for you."
"My Mother and I made plans to hang out and do lunch this past week.	Nice! What did you plans look like?"
"Unfortunately she was unable to make it because her diabetes is wreking her health.	sorry to hear that - she will need help with that, I'm sure."
"I am feeling bad because my grandchild wants me to play all the time but I have to work a lot.	That sucks, I can only imagine how grind intensive that is for them. Maybe they will change their tune when they get a little older."
"She doesn't understand why I always have so many other things to do, but she would literally play 24/7 if I had the time.	You should tell her that herself!"
"My four year old daughter came to me beaming with pride and showing me a drawing she did of me.	aw how old is she really. i bet she was determined to show you that she is proud."
"I was really surpised.  I expected a stick figure, but she drew a lot of features including my beard and mustache.	oh wow, i am so sorry, was this someone you knew?"
"I had to run some errands.  While gone I instructed my older daughters to complete some math assignments.	were they good at it?"
"When I returned I found them playing video games, the math work was not even attempted.  I tunred their stuff off and we did it together.	That's so wonderful! I am glad kids can enjoy free time now that adult responsibilities have been taken care of."
"A recruiter contacted me the other day about potential job openings, so I'm hoping I may have a job soon!	Oh nice! I bet you are anxious to get started right? What kind of work will you be doing?"
"Me too. I've been dying to get out of my current job, but having a recruiter makes me feel at ease.	It's nice to have that extra peace of mind. Always to be working when your whistle lol"
"I found a box of old photos in my closet yesterday.	Ugh that is such a random and wonderful thing to find! Did you take a picture of anything in particular?"
"A lot of them where photos of my sister and I when we were toddlers.  It was a good trip down memory lane.	I bet! Sometimes I feel like I need a vacation, but I'm too afraid to go."
"I was disgusted when my dad left me	Where did he go?"
"I'm not sure. I guess he just didn't want anything to do with me.	Aw, that sucks man. If you ask him why he won't even talk to you, I'm sure he'll tell you the truth. All you need to do is just tell him the truth and he'll forget about his past indiscretions."
"I have been rehearsing for a job interview for a couple of weeks now, and I am so ready!	Oh yeah? I'm sure you are, because that's the only thing I've ever wanted to do. What kind of job?"
"I don't normally prepare for interviews, but I really want this job, so I put in a lot of practice.	I would too. I have interviews coming up and I just want to make sure I have it!"
"I went to the fride and was surprised to find what I thought was an ice cream cake.	Oh no! I guess you didn't find one that day?"
"It turned out to not even be an ice cream cake.  It was some kind of pinapple cake.  I still had a piece but it was disappointing.	Wow, that sounds good but harsh"
"I was surprised when my wife left me	Oh no. What happened?"
"We were married for 10 years	Who was married to who?"
"I was annoyed when my family missed my birthday	Oh? Why was that?"
"Yeah that's very true. Doesn't mean we aren't important though	That's very true. Soldiers are an important part of society."
"Interestingly, I also had a job interview recently, although I've already heard back and I got it!	Congrats! What kind of job?"
"A lab manager for a Physics department at a University.	Oh wow, I was shocked when I learned I didn't get any overtime pay. That is very lucky of him to get away with it."
"I had a terrifying experience what using the restroom yesterday.	Oh no! What happened?"
"As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise.  When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.	Oh wow, I guess you were a little curious about what it was."
"When I was younger, my dad got into a motor cycle accident. It made me not want to learn how to drive for almost 2 years.	Was he okay?"
"I did learn, but it took a long time to overcome my fear. I'm glad I eventually did!	I'm glad you finally did something about that!"
"I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience, and not altogether pleasant.	Oh no! How old do you think your car is? Mine is 22."
"Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard, but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident.	That's great. Before we know it, he'll be telling us all how to do everything."
"In college I was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper.	That is terrible. Why did she do that?"
"It's ok.  I'm basically over it now, but it was really angering then.	You'll find the right one someday."
"I was grateful when I married my wife	that is a great feeling how did you meet she was?"
"We met at a store	That's great, I was never too good at socializing, only best friends. I hope you stay in touch."
"When I was in college an older woman in a class of mine stole my ideas for a paper.	i was so shocked!"
"Well, ranted about it to my girlfriend for a while then talked to the professor to make it clear what she did.	That's all you need, though. Have you had trouble talking to her about it, Tao?"
"My family and I are close to aquiring a new home.	That's exciting! I've been looking for a new home too. Are you excited?"
"IIt is an older home in need of some repairs.  We can't wait to get started on renovations.	Great, are you thinking of buying it outright?"
"I was excited when I bought my car	That's awesome! I just got my new car! Was it stressful?"
"It was a mustang. I saved up enough money and purchased it outright	Sounds like a good bet. Do you like it?"
"I was fast asleep this morning when my cat pounced on me and jolted me awake.	oh wow! were you scared?"
"It came out of nowhere. I almost fell out of bed!	Oh my, do you know what might have caused it?"
"I'm feeling a little down right now. The weather is perfect, but I miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset. Those were great times!	Same, hope it gets a little better. Maybe you should take some time for yourself and think about all that went into it, right?"
"Yeah, we would take a bottle of wine with us, watch the surfers and just kick back. Wish those days would return.	It always makes me feel good to see my old friends in good spirits"
"Maybe one day. That was when I lived in Northern California - the best place on the planet, imho!	I am confident that I will win that spelling bee tomorrow	wow thats good"
"I have. I've studied for 3 week now	Must you be pretty tired?"
"I've been trying lately to potty train my youngest daughter.	How old is she?"
"It's been a challenge.  Yesterday she got on the toilet herself though.  She said she didn't want to be a baby anymore.	Oh no! My little ones can sometimes be such challenge. I am sure she will make it."
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a while.  Dropping her off at the airport was really hard.	Oh she's not used to such a break? How long she was away"
"Yeah, we talk by text all the time and call every day.  It's still hard though, we haven't been apart longer than a couple days since we met.	I bet it will still be alright. It's ___ weather across the country now."
"I was sad when my dog died	I'm so sorry. I know how that can be."
"Its ok. It's just been rough without him. I miss him	I am sorry, i also missed my pet. is he home?"
"My wife is coming home after being out of the country for 2 months.  I can't wait!	Expecting them is always a bit strange, what are they returning too?"
"I am!  We've never been apart this long, so it's been tough.	My husband quit his job and is living with me. I met on a dating app and have been together for 6 years. I really want to find someone like you!"
"I was afraid when I watched a horror film	was it scary?"
"Some have pop ups and they are creepy	Oh, yes, I have had that experience as well. What did you do?"
"I'm going on vacation for the first time in several years!	That's great! Where are you going?"
"I'm taking a cruise to Alaska. I'm soooo excited.	Wow! I've never been on a cruise, but I've always wanted to go to Alaska. I've heard so much good things about this trip, so I hope you enjoy it!"
"My wife is coming back into the country at the end of the weeks after 2 months away.  I can't wait!	wow that is awesome! where does she fly back to?"
"Germany for a language course.	That's pretty cool. I bet you'll be proficient in no time."
"I was prepared for tonights big dinner	ohh, what's the occasion?"
"It's going to be at my house. We are going to have a lot of food	Nice, I love cooking for family. Do you have all of your cooking classes done already?"
"I was terrified when I watched that horror movie	Me too. And I still do think about it. I guess I was more scared for no reason."
"It was Scream	Oh boy! I thought it was one of those old MGM movies?"
"I was digging through some old stuff I had and I found letters that my wife wrote me when we were still dating. They were so sweet.	That is awesome! These letters can be so sentimental."
"Yeah! It gave me all of the feels. I read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again.	That is great. I too have fallen in love with my neighbor's dog before. I hope you continue to cherish your time with her!"
"I managed to spook myself really bad once watching too many horror movies and being in a house alone by the woods.	Oh no! That is a terrible thing to do. Was someone in the house?"
"Yeah.  I kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods.	That would make me so angry! I never thought anything of the sort, and now I'm angry elwope"
"I'm so proud of my wife	aww she must be a keeper!"
"She really is	I don't know if I could ever buy a dress for a man."
"I was angry when my son destroyed my car	you must be upset"
"no not salvagable. i had to buy a new one.	Well that's good. You can always get a new one next time."
"its okay. gave me an opportunity for a new adventure	I'm starting a new job next week, and while I am excited, I am also very nervous!	OH and how do you feel about it?"
"That's true, but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous.	I feel the same way. I don't know what will happen next."
"I had to go out of town and leave my dogs with a friend, I was worried about them.	oh no.... that is sad. I am so sorry. I hope you can find a new friend soon!"
"Yeah.  They annoyed my friend some, but overall it was fine.	Your friend is very appreciative of the favor."
"My wife has been in Germany for 2 months.  I can't wait till she gets home.	Oh, that's sweet, I bet you are proud."
"It sucks, but it's best to keep busy with whatever you can.  Videogames helped a lot :P	I watched a lot of movies as a kid. I remember looking forward to the end of the line as a kid."
"My wife has been out of the country for 2 months.  She's coming back soon, but it's been tough without her.	That must be refreshing, as most people aren't compatible like you."
"I'm looking forward to it :)	Im excited for you! Enjoy your day!"
"I'm planning on moving to a new city, but I'm starting to get cold feet.	I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you getting ready to move?"
"I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there?	You will be happy in your new city though"
"One of the things I had to do when I started my job was be in charge of moving a department.  When we were doing it, one of my coworkers bailed on me.	Oh no! Did you let him off early?"
"There were others, but we needed all the help we could get.	Yeah, I worked very hard to get where I am. It really does stink that someone got to before you."
"Everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! That movie was so amazing, I feel like i was holding my breath the whole time	a boring movie is ok, my opinion is, a quiet movie is good also, what movie did you like the most?"
"omg, you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it, it's about aliens	Oh the aliens! Oh my gosh! You should go see it!"
"it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff, and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it.	It sure is! I miss the days of having to work for my own stuff!"
"Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice.	Yeah, it's a good time to spread the word and get in your neighbors yard more often. It's a lot of fun to yell and yell."
"I was disgusted when I noticed the food on the table	What did you eat?"
"It was brussel sprouts and Liver	Oh, that sounds so good. Do you know where they got them?"
"I have a lab mix and he is so well behaved and listens to commands so well. I'm glad I got him as a puppy.	Awww, you lucky girl! I have a boy with a lot of issues, so will bet your dealing with a dog who is most likely very loving and loyal to you. Glad you got him :)"
"oh yea. Basically started the day we got him. That definitely helped.	I really feel for you. I had to ship 18 people in a row to get my daughter interested in the military."
"Yes. I couldnt' handle a dog I have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff.	Yeah I feel you. I'm stuck with two bosses at the moment - my boss and my boss's boss. I actually just had a bit of a argument with my boss yesterday, over what to do about all this nonsense about ""trigger warnings"" and ""safe spaces"" and ""you can't have this stuff on here"" blah, blah, blah. It's getting really bad. Have you"
"My friend just recently moved to California...It makes me sad because I have always wanted to live there.	I'm sure your hard work and dedication will be rewarded!"
"Yeah...I really am. I've wanted to live there since I was a little girl. Someday I will!	I hope you have a great experience there. I would be nervous to live in a city with no history/context"
"When I was planning my wedding, the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication.	That sounds terrible. Did you make any adjustments beforehand?"
"Yeah, we dropped them with enough time to find someone else, but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.	pts :) how did you find your friend?"
"It is so frustrating having to deal with difficult customers that don't want to pay their bills/	Yeah it really is. I've been in that position with several people I've worked with. It's very frustrating. Did you call to arrange to have the customer pay in full?"
"Normally I would agree. It only seems to be a few here and there. Most of the time I dont have problems.	Most people arent that lucky"
"We are a retail outfit. So we have some big customers that pay on established terms.	I'm going overseas in 2 weeks! I will be on vacaion for 1 months and I just CAN NOT wait@	Wow! Congratulations, your a great person."
"Where did you go?	I went to Disney with my family."
"I just about had a figurative heart attack the other night.	sorry about that"
"I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door.	oh really, its weird, but its possible that it is just some dream scenario, that is very unlikely."
"I'm very annoyed because my friend didn't give me my money back	I don't blame you!"
"Yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back	You at least made your friend happy."
"I typically procrastinate when needing to pack for a trip. But this time I got my butt in gear and it's all done several days early.	No procrastination needed, that's excellent."
"Thanks. I usually get somewhere and realize I forgot a bunch of stuff I need cause I packed in a rush 30 minutes before leaving.	I used to have an 80 year old that did the same thing"
"Fortunately, my wife usually comes to the rescue on me.	it is always good when your partner is there for you"
"My wife was working yesterday, but she ended up taking the rest of the day off to spend time with me! I was shocked.	I bet you were! How old are you?"
"We did! We went out for lunch and hung out on the beach. It was very relaxing and a nice change.	That sounds great! I love going to the beach!"
"I went to a restaurant my wife really likes with some friends while she was at work.  It's not a big thing, but I felt a little bad about it :P	I understand."
"Not like really bad, just kind of bad that I went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn't go.  It's not a big deal, but I feel bad when I do things like that.	Yea, you should try and avoid those things in the future at least."
"That horror movie made me terrified	I like the ones with blood and guts. I can watch them sometimes"
"Scream	Oh no, I hope you're okay!"
"I really want to have another baby. Baby fever is real lol I don't want to be all crazy about it, don't wanna track ovulation and do all this but i really wanna get pregnant asap	It's an exciting time for anyone, especially when you know you want to have kids. With that said, it's extremelydifficult to know when you're going to ovulate and when you'll get the test result! I wish you luck and pray you get the results soon!"
"thank you :) oh yeah, you can track ovulation, measure basal body temperature, etc. I'm not gonna go into details	That's so exciting! I hope you're doin something wonderful for your future self!"
"My mom bought be a book online.  It should be here today I'm just waiting on the delivery man.	That's great! What book was it?"
"Yes it is.  She wanted two options so I wouldn't know which she'd pick.  She picked the right one so now it's just a waiting game.	sounds like yolo"
"It is nice to have in-laws that are accepting and loving. So many people don't have a good relationship with their in-laws.	Yes, many people have forgotten what a great in-laws are."
"Aw I'm sorry. Mine is only a few years old but it's been smooth sailing so far.	Yea that happens to all the youngsters. They like the company of old friends."
"I have been trying to get my oldest son to be more responsible.  I started out small by asking him to adopt a good sleep schedule.  After several weeks he still hasn't.	That's very admirable of him!  It can be tough getting kids to live by certain policies and schedules, but I'm glad he's starting to see that it's something he has to live by as well!"
"He does well enough in school.  I think that might make him think he doesn't need any disciple in everyday life.  Make me worry a bit.	I agree, think about it as a kind gesture."
"My wife usually sniffs out anything going on, but I was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing.	That's quite ingenious. Were you able to do it on your own?"
"Yes. Friends, family, cake, all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.	Oh, well that is pretty nice of her, sounds like she has a good friend in someone else."
"Thank you. Probably wont be able to do it again, but happy it worked this time.	I am so grateful for my wife	Why? What did she do?"
"She really is! I couldn't be where I am without her	I hope you still have the time to celebrate with her."
"I can handle, bees, scorpions, wasps, crickets, and spiders.  But for some reason I lose my mind around roaches.	They do have a tendency to lose their minds sometimes. I would get rid of them with Mace."
"I take some conselation in that, however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.	oh yea i can relate lol"
"I feel guilty because I couldn't go to my friends party	Oh no. Why couldn't you?"
"I was working and I couldn't leave early	Aw I'm sorry to hear that. Sounds like you had a busy day."
"As a momma's boy I always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time.	I'm sure you were a much bigger presence in her life than I realized. How did you cope with it?"
"Fortunately, she rarely was gone for long periods of time, but I always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do.	It sounds like she was a very dependable person"
"Oh it's great.	I am so excited about going to the movies	Oh that's nice. What are you planning on seeing?"
"I'm going to see the purge. I have been waiting to see it for a while	i never even heard of purge, have you been purged before?"
"I saw a homeless lady and i felt so bad for her because it was so hot outside so went to five guys and bought her some food and cold drinks	Well that was rude of you! I don't understand why people are so selfish"
"blessing bags?? what are those?	they's those little plastic bags that a lot of animals use to take food to the hungry. i love my blessing bags"
"wow that's a great idea! I will do the same! thanks for sharing	The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.	That's so interesting! What was the puzzle? I'm always envious of people who can piece together puzzles."
"Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it, so I don't really know which one, but you can find a bunch on there.	Yeah, I hear Etsy is really popular these days. I never knew people could spend real money on things they actually use."
"Well, what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems, and I was right.	Well, glad you had fun."
"Six days in all, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.	Wow, that's nice. You're an avid travelogt, what did you do?"
"It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas, some with free coffee!	That's good. It's not too bad in the morning but certainly after waking up lots of times since the beginning."
"Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!	Exactly! I try and stay awake during the night!"
"I have big renovation plans for my house.  I've made a money plan and have kept to it so far.	that's sound, I hope your work is worth the money!"
"Yes, hopefully it will all go as planned.  So far so good.	Yes, it is great to work for a company that cares so much about you!"
"I was so anxious for my kid to graduate	That's great! I'm sure you were super proud of them."
"It did. I'm very proud of him	Will he be taking Advanced Placement? I bet you're proud."
"I didn't really try to use weight but i started going to the pool and i actually lost a couple of lbs	That sounds awesome! I'm glad youre feeling better!"
"it's really fun and it's also a great exercise! Plus water is so relaxing	! Oh fun! I've never heard of water as an exercise - let me check my work out first. Maybe you could throw on some running shorts and a t-shirt and go for a run!"
"I hope when I get older, Im not lonely as I am now	That can be a very happy thing. I have that feeling from my mom."
"I was engaged but my woman left me	oh no! did you find a new woman?"
"I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.	Is that a favorite of yours? He's actually one of my favorites too!"
"Yeah, for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.	I remember those games too, they were fun"
"I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.	Yeah, I know how you feel. I've been in that shoes, really bad. What did you do?"
"True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.	I really understand that, I have a trick for that, but I have to find the right bean."
"K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there, but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.	Yea I went through that too with my wife recently and she had to call the police to get me to the hospital. You don't want to go in that house, i hope you stay away from it as much as possible."
"It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.	I am sure it was very scary to you. I am sorry you had that experience. I hope it was an anomaly."
"Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified, but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.	I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.	I use stitcher for a while then I moved to the Napster of the radio business. I have not heard a thing since."
"Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie, and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.	If it's not on there anymore, it's not any good. Maybe try to find a ticket scalper and bring him the extra fee."
"My eldest niece, who helps take care of her younger disabled sister, graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.	That's great. One that young she knows how important grades are and obviously cares more about her work than anyone"
"Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.	oh thats amazing you must be so proud of her"
"I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.	I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.	if its not too much then enjoy the experience"
"Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.	I know I would be apprehensive as well. I hope it works out for you."
"I really wanted to try bison meet and I went all the way to that whole foods store like 57 miles away and they didn't have it, what a waste of time	Oh that sounds terrible. I hate it when meet and greets are wasted."
"thank you! I hope i can find it somewhere locally. i've heard bison meat is very lean and good	I haven't, but I'm sure you will find it!"
"My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.	Do you dinner with him all the time?"
"Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.	I can see that, I try not to be too obtrusive with my kids"
"It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.	Oh yeah, that's got to be tough! You must really miss him."
"I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(	I guess hope is a pretty terrible thing to be"
"I once walkd around the grocery store without knowing my fly was down.	Uh oh, that is a very scary situation. Fly's aren't very good when you're not in the know."
"I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.	That's a cute story. Did you like the mom?"
"It's been a hard day today, its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.	Oh no, I know how that goes. Your husband shouldn't even be out of the house if he's not the center of attention. I felt the same when my husband was away for the Olympics."
"In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!	that's so true. i wish I could just imagine what your family is going through."
"My young niece, who is disabled, was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.	was she alright? do you still have to pay for her?"
"Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.	That's so terrible. I can't imagine how hard that is!"
"It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too, but they live in Scotland.	I have this cat that loves to cause issues	Oh no, have you tried taking him to the vet?"
"Like last night. She decided that she wanted to jump on the table	I see, well hopefully she had a good time!"
"I have tried to complete a work assigment three times now without sucuess.	That's a lot of tries. What are you most frustrated about?"
"Doubtful.  I will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull.	I'm sorry about that. I hope it works out for you."
"I couldn't go to movies to watch The greatest showman when it came out so my husband bought this movie when it came out. he is sweet	Aww, that's quite a thoughtful and thoughtful gesture! Is your husband into anime?"
"it's called The Greatest Showman. it's a musical! So good!! I watched it so many times already	Awww I've been thinking about doing one of those. If I ever win an Emmy's. I'm definitely going to give it a try"
"A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would.	wow that's awful, were you still able to have lunch with them?"
"It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker.	hope it works for you"
"That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover.	My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.	oh, that has been a thing for a while now"
"Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.	Oh boy, I imagine that was a while lol"
"It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.	That's pretty awesome! Do you like where the house is/?"
"After such a long time we certainly will.  I can't wait to start making the house into our home.	I certainly hope you do, too! I'm almost thirty, and I've moved around quite a bit, so I feel like I'm still a little baby in the making."
"Our pet cat will need to be put down soon.	Oh my goodness, that's so sad to hear."
"Yes we've had her since the begining.  She is older now and has suffered with feline AIDS for awhile.	That's such a shame. I hope your cat has a speedy recovery."
"It really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street	It is a sad situation. We need to end it."
"I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity	that's great, I'm glad you're doing good"
"My husband shocked me the other day	What did he do?"
"He threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death!	Oh wow, how scary! Did you get a good look at his or her?"
"I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.	I agree, how long have you two been together? Can you just tell him how you feel?"
"No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?	Of course I have, and you should feel proud of yourself."
"I was planning to view the stars last night, but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.	I am sorry, I am sure you have other things to do"
"It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.	pending a hearing and a possible bail review, i'm sure this is going to be a very long and drawn out process."
"A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.	I hope it goes smoothly. Do you have kids of your own?"
"Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.	I can understand that. I don't have kids yet but I know how that feels."
"My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!	I also can't decide if I'm a girl or a boy. If you could take one thing away from this conversation, what would it be?"
"I'm sure that's hard at times. I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.	Do you have siblings and if so how close are they?"
"I am dreading the two hour trip to the grocery store this week.	OH no. Do you have any plans that day?"
"Me too!! Being so far out, it takes forever to get anywhere. I miss civilization lol.	Yep. I'm sure you will find someone soon though."
"We are workcamping in the mountains of NM. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours to get anywhere lol. We havent seen new faces around here in months lol.	im really exited to go to disneyland on vacation next summer	I love Disney! Where are you going?"
"yes im staying at the hotel for the first time i am really happy	That's a good feeling! I am sure you will enjoy your new home."
"I finished a class and most of my classmates got an A! It took a lot of work.	Well that's great. It's great to work hard."
"It sure does! I am so proud of the hard work that everyone put in!	yeah that's always good! I'm glad it's paying off for you!"
"I have the best kids in the world.	That's wonderful. What makes them so great?"
"Lots of little stuff.  They love to draw me pictures, crack jokes, and give lots of kisses.	That sounds so fun!"
"My husband has been putting in so many extra hours at work	What does he do?"
"Oh I am pampering the heck out of him! It got him a promotion!	aww that is awesome, i hope he reciprocates"
"I just got laid off from my job. I need the paycheck so this is not a good situation.	I am so sorry to hear that! Your feet are going to have to find other jobs but I know that your heart is in the right place. Hopefully this isn't too bad for you and that you'll keep being offered things."
"I am going to apply for new positions. Hopefully I will get something soon.	Thats wonderful news. Good luck and I am sure you will be very successful."
"I work in I.T.! Thanks for asking!	I just applied for a new job! It is a job that I have always wanted.	That's great! I am so happy for you! What is the job?"
"Thank you! Have you ever applied to your dream job?	Yes. I interviewed for a dream job in interviews a few years ago."
"i ahte when my Girlfriend goes to the club alone	It is not good for the relationship."
"Yeah it makes me really jelous when guys talk to her	yes! even though I am a quiet guy i love interaction with other people"
"When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!	That sounds so cool! Did you guys ever bump into each other again?"
"It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!	Was he staying at your place?"
"We certainly did. Where I was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs, restaurants etc. so we'd go to the beach and then party at night. Brilliant fun!	My Keurig just died. This is the third coffee pot in less than a year!	Oh no! I know how you feel. Everyone loses something when they buy a new thing. Ironic that it was the Keurig that I bought."
"I agree! I am so disgusted right now!!! We drink a lot of coffee lol. Its a 2 hour drive to the closest town to get another one too.	Oh man. I'm so sorry. Maybe you can find work around or maybe you'll go back to roasting your own beans."
"We travel fill-time in our RV so I don't really have room to carry a back up. I hope our next location is more accessible to civilization.	I just had to move across country to a new job.	why is that?"
"I am actually! I was so ready for it. I basically studied moving so that everything would be easy	That's great! I'm sure it's going to be a lot of fun."
"One day my daughter got off the bus and was crying. An older boy intentionally tripped her as she got off the bus and she got hurt. This made me very upset and mad!	Wow that's messed up. Is she okay now?"
"He just thought it would be funny! He was also several years older than her and a teenager. Too old to know better!	It's so sad. The most you can do is hold onto them and make sure they don't forget a thing."
"We recently found out that our 15 year old son has a rare, degenerative neurological disease.	My condolences to your family. :( DO they have a hope for him?"
"No, the doctors tell us there is no cure. They are trying to treat the symptoms but thus far its been unsuccessful.	Im so sorry to hear that. I wish you luck and know that you will get better."
"Thank you, its been scary. He has good days and bad.	The door bell rang last month. I wasn't expecting anyone, but it was my daughter and her family from way up north.	That is fun! You must have a lot of good memories up there!"
"I couldn't believe it. It had been almost a year since I saw them and she never even gave me a hint they were coming.	Am so sorry to hear that. Have you tried discrediting the person who put food in the fridge?"
"I've studied hard all night in order to make myself ready for tomorrow's test	That's a good strategy. Do you feel like you did well?"
"Repititions and exposure are my strategies.  Sumer semesters really ramp things up.	Indeed. When I took my first sutction in school, it ramped things up as well."
"Going through an unused drawer I found old drawing from when my kids were little	That's a cute thing to do. Was this for a school project?"
"While the actual incidents of each drawing are lost in time it did make me think back to when they were younger.	I agree, it's interesting to look back. Which drawings have you drawn before?"
"I just had my husband remind me of when I fainted when he proposed!	Ah okay that might be a good thing! Are you a bit jealous? It's a pretty typical reaction to a first proposal."
"I was so happy when I saw him get down on one knee that I just blacked out lmao	haha I dont know why people are so stupid. im sorry for your loss."
"The news announced a tornado warning. I ignored it at first, but then the city tornado siren went off.	Nice! Are you in a dangerous part of town?"
"I almost panicked as the winds started to gust, but thankfully it missed us. A few miles up the road weren't so lucky though. Always listen to those warnings	I can imagine. I would have been so scared. Hang in there."
"I got a new puppy for my birthday! She is a cutie!	What type of dog is she?"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	That's a pretty name. How old is she?"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	That's a pretty adorable name. How old is she?"
"My neighbor ran into my car! They didn't even leave a note!	I hate when that happens! Did you call the police?"
"I could tell by the color of the paint left on my car, and their car now has a scrape with the color of my car. I don't know what to do.	You should get a paint remover."
"A thunderstorm raged all of last night! It kept me awake all night!	Oh my! I am sorry! I am afraid I have never had to endure a thunderstorm!"
"It is quite frightening! I wish that I could overcome my fear.	Yeah, it's probably because you're in a scary movie. I'm sure it will make you scared again, though."
"I just applied for graduate school! I feel good about my chances!	You must be a very confident person to be so confident. I am sure you will get it."
"Thank you! I am very excited! It is quite unsettling though.	oh thats cool"
"I remember just taking a deep breath the other day in the garden and just feeling happy	ah thats a good thing"
"I have a garden so fully packed that I can't see my neighbors at all!	oh no that must be frustrating"
"My neighbor really helped me out recently after a big windstorm.	That's great that someone in your situation was helpful."
"No, they generously helped me clean up my yard and cut up a tree with their chainsaw, and they asked for nothing in return.	Wow. You should buy a chainsaw some time."
"My son just graduated from high school! He has worked so hard, and he even earned a scholarship.	That is wonderful. You must be so proud of him!"
"Thank you! He is going to study Computer Science!	That's great! Sometimes they can't handle the stress of it all, so they blow the calculator out of proportion. Again, good job."
"I am taking a trip to Disney World next month! My wife is going for the first time!	I am happy for you! I am sure it will be a great time for you and your family!"
"I have been a couple of times before, and it is such a magical place! Where are you planning on taking a trip to?	To the Caribbean, but I want to go back to my childhood place in Texas!"
"I slipped and fell in the restroom last week. The floors desperately needed cleaned.	Oh, that's awful! Are you okay? Were you scared?"
"The only thing to get injured was my pride. It was quite the gross experience.	Ah I see. Well sometimes pride takes refuge in the most disgusting places."
"The other day Comcast customer service kept me waiting for 20 minutes just to speak with someone. What a disgrace!	That is so annoying, they are so rude, I would give anything to stay with them."
"They're awful. If they'd just employ enough cs people to handle the volume you could just about bear it!	yep us too if we work hard we can get by"
"Mind you, their product is useless too. Ok, rant over!	Queue jumping is something which irks me no end. I was at the deli counter of my local store recently and some guy came up and started ordering. The employee served him, too.	Ah, that's embarassing. Did he apologize to you or the manager?"
"Yes. And I'm disabled and it's hard to stand for a long time while some idiot gets his lunch. I hope it was horrible!	I think he got a discount for being disabled. I think most people just get two lunches."
"Perhaps salmonella poisoning? One can only hope, lol!	I am very glad we headed the warnings and evacuated prior to Hurricane Harvey.	That's good. Is your neighborhood in Palm Beach County nicer than your neighborhood in west Houston?"
"Yes it was a scary time. We stocked up on food and bottled water and moved our RV about an hour and a half inland. Luckily the storn went to the north of us.	i'm glad it wasn't too bad, it must have been very expensive to fix"
"Our Rv is our home, we are full-time Rvers! Thank you so much! Have you ever been through an evactuation? Did you feel prepared?	This past Mother's Day my husband gave me some wonderful unexpected gifts! He even got me a gorgeous diamond ring.	That's so sweet. What did you get in the mail?"
"I was! It was so thoughtful and sweet, and I was very touched by it.	You deserve a cuppa!"
"My parents are going to a tea room for their anniversary.	on no! what are you going to do if you dont want to go!"
"No that is where they decided to go but the thing is I called the place and they can't accommodate my special diet I am on.  I am so sad b/c that means I can't go with the.	Special diets are very restrictive and they can cause all sorts of health problems. I hope you can find a way to go with them - it's hard to go with someone you don't know well."
"I am very excited for the arrival of our 7th grandbaby!	Oh, that's exciting! Is it a boy or a girl?"
"Thank you, I try to be the best Nana I can be. We are hoping she comes while we are visiting for Christmas!	Thats so good. I wish friends in good stead."
"Thank you so much! I surely will.	My dad has early onset dementia	i am so sorry to hear that!"
"Yes, I try my hardest to be caring and patient with him b/c I know he doesn't mean to be harsh or hard to deal with at times.	Sometimes it can be really hard to teach them all at once, but it teaches them well in the long run! That's awesome!"
"At work today, all my coworkers sang me happy birthday. It was so nice of them!	That is so nice! I'm sure it was a nice surprise."
"It was so thoughtful of them. I didn't even mention it was my birthday.	I bet you'd be upset about someone else getting the spotlight. Like a jealous neighbor."
"I don't know. But they sure wen't above and beyond!	I took a huge test today and man it made me so nervous. I really hope I did well on it.	I hope you did too! Think you did okay?"
"I did, I studied every day for week! I almost wore myself out studying.	It's great to have that discipline."
"I really hope so, I am so nervous while I wait for my results.	I am so proud of my son	Aw, good for him! How did you raise him?"
"He got the highest score on a test	How did you do?"
"My husband usually gets a big bonus around this time of the year. We are eagerly waiting, hoping, and waiting for it!	I hope it comes sooner rather than later!"
"It is! It's not a guarantee though, so it's just a waiting game, and not easy.	I honestly wish the best for you, so you know that it will work out and that you are doing things the right way."
"I am so angry that my brother didnt come to my party	Oh that sucks. Were you guys close?"
"I am not sure. I just don't know why he didn't show	Then it wouldn't have been a problem for you to go ahead and buy it now"
"I am confident that I will have a great day tomorrow	Oh yea? What's going on?"
"That is so true. Getting to know you also makes it seem like a great day already leading to tomorrow.	Hahaha! Good times. I wish i had kids."
"I have trusting issues because my fiance left  me	How long were you together?"
"I know but it's so hard because no one wants to be with me	Don't feel bad, most guys want that, too. The problem is, most girls don't want you either."
"Flying typically doesn't bother me too much, because I love travel. However I was a bit concerned on a flight once right after a travel advisory had been issued.	it can be scary right"
"Well i did have a few of those. It went fine. I was still nervous even after we landed in a foreign country. I just watched my surroundings. Everything went great.	Thats awesome! I would be nervous too flying in foreign places. at least you had a good time!"
"I am so lonely right now because no one wants to be with me	Why aren't you getting any flack for that?"
"Yeah, but no luck	Dang, it sure is hot out!"
"when i was younger I was really getting into graphic design and really wanted a new Apple computer. I knew my parents couldnt afford it, but they somehow made it happen and surprised me on Christmas..	Apple are pretty savvy about supporting kids nowadays, it must be nice to have such a great product"
"yea my parents are pretty great. Pretty maddening at times, but I wouldn't trade them.	What are they like? My husband and I tried to get out of our first deal and ended up moving because we weren't happy."
"I hope to be there one day and see it from that side.	i felt really good when i won a poker tournament last week	I have never won a game of poker"
"yes it was, it took a long time to do but at the end it was worth it	That must've been a lot of hard work! I'm glad you guys got to enjoy that."
"Spiders is one of my gratest fear they make me so scared	I hate spiders!"
"i have tried to overcome my fear but i just cant they make my skin temble	I am no longer afraid but I sure would be if I were you! I have a friend who recently passed and just started having panic attacks so you might want to try and talk to him after to help him get unstressed."
"i am impressed that video games grow so much every year	Yes, it seems like every couple years that they triple the size."
"that is a great game the growth on video games has been amazing this past few years	Yes, since the NES there has been a huge explosion in the amount of video games we can enjoy."
"We went out to dinner for our first anniversary and they got our order all wrong.	That's so sad. What did they end up cooking?"
"Thank you. The restaurant came highly rated by a lot of people so I guess my expectations were high. I tried not to let it bother me.	well done"
"My wife flew home to see family. It is very quite at home now.	oh, that's nice! it's a good thing that she's happy"
"I know, that would of been nice! Instead I was all alone for the last few weeks.	It get better with time i think"
"Me too, a home doesn't feel like a home without a woman.	i am really impressed everytime i see my nephew on how fast he is growing	Yeah, that's a good thing. I always see little kids grow so fast and then they're just barely walking."
"yeah but i dont see him very often maybe that is why i always get shocked when i see him	I understand that, I have a roommate who is a musician and he is the most expressive person I have ever met. I hope you have some ""time to catch your breath"" before you start to date again."
"When I got the phone call that my mom had cancer I was so upset.	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Who did you call and where did she get her cancer from?"
"It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.	its funny how times have a different take on things these days"
"one of the best days of my life was when i graduated from high school	That's a great accomplishment! I bet you were proud."
"i know right time goes really fast and you dont even noticed, for me it was 13 years ago	That's a long time ago for sure!"
"The other night I was driving home in the rain and slid into the guard rail. It is going to cost so much to get my car fixed!	Oh no, slid into something? I've never heard of a sliding object. Was you able to get it fixed?"
"I know, I will have to be more careful next time. I shouldn't eat ice-cream while driving,	That's what I did the other day. I shouldn't have eaten it, but I shouldn't be overdoing it either. I only eat ice-cream when I'm really hungry."
"It will still move, but I can't steer very well with the front tires missing.	There is a tornado coming. But I have the pantry full and am ready this time.	Oh wow. I hope you're ready for it. Are you in an area that gets storms bad?"
"You never know how long the power might be out for!	If you have a timer in the breaker panel, you KNOWS it's out!"
"It could take a while for any sort of rescue to come!	I had a pretty large loan, with a bit of a high interest rate, and a high monthly payment. My mother decided to pay it off for me, out of the blue!	Wow! That is wonderful! You must have felt so special when she did that."
"Yes, I couldn't believe it. She's so sweet and giving, but I sure didn't expect her to do that!	As you are I know it is a great feeling when you get what you want"
"My husband is the most faithful man I know	Awww good for you! What makes you say that?"
"I have so many health problems and he is always there for many no matter what being loving and caring	That is very sweet. I wish I had a like-minded friend."
"I left the front door unlocked and the mailman robbed me. I couldn't believe I would do that.	That's terrible! What did you do?"
"Only my pride! I wasn't at home when he robbed me. He took a lot of valuables.	I'm so sorry. Will you be okay?"
"I hope so! A federal worker like that should have more integrity!	I have always been afraid of snakes i dont know what to do to control my fear for them	I'm sorry, I think your situation is much more with reptiles than snakes for reptiles. Have you considered getting a reptile and watching it from time to time?"
"yes, i one time i was taking a hike and 3 meters to my left was a rattle snake i jumped like a rabbit and ran back to my friends	Wow, that is scary! Sounds like you must have been very nervous."
"I was annoyed when my wife left me	On purpose?"
"Yeah its been a rough 2 weeks for me	I'm sorry to hear that, it's going to be so nice to have some rest after this week!"
"I was afraid when I went into the movies alone	were you scared you would be followed?"
"Because I have always been with someone, so going in alone just frightened me	I guess going alone may be a bit too risky"
"I've been married almost 23 years. My husband travel so much, but we both have trust in each other to be true and loyal.	That's so sweet! marriage is very hard indeed"
"for his job. So, it can be hard, but we trust each other.	That's a great setup! I hope you get a better paying job, that's always a plus."
"I am hopeful that my friend will be able to make it to my party	Okay, where are they supposed to be staying now?"
"It is to me because he is my best friend	I get it. Do you not like them anymore?"
"I have been exercising and taking care of myself more lately.	That's great! How do you feel about it?"
"I think many do, but man does it feel good.	better than smoking weed"
"I am joyful that I am with my wife	That is a good feeling I am glad to hear."
"We have been together for 10 years	That's impressive. Do you have any children together"
"I felt pretty luck the other day! I won $100 on a scratch off ticket! I never win!	That is pretty lucky! Do you sometimes win on these types of things?"
"Not usually, I never win. so, it was very unexpected.	Im sure it was. But, it would be surprising if it wasn't. It's good it it was unexpected."
"My sister was given $1,000 by my grandma as a graduation present. She did not give me a penny.	Wow, that would make me cry. I am so sorry."
"Perhaps, I just don't understand why I was left out. Seems unfair.	Sounds fair to me. I wonder how they even found out?"
"We went on our vacation about a week ago to the beach and it rained several days while we were there. We wanted to go to the beach every day!	Oh wow, that does sound like a nightmare!"
"Yes, and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront! But, we still had a good time, just wished we could have had less rain!	yeah, the sandcastles were awesome! but yes, the beaches were fab!"
"I was given the opportunity to work at a new job that I was hoping to get! I never thought it would be possible!	That's great. You must have felt really excited and at ease."
"Thank you! I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity.	You should be proud of yourself! You have worked very hard and deserve this."
"I fell down in a mud puddle today while walking to lunch. I was covered in mud for the rest of the work day.	That is awful! Were you okay?"
"No kidding! It was hard to keep a good attitude for the rest of the day.	Im sure it was, but it is so nice to see someone that care for you like that. Its a great feeling to care for others"
"My husband works nights a lot right now.	That's terrible. How long does he work night shift?"
"It really is, i hate being alone at night.	i do too, i wish i could get out of bed and just focus on my problems at hand"
"A few, but he still has to sleep all day, makes doing things hard.	I'm anxious (if excited!) about an upcoming move -- we've lived overseas before, but this is such a different state and climate, I'm not sure what to expect!	wow I know the feeling! I was kind of scared for a few days when I first moved here, I hope everything goes well and i am able to find the perfect home :)"
"Alaska! We've got some transition time, but I've been doing deep research on Anchorage -- and the more I see, the more I like!	I live in Boston, so I've always had a soft spot for Alaska. She's so beautiful in the water!"
"I hate that people hit on others they know are married.	I agree thats when you should confront them about it."
"Right? Happens to my husband all the time and it's just frustrating.	I understand, especially with kids. Sorry to hear that."
"No, since it's his associates at work!!	i cannot wait for the next star wars movie to come out	I have not seen any of the new Star Wars movies."
"he is, i really like the new ones but always will like the old ones better	I prefer the older toys but say I like the new toys, I pick them instead."
"i hate when i fart in public it is so embarrasing	Yeah, farting can be pretty embarrassing."
"i can hold them but some of them are just accidental and it is the worst, depends on what i eat haha	Yeah, I guess if you know you're eating a lot of onions it can mess them up."
"My husband recently got me a great gift. He got me a beautiful 14 kt diamond ring! I had no idea he was.	that's a great gift, were you happy to get it?"
"Yes, it was so sweet and unexpected. We've been married almost 23 years so I guess I deserve it lol	Well kisses is just the beginning, make sure to give your wife two more soon!"
"i hate that people dont care and they just throw their trash on the street	That is what makes the streets so dangerous."
"if im walking i pick up as much as i can	That sounds fun! I like going through my old shopping malls and finding old toys and games I used to play with."
"i am extremely afraid of going near hiights	won't you be too anxious? don't forget the history with the South by Southwest and the shooting at Georgia."
"Yeah last year i went to disneyland and got on the elevator game and i almost cried hahaha	It's always worth the tears, at least they're not buried forever."
"The last job interview I went on also went well, but it took a long time to hear back from them.	I heard they are notorious for interviewing bad candidates. Hope you get a chance to work for them then."
"Oh, I did eventually, it just took like a month.  I ended up getting the job!	Awesome. I wonder how the interview went."
"i cant wait for my disneyland vacation next summer	That sounds exciting! do you have a large family?"
"i think me and my family is going there for 1 week it is going to be wonderfull	What will you do while you're gone?"
"i am getting my new car next week and cant wait for it.	That's awesome! What kind of car did you get?"
"it is a 2017 bmw, i traded in my old car to get an awesome deal	Oh so you're getting a new car is it a rust free one?"
"My in-laws are helping us pay for school clothes for our kids this year.	Nice! I heard once it rids very fast, it takes months to make."
"Yeah, it helps take some of the burden off of us. I will have to check out Goodwill and see if I can find anything.	I wish you the best of luck!"
"Wow, those prices are great. I'll be going by there for sure. Yeah, the best part about them helping, is that they do it, not expecting anything in return. They just all of us and want to help.	It's a great way to start"
"Yes, they are great.	I was in a college class once with an older woman.  She took a paper idea I had talked about and presented it as her own, stealing all the work I had done.	Oh that's the worst! Did you afterwards say something mean about her?"
"I did.  There wasn't much she could do, but at least I could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work.	That's great! That's what makes paper fun, isn't it?"
"i really hate when people make me wait for no reason	Why does waiting matter?"
"my girlfriend allways makes me wait, it makes me really anxious ahhahah	I've been there, it's terrifying. Are you in a hurry?"
"One of my best friends is moving far away and i dont know when i will be able to see him again	Oh no, how are you feeling about that?"
"yeah i can call him and email him, it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again	Call him and give him a call. Or maybe it works out well before the trip and you both fall off the face of the earth."
"I think having goals is important. My mother in law has managed to lose weight and walked daily.	Thats great! I wish I had a goal for the last few months I have been living off."
"Very similar ones, but I like focusing on others success	That makes sense. I don't want to focus on the negative parts of others. I want to stay positive and hopefully our success will be based on ourselves."
"It really does, hope any you have works out!	i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it	Me too, it breaks my heart. It's something I grew up too know about."

"I have an older friend who I try to help out.  She lost her husband a couple years ago.	How long ago did he lose his job?"
"We go out to lunch regularly.  She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.	I am sorry, I have been there too many times. What can I do for her right now?"
"Thanks.  Yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now.	We need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues, no matter your views.	Yes that is a great attitude to have!"
"Exactly, let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!	You are so right. I hate when that happens."
"I spent my first Christmas away from home in a computer lab, working by myself.	That must have been lonely. Did you cry there?"
"Yes, it wasn't very fun.  But I had to do it because my project for work was due the next day.	Well that's good. What kind of project was it? Hopefully it won't be one that is too difficult."
"I miss my dog Kat	how are you gonna get her back?"
"Yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year.  She was a great dog	Sorry to hear that. My dogs died a few years ago as well. But they're like family pets, you never lose them"
"Thanks.  I do miss coming home to her.  My cat is just not the same.	It's great to see my husband doing so well.	He seems like he's on the path to recovery :)"
"He's become the top manager in his division in just two years.	That's phenomenal. You must be proud."
"Hello, I am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets ... it is unacceptable	Oh no, I've heard that a lot lately. It's no fun! I worry I may have to move."
"I feel that pain ... as if I had been hit	That's terrible! If I may ask, where did you have fun at?"
"it's something since I was born ... I'm like that	That reminds me of the time I went to LA for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark.	I recently been to LA and it's a totally different animal. The police are much better there and it's much easier to get around the city by car."
"Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also.	That's great that they noticed atleast."
"I really miss my puppy, we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always.	That's so sweet. Did she pass away?"
"Yes, she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.	Sometimes children's birthday are so much fun and a nice way to remember the great people they have met along the way."
"my son is teething and he is so cranky! I gave him tylenol and got some teething toys. I don	That sounds so painful! Is he a boy or girl?"
"it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! Doesn't sleep good, doesn't want to eat. poor little boy	Aww, that's terrible. I hope you try to help him eat. I know it's rough."
"i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed. i didn't it's gonna be that hard. I think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college	It'll be a lot of work, trust me. I've been there."
"I hope so, i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face	I hear you! I love my baby feet! I'm so bad about it, but I think I just stay out of their way more than they'd like to believe. I'm sure you'll get over it soon enough!"
"I have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around Italy.	That would make me so jealous. How far have they been going?"
"I wish I were with them.  I love Italy	That's great! I wish I were there, too. I am so jealous!"
"Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.	I do too! I need to get away from it all and start a family somewhere."
"That is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures	My friend bought me lunch today	How nice of you. What did you order?"
"I had a nice burger and fries	I love fries. What kind of burger did you have?"
"Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch	I hate when people pull in front of you, especially when it's clear behidn you.	I know, it's really annoying and frustrating. It's worse when it's dark."
"Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.	Oh no! I'm so sorry!"
"yes, sadly I easily can.	I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy	I don't blame you! the dark is no fun"
"That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on	i do that as well"
"I like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs. They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.	That's cool. Hope they get a little bit of exercise too."
"They do. They get to smell the grass, they play they get their exercise, they get to have fun, they get to be a dog!	Wow! Is there anything about being a dog breed that you like?"
"Last night at like midnight the power cut out completely on my street	Oh no! I hope it was only for like 5 minutes!"
"We luckily had candles around! I was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power	Were you in a tight spot?"
"A while back my cat knocked over and broke my mothers urn.	Oh no! Did it smash into your house?"
"I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it	Yeah, I used to fix crashes with fulbox but that didn't help much and the experience was often frustrating."
"I made a bowl of cereal for breakfast and when i started eating i realized milk was spoiled!! I started gagging. it was so gross!	oh, thats a let down."
"don't you hate that? gosh, i didn't eat anything the whole day because i don't have an appetite anymore	Yeah I'm guilty of that sometimes too."
"I was so calm and happy the other night just listening to rain hitting the kitchen windows	That sounds so relaxing!"
"It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too!	Yea it helps calm me too"
"i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere	I'm so sorry to hear that. Is it an expensive car to fix."
"not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up	Oh wow. Well, I hope some one helps you out!"
"Though the odds are against you, I understand why people gamble. I remember a particular time I was playing video poker at a local dive bar.	I could see how that would be a lot of fun"
"Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!	That's insane, do you ever get nervous about the amount that you can spend before you hit that?"
"I honestly think New Orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the US. You never know what you are going to find around the corner.	Yes! It's crazy to be from New Orleans - they don't really have a reputation for crime or nasty stuff. The media doesn't really focus on them that much either, so you just keep cruising by without much thought put into what's around the corner. Have you been?"
"Mardi Gras is great, but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town, and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole, and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!	Oh my devil! I've heard the voice in the past too! Sometimes people say things you don't want to hear. Very weird."
"I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?	I know that feeling! I wish people would stop."
"You can say that again. One time, I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.	That was really mean. Now he's a junkie."
"1	What about 3?"
"sorry that was sent by an mistake	oh it was not an emergency"
"I don't think I am a judgmental person, but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day, and I can still smell it.	I can see how it would be hard on the smell"
"Trust me, this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off, they had running clean water, but no toilet indoors!	Holy crap! To top it all off, the place is dog proof. What did you do to quell your ire?"
"I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.	Oh boy, must've been a pretty cool day."
"I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.	oh really? its nice to know that you are spending a fair amount of time planning for the trip"
"I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at, the possibility looks good!	Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?	I have. I wasn't sure I could trust people, and it ended up being really helpful to know people better than me. Good for you for being able to realize that kind of knowledge!"
"That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!	That's so messed up. I would hate to have to deal with a party pooper"
"Not too long ago, my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it!	Wow, how sweet of her! That's crazy."
"Yes, I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought, I am blessed.	Yes she is. Everyone deserves someone like that."
"I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible	Are you okay?"
"I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me!	That's so awesome! I wish I had a husband like that!"
"So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!	That's great! Did you get everything done?"
"I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.	Is it because you have kids or because you have kids and cats? I can't stand cats that keep munching on things."
"And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!	ah that would be a nice change of pace"
"I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!	I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What was going on?"
"The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to	Daycare scares me. I have had that happen to be before."
"I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!	That's wonderful! What did you get in particular?"
"YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!	I can imagine it was, school can be such a bore sometimes."
"I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!	Yeah, it should be a good year for those online shipping things."
"Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!	Yeah, I heard the same thing! I always pick those off when in store."
"The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider	Oh my goodness! I would have screamed! What was it?"
"I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that!	Things you can't change like if you used better glass! I would definitely stay away from them"
"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	Oh no! I would have been too! Did you not enjoy it?"
"Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!	How weird! You must have been pretty hungry!"
"Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!	Wow! What a surprise. What are you going to do?"
"It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!	We finally made it this past year and a half and it started to feel real."
"When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.	maybe it was for something good maybe"
"He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!	You know he's a pretty smart person too, never doubt a thing, and is always correct."
"Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.	oh no thats terrible. did you wake up with a cold"
"I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!	Oh my goodness! That's horrible! Are you feeling okay now?"
"I don't know how you are with Calc, but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.	Calc is a bing bing. I can't stand the practice exams. What subject is it?"
"Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!	Wow. Must be a really smart girl."
"My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night	What did you do to get her to stop?"
"She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her!	Did you hear her?"
"I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27, I would have thought you were crazy.	It takes a lot of hard work. What do you study?"
"I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer, but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra, and was accepted to a state university two years ago!	That's great you were able to get that degree. What was the job result for?"
"i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college	Oh no! I'm sorry that happened to you! What was the college?"
"yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha	Oh you didnt get into Auburn? lol"
"My boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend...	... and now you guys are separated for the foreseeable future. Do you think that this is the beginning of your breakup?"
"Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her.	I'm sorry. Maybe you can pick a different girl?"
"i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years	They are getting bigger all the time."
"gaming has blown up this past couple of years	It's definitely something I enjoy doing, and something I could never do professionally."
"I love roller coasters, but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter.	That's too bad. I know it's tough when things you love close in on you, and it's no fun in the summer either."
"Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around, all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.	Yes, February is a great month for those that were close. I hope you remember them and have a great time together!"
"I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.	You sound very confident of that. What are you going for in a career?"
"I'm an Engineering major, electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?	Ha. Tech-enthusiast, bless my heart. What got you into engineering?"
"i really am thankful for everything that i have and had	That is good to hear. What keep you thankful?"
"it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little	what type of medal it is"
"he gave it to me beafore he went to the army, and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional	My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!	I know ropes well as my son plays it. does it frighten your son?"
"Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?	I do like to bowl but not as much as most people. It takes a lot of hard work."
"I keep hearing strange noises in my house. My husband is out of town and I'm all alone. There has been reports of break ins on my street.	That's scary! What's going on?"
"No I don't, I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!	Oh no! I hope your dog is okay!"
"So I suck hard at bowling, but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.	Bowling is hard! I really like the card games too!"
"Yeah, my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.	There's nothing worse than someone taking your fun! Thanks for saving the day, you deserve it."
"I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend, for various reasons, but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!	I'm so sorry that happened to you. Are you okay?"
"Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.	Yea I guess so, but you never know how their relationship is supposed to be. It's always best to be understanding and to be able to leave her knowing that you won't be able to change the past."
"I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.	I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have anyplace else to go?"
"No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.	That still doesn't explain why you're so down on yourself. You need to join a club for drugs in minors. It's a much better life."
"So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.	It can be tough at first, but once you get used to it's like new again. Don't worry about it too much."
"I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.	wow i am sorry to hear that, i hope you feel better about the whole situation"
"So college is starting up soon and I feel more ready than ever to do well this year!	I'm sure you are more prepared than ever! What are you studying?"
"Thanks, I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.	That's a shame. I know procrastination isn't fun but it can be hard to deal with in the long term."
"So I just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room. I feel very at ease.	Great, relaxing dinner usually does the trick."
"Surprisingly enough, a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!	Oh ok. I am sorry. I love pizza."
"my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart. i can't wait till these molars cut thru	That is heartbreaking. How old is he?"
"I do but he doesn't like them. he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad	I'm so sorry, that must be so hard."
"I think I will be very busy Monday night playing my new game.	What kind of game is it?"
"World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.	Oh ok. That sounds interesting. Have you ever met?"
"I come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing. It's very frustrating.	That is very frustrating. Have you thought about talking to a family member about this?"
"Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.	thats cute"
"I think storms are wonderful, except when the power goes out.	That's a tough problem to be afraid of."
"It was extra loud and my husband was at work, bit scary.	Man! That's so scary! Let me out of the house too!"
"O it sure seemed like it did, dogs were scared too.	College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!	That's awesome! And it's not like you have to do a lot - I recommend 10 hours a week."
"It probably will be, as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!	I can imagine. Best of luck. Just make sure to study hard!"
"I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.	That's pretty great! What did you think when you heard it?"
"It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.	I am glad that you did enjoy doing so much of the time"
"So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.	Well bowling is not for everyone. Discover your gifts and make them your brother can replicate. It's humility at it's best.Bowling can be fun but bowler's often times delivers worse. Maybe consider practicing with friends or family."
"For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!	Bobby Flay is a ball of passion,energy, and devilry! He strikes fear into my heart every time hera"
"I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.	What is your new job"
"it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.	Oh wow, I'm sure its not hard once you get the hang of it. I have butterflies in my stomach because I just had to rush to get home today. Hope you are able to recover well."
"So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.	That's no good. customer service is very important."
"For sure, that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose, can't expect to be perfect!	It is better to have a vision for a restaurant that you would like to open and meet that vision with your own hands than to have it snatched from behind by a ruthless franchisee."
"So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.	oh I love going on road trips, do you intend to return some time?"
"No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself, would do again!	That sounds so beautiful and peaceful. I would love to go again"
"So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!	Well, my dear, do you have any other preferences? For example, are you a lover of cars, a lover of people, or some mix thereof?"
"I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!	That is good that you are careful. I wish I had a pet like that in my life."
"So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.	It's not too bad. What kind of car should you get?"
"Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.	Doesn't seem like it would be that bad, other than the fact that you probably wouldn't be able to use it anyway. I certainly wouldn't be stuck with a busted engine either!"
"PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!	wow, why do you fence?"
"It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.	It was! I would have been! How scary!"
"So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!	That's quite annoying! What did you do?"
"Oh yes, very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now, I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.	ate a new one soon?"
"I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.	I feel you. At least if I'm the center of attention, everyone is going to know it."
"I know! Like, mentally, I don't care, but my body just responds by making my legs shake, my heart pound, and speaking too quickly.	The best thing you can do is just keep at it. If you get better you'll be like me and adopt the body like it's a daughter/sister. My sister started out with the same thing and it's much more difficult still but I keep at it and get faster."
"I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times, it was awful.	That sounds like a lot of work. Did your dad find it?"
"Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.	Yeah, dogs can pretty much mess everything up."
"So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.	Rap is a very interesting music. I cant understand most of what is said"
"Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.	Yeah, I wouldn't have been able to see haha"
"I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester.	Oh no, I hope you were able to save some money."
"Yes, everything's taken care of, thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!	Well that's very sweet of him! I bet you're not lonely now!"
"i was really glad i finished my service for the military	That's good. That makes you independent and able to live independently."
"it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country	I am very proud of my son for standing up like that!"
"i did not expect my car to be soo good for the price i paid	That's really good, were you happy with it?"
"yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well	That's great! What kind of car did it have?"
"i don't like to see my parents smoke it makes me really sad	Aww no. Why is that?"
"yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now	well that's good to hear"
"i hate when ash from my cigarette drops in my work pants	I almost always make a big stink when people do that to me."
"yeah, i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off, it is really embarrasing	Yes, do you have any idea what can be done about it?"
"When katrina hit texas my family lost like half of their belongings	Wow, that's really dangerous!"
"Well when it hit we left but now we are ok and we recovered well	I am glad to hear that. There is no need to be scared of that, it is nothing to be scared about."
"i cant stand people that dont flush the toilet	I am sorry, I have never flush but I know it is hard."
"Oh, so where do you go to do your personal buisness	I work. I had a big ceremony today. I am so happy."
"I guess i will be the next team leader	Yeah, that would be awesome!"
"Yes. I was expecting that very much.	Is this your first job?"
"My kids and I went to Six Flags and they wanted me to ride the roller coaster but I had so many reservations about getting on it.	Ain't that the truth. Wouldn't something in the settings make you uneasy?"
"The high speeds. It had been so long since i had been on one. I finally did get on and we had a blast!	High speeds are fun. I heard about High Peaks a few years ago, but haven't been on one in years - whaider you?"
"When I turned 40 last year, my kids planned a birthday party for me that I had no idea about.	Aww that is so sweet! You must be feeling so proud of yourself!"
"It really was and just what I need as I wasn't really happy about turning that corner into my 40's.	Oh I know that feeling too. How did you end up meeting your wife?"
"A few weeks ago we were at a wedding. Everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my 3 year old niece started to choke on a carrot. So scary!	Yikes, did you scream?"
"Yes, someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.	Panic is understandable. I would have been terrified!"
"So an online payment distributor company won't instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct. Feels bad man.	that is a pretty bad experience"
"Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.	I'm so glad that nothing went wrong. And it wasn't even your fault."
"Today is my off day and I wanted to sleep in, yet here I am awake early.	Me too, I hate that feeling."
"It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.	Lol! Maybe you should try and re-direct your focus to something more productive in the future. body, mind etc."
"I was dog sitting at my dad's house last week and I heard strange noises in his house.	Oh no that sounds awful. What was it?"
"I don't know, it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.	That is very odd. I never understood why people won't turn off the water in the sink or the fridge!"
"Last semester, I had to give a class presentation. My stomach was full of butterflies from the nerves.	That's so nerve racking. Everything happens so fast."
"All things considered, pretty well. I definitely had some anxiety about it though. Presentations are my least favorite thing in the world.	They definitely can be tough, especially if you're tall and have to stand straight. I also hear that a presentation is 50% of your brain, so you have no control over it other than trying to minimize as much as possible."
"My aunt recently passed away after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.	I am so sorry to hear that. My uncle is one of the few people in his family that has been researching this disease."
"Thanks. It's been especially hard because she was almost like a mother to me.	I'm so happy for you. I know how precious a child a mother can be."
"So I asked out a girl in my class and she said yes. Was a big morale boost.	Right, you never know if they are the type to turn you down."
"Thanks! We are getting coffee this weekend. Hopefully something comes of it!	I hope so, too! Get out and meet some cool people."
"I always carry a multi-tool and a small 4-1 screwdriver on me. I feel like I can fix almost anything with that.	That's a good thing! I carry a belt pouch and a few belts. Does your boss not take notice?"
"I'd like to think so. I just like to be ready for anything.	Yes, you should be more prepared."
"I'm starting a new position at my job soon.	That's great! What will you be doing?"
"I'll be managing consumer relations at a law firm. I'm really looking forward to it!	That sounds exciting - hopefully you do well!"
"My car is on it's last legs. I think I see a new car in my future very soon.	You will surely get a new one, I think."
"I would love to get an X-Terra! I'm a big fan of the SUV platform.	I posted that to my friend, hope he can help me!"
"After dropping out of college 6 years ago, I decided to go back this year.	I can imagine you to be excited about it. Where do you hail from?"
"I have high hopes for myself, as I have all A's so far. I hope I can keep up the momentum!	what are you studying?"
"I just had a delicious breakfast and now I'm casually relaxing in my room. Life is good!	That's a great start to the day! Breakfast is the bomb. You better be on top of it tomorrow when you start school."
"Pancakes and sausage! How can you go wrong?	Yum, I love cake and sweets. Definitely need to go back to bite into some more cake."
"So I have been saving money for about a month now and should have enough for any kind of emergency that may happen. Feels good man.	Good because now you have something to look forward to"
"Thanks so much! It definitely relieves some stress knowing that I have a safety cushion. Hoping I don't have any emergencies though!	It certainly does! Good to hear that you have one, it's very helpful."
"Having a baby 3 months ago really changed my view on life for the better.	Congratulations! I know that if I had a baby it would be the same way."
"I was a heavy drinker, and looking back now, I know I was in a downward spiral, I just couldn't tell at the time. Now I'm pursuing my education and have become much more healthy and responsible.	It can be hard to find that silver lining to every situation. I wish you well and look for the perfect situation to be!"
"My husband and I are going a  cruise with a couple that we have been friends with for a long time,	That's awesome! I'm sure you are going to have a great time. What kind of cruise are you planning?"
"We kind of all came up with it together. They booked it and we just pay them a certain amount of money each week, until our part is paid for.	That's pretty cool. It's wonderful when our friends are able to help us out like that."
"I hope you can too. If its ok, I would like to pray for you, just to maybe help you find someone special.	I am so proud of my sister	Oh yeah? What did she do?"
"She bought me a car	Oh, a used one? That's a whole other ball of wax."
"We are basically best friends. It is my birthday and she worked really hard to get a car for me	Very admirable. I wish the same could be said of my best friend. She works hard shifts to get the best deal."
"I am sad that my parents didn't attend my birthday	Aww, that's sad.... how old are they?"
"No, they just are not wanting to come to it	Oh I see. Well that's okay. I don't know a lot of people who are going to celebrate Christmas anymore. At least you won't have to worry about getting sick or losing your loved ones."
"Last week at the end of the week I got home from work and was pretty tired.  I ended up just sitting on the couch with my wife and dogs watching tv.  It was nice.	That sounds nice. I'm glad you were able to take a break. You should be feeling better soon."
"Quite a lot, actually.  It was a nice way to spend the evening.	That's really great! I love when travel makes you feel like you are actually on a vacation."
"I was going to a wedding outside of my city, and had arranged to have my dogs watched while I was gone, but the person backed out really soon before I had to leave.	I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully it works out for you."
"Something like that, they were vague.  It was through a company so I couldn't really get much out of them.  Luckily a friend stepped up and watched them for me.	That was very nice of him. I hope your future boss is trustworthy."
"I was tired last night and my wife was out of town, so I went to bed early.  I ended up lying with my dogs in bed for a while watching TV before falling asleep.	Oh my, did they wake up?!"
"A wire haired dacshund and a shephard mix thing	Oh, those are my favorite kinds of dogs, they always have such a sweet and loving relationship with you. How sweet!"
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a month and a half.  She gets back in a couple weeks, and it's getting tougher to wait.	How does that make you feel"
"I do, every night.  It's still hard going from having someone around every day to never, but I'll get through.	It's a long and hard path to walk, but I'm confident that when I get through that hump up you'll be able to appreciate what a great companion I am."
"My dad was cleaning out his attic when he found a box of my old stuff from childhood	Wow that is awesome, it is sentimental"
"I did! He found my favorite childhood book of mine and I just sat there thinking about all the memories	Wow that's amazing! You must be a great friend to him."
"My wife is out of the country for school, and the other day she was having a really bad day.  I couldn't really do anything to help, and it made me feel bad.	I know that feeling, Mine took the day yesterday, and i was having the same feeling"
"Thanks, that's actually really helpful.  It's been tough being apart for so long, we haven't been apart more than a couple days since we started dating.	That's good to hear."
"I almost got into a fight the other day at a store.	How did it end?"
"A guy budged in front of some other people, I confronted him about it, and we got into an extremely heated exchange.	That is really not cool. I would have lost my temper and hit him on the nose with a sledgehammer if I had been in your position."
"No, the guy eventually backed off and left, albeit not before he flipped me off a few times and called me numerous names.	For a while my husband was really sick with the flu	Oh, was he better when you got there?"
"He is but I just felt so much love for him because there wasn't anything he could do	that is ok, i think we all feel that way for our parents, even if they do bad things we do good things for our own peace of mind"
"When people make me wait, i get really anxious	Yikes! Waiting is a real pain. What's the longest you've ever waited?"
"Not really, i just look at the clock and wait for the time to come and when they dont arrive in time i start getting anxious	I have tried both methods and nothing seems to help. I hope you don't end up spending lots of money on a time machine."
"I love dogs very much they are always great companions	They deserve a loyal dog who is loyal to begin with!"
"I got a puppy not to long ago and love him with all my heart	That's great! I bet he means the world to you."
"My cat broke her leg not too long ago and had to have surgery one it	Oh no! I bet she's in so much pain. I hope she pulls through."
"I was lucky cause I know my vet personally so I only paid 175 usd I was so scared for her	188 is the new low lol. Well I hope she is okay now."
"there was a shooting in a gas station near me i was really devastated	That's awful. Are you alright?"
"im not sure but there was 2 victims i was devastated	Did the other two people get hurt?"
"I was sad when my dog died	I'm so sorry. How old was your dog?"
"I had him for 10 years. It's just so hard because he was my whole world	I am sorry to hear that. My husband has that problem too. Big loss for sure"
"I am so lonely because I am all by myself	I am sorry to hear that. Why are you alone?"
"I appreciate that. It's just tough because I go daily without talking to anyone. It's nice to talk to someone	Everybody likes a good conversation though."
"i was really jelous when i say my  neighboor had a new 2018 Bmw convertible	Oh, that's a cool car! What color is it?"
"yeah it is i wish i could have a car like that	I know the feeling, I am ninety eight and still want one."
"I am sad that my friends dont visit me	Its OK! You are not the only one! Vous Ãªtes les bons temps donnÃ©s!"
"I don't have a car and they live far away	too bad but glad they have internet to take them anywhere"
"I am disgusted that my food didn't come out the way I wanted it	Oh no! Have you tried the refried beans? They are delicious."
"It was burnt and not appealing	Oh that's not too bad then. I hope you can find the original tanning bed."
"when i was young i hit a car on the parking lot and did not say anything'	You must have been so embarrassed. I am glad you are not that anymore!"
"i did not see any marks on the other car and was running late	Dang, I would have been nervous too. Did you get out and talk to anyone?"
"My sister is so caring, she took care of me when I was sick	It's great to have someone who cares for you, I'm glad you have a brother like that."
"That is so true. I am so very thankful	What things do you enjoy most about your birthday"
"I heard this god awful howling the other night at like 2am right outside my window	Wow where is it coming from? I would be so scared."
"It was! I was so scared to be honest with you! The worst part is that I don't own a dog either	I totally understand. I can kinda understand how you feel then."
"I was surprised when my mom bought me a car	That is a great surprise! Have you ever been in a car?"
"Its a ford mustang	I love Ford sedans! I have a viper and a volkswagen hehe."
"I am very ashamed in my family	Oh no, what happened?"
"Because they never invite me to go places, and they never call me	Wow that is so annoying, so you probably dont talk to them much anymore."
"I am disgusted because of my friends pulling pranks on me	That's terrible, how often do pranks happen?"
"I dont know. They have been my friends for so long but these pranks are just making me mad	you should punish them then"
"I was afraid when I got out of the movie theater	What movie did you see?"
"I was watching a horror film and then I had to walk home alone in the dark	I have been there, I hate that. It is SO scary!"
"I am very faithful that my family will make it home in time	thats important to you"
"They are in Cuba	Oh really? I had no idea. I hope you are able to visit again soon."
"I am terrified that my wife is going to leave me	Oh really? Do you know why she is doing it?"
"Because she is talking to other men behind my back	Oh, that is interesting. How is that working out for you at least?"
"I am sad that I won't get to see the movie I want to see	aw no what movie?"
"I wanted to see the First Purge	i hate when people get excited over things like that. purges were always so terrifying"
"Because I didn't have a ride to the movies	We just got back from the beach two weeks ago. It was such a lovely vacation. We loved relaxing on the beach and just taking it easy.	Oh I love the beach! I love being able to go anywhere and just relax all by myself. Two weeks is a long time to be away."
"It was very nice. There was a day or two of rain, but mostly perfect weather!	It's always nice to have a good day! Hopefully there will be more rain chances next time."
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December.	Nice! Where are you going?"
"To the Caribbean Islands. We are going with another couple that we have been friends with for a very long time.	Ah, so you guys went your separate ways? That's cool, sometimes you have to make those choices. Is there something in the way couples are structured?"
"Thanks, me too.	The other night I was just craving candy. I ate up all that we had!	Eww! What did you end up gobbling up?"
"Sometimes you just have to! It felt so great then but I hated it the next morning!	Hated what?"
"My husbands cancer free now!	That's amazing! I remember when that was news."
"Congrats! We are hoping right now that nothing comes back but It's so happy	I'm so happy for you!"
"I'm so frustrated with my husband. He dismantled the bathroom to do repairs and still hasn't completed them six months later!	Uh oh. I would be mad too. Can we expect next time?"
"He promised he would complete it within a month and since it's been so long, I called a contractor today!	Yea, seems he has a future Secretary of State in him."
"I've got a job interview set up for next week and I'm really nervous!	Oh man, I'm sure you will do fine! Are you prepared?"
"I hope so! I bought a couple books on preparing for interviews and I've done a couple mock interviews with a friend.	That's really good. You must have really prepared yourself."
"My parents always argue and it pisses me off!	Yeah, mine and your parents must be the worst people in the world."
"I have but they rarely listen. They act like children and it can get frustrating. What can you do?	i would talk to the police"
"Sometimes life just gives you lemons. At an old job of mine, I had what will probably remain the worst performance review of my life.	Oh no! What was the reason?"
"I'm not sure it was really about my performance at all. I was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there, and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved, and I would be answering phones.	You might want to consider setting up a new position."
"That's must be a relief for you.  I am assuming you have children?	Yes, but i have another job that keeps me busy."
"So I guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  Do you attend school?	I sure don't! I just want to be in school, not in a different one!"
"Do you have something you are looking forward to?	My father passed away about 2 1/2 years ago. It was totally unexpected and really was very traumatic and hurtful to me. He was still quite young and my family and I had no idea he had a life threatening health issue.	I am so sorry to hear that! It seems almost impossible to overcome the loss of a father, I am so sorry."
"I was pretty close to my father and always lived close by. But, you always wish you had more time. But, the last words I said to him was that I loved him, and I'm grateful for that.	Awww well that's better than I would have done the same thing but I'm sure you have learned a lot in the meantime! I'm sure your very proud of him for saying that."
"Once when I was younger I went to a friends 16th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen	Really? That's insane. Did you go on your friends booze and did it feel good?"
"we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but I didn't see it.  It was a very clean door.  LOL.  Later on that night I won a door prize.  which was pretty funny]	Ooh, that's pretty neat. What was it?"
"My daughter caught me in a bad mood the other day and was being a bit argumentative. I lost my temper, yelled and really hurt her feelings. I felt bad that it happened.	I am sorry, I think I know how you feel. I am sorry. have you talked to her about it?"
"Yes, I was already not in a good mood, and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button. But, I knew I shouldn't have done it as soon as I saw the look in her eyes, I felt very bad.	Yeah I would have too. Your friend is always right behind you so you don't even have to think about it. It's not fun but it happens and most people will just talk themselves to sleep which is their friend's problem not yours"
"You never know what someone else is going through, and looks can be deceiving. Like this old man that seemed like any other drunk.	Oh no, that's terrible. I hate it when people are just look deceptive and careless with others' lives like that."
"It was hard to tell honestly, but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic. He had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home, so I hailed him a cab and paid the driver $20.	That's not very bad I bet. A cabbie should always be trustworthy."
"We hadn't been to the beach and years and really wanting to go back for vacation. We were able to a few weeks ago and it was awesome. I was thrilled!	I can imagine! Why did you decide to go back?"
"It's was great. The weather was perfect most of the time, and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much. We were really hyped to go!	I can imagine! Enjoy the peace and enjoy the weekend!"
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped over a big cord. This led to me having one of those running falls, that seem to last forever! I wanted to disappear at that moment!	oh yea i can understand that"
"Oh no, there were tons of people that noticed lol. I can laugh now, but not at that moment.	Move along, all that time to laugh at the dumb thing you did."
"I lost a puppy recently and I'm still broken up about it.	Oh no! I am so sorry about that, how did it end up?"
"it's never going to be ok, but it will be a little less painful in time.	I feel you. I wish we could go another day."
"I'm sorry youve been there too.,	It's not fun when a 4 year old does something he shouldnt.	Yeah but that is a different story."
"Took a small toy, put it in his pocket. took it back to the store and made him return it.	Thats a good idea"
"Yea, he seems to get it now.	As a mom I sometimes sneak a sweet treat when I make it out alone.	Does your mom not like that?"
"Still feel bad when I got an ice cream the other day	How come? What was the flavor of the other one?"
"I've had a rough week! The house has been a mess from my dogs and toddler. My husband hasn't been helping out much, its fustrating!	Hey that's good! You're not the only one that's had a bad week! I've been through that too last weekend when my son was born. You'll get through it!"
"I'm not sure! He has been busy with work but also has been going out with friends a lot :(	well i really wish you the best of luck and hope it comes together!"
"My niece made me proud today, graduated from her nursing school.	Oh wow! You must be so proud of her!"
"YEa, she's over come a lot for it.	I'm sure she will be fine"
"Since it was my birthday today, when I came home there was a big pink cake and flowers waiting for me :)	That sounds so wonderful. You should be so happy."
"My husband! I did not see it coming at all, thought we were going to wait till the weekend to celebrate.	Congrats! It's hard to lose a betta fan."
"We had to clean out our storage building because of roof damage. I found an old box of pictures!	That's very lucky! Hopefully our photos give our family and friends a good look at what we went through!"
"My family and all kinds of old memories, birthdays, festivals, swimming, and other stuff	That sounds so fun! I hope you get to do something fun with them soon!"
"It's so hot and our AC just broke. We had to open the windows to be able to sleep!	Oh noooo...I hate being in the sun! I'm sorry you're having problems. I hope it's only a matter of time before your paycheck starts coming in. Hope it's only a matter of time before your paycheck starts coming in."
"The icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you	Are you a fan of horses? I the flying kind!"
"I'm so excited! My family and I are moving to a new state at the end of this year!	That is awesome. I bet your are excited to be far away from your family and friends."
"That is nice. Having a better paying job is always good.	Exactly. job security is important."
"I've got back in to running this week, I missed it! It's a great stress reliever!	\"
"I love to run, did Track and Field in High School! Right now I'm only running 3 miles till I build my stamina back up! What do you do for excersise?	Yea it's a tough, physical sport but so much fun. Sounds like you have a great story!"
"You won't believe the day I've had! I got to sleep in this morning, I haven't done that in months!	Oh no! What happened to you?"
"Yes, my husband even cooked dinner for me today, and helped clean the house! He has been very helpful today.	that's so sweet of him, it's fantastic when a spouse can do that for you"
"This has been a great week! Well actually a great year for my family.	That's awesome! What made it great?"
"Thank you, my husband got two great job offers!	oh what kind of job do you like?"
"My daughter is growing up so fast!	Oh dear. Is she getting into trouble?"
"She is 4 and in Pre-school! She is doing so well learning how to share and also knows her colors!	That's fantastic! I love it when kids are so engaged and interested in the material that they can do so much from being able to craft their very own items!"
"I live in Central Texas, it rained and lightening stuck a house here and caused it to burn down!	Texas is not a great state when it rains!"
"Yes, I hope the family is okay! No word yet if anyone got hurt.	That's so true. I hope you find peace with that."
"my baby is sleeping, my house is clean... it's just so nice and peaceful right now	Awwe that is so wonderful! It is so nice to have a peaceful life these days."
"i just hope tonight won't be that night when my baby wakes up every 30 minutes	If it doesn't sound like tonight baby, I guess you are still hoping for a good night's rest."
"I feel like a failure, Im suppose to be on a diet but ate too much today!	how much did you eat?"
"Thanks, I keep telling myself to stick with it but its hard!	I guess so, but persistence will pay off!"
"I'm thinking about quitting my day job!	Oh no! Is it a day job you have now?"
"My boss has been unreasonable and a pain. He dosen't understand how much time I put into the company!	Therou? Nicht so he is unreasonable he made me late for a meeting."
"Tuesday I got to take my kids to the beach for the first time.	I have never been to the beach, and it scares me. I've heard it's really fun though."
"We had a blast! I could barely contain myself on the trip there!	I love traveling. Did you take lots of pictures?"
"My new dog is doing so great, she was potty trained in a week!	What kind of dog is it?"
"She is a Jack Russell, she loves to cuddle in my lap.	That's kind of cute. I bet she means so much to you"
"i moved to a new house recently and miss my old one	Ah that can be tough. Did you have any fun times together?"
"10 years, i hope i get to feel the same way i did in my old house	10 years is a long time to wait though!"
"i feel like i am the best player on my soccer team	Really? How so?"
"yeah i do i am always the one that steps up in the game	It's so refreshing to see someone that genuine and forthright about their play. They are so exciting to watch."
"I've been having anxiety attacks lately. Everything is great and suddenly i start thinking about something bad happening and i have a full blown anxiety attack over something that didn't even happen	I am sorry you are going through this"
"no, it just started happening. I would say it started a couple of months ago. i will see a doctor in 2 weeks	I hope it goes well for you."
"We recently went on vacation and it made me feel reminiscent. It made me think of the last vacation I was able to spend with my father before he unexpectedly passed away.	I'm so sorry to hear about your father. You must be very close to him."
"Thank you. I don't think it matters how old you are when a parent passes away, it's very painful. The vacation did bring back great memories with him though.	Im glad, its always good to see the good in people even if we dont like them."
"my friend can literally eat junk food all day long and stay skinny! She doesn't even work out. and here i am, eating healthy, working out and still loking fat	Haha, that's great that you can stay so active despite your being in the workforce! I wish I had your lifestyle!"
"that's true too! But i just wish i looked like her	I know what you mean. One day we will look like our moms and dads from when they were alive."
"It was my birthday and My friend sent me a birthday card with a gift card in a mail... i never got it, somebody stole it! and we actually have a cluster mailbox so only i can open it. it means that usps worker stole it	Well that's terrible! Did you complain to mail office?"
"i did, the lady told me they can't do anything about it because it didn't have a tracking number.	Oh no! That's not safe at all!"
"My cat was playing last nigh and brought it to me.	Oh my, I bet that was a pleasant surprise! Did you introduce it to your cat?"
"Well, it wasn't one of his toys like I thought. It was a dead mouse	Oh that's ok I guess. It's still a little weird I guess"
"my son just used a potty for the first time! he is only 16 months. i'm so proud of him	haha well that's great!"
"I know! they  grow up so fast! I feel like i just gave a birth to him and look at him now	Yeah they are so small but they are having such a big time!"
"Sometimes things don't work out like you planned. It can be a real let down though.	Yes disappointingly true. I wish i could turn those things around quickly though."
"I got two tickets for a friend and I for a concert. The day of the show, it poured and no one got a refund.	Dang, that's frustrating! I wish there's a way for me to report a ticket issue! Hopefully they can't take the blame for the rain!"
"My family went on a road trip this week and had to stop at a gas station for the bathroom.	oh no. that is unfortunate"
"Well the bathroom seemed cleaned but the roaches told me otherwise.	That's too bad. I guess they don't live in a closet like us."
"It sounds crazy to say, but even though I was hit by a car on my bicycle, it could have been much worse.	on my way to work?"
"I'm quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws). I am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!	I'm glad you're ok. That sounds frightening!"
"It might be, but considering I'm 29 with an artificial hip as well, I've gotten used to being half metal.	Last semester was probably the largest challenge of my life. I go to school for electrical engineering, and I took 6 courses.	I'm sorry, I guess you had to study really hard to get accepted."
"Oh my gosh then you know! I have to say though, it all came out in the wash - 4 As and 2 Bs!	That's a little bit weird though - but I guess sometimes it's good to remember the past!"
"Waiting for something to come in the mail can send me in to a tizzy. It's even worse when it's parts I need to finish a computer repair job.	Oh, well that sounds interesting, I hope it's something urgent you're waiting on."
"I did get it done in the end. It was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came.	That's good. It sounds like it was a lot of work, but at least you got it done."
"Have you ever lost control of your bowels as an adult?	no, no! but I hope that you live a long life"
"Phew! I'm glad I am not the only one. Although for me, it happened in the middle of dinner at a small Vietnamese restaurant, and an employee walked in on me cleaning my pants in the sink!	Oh no! Well it happens to the best of us."
"I went to a heavy metal music festival in Las Vegas a few years ago! I had fun, but to be honest it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster.	I have never gone, but my friend did a while back. It was really good!"
"I think it's because everybody can relate when it comes to live music. My girlfriend broke up with me the second day, but we had to stay in the same room.	Well she was a good girl. I can understand how you might feel jealous."
"You know how sometimes things don't go as planned, but it feels like they turn out better in the end?	Yeah, things always seem to go as planned in movies."
"You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event, but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend.	OOoh I feel for you, sounds like you really miss your buddy."
"My father was having abdominal pain, so he went to the hospital and they discovered a tumor.	How old is the tumor?"
"It was cancerous, but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well. A few days later he passed away suddenly, with no exact cause of death.	That is so terrible. I am so sorry for your loss."
"I love it when the new star wars movies come out, seeing all those kids (and adults) dress up for the theater really takes me back!	Same here. I used to love the first one especially."
"I don't anymore, but when I was a kid, a friend and I dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of Episode I.	That sounds like a lot of fun! I love dressing up as my favorite characters to get into the mood for the show."
"On our second date, my girlfriend and I stopped in a dive bar on our way back from the beach.	That's actually super romantic. Did you two have a good time?"
"Like a hole in the wall. Cheap drinks, sometimes a little dirty, but altogether relaxed - the opposite of snoody. They had a pool table and I showed her some tricks.	That sounds like a great date! Did you do anything wild?"
"Yeah, I should have just said that. Honestly though, my favorite places to drink.	There's places you can go to really drink in a social setting. You don't have to go to a bar to cool you down."
"My father passed away a few years ago, but I still have my grandfather's watch that he gave to me.	How old is your father? It's nice to have something he gifted you"
"I honestly hope to. Every time I look at it I remember the good times we had together.	All is well. When will you find out?"
"Hanging out with old flames can be tricky when you are in a committed exclusive relationship.	I understand, we all have to cut our losses and let nature take its course."
"Actually, an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink. She made a pass at me, but I told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend.	Thats sad. exes mess up us psyches."
"going near hights really makes me scared	Yeah, pretty much. I wouldn't take any more shortcuts."
"just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights	I think you may have been scared because it is so far away?"
"During carnival season, there is a big rave at an undisclosed location in the middle of the night.	Really? That sounds quite interesting. What is the name of the music festival?"
"They are a lot of fun! I must admit though, I was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down.	oh damn i can see that now.. what ended up happening"
"Well, there were only two officers and a couple hundred of us. By the time we were all walking away from the warehouse, I was actually laughing.	my girl friend broke up with me about a month ago	ugh, that's terrible news. How are you feeling now?"
"we where just not getting along, and did not h ave enough time to see each other	At least you have changed your number. I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can at least see each other next time."
"yes we are	I was always terrified of haunted houses when I was little.	I was always afraid of haunted houses. I believe I was younger."
"Glad I'm not the only one! My friend has a birthday in October and she wanted us to go to one as a group. I'm still not sure if I'll go,	That is weird, but also good you are happy as long as you have fun."
"My sister snores really hard every night it is getting really anoying	I know the feeling, I am sister and we all snore!"
"well it is not really her fault it just makes me angry hahah	Yes it is no good. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. If only it was someone else's fault."
"My friend and I spotted a mini-gold course when we were coming back from the next state over.	Oh that's pretty amazing. I bet you were very excited about that."
"I know! We played a round and they let us play a second round for free!	Well, that's the dream come true for a lot of kids. A chance to try new things."
"I feel excited about our upcoming baby shower	BAY SHOWER! Are you pregnant?"
"I'm having a baby boy!	Congratulations! Is this your first?"
"i am really exited for my vacation next summer	Oh exciting! Where are you headed?"
"california, i really hope i get to go to universal studios	universal studio, that's awesome, I really wish I could go"
"when she left for 3 weeks i was alone	i am so sorry to hear that. were you able to see or hear her?"
"nothing at all. I was kinda depressed	That's too bad. Maybe you can find an ice cream parlor that specializes in flavored ones. That way you won't feel as bad about not finding her. ice cream is one of those things that really hits at the right time"
"My Calculus final was no joke! I started studying hard two weeks before the test.	hahaha did you study really hard?"
"Trust me it all paid off. When I went in to take the test, I was absolutely solid on the material.	That's great. I anticipate good test results for you."
"Felt sad when she left for 3 weeks	oh well does she keep in touch?"
"To see her family. It sucked though because my car had broken down.	oh wow I hope you can see them soon!"
"I am happy with where we are now living	that's great! you sound very content with your life."
"A very nice complex with 3 pools!	oh wait.. what is that?"
"I interviewed for a new job and the interview went really well.	That's great news. What kind of job was it?"
"The interviewer made all the comments you'd expect from a good interview and seemed to respond well to my answers.	That's great, how did you do?"
"Some people are just naturals. The first time I played pool with a friend of mine, she had to beat the guy running the table.	thats no good at all"
"I shot so-so, but my friend ended up winning the table and beating 5 guys in a row.	Table tennis is a game of skill. If one player can handle it, it's no problem for the other ones to not be able to play. If they can't handle it, it's a game of skill."
"I didn't receive a scholarship in college that I really wanted despite being qualified for it.	That happens sometimes. Maybe you should ask your professors and see how they feel about it?"
"Yes, I'll still attend but the extra help would've been nice.	I hope you can continue to climb the career ladder as you see fit!"
"I know things will work out in God's perfect timing	I honestly hope they do and things get better for you."
"Yes I am. For everything we want for the baby to be gifted to us lol	Dang! Hopefully the baby gets a great teacher, friend, or aunt!"
"My sister graduated from college after a long road of persistence and determination.	That's awesome. What did she major in?"
"Yes, she is. My family and I are very happy with her accomplishments.	You must be a good parent to raise a child who exceeds your expectations!"
"I like being alone, but not feeling bad when no one is around to talk to	I feel almost the same way. I don't like feeling lonely."
"It's true I do need my alone time	you shouldn't be sleeping rough then a stranger's feet."
"Dog ate grass and then threw up	Is that how it's been referred to in the military?"
"Well she was ok. Shouldn't have been so silly	Well it was fun to see her laughing and tickling your little face."
"I am so happy to be having a boy	Oh that's great! How old is he?"
"Thanks. Yes it is. I already got a crib and baby bath.	I'm happy for you. I'm sure your husband will be proud of your new addition!"
"When I was younger, I worked really hard to save up money for a car, but needed a bit more. But on my birthday, my parents paid the rest for me.	Wow, you are lucky to have such parents! Not so much anymore, I'm sure."
"I agree. I really wanted to do it myself, but it's something I'll never forget.	Will you still be able to do it?"
"I recently went on my first international trip by myself.	That must have been exciting!"
"To visit my family for about 3 weeks, I got married a few years ago and my husband and I live pretty far from them now.	Do they live far away from you?"
"Yes, just very nerve racking dealing with the international flights and passport checks and security checks. Definitely an experience.	I was very proud of her for flying all by herself	That is great. It is so relaxing to be independent."
"Especially with 2 full suitcases	It is indeed hard. But do you think you will make it?"
"I don't generally trust people.	Ah I'm sorry to heard that! What happened?"
"Upbringing. Dad use to say never trust anyone before I left for school every morning	Oh, well that's a good way to start"
"You just can't trust people any more. My mechanic told me it was going to be $1000 to fix my Jeep.	Well, truth be told, I have never had a car problem myself."
"Turns out, nothing much at all. A guy down the street got it running for $100.	Well that's good. It sure sounds like it works!"
"I am so happy that we're having a baby boy	Congratulations! Boy or girl?"
"Yes it is. I am over the moon	That's great! I'm proud of you!"
"I've just successfully completed my first international flight/trip by myself.	Wow, that's impressive! How long were you staying at a hotel for?"
"Yes, I got to see my family so it was great! I had to be very organized. The flights and layovers were kind of intense.	Oh, that does sound hard! Well I hope you get to go again soon!"
"I was so sad to find out what she had done. Found it on her facebook message history..	oh no. was she able to block you?"
"She met up with her ex to return his t-shirt..	Oh boy, that's not right."
"I am currently expecting my first baby, it's a boy!	Wow, that's wonderful. It must be a happy time for you and your family"
"October, right around the corner!	That's great! I hope you have fun!"
"I recently went tubing on a river with my girlfriend and her friends from college.	That sounds like so much fun! I bet you're having a blast!"
"I had a blast! It's supposedly a four hour float but we were out there for eight!	Oh man! I'd love to go on a floating vacation with my family. I'm jealous."
"My girlfriend's dog was a 17 year old Chihuahua who emerged from a bathroom at a party in 1999.	Oh no, I have a dog and she loves to bowl me while I am eating dinner. I know how you feel."
"He just sort of showed up and no one knew where he came from. He passed away recently after running away from our friends farm and being struck by a car.	thats so sad"
"I can't believe my girlfriend was still interested in me after she saw the slum I was living in.	wow, that is shocking, are you okay?"
"Something like that. My room was in shambles and the house was falling apart! I was mortified when she asked to come inside.	Roomate must have been furious and didn't know what to do."
"Once after a night on the town, I came home and my room had been ransacked.	Wow, that must have been horrible. Are you thinking about going back and buying a new room?"
"The thing is, my alcoholic room mate was the culprit. He had even thrown some of my belongings in the bathtub!	Oh no! I am glad you are home with me now. Communal cleaning is good for you and others! I am glad you are healthy now and not in a hospital!"
"I am expecting my first child. It is going to be a boy! We are preparing the nursery and getting everything in order for his arrival!	Wow! That is fantastic! I have two kids myself. I have so many photos on my computer of my kids. I am so excited to see them grow up!"
"Yes, it is!	How far are you willing to go for that?"
"A few months back, one of my girlfriend's close friends died from a heroin overdose.	That's incredibly awful. I can't imagine what that must have caused you."
"I only met him a few times, but he touched a lot of people's lives.	Awe. I wish i didn't have a job yet. But then I don't have many friends anyway."
"An extremely timid girl in my physics class invited the class to see her band play at a bar downtown.	What are you going to do with the class?"
"I actually went last Friday night. Turns out she is an incredible guitarist - a real shredder!	wow, she sounds amazing. what instrument do you play?"
"I am pretty sure everyone is scared of being trapped in an elevator, and I can confirm it's quite a shock.	Oh my goodness! How long were you in there for?"
"Yes just a couple weeks ago. The elevator screeched to a halt and the lights went out, and I have to confess I screamed.	Oh my goodness! I would if I were you!"
"I thank God every day for the many blessings. Especially our new home	Well, I'm glad that you have something to look forward to. I'm sure it will be a source of joy for you and for your family."
"5 months ago now. It's really nice here, there are 3 swimming pools	Are you referring to the one near you or across the country?"
"Right after I had my baby, my husband worked second shift, so he didn't get home until around 2am.	ah that was ok"
"Yeah, but it wasn't really a problem, until one night around 11pm. I was changing her diaper. The changing table was in front of a window, and I could hear people running up and down the porch in front of the window and they were banging on the house.	Oh no! That's terrible, what did you do?"
"I'm not sure. Doors and windows were locked, but I was so relieved when my husband got home.	I'm a youth leader, and just the other day a teen from the group was asked to speak at a local church.	Oh wow. Well then I for one am impressed! You guys must be a very obedient bunch."
"He was nervous, he has to prepare an original message. He did really good, and he really showed and understanding of the bible.	I'm sure if you really studied it, you could come up with something!"
"Thank you.	I get so mad when I have to repeat myself	who is having this problem for?"
"I know. But it makes me stressed out	It seems like you don't have much else going on in your life. What are you focusing on instead?"
"Hello ... today I am happy, we go with my children to the movies and then to eat pizza	Sounds like a great time, how come you're feeling happy today, personally I'm feeling content but on the flip hand, anything is possible for any reason."
"The incredible ... they love ... it's going to be fun	I'm sure it will be fun. I've never had a campfire dinner at all."
"Thank you very much and you too..	Graduating from college was a load off my shoulders.	Yeah, higher education is expensive."
"Thanks, it was a long journey.	What did you end up getting?"
"I was turned down for a job I really thought I'd be a good fit at.	That is terrible. Did you offer to resign if they offered you a job?"
"Someone else interviewed who had much more experience than I did.	Ah. Well that makes sense. Sometimes interviewers are looking for certain traits and sometimes to get a ""read"" on someone. I find a lot of people are justasses and don't know how to craft a good interview. interview with confidence"
"I went to a sketchy part of town once. Just being there put me on edge.	I have been there, I can imagine what it is like. did you do anything to put yourself on edge?"
"It was for work so I had to do it, but I typically avoid those places as well	Yeah, they're on fire all the time and it's usually from arson."
"We went to a friend's house the other day for dinner. I was helping her cook. I was following the directions of a recipe and accidentally cracked her baking dish.	Oh no! What happened next?"
"Yes, I did, but she wouldn't even hear of it. She told me it was fine.	How embarrassing! I would much rather have someone talk with my ear then your mouth. lol"
"I am looking forward to moving into a easy place to take care of.	That is great! I am sure it will be tax free and be a nice bonus."
"No, not moving soon, only wanting to and looking around to see what is affordable.	That must be very hard on you. You must be lonely."
"So I had an emergency come up for my family and I had enough money to cover it. I feel great for preparing!	You're a smart girl! I bet your family will too. :)"
"Definitely! And they are paying me back, so it isn't like I'm losing money either.	Yea in a way it is! I feel like I should be doing more like you, more akin to a mom then a guy."
"I drank a lot of alcohol at my friend's BBQ party, and I ended up puking and passing out. Not my finest moment.	I hope you were able to recover."
"Hahahaha! Well, I guess we can make light of even our worst moments.	Yeah, I know how you feel. I love those moments when you see the best in others."
"My eldest son just graduated High School I was so proud.	Congratulations! That's a great accomplishment!"
"It's kind of a surreal feeling tho, hard to accept that he is grown.  Now college is about to start.	now that is a positive thing"
"The time just flys by doesn't it?  It hard to imagine that they dont need you so much anymore.	So a customer just came into my work and started yelling at me for something that wasn't my fault. I hate when people do that!	That's fair, that can be pretty infuriating. Did you file a complaint?"
"No, I didn't yell back haha. I would get fired.	That's no fun. I bet it was a lot worse if you were a manager."
"Retail, yep.	It makes me angry when people never notice me	Do you ever hear any kind of commments?"
"Everything. I don't have friends so it's nice to get noticed	It's even better when it doesn't come easily. I wish I could be accepted into a club like that!"
"I get excited when I go swimming	Aww, I love to swim. I need to catch up!"
"The fact of relaxing in a large pool of water. It just grabs my attention	That sounds so nice! I love swimming."
"My wife wasn't feeling so well, so I took care of her and made her some soup <3	That's awesome! I'm sure she misses you."
"She is much better now! I love her so much, so I try to take good care of her.	That's great! It sounds like it's her who's getting better, not you."
"I am so grateful to my family	That is good. Why are you grateful to your family?"
"They help me with whatever I need and they are always their for me.	Got any in particular in particular?"
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a party	That's great that they wanted to have a party for you. That's the best birthday ever."
"It really was. I am pretty thankful for them	I am glad you got some sleep"
"A big wind storm blew through town and uprooted one of the trees in my yard.	Oh no! That's terrible! Are you OK?"
"No, but that was my fear. I kept waiting to hear the sound of a branch or tree hitting my roof, or breaking glass.	my mom used to always use my brother as a makeshift ladder when we were young. now we have our own separate roof"
"I took my dog to an agility competition and she ended up winning first place!	Amazing! You must be proud of her!"
"Thanks so much! It did, but she's so hard-working and I couldn't have done it without her.	I am sure she appreciates you being able to do what you do, too."
"I was sad when my parents left me	I was sad also when I saw them go. I guess they did the best thing They could with the money."
"I stay with my older sister now	It is nice to have such a caring sister. Are you two close?"
"My brother got a really high-paying job and now spends all his time flaunting his money.	I would say tell him to keep it in reserve for a rainy day!"
"Not very well! I mostly just stew and complain about it and wish I had his money and lifestyle.	I'm sorry to hear that. Stewing alone doesn't sound like a very good living."
"I was disgusted when my food had a hair in it	That's disgusting. Is your food next of kin insured?"
"Yeah I got a refund. They were very sorry about it and I forgave them	I am sorry they did that but I bet it was worth it in the end."
"I was anxious when I went to the theme park	did you have fun?"
"The roller coasters	Did you like the food?"
"I was furious when my friend made fun of me in front of random strangers.	What did he do if you don't mind me asking?"
"I am not sure. He told me he was sorry afterwards but I didn't listen to him	sometimes it's hard to listen to people but once you admit it's wrong it's easier to change your ways. I hope your son is doing better."
"I feel so lonely because I have no friends	i am the same way"
"I haven't. Im too shy and I am scared of what people will say	I took the LSAT and it was taken before I knew how to spell. I took all the AP history at college and they don't even bother with that."
"I was jealous when my girlfriend was talking to other guys	Oh I'm sorry. Can you talk to her about it?"
"I do not. I have trust issues	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it starts to look better for you."
"I was terrified when I watched that horror film in the theaters	Do you enjoy watching horror movies now?"
"I did but it was really a challenge for me.	Well, hopefully you are able to put on a good show for the crowd!"
"I was sad when my dad died	I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass?"
"It happened 3 weeks ago	Oh no, hope it starts moving again soon."
"I was sad when my wife left me	I'm sorry that happens. Do you have any friends or family that can help?"
"I just dont know why she would marry me then.	It was a very kind thing to do."
"My family and I went to the beach on Tues and spent the whole day there.	Wow, so you're not a big fan of the beach?"
"One small thunderstorm but other than that great! I'm amazed I didn't really get burnt!	Yeah, those things can be so devastating especially if you aren't careful."
"When someone talks down to me, it makes me sad	I am sorry you have to deal with that. How are you?"
"I am just too shy to say anything. I dont know how	You can tell your mom?"
"I am super joyful when my family comes together to eat dinner	That's always great when family is involved! Are you celebrating with them this weekend?"
"Usually once a week. Its a great feeling	It is. I have found that doing the breathing post also helps."
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a big party	That must have been a great surprise."
"It was. I had a great time	That is really great. I am happy for you"
"I am so annoyed that people are so mean to other people	There is usually not much you can do."
"That is so true! I dont know where this world is heading.	Have you ever flown in it?"
"I get so jealous when my parents don't pay me any attention.	Why is that?"
"I haven't because I don't know how to start that conversation.	Well you could always go to a teachers office and plead your case."
"I was furious when my dog ate the wires to my Television	Why did he do that?"
"Yeah but it will take a few days because I have to wait for my paycheck	I am sure it will all work out."
"So what happens in the middle of the night? I got woken, again, by my upstairs neighbor thumping around. Does she have to be so rude?!	That's terrible, what do you do in the middle of the night?"
"No, they don't. Well, this time I've had enough. I've told management I want into another apartment and explained exactly why!	I am sorry that happened to you but I am glad you understood their pain."
"Not really, but the alternative is to go slowly mad. These blessed individuals stomp around day and night, screeching into their cellphones - they're horrible.	I am a very trusting person. It gets me in trouble sometimes.	I get stressed out when my co-workers trust other people. Are they doing it out of fear?"
"People take advantage of me	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan to get better?"
"I'm only 6 months away from having my AA in Healthcare Administration.	That's awesome! Do you feel like you are prepared?"
"I really am, I can't wait to start my new career!	Woohoo! That's exciting! I hope everything works out for you!"
"Going to the dentist always has me on edge. I hate it!	They should not do that! It is not necessary or safe."
"I know...it's a necessary evil. But it hurts so much!	It definitely does. I finally found a man tonight I could bed!"
"One of my very dear friends got his dream job recently. He was so diligent in finding information and contacts. I so respect what he's achieved.	That's great, he must've worked really hard."
"Well, it takes perseverance and a bit of luck, but you can do it!	You will! Mgt."
"Lol, you and me both. You could always marry a Kardashian!	I would though but i can't know enough about biology to do thi"
"Or someone not quite so objectionable :) Seriously though, I'm so happy for K with his new job.	We started watching a Red Sox game near the end and they were losing. Next thing you know, they were ahead four runs.	That's incredible!"
"Yes, usually I think so too. But this was really fun to watch and we were so happy because it did not look good at first.	That is my favorite kind of birthday party."
"My car that I hate is going to die soon and I'll be able to get a new one. Score!	score! I hope your luck continues, you deserve one."
"I'm thinking something reliable. Maybe a toyota or mazda.	I would be excited if I were you! I have a mazza and it is amazing. I have one and love it!"
"Yesterday my husband opened a window and a HUGE black bug flew in!! I almost died!!	That's horrible. How did it take?"
"heck no, i told my husband to deal with it. i ran in my bedroom and locked the door	... I'm sorry, that's a very tough situation. If you need someone to talk it out, I hope you find someone quickly. I'm sure your husband has a lot of really good friends in his community. I hope he's able to be a good father"
"Well, don't you know, one of my neighbors who works for AA was in San Francisco recently and saw some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). So she bought some and brought it to me. How nice of her to do that!	Ah, that's a good point, I think we all know she's just trying to earn some extra money. Doesn't take very long to learn that, especially if you work hard!"
"This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.	I've never had cream cheese. How was it different this time?"
"Ooh, I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?	Wow! I am really not a fan of Cabot either. They seem to go for the easy way out over thinking things like that. I hope you guys pull out all the stops with this one!"
"I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me. I'm in NC, where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!	Haha, that's funny. The people you deal with can be considered your family."
"my brother would've turned 34 today. he died 2 years ago and It still hurts so much	I know this is a tough time for you as well, But rest in Power, He will be in your prayers again Soon"
"yes we were. He moved to the different country but we spoke pretty often	oh yea its nice there is not any one like us left."
"I had planned to go to the beach with friends, but it looks like it's going to rain.	Thats a bummer. Maybe you can reschedule."
"Nah, it said there's be thunder and lightning, so looks like we're stuck inside :(	That's a bit terrifying. I hope everything works out for you."
"I spent last weekend with most of my family, they live out of state and i don't see them often.	That's unfortunate. If you're not seeing them, that's a bit strange. Have you tried meeting in person?"
"I did, Yes. Work has been hectic lately so i was really looking forward to unwinding with them.	unfortunately we are all human,some of us busy ourselves with other people,not us."
"We ate good food, drank wine and went swimming.	That sounds so fun! I love swimming."
"It was, kind of hot but not enough to complain about.	Thats good. I am glad it wasn't too bad for your work flow"
"I hate how our country is so divided right now	Me too. Not a good thing. Can you imagine a world in which you have to be afraid to travel? Ugh!"
"True. I hope we can become less divided in the future and solve things	Yes. It's always better when we work together."
"My father passed away about 2 years ago. It was so very difficult for me and very unexpected. We didn't know he had a life-threatening illness and weren't prepared in any way for his sudden departure from us.	Sorry to hear that. I recently lost my grandmother to lung cancer. I know how much his love meant to us."
"Yes, my family and I are close and we were there for each other. But, my sister had passed away around 6 years before, by committed suicide. The last few years have been very difficult.	I'm so sorry to hear that. It's hard to see loved ones who have made mistakes and haven't been able to be with them. How are you doing?"
"I feel like a terrible sibling right now.	oh im sorry to hear that"
"My sister, who lives out of state and i don't see often, was recently in town visiting our dad. I didn't visit with them.	Uh oh, did they forget you were away?"
"I am going to a concert very soon.	You think it's very nice?"
"Imagine Dragon and Grace Vanderwhall, do you know them?	No, I saw them in concert a couple years ago. They are a beautiful band."
"Yes she was.	Our new property management person is remarkably efficient. She emailed me details of a conversation we had yesterday. The others promise the earth and don't deliver!	Wow, they deliver what? You trust them?"
"It is. I've been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it.	You did what you had to do. No beating yourself up about it. Just move on and be happy you got a new home and were able to make the choice you made."
"Absolutely! I move September 1st. No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!	School for my kids started again this past Thursday.	aww, that's nice. Did your kids have fun?"
"It was good. I am dealing with a mixture of both emotions about them being back in school. I was happy I had all the supplies, clothes, shoes, and other odds and ends in time.	I am sure you will be able to cheer on your team again someday!"
"I had planned a beach trip about a month before we actually went.	Was it a vacation?"
"We went to Virginia Beach earlier this week. I was so giddy up that whole month I could barely contain myself.	Oh wow! That sounds like an amazing trip, but I don't think I've ever been to Virginia Beach!"
"My husband, 2 kids and my mother. My kids had never been to the beach.	Awww man, the kids of the beach are born! How old are your kids?"
"I bought a ticket last week for the lottery, when it was over 100 million dollars.	Wow... that's quite a large sum of money. Did you play your ticket?"
"I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn, but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.	did you buy anything before the end?"
"True, but it would be fun spending that money.	My husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! This was unexpected and great news	What did he do?"
"It sure does. It came as a shock, but a pleasant one.	I'll bet. As long as you can crawl, you got this."
"I just went today to visit my son in his new house.	oh that sounds like fun i bet!"
"It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it.	of course. you're a good friend"
"So tonight we are suppose to go eat out as a family but I cant get a single one of my family members to agree on a place.  So frustrating!	That's unfortunate, hopefully you can persuade them to split the bill."
"That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.	I don't know if I could or would ever do that."
"Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.	Oh, I see. Well, I guess they will have to start next week with a bang. Can we expect a lawsuit then?"
"I guess that way the wallet wins every once and awhile too!  lol	I'm so happy that it is Friday!	I'm sure you are, thanks for that! What is your favorite Friday tradition?"
"Somewhat, I work 4 10 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. Yesterday was my off day. What about you?	Wehr had that when he was in 4th grade"
"feels disappointed because my friend fights with me	That's not a good feeling. Why do you feel that way?"
"no i can't because i love him a lot	Is he dead?"
"I have Lupus and it is getting worse.  I asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet I found that is suppose to help me with it.	Try that! I think you will like it!"
"yes, but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun	dang thats quite a radical idea. i hope it works for you"
"Some time ago, there was a terrible tornado that came through my city. It destroyed many homes, a school and some people died. I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it, or harm my familY!	Oh no that sounds terrible. My first tornado was scary too when a comet came through during the night. I know the feeling well seeing things happen in the night sky. Was your reaction pretty raw?It's terrifying to watch those kind of things happen. But it's even scarier when you have the patience to prepare. Was your reaction to seeing that happen was anything likelihood, or something completely"
"No, they are so awful! They can destroy so much.	inventory is full and we don't have room for more :("
"My husband took me to get a new wedding band recently	Was it a expensive one?"
"I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.	How wonderful! Well, I am sure you will be able to replace him."
"I love the holidays. Driving around looking at decoration is my favorite.	I love the holidays, too!"
"Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.	she probably still has some of it. you never know until you try"
"I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her	That's so sweet of her. Is she a beautiful woman?"
"I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.	It is so nice to have a friend like that!"
"A few weeks ago, we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But, it rained several days, so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted, which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.	I'm sorry to hear that. I've been there when I was younger."
"Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So, a long time since we first went.	Oh wow, so sorry about that. At least your daughter is very young and can grasp the concepts! It'll be great to have a time where she can say, ""You were the first one I've ever laid eyes on"""
"My husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting	Oh wow! I'm sure you were excited about that! How old are you both?"
"I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.	What type of work do you do"
"We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man, so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.	That is a very nice gesture by him. It is something that a lot of people would do."
"We didn't have much choice, as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat, so if we didn't, we'd come back to not having pets. But, I wouldn't just let anybody, that's for sure!	Thank you for that so much to think about that"
"My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell	Did she?"
"I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things	I bet. Trust is the backbone of any relationship."
"One night when my children and I came home, I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!	Aww dang, that must have been scary! Did you go out and check what it was?"
"It was so scary! Luckily, it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up, but it first appeared to be an intruder!	That's really scary, I'm glad it was an unexpected shadow and not your actual one!"
"Last weekend, my family and I enjoyed a nice meal together, and then watched a movie. It was a relaxing time at home, just enjoying each other's company.	That sounds relaxing!"
"Yes, it was drama free and a relaxing time.	Then it sounds like you have a really great girlfriend!"
"My dog, riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure	I am so sorry to hear that! Heart Failure is such a painful condition!"
"It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps	I am sure he is glad that you are okay. It's nice to know people do still care."
"I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me. She was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support, and that's why I didn't tell her. But, I still felt so bad about it.	That's his right as long as you weren't married! hahaha. That's very mature of you."
"Well, she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job, plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.	oh dang that is kind of sad"
"I am trying a new diet to treat my Lupus.	That sounds very interesting, what is lupus?"
"I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take	i am sorry about that! All i can do is be myself and try to figure it out! i hope it works for you!"
"There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments, so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating, since it causes others more work.	That is terrible, that is why I always have a second job."
"Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over, but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!	I say just let it go and see where it takes you. You have to spread the word!"
"My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning, and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.	Wow, that's so sad. I hope it wasn't something cruel."
"Yes, she was only about 9, and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!	Awwwww, I love animals! I have one that's been dying for a couple of years now. I still love her very much"
"I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.	That's wonderful! What will you do with the winnings?"
"Not normally, so I was quite surprised.	oh, i would be as well"
"$1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.	That's quite generous of you. Will your friend be able to help repay you?"
"Thank you, that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out.	I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day.	What happened?"
"Someone backed into my new car.	Oh no, that's terrible! Are you ok?"
"Yes, they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it.	Many years ago, we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her, but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!	Oh no! Well, I am sorry you feel that way. I am glad that your friend came out ok."
"Well, she was attractive and at the time, I thought he was thinking that too. But, I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, since she was falling down. But, it was hard to see it at that time lol	Now you see where I'm going with this. A little self care at such a young age can make all the difference."
"I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.	What happened?"
"Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night.	I could imagine. I bet some people really enjoy doing that kind of damage."
"Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.	Oh I get that, but I try to avoid the big cities where I can see things people don't see in my town, I guess."
"That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.	shoot a couple of frames and let me know how it goes"
"My aunt came to visit today, we went out for mexican food!	oh my lord, you must be so proud of her"
"Yes, kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours, she is on a road trip!	Wow. You are kind of jealous."
"I have a big exam for college coming up, I have been studying day and night.	hard work pays of"
"It is for my molecular biology class, I feel pretty good that I am going to Ace it.	Okay. that is great. I hope you do well."
"I went and saw a hockey game today, It was really exciting.	Oh I love hockey! What kind of team did you support?"
"No, I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool.	If you ever do go that would be amazing and nostalgic. You could play all the way through Toy Story and still have time to catch up!"
"I was on a run today, and saw a loose dog but couldn't catch it before it ran off!	Oh yeah, that happens to all dogs"
"Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!	I cant imagine what would happen that small dog would be hurt"
"I got some bad news today, my dad passed away.	I'm sorry to hear that. I know your pain so well."
"Thank you, I am a mess. It is still hasn't hit me that he passed away.	It can be hard to be angry at yourself sometimes. I know it must be very hard."
"Its so quiet in my house, my husband is out of town for work.	is he gone for a few weeks? or is the quiet everything going on?"
"True, I'm trying but keep hearing creepy noises. Guess I need to turn the TV up louder haha	I always try to hide in my closet when I'm feeling creepy."
"I got some great news today! My husband got a better paying job offer!	oh that's great! good for you guys"
"Not sure yet, but itll help us life more comforatbly! We move to his hometown in November when he gets out of Army!	wow thats great"
"My daughter is in highschool but took a college course this summer and got an A!	Awesome, I bet she is excited about that. I am the same way, I get so many mixed signals when it comes to the next stage in a pregnancy. I am happy for her though"
"That is very good. You should be proud of her.	I ate way too many sweets today!	Woah, that's a bad feeling. It happens to the best of us."
"Thanks! Being on a diet is hard, espically with family in town!	Oh no, you shouldn't let them into your life! That's pretty hardcore, lol."
"I was running today and felt like this car was following me..	How tiresome! Where you going, and what were you doing?"
"Yes it was, I think I need to start carrying pepper spray or something	I carry a pepper spray"
"Im watching the show The Bold Type, my favourtie characters dad died :(	That's a very sad thing, I am sorry. :( I forgot the name of the father, I think."
"Yes, it's a great girly drama! Reminds me of Sex in the City but Modern.	It's good. I liked some of the previews online. Hope you enjoy it!"
"It's been a great night! I'm just relaxing with a cold drink and my favourite show!	Oh yea...I've been thinking I want to do that when I'm older. It will be fun"
"Yes defenitly, It dosen't get better then this! My daughter has been fast asleep since 8pm.	Thats amazing. Kids grow up so fast. It's defenitly what I would do for sleep."
"My family is moving from Texas to Arkansas in a few months, Im worried for the change.	Oh, well good luck! Are you going to keep an open house to see what the new place is like?"
"My husband is getting out of the Army and moving back to his hometown where he has a few job offers! Big changes coming..	Oh, I see! I am happy for him! You must be excited about it!"
"I recently moved into a new home.	Oh, how are you feeling about it?"
"Yes, there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with.	I can imagine that. It is nice to be able to do something that is fun for them"
"We had been saving for 4 years to buy a bigger house. We had outgrown our other home.	I had a doctors appointment today.	oh its good to see someone with cancer. how is is going?"
"I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back.	oh damn, i would have been furious, they are supposed to be very good"
"I agree! Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever.	I had just moved in to my new apartment, and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door.	I bet you were livid. How did you handle it?"
"At first I tried to resist, but I ended up adopting him!	awww that is so sweet. I love animals, I hope you perfected your handling of him."
"I received a wrong number call last night at 2 in the morning.	oh no, did you get to sleep that night?"
"Yes! It was so aggravating. They would not believe me when I kept telling them it was the wrong number.	It's always tough being in a situation like that. I hope it was an isolated incident."
"She did twice before she finally believe me that there was no Bret there.	I recently found out that I am having baby number 4.	oh god!! first one yet? i hope it goes well"
"Wow! That is great. We were thrilled because we didn't know if we were going to have anymore and nature just decided for us.	Nature really does prevail over us all, I think."
"Yes they are. They make life worth living.	Halloween is quite a big holiday where I live. People get really in to their costumes!	Really? That sounds like what I would enjoy the most! Do you go to spooky parades or just the fairgrounds?"
"It's peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining. Last year I went as a plague doctor, and everyone agreed it was terrifying!	That must have been pretty entertaining!"
"Last year we lost our home of 20 years to a house fire.	Oh no! I can only imagine how devastating that is! Are you OK?"
"Yes, thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened.	That is great that they were always ready for you."
"No, we just bought another house closer to town. It was sad losing everything that we had.	When me and my friend got lost in the desert, I thought we were done for.	That is crazy how far we got"
"Only a couple of hours. We flagged down an old Chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out.	Old Chevys are great, do you like them?"
"I went tonight to meet my daughters teacher.	Oh yeah? How exciting. It's always nice to meet the next door neighbor."
"Yes, I think she will be a great teacher. She showed us her plan for the year and I think it was great.	effort and passion paid off"
"Thanks so much. I completely agree.	I just finished watching the Saw movie.	Did you like it? I did not understand much of it."
"I hated it! I didn't want to watch it but my husband did. The gore is just too much!	Yeah I've seen a lot of gore but I'm not a fan of blood!"
"Yep! I feel kind of sick to my stomach now from watching it.	I recently went down memory lane was looked at all my high school yearbooks.	Do you feel kind of nostalgic about it? I know I do."
"Well.... maybe not as awesome. lol But I do try to keep in shape. It was good seeing all my old friends.	Old people are amazing. I wish I could meet them like that."
"I do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch.	I would really like to get back to doing those. I have broken off many friends in the last few years but I still get to spend time with them"
"That's a good idea!	thanks"
"I had this guy flag me down today after leaving the store.	That's very nice of him! How long have you known him?"
"I was scared at first and then he hollered and pointed to the top of my car and I had left my purse on it. Boy, did my face get red.	That is scary! I would be mad, too. Did he follow you and if so, how did he do that?"
"My daughter just bought her first car on her own.	You must be very proud of her."
"It's a 2008 Mustang. She worked the last two summers to buy it.	I can imagine that is a very desirable car."
"She is super excited to start school now and show it off.	I'm leaving tomorrow to go on vacation!	How exciting! Where to?"
"We are going to Daytona and Orlando for 10 days.	That's a lot of fun, how fast will you be traveling?"
"I sure hope so! We've been planning this trip for a year.	What country are you in?"
"My husband and I have a fun weekend trip planned soon. We are going to go to the casino for the weekend, just the two of us. We are really looking forward to it.	That sounds awesome! What are you going to do there?"
"Yes, it's been awhile since we had just some time for us. Plus, we love Blackjack!	Oh nice. I am white, so I do not have that great of a history... but I have a friend that is from Europe and it is his first time there!"
"I have a very good friend and her live-in boyfriend of 5 years hit on me! I'm married, and he didn't care. He sickens me!	Awww man! Are you gonna date him?"
"Yes, I was really surprised and I find it terrible behavior.	Are you gonna get counseling?"
"We went on a vacation a few weeks ago, and it really made me think back to our last vacation. It was with my father, the last one before he passed away.	That's so sad, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you miss your dad?"
"I did, but of course, wished I had more time. He passed away unexpectedly, so I was going over that vacation in my mind too. I miss him.	Aww, I'm sorry. What a great lost dog you have! I hope you can grieve during and after your visit to him."
"I was pleasantly shocked the other day when I won on a lottery ticket! I hardly ever win and I won $200!	wow that is pretty awesome! are you going to give me money?"
"I just tucked it back for a rainy day. But, I may splurge with it this weekend, since it was unexpected.	Well that's good. I wish you the best of luck!"
"My husband sure did surprise me with his handiness and hard work around the house last week. He was able to accomplish so much work in a few days!	how wonderful you both must have worked so hard for so long!"
"Ok	I was the first person to receive a pretigious award at my college after years of the award being on offer.	That is very cool, what was the award for?"
"At the department office back at the school.	oh. that makes sense."
"One of my coworkers really ticked me off one day. She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!	Thats a strange thing to do! Did you tell her?"
"Yes, she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her, and it was her work! I let her know it too.	That is not fair! That must be so difficult. I hope you both can communicate more closely and that she doesn't take it too far!"
"One year my cousin wasn't going to get her young son anything for Christmas. It broke my heart so my husband and I bought his Santa gifts that year.	Aww that was so sweet of you to do. I hope he got what he wanted."
"The little guy deserved a Christmas and we really loved him.	I agree. These days, it's hard to imagine that my little brother was a child when he was. I'm glad he's grown up and is a grown man."
"When I went to the fair last year, I tripped on a large cord they had going across the walkway. It was a long, running fall! I wanted to hide!	Oh no! That sounds scary! Did you hurt yourself big time?"
"Scuffed knees, but mainly my pride. I was also in front an attractive guy I knew so it was even worse.	Sometimes that happens, but I always back off now and then to show them that I am more important."
"My husband and I are at a point in our lives, we are able to save, afford all that we need and save for retirement. I'm so appreciate we can, as I know many aren't able to do that.	That's so awesome. So I saved 40 bucks last year. Thanks to both of you."
"Yes, we have been working hard, as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times. But, it's worth having some financial freedom!	That's great."
"One day at work while I was pregnant, I fell! Luckily, the baby and I weren't hurt, but I wanted to waddle away so fast!	Oh no, that sounds terrible. Are you okay?"
"Yes, it really was quite so!	i bet it was! you deserved it."
"There are times I feel a bit alone and down. My husband has to travel out of town for work quite often.	Aww, that's a bummer! Maybe you can find a therapist to talk to about it!"
"Well, yes, of course. But, that isn't quite the same, is it.	No, it isn't. I think the main difference is that I want my dogs to be around me, you want your kids to be around you."
"My children recently started school again and it made me feel a bit apprehensive. They are growing up so quick, and I know it won't be long before they sadly move out of the house :(	I know how that feels. I have 3 kids myself, and honestly, I can relate to that."
"For sure! But, it flies by before you know it. I get my nerves on edge when I think about them all moved out of the house.	Did you all move in houses together?"
"Despite working until a few hours before, I scored highly on the ACT the first time I took it back in high school years ago.	The new assimilation test takes a long time to make. I hope you did well."
"Thanks. I thought I'd do poorly because I was tired.	it's okay, you will do better next time"
"Not that long ago, my husband planned a secret trip for us! I didn't have a clue he was doing it and was pleasantly shocked. It was so much fun!	Did you all have a blast?"
"We just took a weekend trip to Tunica, MS. We stayed at a really nice casino hotel and just played some Blackjack, enjoyed good food and each other's company!	That sounds really good!"
"I lied to my mother one day about where I was going. It made me feel pretty bad and have a bad conscience.	I'm sorry you were feeling guilty. Was it a good lie?"
"She didn't want me going with that friend, but I wanted to go, so I lied to her. I was much younger then.	oh thats ok, we all do stupid stuff at younger then"
"I won a free trip to Florida. It's not the best vacation, but I'll take it for free.	Wow. You are so generous. I hope you enjoy your vacation"
"I've been to Florida many times before so it wears on you.	I have been there 4 or 5 years. It will wear you out but it is beautiful the way it is"
"I won a lottery for a small amount of money.	Wow that is amazing! How much was it?"
"No, I wish. It was only a few hundred dollars.	Oh wow, that's not bad then!"
"A good friend of mine moved away recently and we lost contact. I really wish we would still speak.	That's incredibly frustrating. Have you tried calling their phone number?"
"That's a good idea. Maybe I'll try that soon.	You should! They are not hard to train up for, it just takes some time"
"Someone was speeding on the road and I got into an accident with them. My car was totalled because of their carelessness.	Oh, no! That is awful. Is your insurance going to be able to cover what was done to your car?"
"Yes, but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn't an enjoyable situation.	I can understand that. What happened next?"
"I let a friend watch my dog for a week while I was out of town. I would've been devastated if anything happened to him.	thats amazing, what did he do to your dog?"
"I hope so. I've only had my dog for a short time and this is my first time away from him.	im sorry, all animals are best so hopefully you will have another dog"
"I have been feeling great about life recently. My relationships have been going very well	How are they going?"
"I am not, but I have a person I am very fond of. Are you?	I am not. Have you tried telling them?"
"I got a surprise gift in the mail yesterday.	Was it a new puppy?"
"A gorgeous vase. It's so pretty. I have no idea who sent it.	Oh no! That's terrible. What type of vase did you receive?"
"Yes, I love flowers. I can't wait to fill it up.	My sister broke my vase. I was pretty enraged!	oh no. is she going to take responsibility?"
"I scolded her but then told her it was okay, but it's not the biggest deal!	Yes it is! I always say kids do not understand that they make mistakes until they have been in a car for a while."
"I'm am upset today because my daughter who lives really far away called and said her baby was admitted to the hospital.	Oh wow I would be upset too. Did your daughter give you a reason why she was upset?"
"He was premature so he's been having some breathing issues. I hate not being there.	That is unfortunately very difficult to deal with. I hope everything turns out well for him."
"I'm so taken by the talents of contestants on the show Face Off -- have you ever seen it?	I have seen it, is it good?"
"Their abilities to both imagine and create their characters is incredible!	Yes, he can do that too, you just have to be patient"
"A lot people know Toys-R-Us has completely shut down not long ago.	That's terrible, did you have fun shopping there?"
"Yeah, a lot of my friends and I got to thinking of all our memories there. Really makes you think back.	I certainly will have to check that out. My daughter is going to be a woman."
"I feel so bad, I forgot my sisters birthday...	That's terrible. Did you make it up to her?"
"Yes I plan on it, its just been stressful time at home with a toddler, it slipped my mind	Well hopefully it'll be better when it's older. With stress and stuff it's easy to get lost in your emotions. Hopefully you can let it settle and carry you through."
"I love my husband so much I could never cheat on him.	That is nice. A little trust is always nice."
"Yea, I wouldnt want to hurt him, i cant understand anyone who does.	Yeah you shouldn't even try"
"It can be really tough when your husband and teenagers have electronics.	I agree. But be sure to not let it get to that point!"
"I do for family time but sometimes I can sit in a full room and still feel no one is there	I have tried that and it gets annoying."
"Tomorrow is my husbands Birthday!	Wow! That's so beautiful. What are you going to do?"
"Yes, we are going out for a nice dinner. We haven't been on a date in months!	I'm jealous! Have fun!"
"I love the holidays, that make think back to being a kid.	Yeah, the holidays bring up a lot of memories. My favorite part about the holidays is getting to spend time with friends and family."
"Yea, that would really be great. Or maybe we'd get bored.	Or we could all go watch Netflix"
"There is a big storm going on in my town right now!	I hope it's not serious, I hate bad storms in my area."
"I don't, it makes me nervous with the strong winds and rain!	I am sorry, that sounds scary!"
"My favorite game has an expansion on Monday, I can't wait.	I will be checking it out on Monday! Maps, upgrades, stratagems...it's all there."
"World of Warcraft, It's been my favorite for years.	Sounds like a good game. What is your favorite character?"
"I just got a promotion at my job!	Congrats! That's great!"
"I work in Human Resources for a big company, I wasn't expecting the promotion! Feel Blessed :)	That's awesome, congratulations!"
"I really like every shelf in my house to be arranged just so.	That is a great idea. I like to keep everything handy."
"I do, everything is in it's place. It thoroughly bothers me when someone puts random stuff on them, like cups or papers.	That is very annoying, you should not have to deal with that anymore!"
"I just found out my husband is cheating on me..	Oh no! What will you do?"
"A few months, I'm not sure what my next move is. Staying in a hotel for a few days to think.	I would do that, its nice and warm out these days"
"My daughter is finally fully potty trained!	that is great! i bet you are proud"
"Yes, I am very happy as well! No more buying diapers haha	That's so true!"
"So, my new puppy is adorable though maybe not as amazing yet as yours.	a little spiderman?"
"She's so cute and fun, i love her already.	You should talk to her a lot because you promised"
"I started doing more research on salaries for the degree I'll have in 6 months.	That's a good plan. You guys should end up meeting in a place called Glass House. It's a job fair for new graduates."
"It seems to be about 60,000 per year just out of college. I am eager to see if the statistics are correct.	That is a lot of numbers"
"I know it's silly, but my friend got something I wanted in a game the other day, bit sad.	What did he get?"
"I guess, little things at times right?	yeah little things at times"
"I watched The Lion King today with my daughter, reminded me of my childhood.	Aw how cute. I bet she's an amazing person too."
"Yes! I'm excited for that as well. I watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!	awww. I hate watching horrible movies. That was soooooo old."
"5	huh?"
"Opps. Ok, i mean that I was sad the other day because a friend is moving.	Ok, that is sad. But, I am sure they are trying their best"
"not to far, but it's still sad to see her go.	Yeah - sometimes pets go so fast. I'm sure she's in good hands in time."
"I have been having a rough week!	oh i hate to hear that, are you okay?"
"Yes but I am afraid I might loose my job..	I don't blame you. I have had to. Loud houses are a thing of the past."
"I hate how our country is right now.	I don't blame you. The way things are right now, the country is totally run amok."
"People just can't seem to get along, makes me sad.	i am sorry, i know, i have been in that situation as well"
"I spent all weekend alone, wish my family lived closer.	that sucks"
"My family is over 2,000 miles away in Alaska, its tough!	Well I hope you two can see each other again soon?"
"My husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache	Ouch, are you sure it wasn't an accident?"
"Not yet, but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.	That's so kind of you! I'm sure he will appreciate that."
"Ah, it's been rough. My dog passed away two nights ago.	sorry to hear that"
"Thank you, she was 12 years old so I knew it was coming but still shook up about it.	I bet you were so proud of her!"
"I hate when it storms so bad the power goes out	yea i feel like that too"
"I agree.	Is there anything else you would like to say to them?"
"I found a hundred dollar bill when cleaning my closet!	Oh! What did you do with it?"
"No! I'm not sure where it came from! and I live alone :O	Oh, well that's no good... hopefully they will contact you with compensation."
"There was a huge spider on my wall, it ran away before I could kill it..	Run!"
"Me too, I think it was a wolf spider. I hope I can sleep tonight	Oh my goodness! I think you might be in for a surprise!"
"I'm so nervous, have a final exam on Tuesday!	Oh, I failed the English I took last year, I know that by heart. You should feel confident in the English."
"Yes, I have been studying a lot but still worried. I need to get a good grade!	As you should, to graduate you will need to study harder!"
"I have to give a speech on Thursday.	You must be nervous. What will you be saying?"
"Yes. But mentally I am never ready to give a speech if im being honest.	I understand that completely"
"It's on local politics. Not a fun subject either!	I sold some stuff I didnt need last week.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that!"
"Yea, enought to have great weekened anyway.	great weekneden, I hope you have a great weekend."
"I think that my husband and me have so much faith in each other.	That's wonderful. We're lucky to have each other."
"I know, I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.	It's important! Honest love is the best!"
"Ten years ago now, a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate. I didn't know if there would be anything to come back to.	That's terrifying, so many people have evacuated before?"
"Pretty messed up, but the house was still standing.	haha. thats a great feeling."
"was travelling 14 hours internationally. First flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative	That is really frustrating. Did you get charged extra?"
"British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting, they could not	ya, that is true but it is convenient to have those places available to you, that is why i travel alot"
"I've felt excited when I found out I had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course, taught by someone who I knew could help me in ways that I would I not be able to through self-study alone.	Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself."
"Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special!	You definitley have great teachers, much appreciated"
"I think it was :)	I like going fishing, it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.	I used to fish when I was younger, but it was way easier when I was a kid. I love doing the flips and cork in the water."
"I do, I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?	Great, how many children do you have? Mine is 3, so I'm only prone to having babies"
"I dropped all my food in the cafeteria the other day. Everybody was staring at me.	That must have been embarrassing. Were you able to recover by the time you got to go home?"
"No, it was at work.	Neither did I. I'm sorry."
"I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it!	Ah! Did the car start up again?"
"Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!	The first one was my favorite, thanks for the info."
"I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!	Oh nice. I never start, lol"
"Auburn Tigers	its a nice color"
"I did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday.	Oh no, what happened?"
"I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.	Don't people just drive away!? Did they at least cry out in pain?"
"I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.	Oh how exciting. I am sure you have a lot of proud memories of him."
"Oh yeah, definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!	yes all the hard work pays off buddy"
"I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!	- Did they have any idea who the culprit was?"
"It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.	Wow, you must be lonely. I can understand that. Did anything good happen?"
"I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.	Oh my, I hope you are ok? That is a crazy thing to do"
"Yes, I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!	sorry to hear that!"
"My transmission in my car went out the other day, maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.	That's always a blessing when you have reliable transportation. It's good to know that you're not alone."
"Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too, so my money is tied up.	That's unfortunate. At least you will have a roof over your head now!"
"I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.	What did you do?"
"No, I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.	Did you call the police?"
"Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!	That's great! I hope you have a good trip!"
"I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary	I agree, it feels good to have all the knowledge and tools you need to take care of yourself."
"Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech, and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!	That is crazy. I always thought rock and roll was all about the guitars."
"I'm sorry if I was unclear, I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).	Yes, that can sometimes be a little jarring. Was the set not meant to be?"
"So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!	wow that's amazing! i can not wait to learn to play this game!"
"Yes, very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.	I've never bowled and would be interested, maybe go to a local store and see if they have a spin and try it out."
"So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!	No way, that's the worst."
"We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess	Yeah, we talked to them after they had gone for at least 5-10mins. they need a lot of nurturing"
"I am starting a new phase in my life. Completed all debt and off to a new start	Great. What are you going to do with the money?"
"yes very. but I know that it will be good.	I hope it is, for my work we have a ay y No way."
"Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress	I wish you the best of luck!"
"I try to be. it can be difficult on some days, but I think I have a good attitude towards most things	Sounds like you have a great husband and a great wife!"
"I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.	that's awesome! what are you studying?"
"Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.	you got this workerplacements are coming again soon and lots of good ones too"
"My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck	That's great, it must be quite unaffordable for your friend."
"Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!	That's quite an amazing feat! I'd love to be in that position."
"So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.	Oh no! I hope it didn't hurt too bad!"
"No, but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.	That is impressive, i would be so scared if i encountered such a thing."
"My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.	That's got to be frustrating. Does he have fun with it?"
"No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!	Of course, that is very important. When did this happen?"
"I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!	That's awesome! I had a new car too when I went into work and loved it! Not just a car though, these shoes are very stylish."
"I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.	im sure, theres nothing like true freedom"
"I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.	Yeah I love hits. I like the classic tunes like ""You'll be alright"" and ""You'll be in love""."
"It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado, 2pac, etc.	Oh cool I imagined it was fun. That sounds like a good time!"
"My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.	That is so scary! Is he okay?"
"They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.	I am sure they will pass the tests they have. They have been through enough before"
"I am so excited - after a year of misery due to my loud, inconsiderate upstairs neighbors I'm finally moving into a new apartment!	That is great. I have a neighbor with a ton, and I consider my floor about as quiet as a drum. It's a great feeling to have new neighbors!"
"I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!	That is awesome, peace and relaxation are the best for all!"
"Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)	I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!	How frustrating! I bet you felt terrible about it."
"It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.	I am sure it was not a good feeling. I bet your date felt bad too."
"We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone, especially my brother and sister.	I hope you all have a good time. Family reunions are the best."
"It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.	i hope they make an effort to meet more often"
"I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.	That is great, how did you do it?"
"Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it, but consistency does seem to pay off.	indeed it does and it feels great"
"I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.	That's awesome to hear! I bet all that hard work will pay off."
"I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though, I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future	That's great to hear! I start Crossfit this coming weekend. I've been trying to get in for a couple months and never really achieved success. What's different this time?"
"My brother got a custom-made bowling ball, and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.	Aw, that's so cool! I really wish I had a favorite toy or appliance. Maybe a gaming computer would be cool!"
"He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.	I bet that is a lot of fun! I would be a ball of nerves, even though I play videogames."
"Ok, so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!	What if the noise was coming from the wrong place?"
"Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)	I see :) I hope they don't go back to that on a Saturday"
"Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.	It's just part of life, getting older. You just don't know when it's right to come out and say something or when it's not. It's been going on for so long that I don't know how it's possible to go into, but hey, maybe something good could come of it!"
"Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.	Or you could just not listen to them at all and be ok. I'm sure that'll work out!"
"I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.	Did you try to go to go home?"
"No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.	Well that's funny and terrifying at the same time. I hope you ARE clean now though lol"
"I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!	oh wow that sounds exciting! are you going to go to them?"
"I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him	I am sure they will be great parents."
"I can't help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time.	How is it now?"
"I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.	I'm sure that is a hard thing to deal with"
"The last time I went into a job interview, I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.	That is great, do you feel like that is a good thing or that you could have gotten a better deal?"
"Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.	Yes, I know how you feel. I had to buy a second pair last year."
"Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!	Did you get scared?!"
"I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!	Haha! That must have been hilarious! I bet you were so happy!"
"It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my ""attacker"" off with!	I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself	oh wow! that's a bold move!"
"I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese	I'm sure you can do it! Keep your head up! If it's not too bad, I hope you can get it under control."
"My co-worker just bought a brand new car.	Wow, they must be so jealous of your success!"
"I know, me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.	Have a nice day, I am sure they will appreciate you too!"
"i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i'm so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are	Craigslist is a scary place, I have had phone calls where people were wanting to kill you."
"I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone	that is a bummer, hopefully you can find time together to make your own memories, you both deserve to miss time together."
"I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!	That sounds very exciting. What will you be doing in the forest?"
"Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!	I have heard that traffic is not so good in this city. Maybe try going to one of the waterfront parks?"
"They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.	Someone stole my identity.	OH no. What did you do?"
"I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.	Dang. Do you know who did it?"
"i have food on my table, a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful	Sounds like a pretty good life. I'm happy to hear that."
"yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted	I know that feeling. I still have some in my family."
"so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets	pattern making! I really need to get a sawing machine, because it's so easy. There is nothing like having a 4 by 6 inch blanket that you can cut out patterns on."
"thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies	That is my goal too"
"I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!	I arranged a trip to Cali a few years ago and it went amazingly well. But, the summers there is not my favorite."
"Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.	Oh, yes. I wish I had a good friend who could take my place."
"Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!	When I spend time with my family, it reminds me how lucky I really am.	That's something I think about often."
"Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.	Yes, I always remind myself to be thankful for the little things in life."
"My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much	Aw, you must be so happy for your dog."
"She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?	I have a few dogs. I love them, but they can get a little crazy when they don't have their owners around."
"School starts a week from tomorrow and I am getting fairly nervous for it!	college?"
"Oh yes, I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?	Yea. I mean, it is over now doesn't mean it makes or breaks anyone. And I love holidays like it's the start of fall lol"
"I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it	I think people think that because everybody around you is doing well, that means you have no problem letting everybody do well."
"yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad	Everyone does it. It's just an introverted feeling."
"I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.	I totally know what you mean. I just hate the idea of giving up on a semester that you've invested so much in. Get everything you can while you still can, because when that's all, you won't need it as much."
"I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.	I am sure you will. Part-time jobs are not for everyone."
"My brother just turned 16 and he's about to get his first car! I'm so excited for him.	Congrats, you must feel like an uncle to him."
"Probably some kind of SUV, maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!	Those are swell cars, would you recommend them?"
"I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!	That's awesome. What kind of car?"
"I want an SUV, like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!	good deal. i am happy for you. stay safe"
"Recently my husband and I were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off	That is a horrible situation. What happened?"
"I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary	Did you call the police?"
"My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.	Oh no, how old is he or she?"
"She will be 30. It makes me feel so old, but also how fun it was when they were little.	That will be lovely, you will miss them a lot"
"I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I	Are you happy? What made you feel that way?"
"Sorry, I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!	Oh lol. Well I really hope you continue to progress"
"I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.	That must have felt good! It was calming while you were in the middle of it"
"Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!	I just love Dragon tongue beans. I can't believe people still eat them!"
"They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.	That's very palatable. I'm guessing you have a certain demographic that enjoys the sight of beans?"
"What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!	I love organic! I have never found anything GMO. What else do you need to know?"
"I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!	What did he do?"
"Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!	That's funny, I guess snakes can be frighten scary!"
"My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.	That's great that he showed confidence in you and your abilities!"
"Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.	for what?"
"When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.	Thats sad, i was aware of him before and totally miss him now"
"It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!	Every dollar spent should be put towards something good."
"Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.	I am sure you mean parapsychology. I was wondering if you could give me a call to talk about it. I have a psychic friend who can help me with my issues."
"There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.	I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away	Oh I see, you had some good talks with her. btwn talking to her you have to keep your weight in check b/c of being unable to see her."
"Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!	That's nice! I'm glad you had the opportunity to see her."
"I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!	Wow that's shocking that he actually won that...utchy."
"Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!	That is the best kind of drunken fun, the ones where you have a belly full of beer and can barely keep yourself going"
"I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.	OK, I have to go to 6th grade and they have no teacher at all."
"That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.	I agree. Kids nowadays grow up so fast. It's crazy how they can do things we thought were impossible just a few years ago."
"That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.	When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.	You must have been embarrassed when you went through that. What did he do after an earthquake?"
"It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!	I am sure you are! I hope all goes well with your new found happiness!"
"I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.	i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please	That's amazing! How old is he?"
"he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian	Wow! That's impressive! Good for him. It's never too late to get a degree or job!"
"A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.	I bet it was a nice surprise!"
"Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.	Yeah, here we are almost a year later, and same thing happens. She's still the same, age, same effort as when she started."
"No, moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband, but we split up.	I found a cat in my attic yesterday!	That's amazing! What did you do with it?"
"My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!	that is a really scary thing to have to deal with"
"My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.	Aww, that's terrible, sorry to hear that. Long time friends are hard to come by"
"Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!	That's great. Good for her."
"She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!	I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!	I've never tried it, but my husband has and he said it's ""the best thing he's watched in a long time""!"
"I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!	Hulu is a great option if you can get it! What's your fav show?"
"My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident, I'm so upset.	Uh oh. What kind of cat?"
"Yes, we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.	well i hope it wasn't!"
"I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.	I hear your concern. I remember in the old days the stories were the same - the hearth was ablaze. How could you in your right mind lose all your family in a wildfire?"
"Yes, I heard about it. Such a sad story.	How did he die?"
"My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..	That's so nice of them. Was it a surprise?"
"I did! It was a very nice gesture.	i bet it was i bet your are so lucky!"
"We are waiting on military orders right now, I'm so hoping they come through next week.	oh wow i am happy for you"
"Yes, we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.	I'm sure the official order won't change for a while. We should just keep packing our bags and going our separate ways, I guess."
"I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.	I hear you. I'm always make fun of the way some people treat animals. It's not nice"
"Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.	To which I would respond with ""Well sometimes people are really evil"". Maybe you should try giving the guy a call and see what he thinks."
"For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.	Ah, those are the good ones. Those are the ones you really enjoy."
"It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!	That is wonderful that you are so fond of the old days. It is always wonderful to look back and reminisce."
"It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in!	Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.	Oh my gosh, I have friends like that! It's crazy they can't live without it. Do you spend a lot on eating out?"
"Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries.	That's a lot of money! My husband spent about the same amount a couple of months ago"
"We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.	Are you going to Kansas?"
"Texas, there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change.	I went on my first camping trip to Colorado in March and loved it! It's much easier to spend time out in the outdoors for the first time."
"Awesome, my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.	I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.	Well that's good preparation! It's scary when you do nothing!"
"So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.	That's good to hear. I hope your health improves!"
"My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her, one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!	That's wonderful. Are they happy about it?"
"Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!	Your family sounds wonderful. It's always nice to have some fun and enjoy family time."
"Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.	My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards	That is a very exciting thing to do. Is she sick all the time?"
"She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess	That probaby sucks, I hope she gets better"
"Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us	Sorry to hear that. I have lost many family members over the years. Are you and your family around at the end of the hall?"
"Yes, it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult, so it was really hard when she passed.	i'm so sorry to hear about you, i had a similar experiencerain about my moms daughter when she was little and it was so beautiful as well"
"We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.	That's great that you had extra stuff to last you a long time."
"I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.	That's really good. Everyone would like to get away and be alone."
"I've been so busy packing, packing and more packing.	oh haha. I do that as well. its so much fun"
"Yes, don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.	You will get through it, don't feel down. you are doing everything you can think of to make it through"
"I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.	That's great to hear. I recently got married, to a cool co-worker,same, but it's always the first thing people think of when they think of a happy marriage. Be sure to cherish every single moment with him, no matter what!"
"I do feel very lucky, especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.	in your old age?"
"I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.	How was the song?"
"Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back	Ricky Martin? That's pretty amazing. I was looking at his music art when I was a kid. It's pretty cool."
"I took a test for college the other day, it was basically our midterm.	We're in our senior year, yeah. Did you do well?"
"I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.	I am sure you did great! I would be so pumped about it if you got the job anyway."
"Discrete mathematics	I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago. I know a guy who was playing in it. Guess what? He won! Fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!	Oh yeah I have a bit of a passion for golf in America. It used to be pretty popular there but not as much. So much fun!"
"He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to, lol!	What champ is he playing in?"
"You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!	Nice! I'm sure you are both very proud of your loved ones!"
"Thank you - he'd appreciate it. It makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved.	I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.	Skydiving is amazing! I actually took a job as a ""skydiver's instructor"" in Scotland. It's amazing how you can get experience like that and make friends just by skydiving!"
"There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.	I live in Florida."
"There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!	Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life	Some people are always on the winning side of things. That's great! But, sometimes you have to win on your own terms, and that's ok!"
"Exactly!  I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is ""Always be prepared""	oh how fun! its always good to have friends you can count on"
"You know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? That happened to me recently - the owners rented it out the night before I was to see it :(	Oh no. Did you end up going?"
"Yes, but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!	Yeah, those things are a bit of a relief. But yeah, its a relief to have a place like that!"
"I'm sure I will so long as I have good neighbors. I'm over the first place now, but it wasn't pleasant to be pipped at the post!	my horse died last week i was devastated when i found out	That is terrible news."
"yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad	Wow, that's gross, did it spread to others?"
"i am always outside my house beafore my friend gets here	And thats what makes it fun - you can just be free to be and be outside - you are in the moment."
"i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives	Do you love him?"
"i was really happy the day i finished my doctorate	Congratulations! What do you want to study?"
"yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end	At the very least it gives you a reason to keep coming back even if you don't feel like it. I want to work at a tire company someday."
"in science of medicine it was really a fun exppirience	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, and is getting back in a week.  I'm super pumped!	That's awesome! I bet you're excited about that."
"No, taking a language course to help her graduate studies.  Good guess though :P	very good"
"My wife is coming back into the country after being away for 2 months.  I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P	oh its nice to see her again, sounds like you really miss her."
"Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad, but it's nice to come home to a clean house.	I can sense that tidbit of information making you feel peace. I'm glad you're not worried she'll let you know when she's home."
"i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public	oh no! that's a terrible thing to have happen. burn at home please."
"yeah it is the worst, i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing	I would imagine so. I would hate that my friend."
"I had a bad experience out to eat the other day.  I don't do it too often, so it was a bummer.	Oh, no! I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.	Yeah, I can understand that. I don't like bad food, and I definitely don't like bad service."
"I was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn't watching where I was going and knocked over an entire display.	Were you able to save any of it?"
"It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it. My face was bright red.	*sigh* It happens though, it is normal for teenagers to be embarrassed and ashamed at times. I hope nobody else knows about it and you can clean it up for next time"
"My wife has been out of the country for two months and is getting back in a week.	How does that make you feel?"
"Definitely :)  It's been a long and lonely summer :)	Keep that positive attitude! There is a summer for everyone!"
"I recently moved from California to North Carolina and suddenly realized I knew absolutely nobody. It was a horrible feeling.	i can imagine how you were feeling. were you able to recover by yourself?"
"My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway, a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly, huh?!	haha, you're right. I was actually in a city with lots of available apartments and I just could not afford it either. Well, friend safe drove across too - safe and I are going to stay with you."
"The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.	I know what you mean. Renting is a pretty expensive thing. I paid $1/hr for my first apartment and since moved to a place $3/hr up. Gas is another thing."
"The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?	Vancouver, Canada. It's crazy the different types of life you can get from outside the country - deserts, volcanoes, nature!"""
"A while ago I drove from Florida to Northern California. It's a long trip, but I knew I could do it just fine.	IRA, I am sure you will be fine. How far are you heading?"
"It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East, so kind of knew what I was doing.	It was probably worth it for you. Sometimes you just need a break."
"Oh no - I'm not a race car driver, lol. And anyway, it's kind of fun seeing different parts of the country, so rushing would (to me) be a waste.	My wife was really sick the other day, she was stuck in bed for most of the day.	How did she get sick?"
"Not completely sure, maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now, though her appetite took a bit to come back.	Sounds like it. Sometimes when I go to a new restaurant I forget to bring enough money for my taxi."
"summer was so boring for me, im really happy school is starting again	Oh yeah for sure! I didn't get a chance to go to school much because my job went to such someone else, but I know some people who are really busy and sacrifice for their kids"
"not really, i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did	i would have been upset as well, my father also worked all summer as well as i did"
"My mom is having weight loss surgery next week, I'm nervous.	That can be very scary. I hope the surgery goes well."
"She is having gastric bypass surgery, I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!	what does she have going on?"
"there is nothing i hate more than losing in something	More than anything, just hate losing so much! More so than anything else."
"not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me	I agree, I get that. I would be extremely frustrated as well."
"It has been a wonderful Monday!	Oh yeah? What's going on?"
"I found out a got a pay raise at my job, we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in November!	Wow that's awesome. Congratulations! Are you going with your family?"
"I read in the news about a family who lost all six of their animals in a house fire :(	That's terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you lost all your pets?"
"I know, it made me upset! My two dogs are my babies couldn't imagine loosing them.	I lost my grand mom last year and it was just such a shock. It's so hard to lose a loved pet."
"my dog is over at the vet for 4 days and makes the house feel so alone'	Is your dog Lab? I see that you have such a sweetheart."
"yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back	What was wrong?"
"My wife went out of the country for a couple months at the beginning of the summer, dropping her off at the airport was really tough.	Oh that does sound rough. Sorry you had to go through that."
"Not for more than a few days.  It's been a rough couple months, but it's almost over!	Well that's good news. What will you do then?"
"When my wife and I had to move for her to go to school, we had a lot of trouble finding a place to live until my parents were nice enough to cosign on a loan.	Were you guys able to find a similar house a little closer to home?"
"We are.  They've helped a lot during my life, but this might have been the biggest one.	I am sure they will understand"
"i cant wait to visit my family back home they are so far away i dont get to see them a lo	That's a wonderful place to be. I hope to visit with my family soon."
"in a couple of weeks i am really happy to see them it has been 5 years	That's awesome! Wish you lots of luck with your wedding!"
"i cant get near spiders, even if i see them in pictures they freak me out	Me too! Do you know what makes them so scary?"
"not really i was just born afraid of them hahah	I was also scared, but I have since gotten over it."
"A few years ago, before we got married, my wife planned a party for me for my birthday completely without me knowing.	Wow, you must have been surprised. Did you ask her for her birthday money back?"
"It really was!  I walked into my apartment to like 15 more people than I expected.	Oh man, you should make sure you put some stickers on the way to work next time."
"i hate when my little brother throws food on the table just to annoy m e	I know! I like them squirrel sitting but they are too cute when they are playing."
"he is like 11 but he does it when my parents are not home it is really anoying	I see, your son is pretty amazing."
"I was stopped at a traffic light when a woman in a truck scraped slowly along the side of my car.	Oh no, that's painful. Are you okay?"
"Yeah, we both stopped and pulled over.  I think she was high or something, she was really off.	Well she will know better than to do that again"
"i found a little ball of hair when i was eating at a fancy restaurant	I bet that was a surprise and not something you expected."
"yeah i did, they gave us a refund and we did not come back to that place again	Yea, that is pretty terrible. Their customer service is terrible."
"I had made plans for dinner and had set everything out and I found out my husband ate all the bread!	Oh no! That is a terrible predicament to be in! I'm sorry to hear that. Did you ask him why he was done eating the whole loaf, and what did he say?"
"It wasn't even garlic bread! It was generic bread to dip in soup!	oh man theres only one kind of bread to dip in soup, that's awful."
"i feels surprised	Why is that?"
"my boy friend gives me a birthday gift surprisingly	That's nice, what did you receive?"
"My neighbor used to have an old beagle - a lovely pooch. He died of cancer just before Thanksgiving. I looked for him for weeks - I miss him.	Oh no, I'm so sorry - is there any possibility to adopt the dog again?"
"Yeah. I used to see him when I was out on my porch and he'd come out for a sniff around or a tinkle. He was so sweet and gentle.	That is so sad. I am glad he is long gone."
"They sure are. I actually prefer them to some humans I know! Do you have a dog at the moment?	I just got a new cat. Her name is Oreo."
"That's wonderful, that you were able to take her in. Good for you! More people should act like that.	They do. We need more people like you in the world."
"I'm not a very good cook but sometimes my husband scares me with it!	What does your husband usually do to make it scary?"
"He was putting chocolate right into the chilli the other night!	Nic! He's seriously doing that, he must be a chocoholic!"
"My son came home today and was working on his homework.	How come?"
"In 7th and they're doing pre algebra. He said he didn't know it, then proceeded to get every question right!	Wow, he really is a talented kid!"
"I've been training hard for a marathon next week, and I am beating my record time!	Holy cow, that's amazing! I bet you feel so accomplished when you smash that."
"For a few months now, but I've been training pretty hard just these past few months.	That's a good thing to keep you fresh."
"I'm very socially awkward and tomorrow i'm going to have a playdate with some local moms and i'm so anxious	Maybe you should go with them next time instead of making a new friend!"
"that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice.	Hello all,"
"I recently went to ruby falls, an underground cavern with a waterfall.	I love mines! I always wanted to go there but could never make it in the right place at the right time. So much to see and do. Are you coming back again?"
"Not that particular one, no. I had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down 23 stories.	Well it's good to hear someone is still here. Chills probably run like high as 23 stories right up to if you don't have any type of safety devices."
"Overall it was a good time, but i was nervous being that far underground, i need to learn to relax and enjoy things.	I had some hesitations when I was at the gym today, thought I wouldn't be able to handle the weights	Oh no, what happened? Are you okay now?"
"I decided to focus on the music that was blasting, just tried switching up what I play in the gym, it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle	Interesting, I like the jonwayne music too. What is it blasting?"
"Have you ever been in a car crash before?	no has it ever occurred to you? if it has you may be able to avoid it in the future"
"I got T-boned once, I'll never forget spinning around in that car, hearing the tires squalling. It was really scary.	I am so sorry that happened to you! That is so scary!"
"My wife has been really sad here recently, I've had to hold her while she cries herself to sleep at night.	That's no good, how did she die?"
"Shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer. We've been to 4 funerals, and the most recent one was really hard on her.	Oh that's so sad. How long has it been since she has been able to spend time with you? It's hard to lose someone so dear to you"
"My bank, which I've had a savings account with for over 10 years has been deducting $15/month from me for ""inactivity"". How about that?	did you raise a fuss?"
"Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.	They sound like a really good trust, and you should continue to have it!"
"Yes. They said that they'd been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money. What rubbish. It just amazes me!	Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.	No, I haven't. But yes, it is always so painful."
"Yes, my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.	I'm so sorry to hear that. I know what it's like to have to deal with something like that and it's so unfortunate. I hope you're able to get through it and that you're OK."
"Have you ever had a new puppy?	Yes, I did when I was about 14 months. I had so much fun with him/"
"Yeah, he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside, but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!	The poo should be gone for good now, but you can always clean it up!"
"I store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid. I was storing my last piece in there	sounds like a good idea"
"Last night I wasn't in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone!	Oh no! I'm sorry! What was it?"
"I ran into my neighbor's mailbox with my car but didn't stop and leave a note.	thats what i do, i would have left a note too"
"I agree, I felt so bad about it. When I saw him replacing it, I went out and confessed.	wow this is a good friend"
"i'm so stressed. we are struggling financially and i don't even know how are we going to pay rent this month	I am sorry to hear that, I know how you feel. If you have family help them out as much as they can."
"thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it's expensive	Oh god! I hate it when that happens! Is it going to be fixed?"
"My mom made a pretty awesome scrapbook and gave it to me for christmas several years ago. I recently dug it out and went through it.	That's so kind of her!"
"Photos from my whole life growing up, with sections about my relationships with each sibling. pretty awesome.	That sounds very fulfilling."
"I once was taking a big trip I had been looking forward to and the day before we leave for an international flight a high level travel advisory was issued for the area we were going.	What? Are you kidding me? That's insane. Where was the high level travel advisory issued from?"
"No. We went ahead and went on. It actually turned out to be a great trip with zero incidents.	That's great, nothing beats a good adventure."
"Yeah. Glad we didnt bail.	Did you find out who stole it?"
"No. Best I can remember it didnt even rain.	I hate it when plans fall through. I really wanted to spend my time on the water this last weekend.	Oh no! That is a nightmare! Did you go on vacation?"
"I was going to Florida to go on a multi-day canoeing and camping trip. At the last minute, the two people I was going with backed out, and I simply couldn't afford to go alone.	Wow, you're no fun, sorry to hear that! Will you be able to reschedule with someone you trust?"
"My grandpa always said he was a rockstar back in his day, but I never believed him.	What instrument was it?"
"I don't know if he was famous, but the other day, he got on stage, bit the head off of a bat, then belted the words to Crazy Train. It was unbelievable!	Holy moly, that would make me cry! Such a sad and courageous thing to do."
"I used to do flooring work, we had to deal with some pretty strange situations sometimes.	Oh no, what happened?"
"well, one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him. was revolting.	Oh no! No way! It's one of my worst fears! I feel sick for people who have to deal with that every day."
"It really bothers me that my son sticks his dirty socks in the toy box	That's ridiculous. What a child!"
"I guess so haha but no matter what I try to keep him from doing it, it still happens	Same here. Kids can be really annoying."
"I recently had my hip-length hair cut for the first time in years.	Oh wow. How did it go?"
"It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut, but it looks much thicker and healthier now.	That's great, hopefully it last a long time."
"I went around work all day today with a hole in my pants, right on my bottom.	That's a sight to wake up to! I bet you were embarrassed!"
"Yep! No one told me. :( I have no idea how many people noticed or saw it.	I would be really upset. I would have told someone and gotten into big trouble."
"I paid $1000 for one of those mystery boxes on eBay. It said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items.	Oh wow! What did it actually have in it?"
"I would've happily taken that! Instead, it was filled with literal garbage, like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.	Wow, that's trashy even for them!"
"I had my final exam for Chemistry today!	That's nice. Did you study hard?"
"I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.	Congratulations on the test! If you're good then you should Pass!"
"It can be rough when I have a problem and need to vent to someone	yes i know that feeling"
"You are sweet because part of the problem is when I realize there really is no one to talk to. Thank you	It's part of being human! I guess I have never heard the term before."
"I've been training a new girl at work this week!	Oh really? That's a great idea! How's she doing so far?"
"She's doing great, especially for her second week on the job!	That's fantastic. I'm sure she'll do great."
"I've already been shopping for christmas, I'm excited!	I love Christmas! Are you going to be getting lots of gifts?"
"I know, it's my favourite time of year! Makes me happy :)	yeah it is!"
"I was just at the casino, spent almost 100 dollars on a single machine. I didn't will anything.	That's pretty awful, I would recommend going again though. Maybe get a spare machine for another time"
"Haha, yeah I got a little sauced. The worst part though was as soon as I got up, someone sat down and  rolled triple 7s.	oh god, thats so bad. You better go over and fix that, or risk the ridicule and even death threats."
"I used to get supremely scared when I wanted to go up stairs when the lights were off	Wow that's bad. Sometimes you just need a little bit of terror to let you know what's out there."
"Yeah, so I would book it up the stairs as fast as possible	That's a good idea. And make sure you don't end up in the laundry room!"
"I just got matched up with someone online. It will be my first date in a while.	What was the person's first name?"
"Yeah, I'm really hoping to make a good impression. Other wise that would feel pretty bad.	I hope you do. I am sure you will."
"Tomorrow is the big day, I have to deliver my proposal to the client.	I'm sure it'll be fine. Do you have any family nearby?"
"I have been preparing for weeks, but in the back of my mind I still have doubts.	I sure hope that you do alright, it would be bad if you gave up! Just out of the water."
"My boyfriend's cat wakes me up every morning at 4 AM.	My boyfriend has a cat. It wakes me up every morning at night too. Is that a pet?"
"I love him, too, a lot. But I don't know why he just stands in the hallway and meows nonstop, even when he's been fed.	That makes no sense! Maybe he's never seen a puppy before?"
"Ashe. He's cute :)	I'm finally almost done with my associate's degree! I technically started wayyyy back in 2011, but I just got serious in 2016.	Congratulations! That takes some serious dedication. How did you do?"
"Thank you. :) I only have three classes left to take. I'm so excited.	I hope you do well anyway! What are you studying?"
"Thanks a lot ;)	Playing hookey can be really fun. But sometimes it backfires...	harmonising sounds really nice but at the end of the day, everyone makes mistakes."
"When I was a teenager, I called in to the restaurant and told them I had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away. Wouldn't you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!	Section away?!? That's pretty funny."
"Sometimes I enjoy being alone, but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home.	That is very good, you must be very lonely."
"This was a while back, but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally, he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.	thats unfortunate but good for you that you were able to come up with a plan on your own"
"I have a beautiful girl friend. But I met someone else.	oh no, are you going to meet someone else?"
"I'm trying to figure out how to kick her out of my place.	You will have to be patient. Have you had issues with her before?"
"I just watched the ring movie for the first time.	Did you like it? I am not a ring fan."
"I can't even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days.	Do you know what's wrong)"
"Once I took a sip of iced tea while I was driving and it went down the wrong pipe. I had to pull over so I could try to breathe again.	thats awful! hopefully it did not ruin your day."
"Yeah it is. I thought I was about to die lol	I am glad to hear you are alright"
"My cashier gave me extra change back and I didn't say anything.	Cashiers are always nice people"
"Because I had also stolen some candy and wanted to get out as soon as possible.	I understand that. I hope you didn't get in trouble."
"A man came to my door with a gun, asking for money.	Oh my. Did you help him?"
"I did not know him. He took some items from the house as I didn't have any money on me	May I ask what the items were?"
"I like finding little resources or tips that change old habits I've been coping with in what seems like ""1 easy step""	I'll get on that. The internet is amazing these days, I recommend it to everyone."
"Exactly, I started taping my mouth closed at night, finally woke up before noon, mission accomplished	I'm sorry you had to go through that!"
"I started taping my mouth closed before bed, and now I'm no longer tired when I wake up, feels like I am born again	That sounds like a good habit to have."
"Yeah, it	Is it a little expensive than just taking a taxi?"
"I use band aid tape cuz it's okay on the skin	Sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time. Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.	It can be a rough life sometimes. How do you think it went?"
"It was, but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived, there was a festival with games, performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!	That sounds so fun, it's been a while since I've had the time for something like that."
"I was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud, and I had a hard time focusing	The loud noises probably hurt your feelings."
"No, I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible	The best way is to just be and let other people let you be. i'm sure they love and care about you the most about it."
"I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!	I really hate when that happens and I bet it will happen again. I had a similar experience at a couple places I was going to. Did you make a beeline for the bank you wanted to go to?"
"That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card, and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!	That has happened to me before. They had a teller's mistake and actually put my card in the wrong envelope!"
"I went to a bar I used to go to in college, and I was surprised to see an arcade machine I built with a dear friend of mine!	Oh sweet! What a unique and fun addition to your friendship! What a good friend you have, this machine is truly special."
"Yes, playing the machine we built together reminded me of all the good times we used to have.	oh thats sweet"
"I hadn't been to the dentist in five years but made an appointment recently because of a toothache	I am sorry to hear that. Do you have gum or is it not in your mouth?"
"I just started to feel a sharp pain in one of my teeth. It might be a cavity or something worse	ugh, I think I have had that happen before, have you? I hope it's nothing too serious!"
"I can't believe I am telling you this, but I actually camped out to buy tickets for the new star wars movie.	I'm no stranger to camping. What actor were you going to see?"
"I'm glad you don't think so. The kicker is, when I got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!	That makes sense. It was a one way ticket to heaven! How lucky you must be to have that guy at the front of the line!"
"My girlfriend and I were going to a big parade with some friends. As we were leaving, she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.	Oh no, she didn't trip on you?"
"Unfortunately, it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead, I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.	That's very kind of you, netflix is the best drug of all time. You brave soul."
"My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking, but ultimately underwhelming thing	I hope it was worth the surprise."
"I guess because furry things don't really scare me, I was like well that was a waste of a reaction	ah yea i can see that"
"I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift	How much can you lift?"
"No not really, just seeing how much energy I could summon from within	Yeah, that must've been terrifying."
"There's too many things to think about	I know, it seems like all the busywork and worrying gets to you!"
"Yeah, what am I getting myself into	investigations and innocence day etc"
"I just finally won some money playing scratch lotto tickets.	That's amazing! Did you pick your favorite numero uno?"
"Close to $20,000, I think I'm going to spend it on traveling.	oh cool. then you should"
"I went to a play recently that was unconventional in a really fun way. It actually took place at a pool.	That's interesting! What was the play about? I heard it can be scary when people swim into a pool."
"It was an adaptation of ""The Last Unicorn"". It had parts that took place in the water, and parts that took place on a giant trapeze!	That sounds so fun! My daughter and I will watch it all together in the future."
"I got a new puppy. She's really cute and playful	That sounds wonderful! What kind of puppy did you get?"
"I named her Layla.	Nice! What kind of dog is she?"
"I recently went to a Steely Dan concert with my lady.	awww that is nice. how did you enjoy it?"
"Yeah, it was awesome reminiscing about those times when we used to get in trouble back in the day... times were so much simpler then.	I used to think of that all the time when I was a kid."
"I just got a new puppy, names fido.	What kind of puppy did you get?"
"It is a german shepherd. It takes a lot of work caring for it, definitely needs a lot of attention	Aww, that's sweet. I love German Shepherds! They are the best."
"On my way to work, a goose stole the toupee I needed to impress the new secretary, Christy.	Wow, did you get the tiara back"
"No! I am so furious with that goose, that I could wring his neck! I can't get any ladiez with this chrome dome of mine.	There's only one king, and he's a fat old goose"
"I was doing the dishes and a huge roach crawled out from underneath the dishwasher.	Oh gross! Did you clean it up?"
"I almost fell over trying to crush it, i forgot I wasn't wearing shoes and stepped on in with my bare feet.	Gee, that's lucky. I guess I'm supposed to crush it now, huh?"
"I was walking down the street at night, I felt like I was surrounded by something unseen.	That's scary! What were you feeling?"
"Every time I turned around to try and catch something there was nothng there. Just the feeling of something watching me....	That is terrible. I hate it when people don't study!"
"I had a job interview that I didn't really feel prepared for.	Oh, that is a tough one to be honest. What happened?"
"I did not get it unfortunately.	I'm sorry. I'd say you deserved it if you asked for it."
"One time, I smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car.	oh wow that is weird, what was it smell like?"
"Well, when I went to lift the engine cover, I noticed a dead, rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.	Oh goodness, I wonder how it got in"
"I went to the store, just trying to get some milk and bread, and I got rear ended by a driver.	Oh no! That is so scary! Did you get hurt?"
"Yeah, it was more of a shock than anything, was not expecting someone to hit you when you are just crossing the street.	I'm glad you're okay and safe. Sounds like you surprised someone by coming to the light."
"I have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech.	Oh wow, I bet it will be a great success. Do you have all the written material ready?"
"I can only dream. No it's more on par with Lord of the RIng's final battle.	I didn't think about that at all. I guess it's like Fable Legends...I always end up playing the ending lucky rabbit lol"
"Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.	liners = dun dun"
"Yeah, I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.	Yikes, did you get bailed out eventually?"
"I thought I bombed my math test but I got a 103 on it.	math is tough"
"I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.	I wish I had studied sooner! Sometimes it feels like you know the answers but that's no fun. Maybe you can do it later this semester or next semester."
"I just found a photo book of me and my family growing up.	Oh that sounds lovely! I bet that brings back a lot of memories."
"It was pretty nostalgic , how young we all looked growing up.	cornrows are pretty classy."
"I finally got to see a baseball game live this last week.	I haven't been to a baseball game in a long time, have you?"
"It was the Rockies, no home-run though, it was pretty high up there I felt like I could see the world.	I'm actually a big fan of the Rockies myself."
"When my buddy asked me to help him clean out his grandmother's house who had recently passed, I was not prepared for what we found.	What did you find?"
"You hit it right on the money. She was not only a hoarder but a cat lady, and the mix of paper, bugs and cat feces was an affront to the senses.	She's been through a lot. I'm sure she'll come around."
"I let my dad borrow my car and he got in a minor accident.	Was he suspended? Did the insurance cover the damage to your car?"
"Yeah he is fine and my car was not damaged. My insurance premium is probably going to go up though.	That's good. I'm glad your son is okay."
"He said he would cover the extra costs so I'm not too upset	When I bought my new car, I couldn't believe how smooth the ride was.	That's great, I always wanted a smooth ride vehicle"
"It's a Chevrolet Camaro.	Oh, does he have any showrooms?"
"I studied for 7 months to take the GRE exam, it was stressful.	I'm sure you did well."
"I did, and I was accepted to my number 1 program, which meant that I was going to be paid to learn!	That's awesome. You must have a great teacher to encourage your continued study."
"I have a feeling the really hard work might just be beginning, but I feel exceptionally lucky.	I studied all night for my final exams. I needed to pass them to graduate from college.	Oh, yeah. Did you do well?"
"I did. I was able to sneak in a few hours here and there.	It is ok. Most people are just worried about their job and not about the people around them."
"I left my wallet in a movie theater, and didn't notice till I was half way home!	That sucks. I wonder how you will remember that?"
"I was able to get back in and find it, it was pretty well hidden in between the seats. No harm no foul.	I never leave my house unguarded even when I'm out for a walk!"
"Some people are just so generous. Really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there.	Yes, I sometimes feel like there is still some soul in the world."
"That's incredible if true, but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast!	That is amazing, I have never given anyone a ticket to a concert"
"I was so proud of my daughter over the weekend.	What did she do to make you proud?"
"She performed her first solo dance in competition, but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.	That is awesome! I wonder how long she will be in those for before she decides to break out in a show."
"It was, very much so, I will cherish it forever.	I'm grateful for the work hours, but bummed that I can't get time off.	There's always next time! One day you'll smash through the barrier, buddy."
"Well, I've worked without a break for the last 3 years, I just want to get away abit.	That's certainly doable. Cancel your ticket and fly out separately!"
"Right! I'd like to go lay on a beach, or even just the next town over at this point.	I have been extremely diligent in my studies so far, and am participating in two clubs this upcoming year. The future is looking bright!	That's great! What are the clubs you're participating in?"
"I am an electrical engineering student, and I am interested in quite a few things at this point. I think after this year, I will be able to get a paid internship next summer!	Ah, so you will be working under an adviser this time. That's good news. I am sure you will do well!"
"I am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump.	That sounds very frustrating. Where do you haul it?"
"The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents, so the dump has a line every day.	oh no, i would be upset, is your city municipality?"
"We have, and we called a city meeting. I'm just beyond words,it has to be corrected.	's all too common these days. |||| NEW CONVERSATION ||| I recently went to a dinner where we were served something unconventional to say the least.	What was this?"
"I should have known better, as these friends are on the ""crunchier side"". They had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!	Wow that's scary! I hope they threw in the towel now or will try again."
"I lost my appetite completely! I will be sure to get takeout before hand if we ever go to another one of their dinners.	my mom is supposed to call me regarding her test results.	what do you think is going to happen?"
"She had stage 3 cancer, but she was clear last screening a year ago.	I'm so sorry to hear that. It's awful to lose someone like that, and I hope they're doing well now."
"Thank you, I have a good feeling about it.	I went to a wedding recently, and something happened that put a damper on it. I felt bad for my buddy, but at least he knows he can trust me.	Aw, man. That's sweet. It's funny how the wedding can ruin anyone's day. Maybe take your time and think it over before commenting. Sometimes it's better to be vulnerable in those situations, in case the moment doesn't work out."
"Yeah, his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up, and let him know what had happened.	Hey, don't take it out on him. It's his wife who passed out the money!"
"I am highly upset that I'm the only one concerned with earning money for our bills	It's tough. A lot of people are still growing up. I grew up in a small town and had my parents help me when I was starting out. I can relate."
"Not much. It's all on me. It sucks	Well you must have a strong willed ability to stay calm under pressure!"
"I love playing old school video games. The music is amazing	Me too, I love to play Mario Kart! What game did you play?"
"For me it's happy emotions	That's a good way to look at it. It's nice to get emotional, sometimes it's necessary."
"The micro brewery explosion in America has been awesome for my girlfriend and I, as we love craft beer. Until recently, our town didn't have one though.	What state do you live in?"
"We actually don't brew our own, and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!	That sounds wonderful, I'll try to get to one."
"I hate it when other guys look at my girl	i know that feeling, its theest comedy ever"
"She's for my eyes only. At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!	I would probably do the same. I don't give anyone a reason not to pay me."
"Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read ""Kitchen Confidential"", or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year.	I'm glad you're not alone there. I had a similar experience years ago when I was working in a bistro. What did you do in the kitchen?"
"He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food, and we all still look up to him.	It's so great that you remember people like that! They tend to be overlooked sometimes."
"My husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing.	That was very thoughtful. Did you feel nervous at all?"
"Yes, it was a lot of fun and it caught me off guard. It meant a lot that they did it for me.	That's great. It's nice to know that people are still out there for those that are close to us."
"I gave twin fawns in our yard some fresh peaches and they loved them.	Nice! Are they grown up now?"
"I enjoy helping the wildlife in our area. It is alway a good feeling to give a helping hand.	I love giving back to the community. Some of the best things we do is give food to the hungry and medicines to the sick. It is a great feeling to be a part of the community."
"In a week my wife will finally be back from being out of the country for 2 months!	where is she going?"
"She was taking a language course in Germany for her graduate studies.	awww that's so frustrating, how did she manage to get work experience in go1"
"I'm moving into another apartment and just told my neighbor I was leaving. He said he was sorry I'm going!	Did you need to go first?"
"About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.	I bet you're very thankful to him!"
"Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!	Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday, so I had to work overtime, but I didn't even get paid for it!	OH! I would have been so annoyed!"
"I'm technically salaried, so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating.	I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Try to negotiate if you can."
"I went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it	Oh no, did you find any kids aged 13 or 14?"
"Sadly, no.  There's no actual proof of who it was, but we've seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place.  He did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once, so I'll take that as a victory.	Yeah, sounds like he's a good kid."
"My husband went to a job fair and got a lot of job offers!	Amazing! What kind of job?"
"He is currently Active Duty Army, but is wanting to go into transportation/logistics.	Sounds like a lot of different things than just camping. You may get him a job as long as you're faithful."
"It's been a great day so far! The sun is out and I'm on my second cup of coffee!	Yes! I love coffee! What type?"
"Yes I am, about to make some soup for lunch. This day has been just what I needed!	That's good getting some soup in with you. What's been going on in your life?"
"When I applied for the job I have now it took them like a month to get back to me with a final answer.  It was pretty stressful.	That does sound stressful. I would have told them before you even started work."
"Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end, but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.	Yeah, at least you got some cool prizes at least."
"A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.	That's great! But how on earth did they afford it all?"
"I know - I wish I could do that. They've been to France, Italy, Croatia and Chile so far - I'm sitting in NC!	I can too - I want to travel the world but with my kids in the car!"
"I would just like to be able to drive to Raleigh without hurting! I fell and broke my hip a while back and can't walk properly.	Will you be able to drive to Raleigh?"
"One more operation and I should be good. In the meantime, I have to live vicariously through Joe and Helen :)	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, she gets back in a week.  I can't wait!	That's exciting! I hope she has a good time"
"I really did.  It'll be great to have her back :)	Aww! You're lucky to have a friend like that."
"When I interviewed for the job I have now, they didn't give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview.	They just kept saying never mind the interview, they want to know whether or not you got them a job."
"It worked out ok, but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.	That's a great attitude. How far along did they get before giving up?"
"My wife has been out of the country for the last 2 months for school.	Did you love her there?"
"I do.  She's getting back soon, but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.	I would hate to spend even more time with them. I wish you all the best."
"When I interviewed for my current job, I felt like it went well but all I could do was wait.	i know the feeling, i have felt that before too"
"A lab technician at a university.	Oh wow, impressive! A lab is so cool, you are going to love it"
"My parents brought my brother a brand new iPhone. He always gets the newest stuff and I get stuck with nothing.	Well maybe you can keep the old one so you can gift your brother something nice!"
"I have no idea. He's the ""golden child."" It's super unfair.	Well if he is that good a kid, there's no way he's not passing the golden door by!"
"My wife has been out of the country for two months, which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can't help the other.	that must be hard, especially because you used to be able to talk to her?"
"She gets back in a week, so it's almost over.	You'll enjoy spending time with her again."
"my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! I hate insects. they are so nasty	Was it a big wasp?"
"heck yes i did! I locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work	I would also lock the rest of the family and pets in too! Hopefully he will give it to you in time"
"i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season	i do too, they eat through everything"
"yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them	Did you go out in general? I haven't really been out in years."
"Both me and my girlfriend are super scared of spiders, but she made me kill a huge one yesterday.	Oh wow! I'm glad she was kind enough to lend you a friend. I'm sure you will both be ok!"
"Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!	No, I don't think so. I think it's more a feeling of peace and contentment. They seem like they're always worried, but I think it's more to do with your kids."
"I'm going skydiving for the first time with some friends!	That sounds so exciting! By the way, what kind of skydive?"
"A little bit, but I love doing extreme stuff like this.	yes, i fingerpicked a bunch from my childhood, i hope you will enjoy it as much as i do"
"The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night!	that is not good! maybe next time huh?"
"It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs!	bugs indeed"
"On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.	Oh, no. I was just talking about that on the phone with my friend, he's one of the best guys you could ever meet."
"Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.	Just be strong and do it! You'll be great when you're older!"
"You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still, I fret about it. I should just get on with it!	I'm about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack	Did you have fun?"
"she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her	I'm glad you have an easy going girlfriend who makes you feel at ease."
"Cell phones are great, but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable.	I agree. I don't have a cell phone but I understand."
"Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline, and it was not an appropriate topic!	were you able to block the video?"
"Of course they did, some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where. I was humiliated,lol.	My dog died today :(	I'm so sorry to hear that, it's always tough to lose a pet."
"Yes, she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.	Aww, that's terrible. I'm so sorry. I can only imagine the emotional stress that must be like for her."
"my daughter went on vacation with her friends and the house feels so lonely	I think you got a little emotional there. I understand how you feel."
"they went to the beach for 1 week	I love the beach! I'm glad they took a day trip."
"I'm moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can't wait! No more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!	That will be nice"
"Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?	Whats it like? Sounds like a nightmare."
"Eww. Yes, it is loud. Who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? That's nuts!	My wife has been out of the country for two months, and is coming back in a week!	How cool! two months away from us would make or break the relationship in a blink of an eye! I bet you're proud of her!"
"It sure is.  It's just been me and the dogs all summer, I've gotten super bored :P	I hope you can still stay busy while the dogs are gone!"
"I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!	I'm sure it is! I'm so excited!"
"I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom. I am so grossed out by all the bugs here!	That is so scary! I hate bugs too. What do you do about them?"
"Spiders could bite me, which could really hurt!	i feel that with my training lately im going to win my next week soccer game	That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish you all the success in life!"
"for this specific game for about 3 months	That's really impressive, I might need to look you up later."
"After my wife and I moved I went through a while of unemployment.  It was really tough not being able to support us.	I am sorry to hear that, you must have worked really hard to get here"
"It's gotten better now, but it could still get even better.  Just got to keep on moving.	-eric"
"i am really happy for next year i have a trip planned to go to india	I have never been to India. I am sure you will have a lot of fun."
"yeah i have been planning this trip for over 2 years	Wow, that's quick! Where are you going?"
"I had the most wonderful week recently. My neighbors weren't here and I could do whatever I wanted without them stomping on my head!	Wow! What did you do?"
"It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.	Did you end up having to have them fixed?"
"That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!	I can imagine there must be a lot of fear and anxiety that goes along with that."
"Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.	That sounds like a good idea. Especially if you don't mind having them at work during the day."
"I went to work with my pants inside out, and I didn't notice until my secretary pointed it out.	oh man that sounds abit degrading!"
"It was very embarrassing! At least I didn't go the whole day like that.	Oh, I dare say that. I've gone the whole day without eating once! lol"
"The airport was completely empty the other day.	Closed indefinitely? That sounds troubling."
"Home, but I thought LA would be crowded even at 4am, it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy.	Just make sure you don't go crazy if you don't want to see any ghosts!"
"Made getting my connection super easy, and trust me I was in a hurry to get there. Odd how being alone can make you paranoid.	i cant wait to see my dog back home it has been 2 years since i see him	What happened to him? Did he move away?"

"Thank you.	This morning, my dog knocked down a while box of cereal and it spilled everywhere.	Oh no! Did you have to clean it up?"
"Yes, and to make it worse, when I tried to clean it, she tried to eat, so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.	well, i hope you can get it all away from her, and make it not an issue in the long run!"
"No, she only ate a little bit. I cleaned it up pretty quickly.	There was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it	That sounds great! Did you go?"
"I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive, small, and bland!	I don't even know what to say about that. Did you sue?"
"In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.	it must have been embarrassing, how did you handle it?"
"If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.	Well yousound like a good person then"
"I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol. I'm all for earnest discussion, but not at work!	My husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber. He was able to carry so much at once!	Ton it seems like? I certainly have not used that much."
"He is! I was so shocked but super attracted to him too!	I'm happy for you. You deserve the big present."
"i was really sad when my dog died last year	That is heartbreaking, I am sorry for your loss."
"yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about	It's really no problem I guess. At least now you know the drill you wouldn't go back to them again maybe"
"A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer, but he got a job and had to cancel.	Oh no! Did he ever get a refund?"
"Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.	yeah that would have been so cool and fun"
"I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.	My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday, we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe, have fun, and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call, we found out that she had a heart attack and died.	I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that can be to go through that."
"Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.	Yes, it can be upsetting and difficult to share a painful experience with someone, but it's even more painful when that person will never hear or understand. I'm so glad you have good memories of her!"
"Thank you.	My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her.	That is so sad. Did you take her to safety?"
"I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad	yep i am glad someone came and got her"
"I love to play golf, but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again.	im sorry to hear that. is it a long distance relationship?"
"It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!	That's great! Standing always creams the best so itchy skin. I bet that psoriasis will pass pretty fast!"
"Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.	Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!	I'd like to do it one day, but I'd probably stay in a cockpit jet."
"I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.	That's awesome! Is it mandatory to do that?"
"I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.	I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!	That sounds great! What kind is it?"
"I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies.	Oh that's a lot to watch! What movies are you enjoying the most?"
"I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies.	I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face!	oh no what did you do?"
"I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled!	Oh no! I bet that was so scary. Are you ok?"
"I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything	Don't be afraid to talk about your strengths, your weaknesses, and how you'll overcome them. I guarantee you'll come across as confident and prepared."
"a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job, they pay really good money	Sounds like you're on the right path. What will you be doing?"
"I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.	That'sawhatchee! What kind of memories did it bring up?"
"I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.	Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully it's just a phase."
"I actually sent her a message through facebook.	oh thats cool"
"I guess that's a good word for it.	I came home from work today and my wife had a new puppy waiting for me.	Wow that must have been a surprise."
"Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day.	That's awesome! I hope he has a good life."
"It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back.	I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled.	Oh no! Ebay is notorious for its insanely high prices, so I am sure you were able to find a similar one on other sites. What was your plan when you decided to return the dress?"
"I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.	That's a smart move. You can get a great deal on another item of clothing in the stores."
"I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.	I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!	that is a no no! i dont like chocolate too weak"
"It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.	What a bums. You shouldn't ever take anyone for granted."
"It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!	my son is sick, he got this hand foot and mouth desease, nothing serious but he has a fever	I am so sorry to hear that. I hope he gets better!"
"i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow	Oh, that might help out!"
"i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions	That sounds like a winning team. Was it a winning dance team?"
"honestly, no, it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again	Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about 8 years now. Maybe if I just hit rock bottom for a while, I could meet some new friends."
"I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.	i love golf too! why are you so psyched about it?"
"I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!	I do love watching soccer, but it is pretty lagutous in the adult world at this point"
"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	Oh no! My daughter would call any parent a name. That's very unfortunate. How did you react?"
"Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.	Yeah, I didn't know bear cubies are bad. Mama bears sometimes are."
"Yes, they did.	I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!	complete with a snood! What did you do with them?"
"I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden!	Oh no! Well, my advice would be not to mess with wild birds!"
"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	Yes, I know, it is sad"
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	Oh no. I hate bullies, especially the type that call you names."
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	Oh no. What was it?"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	Yeah, that's crazy. Well, I'm glad you're not afraid anymore!"
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	Right, you should definitely lend it back to him. But be careful, he might not be up to par!"
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	thats good of you"
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	Oh wow, what did you do?"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	That's got to make you so happy. That's amazing."
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	It's definitely creepy. Have you ever used it?"
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	That is scary! There has to be something illegal about something that big"
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	Sometimes you just have to remind yourself that they are people too, not a perfect machine."
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	wow i would accost them about that everywhere if i were you. thats strange."
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	Yeah it is. I had to get a new dog last year. It was his favorite."
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	Oh, I'm glad everything came back normal! Hope your kid will be okay!"
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	I am so sorry to hear that. I am sure he is alright now, I hope!"
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	Did you take them on vacation?"
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	Wow, you must have vomited a few times."
"I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.	They usually have the money to fix it so you should be happy about that!"
"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	what kind of kit did you buy?"
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	Oh my, I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you will make it though!"
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	ok"
"Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.	You've done wonderful, you must feel really proud of yourself."
"Criminal and social justice.	I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.	I've never been on a coasters. That sounds fun! Who's coasters have you gone with?"
"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	Probably, but I'm sure there was something worse that could have happened...being on a plane half your age makes you apprehensive"
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	Denver and snowboard! Never been there though, is it in Colorado?"
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	Can you go camping or something?"
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	Yes, I lost my cat a few years ago. I really regret it but also really glad I got another pet."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	It's a difficult thing to go through. I wish you all the best with your new dog!"
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	how many days do you think you will fail??"
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	I had the same experience when I was younger."
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	Oh No!! But now she is 14 and totally gobsmacked she doesn't know any different."
"She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade	Oh, wow, that's exciting. I would be as well."
"I finally had a day of, but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.	I bet you were stressed. The weather in NH is terrible. It is so bad."
"I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.	I can understand that"
"I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious	Was it at the movies? I've never seen it."
"Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.	Oh no! I am glad you are okay. I hate those trains!"
"I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes	Have you found one that works for you?"
"a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is	Oh yeah I've had my policy cut back recently. It's very expensive."
"I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!	Oh gross. I guess you could say that's a feat!"
"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	you'll know when its time to get stricter and more watch out for it"
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	Oh no. What happened?"
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	Being stressed makes things really hard to deal with. Being stressed is not a good thing."
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	That sounds terrible! What happened to your dog?"
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	That's so true! My dog is dog mostly, but he can be an avid hunter sometimes."
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	Oh no that's terrible! Did you try to contact him?"
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	That is rough. I texted her over and over, ever since we started school."
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	If people were nicer to you, you wouldn't have been getting coffee. What kind of drink was it?"
"I will, you never know when someone else is in need!	I will bet you're a very nice person to do that for!"
"It is, I have been so blessed in my life!	My husband started college this week!	Ooh, that's exciting! I'm sure you are anxious to experience that for yourself."
"Yes, he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!	That is awesome. I am glad you are able to support him like you did."
"I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.	That's sad! I bet you will find another place soon though"
"No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.	It's funny, but I DIke I've heard that many things can happen when you eat rabbit fur."
"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	i know the feeling, it is the worst when you are on the edge of your seat and have to push through it"
"I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards	Don't sweat it, everyone burns themselves at least once! I'm sure it's no big deal!"
"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	Did you get sick?"
"I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.	That does sound terrifying!"
"I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.	My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!	Oh no! I love dogs, is she in trouble?"
"People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying!	That is so annoying! I hate when that happens"
"I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.	Oh wow, how fun! What kind of pizza was it?"
"I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.	won't you be doing a lot of work?"
"When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!	that is nice. what did you spend it on?"
"Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.	That really is good news. You must feel really relieved."
"Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!	that sounds amazing, it's great when it works out well, i hope you are always happy"
"I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous.	That's wonderful! I hope you do well"
"It really is, you are molding their future!	I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce	Sorry to hear that. I always loved dogs"
"No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.	Yeah that is true, kids always annoy everyone and tear things up."
"Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.	Oh wow, I would hate having to get a new card."
"They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	That's no good. Do you have any luck getting them to pay in?"
"It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.	My sister got a promotion at work last week!	That's amazing! Where does she work?"
"She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)	Well she would be well compensated if she is an accountant then. Good to hear she sees you appreciate her."
"My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.	Wow. At least you should be proud of her."
"Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.	That makes sense. That's what started the whole incident."
"My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!	That's wonderful. I think when they are young they don't understand the importance of school."
"I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.	Oh. I can only imagine. My parents are the oldest of the three sisters, and they sound like they're having a hard time being there for their brother. I wish you the best, and support going forward!"
"Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?	yeah I agree. grow up fast!"
"Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!	What's your favorite skill he's learned so far?"
"I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.	I would be like that too. I am still pretty overwhelmed by new releases."
"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	Ah, yes. I remember being up early and it being a lot of fun. I havent had that in forever"
"I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.	Oh no, I am sorry to hear that, I know what you are going through!"
"I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.	That is terrible, you must have taken a lot of practice tests."
"Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.	I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made!	He must be very productive."
"Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.	That's a smart move on your part. I'm glad she doesn't need your help with anything."
"Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!	Yeah, filters are one of those things that you can get for free if you have an auto parts store have a look!"
"Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.	I am sorry! I wish I can fix it fast!"
"4	That's how many cups of coffee I had this morning! Did you have coffee too?"
"Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.	Oh I didn't know that. I was going to ask the bearded dragon expert if that was true. Thank god it wasn't too old for them haha."
"My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.	I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday	Thats a good sign! did you have a well deserved vacation?"
"Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic	You seem like a quite nice person. I might be inclined to try and get a job working there because of that."
"I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am	That's great, how long were you asleep in?"
"Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life!	That's the greatest feeling in the world!"
"I had such a bad cold last week, I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.	That's no good! Did you get better after?"
"No, thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still, I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.	Yeah, that drink really weakms up me. I feel you!"
"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	How in the world did she give you permission to do that? You're lucky to have a friend like that!"
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	Lactose is one of those minerals that when you don't understand, it can be really bad for your health. I see a lot of people who are really ill from not getting it right the first time. I'm sure you are more than thankful that she didn't mistake it for anything and that you got to spend time with her."
"She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.	That's crazy!"
"Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!	I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.	Do you think she will be a good mom? Maybe you can talk to her about that."
"I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.	Good luck, I'm sure you will get through it!"
"I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome	That's pretty funny! Have you done that a lot?"
"I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing	I'm glad you managed to subdue it! It'll be glad to hear it didn't take too much of your anger to subdue."
"I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!	Just be yourself and you will do fine. Just take your time and don't beat yourself up when you don't do well."
"That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.	I am sure you will get it. With that GPA you can do it."
"I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.	I imagine that was a hurtful thing to have to do and realize was out there."
"Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?	Well, yes and no. It is hard to get through that emotion. But you have to let it go. Are you still friends?"
"Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.	Yes, they should still be driven like professionals."
"I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!	I could have hurt myself worse, did you hurt your car?"
"I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.	Absolutely! I'm sorry you have to deal with that."
"Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.	If he is that young you better sit him down and teach him well!"
"2	I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!	No no! You should get your camera and get some stills!"
"Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.	I'm so sorry! I hope it doesn't happen again."
"I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.	You are so talented your sister must be very proud."
"Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.	That is pretty impressive. I would think that at her young age, she would already be drawing amazing art."
"I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise.	ala we found a common ground when we were in our 20's and it was supernect with each other"
"I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.	I'm so happy for you! You will have a great life with her!"
"I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.	cancer is very bad, unfortunately. mine is pretty normal, not cancer."
"It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.	I would be so worried and stressed about this, i doubt you will ever be able to beat stage one. I'm so sorry."
"Thank you so much for being supportive. :)	I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.	Oh that's pretty spooky. Whatled scared you?"
"Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.	Wow, that stinks. I bet you were a mess!"
"Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.	I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.	I am so sorry to hear that. I know how hard that can be!"
"Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.	Oh I've heard that before, I am glad that it's working out for him!"
"Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.	I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	that doesnt even begin to describe what is going through your head"
"I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.	It's tough! I hope you decide soon!"
"Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly	I used to play Madden when I was a kid."
"Super smash bros is a classic, never gets old, but yeah you're right	I have wanted to play that since I was a kid."
"I had a job interview recently	Good luck. Was it for a stable paying job?"
"Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.	you're resilient ya will make it"
"Speaking of co-workers, one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes, and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.	Oh, man! That's awesome! Type 2 diabetes is a horrible disease. I know exactly how you feel because I've had to deal with it myself."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.	It's okay, you were supposed to be going to college and now you can live the dream."
"I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me	Thats about average for me. I never want to go alone"
"Jurassic World. It was okay.	That sounds like fun!"
"I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.	Oh, did he mean to? That would have been rude."
"Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge.	Pretty decent as long as he doesn't eat it."
"I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones	I dont watch youtube I go online sometimes."
"I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms	Oh. to be specific. What's wrong about the midterms?"
"I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom, but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain	Oh wow I bet you were ashamed of yourself!"
"Yeah, nobody said anything	Well, I would like to think that it is just the nerves of the battle."
"My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!	No! that's horrible. How did they do it?"
"Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!	I would ask her to forgive you, but she may feel bad for a time. But you can ask to marry you both."
"Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.	I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.	Right. I'm sorry you're having a tough time. Is he a good friend?"
"I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.	Well that's thoughtful of you. It's nice to know family can still put up with things like that. It's a great tradition to have."
"Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.	I am sure he did great. Was it a difficult class?"
"No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(	I'm glad you've got something to work with it."
"He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.	So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?	Yes! I didn't know it was possible to have a dog that can speak!"
"I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.	lp, philosophy seems apatered to him"
"I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.	Ah! I see. Well, I am only human and did things that I probably shouldn't have lol"
"Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!	Thats true. I served in the military for 12 years and know the true meaning of challenge."
"Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.	I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though	that is awesome, i would have just lay there and uhh.. forgot about it?"
"Yes, I feel much better now.	That's good to hear. asthma can be a very difficult disease to deal with."
"I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.	Aww, that's sweet. Did you guys get to do anything fun together?"
"Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!	Aww, I'm sorry you don't have any more time with her."
"I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.	My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.	Did she come in while you were at work?"
"I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.	Well that's very nice of you. There is always a way to resolve disagreements, whether it's by telling the truth or by appealing to emotional ties that are not based on reason. I'm glad you took the stand!"
"Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.	That's awesome! You must be so proud of him!"
"Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.	Tropical Strawberry is one of the best drugs I have ever seen"
"I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.	That's really frustrating to hear. Have you talked to HR about it?"
"My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions, probably a bad idea.	I agree dang. I try to be respectful even when I don't agree with someone but I'm not always perfect. What were his reasons for not approving it?"
"My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you alright?"
"Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected.	It happens even if you approach it with positivity, it will come back in kind."
"I broke up with my boyfriend last week, and nothing is the same without him.	how did it happen?"
"Yeah, I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.	What are you planning to do now?"
"I just made the most delicious pie	Oh I love pies! Do you have a recipe?"
"It was apple pit,  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.	I love apple pie!"
"I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.	Nice. These days, most people just cut their hair and go back to basics!"
"I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's	I agree with that. You can't live with the people around you. You better start looking for something new."
"I just went camping and build the warmest fire.	I love camping! Did you use a fire pit?"
"Yeah, I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.	sleep is a healer."
"I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.	It's storming outside!? I'm so sorry you were feeling weatherbeaten! I'm sure it was very lonely. Was the storm severe?"
"I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.	Ouch, I wonder how it almost started will it be worth it?"
"I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai	I don't blame you. The whole place is scary, the food is terrible, the water is filthy."
"These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic	anyone be a bit political?"
"I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.	That's horrible! Did you try to call your starbucks employee?"
"Of course, I'm not worried no one would steal from me.	That's good! It's a good feeling no one has ever taken it from you!"
"I can't help feel stressed about money	I know. My situation is no better. I make minimum wage doing online ads in places like CarMax."
"Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700	What do you plan to do about it?"
"I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family	Where did she go? I'm sorry to hear that."
"lol I played xbox games	Play on what?"
"I usually don't feel the greatest because of health problems.	Do you have a hard time staying healthy?"
"Blood pressure and crohns disease, as well as, a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well, woke up happy and energized	Oh oh, I hope you feel better tomorrow! Maybe after a run or something?"
"You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions, and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.	I don't know what you mean by duck and cover. I've never owned a school desk."
"Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.	I was thinking about that. They have desks everywhere. You can buy one anywhere"
"Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?	I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.	I'm sure you will do well. Is it a marketing or sales job?"
"I'm hoping for the best, but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!	I know what you mean, I've been in the same place. I'm so sorry."
"This is going to sound really pathetic, but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!	Really? What are you so happy about?"
"Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.	That's awesome. I'm in a same-same situation now but I swear I didn't have the courage to ask for the lavatory at first, but now I'm the same! Glad you made it through unharmed!"
"Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.	My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.	That is impressive. How old is she"
"She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha	Oh, no, I've always wanted a kid. Congratulations on that!"
"I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.	Can you tell your neighbors? What's new?"
"Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!	Ugh I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Have you considered moving to another city?"
"Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.	Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.	Oh I bet. What prompted that? Might be best to just throw everything in a bag and move on."
"It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do.	That sounds amazing! It's been a lot of work but it's been amazing!"
"Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.	Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?	Yes, I miss my childhood as well. At least I have memories of it."
"It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean, I love my life right now, but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.	Yeah, there's always that nagging doubt that maybe things aren't going right, when all in all it's probably just a phase. That's hard to swallow. Maybe things will be better in the end."
"I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.	i know that feeling, time flies and all"
"As much as I can, but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.	There's a lot you can do. Is there somewhere you can go that they can't go?"
"Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently, one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me, without my saying anything!	Wow! What a nice guy. You are lucky to have a person like that."
"It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.	Oh, no! That's so nice of him! Deliveries are really nice. Do you mind him being disabled?"
"The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!	My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh, i miss her so much	You miss her too, dangit! My nintendo was always playing Mario games."
"yes but she lives in a different country, different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer	I hope she has a good life, and you have a good life."
"For me, one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.	i love reading as well"
"Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?	Music is always a nice way to unwind. Both help me feel relaxed."
"There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.	My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!	Wow! I bet you were very angry about that!"
"In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place, and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!	That does sound terrible! I felt like I needed to flee the place when I was younger!"
"Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day, but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.	Moving back to your parents place was once a fun activity for all of us. It was a time to go away and make new memories. Unfortunately, we have moved so many times it becomes a chore. I hope you can make new memories at least."
"Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.	What is it about where you live, that can make you so hard on your feet?"
"i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need	Sounds like you have a good partner. It's a lot easier said than done, but it's something you want to do. How old is he?"
"he is a french puddle and i love him very much	awww. mewtwo is such a great movie. i loved the first one too."
"One time as a surprise for my birthday, my college friends ""kidnapped me""	Wow, that's a very strange thing to happen. Why did they do that to you?"
"Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).	That is pretty funny! You are lucky you are not deaf!"
"Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.	i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street, i get really angry and sad at the same time	They are just like us - our community living conditions not meeting basic survival needs. Too many people on the street takes away from the overall good will we all have for one another."
"yes i go to my local charity every weekend	That's very nice of you. I usually end up joining the charity as well."
"I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.	Wow! How!"
"I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much.	thats awesome! i hope you have fun"
"I'll try not to. I'll probably just save it :)	haha. good luck!"
"I was really lonely and depressed at one point, and I had a dinner date with a potato I put googly eyes on.	oh no thats a sad thing"
"Much better, thanks :)  Yeah, I was really just doing anything to feel a connection.	I can feel your pain I used to play football like crazy."
"I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!	Oh no! I am sorry that happened. Did you have them on the rug when it happened?"
"I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him	it ok, it was an accident"
"I was confident that I was going to win that prize	Yeah, but did you?"
"It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok	That's not too bad. I wish I won one of those things."
"We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap	I love sausages. What kind of sausage did you try?"
"It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was	That's a shame. I always have trouble with the new credit card designs."
"it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother	A lot of my friends have done and I totally understand. That's why I went when I did."
"yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital	I can imagine, that must be very hard."
"I'm going to my home country next tuesday and i'm so excited i can't sleep!! It's been 4 years since i've seen my parents	That's awesome! It's always nice to visit a new country. Have you been often?"
"Kazakhstan. I miss it and i miss my parents and friends so much	oh boy"
"not bruno but borat lol such a stupid movie. I honestly can't stand that actor and his toilet humor	I am super proud of my parents for graduating college	That is great! Not too many people get to go that far."
"Yeah, they are truly an inspiration that anyone can go to college no matter the age	I went to Colgate University for a degree in Social Work."
"I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods	That sounds like a lot of fun! The weather should be perfect."
"aren't you afraid of the wild animals that will be roaming the area?	I came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag, gotten a sandwich I had forgotten I brought home from lunch, and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it.	i hate when that happens, how did the sandwich land in there?"
"He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.	Wow! That must have made you angry!"
"I am impressed in my sisters camping skills. They are very good	i bet you are, i was wondering if you could buy a campervan and let me know how i could help you"
"We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents	That's nice. What kind of campsite did you join?"
"I am confident that I will win the gaming tournament in Chicago	Cool cool, what game will you be playing?"
"Shooting game	What is your favorite game to play?"
"When I go up with my skydiving students I feel proud when they do well	Yeah, that's a good thing. You always feel like you accomplished something when you look back at your day."
"I have been instructing for 12 years but skydiving for 25	oh wow! that is a long time, glad you are enjoying it"
"You shoudl definitely try it!	Well, recently at physical therapy I walked the length of the treatment room with the help of a cane. I'm feeling quite good about that!	That's great! Did you have trouble with the steps?"
"Considering I've been using a walker for the past two years, yes it is. Thanks!	That is too bad, but it is good to know walkers are very useful and have saved many lives."
"Every day I practice - I'll be back on the golf course in no time, lol.	I am so upset that a public road in front of my house closed because of a limestone mine.	That's terrible. How long ago did you buy the land?"
"It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.	That sounds very scary, but I am sure the person can't really blame you for being scared."
"I just have to wait for the city to fix the collapsed road and reopen the road again.	I am hopeful that I will win my ebay bid	How much would you like to get for your ebay bid?"
"I am bidding on a rare comic book	Oh wow! What is it about?"
"I was walking home one time and a really big dog came charging out from a house at me barking really loudly.	was it fast charging?"
"Thankfully not really, it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it, but it was really frightening until it was retrieved.	oh no, well I'm glad it wasn't really, you should try to find it again!"
"it is incredible to see how technology has advanced these past days	Yeah, it's pretty cool to watch people change the world with technology."
"well the phones are basically a 1990's computer	I agree, only way I've found to get them to work is to have a really good relationship with my phone."
"I ate an entire cake last night	Oh wow! What was it made of?"
"It was! I just couldn't stop! It was so good that I just had to keep eating	I'm glad you enjoyed it. I know it wasn't the most beautiful dish, but I bet you deserved a second helping."
"I am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it	That's a good thing. Why?"
"Ehh, its not the best but it's not bad either\	Its a little slow sometimes but sometimes with those new apps you can miss some calls"
"I was afraid when I saw that horror film in the theater	Was it The Shining?"
"It was the First Purge	Was it your favorite movie?"
"Wandering around my little area of the world I am quite pleased with the variety of stores and restaurants here. I didn't expect it.	I'm so envious of you! Do you like traveling?"
"Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well, I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.	I'll bet that is a plus for having to drive so far!"
"I find it hard to believe, myself! This is the rural south, yet there are fine dining restaurants, the aforementioned store, really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff.	i hate when i do dishes and touch food that was on the plate1! so gross. makes me wanna throw up	That's pretty gross. I'd definitely get a spray bottle of dish cleaner. Or a can of dish washers."
"because the food is all soggy and mushy. i don't know, such a yucky feeling	Yeah, that can happen to the best of us. Maybe the fridge was dirty, too?"
"i really hate when my kids leave their dirty clothes on the floor	I feel the same way! I assume they never bathe?"
"yeah they even have a bin specially for that	thats really cool"
"i hate people that cut lane in traffic without signaling it	Me too, that's why I don't drive while under the influence."
"yeah it really makes me mad to see that people dont care about these types of things	I agree. I get furious everytime a homeless person or person in the remotest parts of the world is care of a large corporation like McDonalds."
"I found a rabbit that had been shot by someone in my yard	oh no, that's a terrible thing"
"Thank goodness it was dead, poor thing is not suffering, but some people can be so cruel.	I know, I've been in that boat myself."
"We had been holding off trying a new restaurant in town.	Was it a little expensive?"
"It's a little pricey and I'm worried I won't like the food and waste all that money. It has good reviews though	Yeah it seems worth it to save so much money. dont worry!"
"Our local organic store now stocks Indian food made by a local Indian lady - heaven, heaven, heaven!	That sounds wonderful. I love food from home. What is your favorite Indian food?"
"About once a week. Her husband works in the store, so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!	That sounds great! I wish I had a food memory like that!"
"Well, my uncle's Indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook, and she taught me. But I'm disabled right now so can't cook much. This is such a find!	I have been working on  my jump shot all month.	You must be feeling pretty confident."
"I hope so I have a big horse tournament against my buddies I want to win the 100 bucks prize.	I wish you have fun!"
"One of my neighbors (next building and two floors up) plays talk radio every morning Very Loudly.	I've heard a lot of that. It sounds like a scary movie."
"Not until about 8am, but it's so loud I can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed. Idiot man!	I can imagine how frustrating that must have been. I'm glad you're ok."
"Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!	it would be really annoying if someone did that to you"
"I've called management twice about it and both times he quietened down - for about two days. Then up it goes again!	Oh wow. I would think they would at least try to make it right! I guess they don't have anyone above them. Haha"
"Nothing in life is certain, the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.	I agree. Life is never as you planned, but you still need to take control of the situation."
"I have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas.	will you be able to catch it on tv?"
"The show is in three months, I hope she sings he late 90s hits.	I hope so too! Too bad the late 90s hits were phased out."
"Our Property Management team just emailed me to say I've got the apartment I wanted!	Awesome! I'm so happy for you, congrats!"
"It really was - I can't wait to move in! It's a smaller apartment, but quieter (I hope!).	That will be nice. I'm sure you will have fun."
"You'll get there. It really is nice to have your own space. Do you live at home?	Oh ok. Maybe i should move to a new home."
"Good for you! Start saving your money now - believe me, you'll need it!	I was on the patio and a giant roach crawled out from underneath.	Oh, that is terrifying! I would have died!"
"It was almost as bug as a golf ball I felt like throwing up.	I would feel the same way, golf is one of my favorite past time"
"I have quite a long drive ahead of me next month. It's about 1/12 hours, but I've don it before so I'll be fine.	Sounds like fun! Hope you have fun!"
"I put music on and open the window. Otherwise I'll disappear into my own little world, and that's not a good thing to do when you're driving!	Sounds like a scary movie, but I bet it's really good in the end"
"It really helps to pass the time, not to mention it can calm you down. And the drive's quite easy and very pretty, which help.	I was so amped yesterday. I got to pick up my now computer for the store!	That is amazing! I cannot wait to have a new computer!"
"It was just a new model HP that I bought but I'm so excited!	They always seem to have better computers so you won't be disappointed anytime soon!"
"I get my groceries delivered to my home and am so grateful for the service.	I haven't had a delivery like that in a while, I hope you don't have to pay anything money."
"It helps me a lot as I'm disabled and it can be quite difficult. Anyway, I hate grocery shopping!	That's about the only thing it does for you!"
"Ugh. And don't even get me started on ""mini-shoppers"" racing round the aisles screeching! Much better to have someone else buy for me!	I just watched the notebook, pretty depressing movie.	yeah me too sad"
"It's a romantic love story. Doesn't end so well for the main character.	Ah. You don't like the main character?"
"my little boy learned how to  count to ten eeven know he is super young	how old is he? counting to ten sounds pretty old"
"yeah i was so proud of him as well i thought i would have to wait months till he got to that point	Yeah, it's crazy the amount of times i've needed to call in sick to do something in the past, only to get an A because he didn't have the patience."
"I just went to the park today.	Did you have a picnic?"
"I was going to hang out, but I ended up tripping and smashing my toe up into a rock.	Oh no! How is the toe now?"
"my little brother dumped a glass of water on me this morning to wake me up	Oh wow! I bet you were a little surprised! Did you react to it?"
"yeah i was furious we are in some sort of a prank war	I would be too. I don't like prank wars."
"Last night there was a really strange animal screaming outside my window in the middle of the night	Yikes! I've never seen that before. What was it?"
"Turned out to be a skunk! It sounded so strange!	Oh no! Did you get rid of it?"
"When I was in college I travelled all over Europe one semester.	That's awesome! Did you get a lot of travel involved? Did you get lost a lot?"
"I love all over Italy, but I also loved Germany and France and Spain.	Oh, those countries are beautiful! I visited them over a few years ago. I do like Spain though."
"Yes it was truly an amazing time meeting people from so many different cultures	We went on vacation and the kids stayed home. I couldn't believe it when I walked in the door and the house was totally clean.	wow that's great! I love kids but I think thats the sign of a strong family"
"Wonders never cease to amaze me. First time for everything I guess, lol	Yeah, I guess such a big life event is a ""wow"" for someone."
"I totally thought the same thing. Too funny (but you might be right)	It really is a random element."
"I went ziplining the other day	Nice! Did you enjoy it?"
"I found it using the Internet.  It was a lot of hiking but they had a lot of long lines.	Oh yes, the alpine pools are beautiful! I'm so jealous."
"Yes I did - I had a great time and met some fun people.	I smashed my finger in the door last night	Oh no! How did that happen?"
"I iced it up but I was so mad because it was my fault for slamming the door	Oh gosh, that's a shame. In fairness it's not like you didn't mean to or something. It's still just a car. A car hits you pretty hard."
"We might have to put our dog down soon.	im sorry to hear that.. i know what that is like, i lost my sweet seas name to cancer a few years ago, :("
"Yes, she's getting older and she's just getting to that point she can't move around good.	i know but it will pass soon"
"i am really lucky that my cancer got cured many years ago	That is great. Is there any reason you haven't been able to get it checked out yet?"
"i did it with chemo and it took a lot of time and effort	I'm so sorry. I hope you get well"
"I am so ready to move.	Moving in a new area can definitely be fun. Do you have a new job?"
"California. I'm ready for my kids to try out some new schools and be happier :)	i bet that will be great! i hear it makes a big impression"
"i cannot stand seeing people throw trash on the streets	I agree. That is a huge issue and I think the media won't talk about it."
"i know right i feel like doing that every time but i dont want to get arrested hahaha let karma get them,	Right, I'm sure they'll be over soon enough like yesterday."
"I am by myself most of the time in a isolated area. I only have animals as my friends.,5|5|4_5|5|5,	Is there anything out there for you?"
"Sometimes it makes me sad, but than I think how happy my animal friends makes me feel.	Thats sad, but nice to know an animal makes you so happy."
"I bought 100 packs of magic cards and didn't get a single good card.	That's terrible. You must have played a long time."
"Collectible cards. My friend bought only a few packs and got incredible cards.	That's cool! Collectibles are a lot of fun to look at!"
"I feel really bad that we have to board our dog when we go on vacation next week.	thats a bummer why did they not allow you to board"
"We are going to a place at the beach that doesn't allow pets with some friends. Our vet also has a kennel there to board dogs so I guess that's what we'll do. She'll be so sad though.	That's too bad. Maybe you can bring a pet bowl and blanket?"
"I actually recently applied for a few jobs myself, Crossing my fingers for something better than my current one.	That's awesome, I hope you get it?"
"Current job doesn't pay enough, I'm waiting for the stars to align and something better to come along.	It is always good when luck will fall in place."
"I just bought some tickets to win the price at the state fair.	How much are those?"
"I know its not likely but I really want to win the new mustang	Mustangs are pretty nice! What brand are you getting?"
"I am so scared to live in my neighborhood. There is people that come around shooting their guns.	People need to move and stop bringing guns here."
"I have been thinking about moving but I have lived here for over 30 years. The area has changed so much.	But what about the animals?"
"My fear is that I wont find a safer place. Not much money to find a good neighborhood to move into.	I went out to the country to gaze at some stars.	Oh, that sounds lovely. I love nature. What were some of the stars you looked at?"
"I was overwhelmed by the enormity of the universe.	That must have made you feel like you had lost your mind."
"My kids birthday was last weekend, my whole family showed up! they didn't even tell me they were coming	Oh you must have been so happy! Did you get a good time with them"
"Yea, i do. hah. They live a few states away, which is why it was so unexpected. don't see them often.	I hope you get to talk to them and keep in touch!"
"Bought two pairs of shoes recently.	How are they looking?"
"Yeezy's, the worst part is the second pair of shoes were both right footed.	That is no good at all. Did you try to buy a new pair?"
"I read the instructions to set up my fit bit 100 times.	uh oh! I don't know what you are talking about. where did you find this out?"
"I need it to work perfectly I need to get ready for a marathon and I need it to track my progress.	Sounds like a lot of stuff. I'm ready for you to start :)"
"I have a big speech to give.	You should be ready"
"Well I don't really know many of the people I will be in front of, so hopefully I don't stutter or something.	hopefully you will be fine, its happened to before"
"I left my purse at in the seat in starbucks.	oh man must've been really hungry."
"I was in a safe neighborhood so i wasn't worried.	That's good. You must have been very careful."
"I was able to say the entire alphabet backwards.	That is really cool. I actually took the SAT Advances last year and did the B and C alphabet. So cool if you ask me."
"no time, I have a great memory, It was on a dare I nailed it perfectly.	Well, you nailed it! Well played!"
"I have been looking at pictures of crazy car crashes.	That is very interesting. I am afraid to look at that kind of pictures"
"Seriously now I can't drive anywhere. I can't even leave the house for fear of car crashes.	Oh man! I'm so sorry to hear that. If I was in your position, I would try to work out and take care of your pets, just in case!"
"I was at the mall yesterday. I sat down for a few minutes and when I looked away someone stole my shopping bags.	oh that's so awful! were they able to get your shopping back"
"No. I didn't notice right away. How could someone do that. Im so so mad!	I'm sorry, did they just not leave anything for it to detect?"
"I was in a hospital and a guy game in with some really bad burns.	That's so sad. Is he okay though?"
"No idea, but I had never seen something like that in person. It looked painful.	Oh yes I can imagine it to be. I'm glad you're ok, it could have been a lot worse."
"I saw a guy deadlift 700lbs at the gym the other day. I was in awe.	That's incredible, I wonder if he ate protein?"
"Yeah it is, it seemed like he had every plate in the gym on the bar. I've never seen someone lift that much in person before.	It must have been impressive, I can only imagine the work they had to put in to accomplish such a huge physique."
"I got to go to a cat cafe when no one else was around!	such a great concept, what did you see?"
"It was! I was the only one around so all the cats came to spend time with me	Magnificent! You are such a lucky guy."
"I walked out to my car theo ther day and felt something hit my face.	Oh my! That is so scary! What did you do?"
"A GIANT SPIDER! It was terrible and I was so startled!	Wow, that would have scared me for sure. I am glad you are okay though."
"When I can home, my cat was laying on the pile of laundry that I had pulled out of the dryer before work. Now it's covered in hair.	That is so funny! I don't blame you, that pile of laundry must have smelled amazing!"
"Well it's pretty inconvenient, that's for sure. Nothing I can really do about it now. Just got to keep the door closed I guess.	That is indeed it I suppose. I doubt it would help much in the long run anyway."
"Today when I went into my roommate's office to fix the internet, I noticed the collar of his old cat that passed away. I miss her.	aww that is so sad. Did you cry?"
"Yeah, she wasn't my favorite cat, but I still miss her. Cancer sucks.	Cats are so much fun. My cats are over 70 and still going strong."
"Sometimes an old song runs through my head and I remember the times where I used to listen to songs so many times that I memorized the words	How old were you when you started to listen to songs so often?"
"Like old kind of emo songs, full of angst and whatnot	Those emo songs are always so enjoyable to listen to. I bet you really enjoyed them as a kid!"
"The other night when I was taking my dog out to go to the bathroom really late. I heard some rustling in the bushes and panicked.	Were you able to find out what it was?"
"Oh she was ready to fight whatever it was, but she was on a leash thankfully. No, I'm just really easily started, all that anxiety over an armadillo. Im so ashamed lol.	Oh, I'm sorry! I assume you pet owner is responsible for the animal care?"
"I found an injured bird in my yard today, it was only a baby to!	I am so sorry to hear that. How did you get it back?"
"Yes, I had to call my local wildlife rescue center to come get it. I hope its okay, they said they think it has a broken wing.	That would suck. I hope it heals well."
"I have a friend coming over soon and I keep checking out the window to see if theyre here yet.	You should definitely go and check it out, you never know what could be waiting for you there."
"I am making dinner for the both of us. I have a roast in the oven. It smells so good I can't wait until it is ready.	Sounds delicious. What for?"
"My boss finally noticed my hard work and gave me a pay raise!	That's awesome! I wish I had a boss like that!"
"No not at all! I'm excited because now I can plan a family vacation for this winter.	That's great! I hope you enjoy it!"
"I have a deadline at work coming up.	Come prepared with a solid plan for success."
"It is top-secret. But every time I try and get serious work done, my co-workers won't leave me alone.	That's gotta be pretty infuriating. Have you tried talking to your co-workers about it?"
"My roommate has been gone all week. I don't have anything to do without him here.	That must be annoying."
"It's just not the same doing something by myself. I don't have anyone to go do stuff with.	Have you ever talked to a therapist about it?"
"We just adopted a dog from the shelter last week and I think she is sick with parvo.	Oh my, is she going to be ok?"
"It's a deadly dog illness, basically a virus that often leads to death. We think she caught it at the shelter.	Oh no. I bet she felt bad about breathing fire that bad."
"Yes, they have to do a fecal sample and test it. We take her in tomorrow to see.	So sorry to hear that. I hope everything works out for good."
"Thank you!	We are planning on going on a cruise in December!	That sounds wonderful! Where are you going?"
"No, I went on one in highschool but first one with my husband and daughter. It's has been so fun planning it together!	Oh yeah! Highschool ended and became a stripper pole. Highschool was so fun!"
"I came home today and my roommate was cooking dinner, all i had to do was fix my plate. It was so nice.	That is so nice. I love fixing my plates too. What a good roommate that you have!"
"I sure did, and the food was delicious. I'll have to surprise him with dinner next time.	Sure, What will you do when you get home after this surprise visit?"
"What kind of pizza place is it?	We are suppose to be having a bad storm this weekend.	Oh no, I hate bad storms. Do you mean rain?"
"Yes, makes you wonder if its global warming. I have been stocking up on food and supplies. Ready for the worst.	global warming i hope it doesnt happen anymore, it was a good thing that you had some food"
"My husband just got called back into work, was not expecting that!	Oh that's bad. I hope he's okay."
"Someone stole some gear, so they called everyone back to investiage. We had just sat down to eat dinner to!	What were you doing after you finished eating?"
"He is in the military so technically he can be called in 24/7 and is payed on salary!	I just prepared an amazing plate of mac and cheese.	Mmm, I love cheese. What is your favorite kind of cheese?"
"It is so good if you add the right amount of pepper.	I have never tried it, but I've heard it's good."
"I just bought a brand new necklace and shirt.	Oh that sounds thoughtful. What are you going for?"
"Not sure I just though it looked cool. Hopefully it gets me noticed.	Look for his name in drafts!"
"My dog keeps having accidents in the house! I'm getting fustrated.	That sounds fustrating. Are you working to get him fixed?"
"Thank you, I will. I think she is doing it to mark her territory, it started when we brought a new dog home.	Our dog got along great with other dogs, so we thought our cat would too. What happened next?"
"When I was promoted to Team Leader at work, I really felt like all my hard work had paid off, to some extent, and I gave myself a little pat on the back.	Happiness comes easily to me, that's for sure! What were you able to accomplish during the promotion?"
"Yes, and it can be difficult at times to move up at places, especially when there are many other long timers there!	I think you should try to keep a low profile and just be the face you want to be, even if that means you get yelled at!"
"I can't wait to go to the water park this weekend.	Whoop Whoop! That sounds like fun!"
"Yes, my kids love it so they are going to be so happy when we get there.	Mine started back in November and so far he is loving it. He rides bikes all the time and football watches too. I had to teach him to skateboard because he would get in trouble for it."
"I'm just laying in bed with a scented candle burning in my room and my cat on my lap, things couldn't be any better.	What a beautiful moment! What cat do you have?"
"Yeah my kitty is just purring away, we're having a good time watching youtube.	Cat videos are the best. They give you unconditional love."
"My mom sent my daughter a toy I played with when I was a child!	You must have been so excited about it! You must be so happy about it."
"Yes, it was neat to see her play with it. It'll make some great photos, since I have one of me playing with it at her age.	That's great, it'll make the memories that much sweeter."
"Six months ago my boyfriend proposed to me and we are getting married next month. I can't wait	That's wonderful! Congrats! It's not often you get a proposal like that."
"On a honeymoon, lol? Not right away. He is totally the man of my dreams. I'm so lucky	That's just the best. How long have you had him?"
"My husband might loose his job, I'm not sure what we will do if he does.	Well that's awful! What are you going to do if he does?"
"The company is downsizing and cutting a lot of departments. His hasn't been cut yet but there are rumors!	That's bad news. What division is he in?"
"I found out my childhood cat passed away	Oh no! I'm so sorry! I love cats, Panda was a special cat"
"I do too, it was so sad.	Yeah, and I'm sorry you had to go through that. Maybe, with some therapy, you can find it in you to try and move forward."
"My daughter is such a talented and creative young artist. When she was nominated to be 'Most Artistic' at school, I felt very secure she would win, because she really is amazing!	I did not know she was so talented. I am proud of her."
"She did! I know I'm the parent so can be biased, but it's really so impressive how well she draws, paints, shades....	That sounds so cool!"
"I was very ready for my first car crash	oh my sorry to hear that... what happened"
"I had all the paperwork set and ready, I had a blanket cause it was in the winter.	I'm so sorry you had to go that far."
"Last night a fly got into the bedroom and wouldn't stop trying to land on my face	That is so gross!"
"It was terrible! Right as I was about to fall asleep the dang thing would land on my nose!	That sounds horrible"
"I left my dog alone in the house when I went to get the mail. While I was gone she got in the cat box and ate the cat poop, super gross.	oh no! i've all been cat alone so my family has been going through a messy situation where my dogs have used my belongings like a pea to eat the cat poop and it's been hilarious watching!"
"There was nothing to clean.... she definitely swallowed it. I stuck her outside cause I can't even think about dealing with her licking anything right now. Gives me the hebbie jibbes thinking about it.	Well, I'm sure it was easily divisible in your mind. I'm sure you treated her like a kitten right from the get go."
"I have been practicing my speech for days now.	do you feel like you are prepared?"
"I have the perfect delivery and all the talking points drilled down. I will be impressive	No one can prepare you for the presentation! It is so nerve racking!"
"My cat puked up a hairball this morning and I had to clean it up.	Aw, that's quite a mess! Did you clean it up quickly or did it run off?"
"She pukes up hairballs every now and then I have some salmon flavored jelly i can feed her, but it happens so infrequently I forget to.	Hahaha, she is a porcelain child. Try the hairballs again, she may enjoy it more."
"When I left the bathroom in high school once I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe.	That is pretty embarrassing, but I bet it's wonderful that you left that much."
"Yeah it sure was, you know how mean teenagers can be. It's like they have no empathy or think about what if it was them.	I had a similar situation where a teenager struck my son with a car. I blamed myself and made him stop."
"I got a new type of pizza I wanted to try	indeed, its excellent and i bet you requested it - moi!"
"A normal pepperoni but it was terrible!	uh oh...did someone else just eat it?"
"When I was in Costa Rica I was having a lot of trouble with the address of my AirBnB, I was so lost.	Oh no! Did you find them yet? They must be having difficulties dealing with that."
"It was because my Spanish was a bit lacking, it also didn't help that people kept giving me bad directions. I eventually stumbled on it but for a while I was worried I would never make it there.	I am glad you made it there. All the bad directions probably made it even worse@"
"I was caught off guard when the gun fired for a race I was in	haha i guess you were like wow that is really cool"
"Yeah, I forgot to take my sweat pants off, that's when I realized running isn't for me	Sounds like a good idea, where do you go to run?"
"I slept with a new girl last week	oh wow.. nice.. did she like you doing it or did you just want to do it?"
"Not really	I guess thats a good thing?"
"Not really. We were very high. We were drunk. But now I feel bad for my partner	I was eating dinner with my husband last night and I was so happy	Oh what happened?"
"I whole heatedly agree! It was just so freeing and peaceful	I could just imagine being in that place, never having to worry about money or where to go."
"Someone came to my door with a gun the other day.	Oh my god! What did you do about it?"
"I called the police after he robbed me.	did they catch him?"
"No, thankfully, I'm fine but scared.	I left my food on the coffee table and my dog ate it.	oh no! did he lick it off?"
"No, she is fine. I had to find something else to eat though.	I hope the radishes and onions are good too!"
"I was trying to study for a test one night and my brother was listening to loud music	why was he doing that? can you talk to him about it?"
"I would have totally flipped the circuit breaker if I knew how, but I just asked him to turn it down	what if he said yes? thats still an option!"
"My dog tried to eat her poo	Oh no. Did you put a bag on him?"
"It probably will.	Are you anxious about it?"
"I borrowed a book from the library the other day but I left it outside	oh that's too bad.. you can try again the next time"
"Yes it did, unfortunately	That's the truth. I wish I could go back to that day."
"I got something nice the other day, chocolates from my husband	I love chocolates."
"It was, and he does that type of thing a lot.	I'm glad he's changed."
"I have problems with the city and their constant tax increase on my property.	have you complained to them?"
"Maybe A move out of my state would be the answer and a blessing to the high taxes.	There is no shame in that. You would like to work there."
"I always do the same, it's not had when they are perfect.	We all have our faults. We all need to work to get the things we want."
"My girlfriend, How about you? do you have a partner?	Yeah I do but she won't let me borrow any money, is there a reason she's refusing?"
"Wow. Looks like you are doing a good job.	I close on my new house Monday, I didn't think I was going to be able to purchase it but I believed in my mortgage adviser	That's great. Have you found anything out about bids so far?"
"Surprisingly it's been a painless process. I'm very thankful.	Well you did a great thing by getting them out of the house!"
"I gave my friend some money that she said she would pay back but she hasn't yet.	Have you tried to bribe her?"
"I really thought  I could count on her, but now I haven't even heard a word from her. Lesson learned I guess.	Lesson learned, hope you continue to have good memories of her in the future!"
"I actually did this, i'm terrible.	I'm so sorry! I've been there lol"
"I stole my mother's card details to pay for a subscription.	You are a good person, you should feel guilty."
"We are going to Six Flags this weekend and my kids want me to ride the roller coaster with them.	That sounds really exciting! I love thrill rides!"
"I'm really hesitant to get on. It's been a long time since I've ridden one and I don't think I'm going to like it at all	Is it too expensive for what you get?"
"When i lost my dog of 12 years i was devastated...	I can understand that! I lost my cat last year. It can't be easy!"
"It is a horrible experience and i hope that i never have to go through it again, how did yours die?	I was 22 years old and im not kidding when I say it was a horrible experience. I am really sorry you had to go through that. Do you know what caused it?"
"I think that in the past i have spent time caring about things that aren't important.	Maybe you can make time to spend time on those that are!"
"Money mostly. I just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life.	set aside for life? Thats awesome. I hope you have enough left over"
"I love thinking back to when I was growing up and the neighborhood we lived in. So many great memories.	Yeah, it's always nice to think about the good times. Makes it easier to cherish them when you're old and grey."
"It really is. All the neighbors were so close, we even spent holidays together. It was like a really huge family all living together.	That is really amazing. I am glad you had such a great experience!"
"Do you watch any YouTube at all?	I only watch DVD's"
"What type of content do you like watching?	Honestly I watch a lot of adult content, but I'm not really a viewer by choice. What is you favorite adult to watch?"
"The other night I wanted cake when I woke up in the middle of the night	i guess at that point in life, self-exploration becomes even more important"
"The worst part was that there was a cake to be eaten! SO I DID! Lmao	I can't imagine how hard that is, especially with all the blood loss."
"My husband was teaching me how to make a steak. The flame was so warm!	What type of steak do you make?"
"It was but I was so sad that I was so scared	yea but its all in the mind"
"I looked at my childhood photos the other day. I remember alled the fun I used to ahve	awww how old were you then? are you still alive and well?"
"I do to. It was much easier then for me	If you were ever worried about financial responsibility then I think you should take a look at setting up a fund as it can really help with that."
"I have to rely on my prayers and my belief in a high power to get me through not having a job and no money.	i'm sorry. that must be tough."
"I remind myself all the time that it will work out and all will be good again.	That is a very strong feeling"
"I was very sad when I found out that my neighbors houses were going to be demolished because the city ordered it..	oh no, that is awful"
"Nope. They bought them out at city valued tax prices and they have 60 days to find another place to live.	Oh wow, that's no good at all. I hope you can find a way to get rid of them fast"
"I feel off my bike the other day. it hurt.	what? what kinda thing happened?"
"A few scraps to my elbows but nothing major, i was just embarrassed.	True true, i can also be that way about my money."
"Hey, Any interest in video games?	i don't play much, if at all"
"great, I'm anticipating the release of Fallout:76 how about you?	It's coming out in august! It will be the last one before Fallout."
"Isn't it annoying when your friends earn more money then you but you work just as hard.	That's the unfairness of it all. I'm sorry you feel that way. Is it because you're bigger or because they have a higher pay grade?"
"Very true. I suppose i just get a bit jealous sometimes.	It'll get better, friends are worth the wait!"
"I exams went really well this year, How has your year gone?	Well I'm sure they feel great but maybe you could do with a break right now."
"Thanks, I am feeling a lot more confident in myself. Remember the year can only get better.	Yeah, that sounds like a wonderful thing to go through. It always feels good when someone makes you feel good. I hope it goes well!"
"Had a good day today, i think i was prepared for everything. how has your day been?	I'm always prepared for anything. What did you do?"
"Well i had a meeting with my boss who gave me a promotion today so i'm over the moon!.	That's great! I know that can be tough but it feels good when you accomplish something. I'm sure you deserved it."
"I got attacked by a swarm of bees a few months back. Needless to say it hurt.	I would have been hurt too. Did you do anything to quell the swarm?"
"It was, they we're absolutely furious with me for some reason.	I would be mad too, you should tell them you told them prior so they don't forget."
"Do you remember the old video games you used to play?	Used to be some games we had on channel 21"
"The nostalgic moments when you play them again is brilliant. You should try it.	If you own all of them you can rent or buy a new set."
"Life seems to be going perfect right now, how about you?	That's good! I'm happily married."
"Well that's even better news! i'm feeling hopeful for the both of us.	That is great! Congratulations again on the raising of family!"
"A girl i went on two dates with wanted a copy of my house key, yikes!	dang i bet that was a little embarrassing, how did she react?"
"I don't know, she said she needed a place to hang out between jobs. Stupid me actually gave it to her.	Yeah, I know how that is. I hope she knows that you have a reason to be upset over it and that you won't stand for it."
"hah, thanks. So far so good.	My girlfriend forgot to order the Chinese food yesterday...	Oh no! I love Chinese food, you have a very smart girlfriend."
"Was annoyed and disappointed so i ended up having a sandwich instead. bad times.	What did you do?"
"My dog puked all over the carpet a few weeks back.	eww that is so gross! i know how that feels!"
"Was absolutely disgusting but luckily it did come out easy.	Yes, that's the whole idea with eating pork."
"The other night I found my cat laying dead in the side of the road	Oh no, I'm so sorry. I hate to hear that."
"It's tough. I was crying so hard that I had to call my husband to come pick us up	Oh I am sorry that happened to you."
"My family dragged me along to visit an underground cave recently, I was pretty nervous.	That sounds interesting, how did it go?"
"It was nice, after i got over the fear from being 23 stories underground.	I'm sure it was, I'm a little afraid of heights, but not as scared of heights as you are."
"Hah, no i wasn't thinking of being trapped. It just seemed like more effort to breath for some reason.	Had a job interview the other day.	Do you think you did well?"
"I think it went alright, i was incredibly anxious about it.	I can understand. You must have been very nervous."
"Ate my flatmates last chocolate bar earlier.	That is a nice thing to do. What kind of bar was it?"
"Nope, i do feel a bit guilty about it but they should have hid it better.	What did you do instead?"
"I went bungie jumping with some friends but I was reluctant to jump.	Were you still a bit scared of jumping?"
"Yes, I don't like heights at all. I did eventually muster the courage to jump, however.	I am sure you are thankful you did it."
"I always try to tell my kids they need to be kind and understanding to others, no matter what.	That's a good thing to know. How old are they?"
"They try but it's hard when there are so many bullies at school. I wish other parents would try to do the same.	I don't understand why some people are so cruel."
"Do you know how much work goes into video games?	I consider video games to be my full time job."
"I was really impressed as some games it can take over 10 years.	I played FIFA 13 a laugher and it was awesome. It is a really big game and lasts for so long!"
"An old girlfriend contacted me looking for a one night stand, I had to decline.	i have been through that before"
"Hah, they can be fun. Though my partner would not have appreciated it!	Don't worry, I am sure you guys will have a great time!"
"I went to a family reunion at my grandparents' house.	Oh that sounds so sweet! I think we all went to some sort of family reunion at some point in our lives, right? My familyreunions were always so relaxing and fun, especially when my grandparents were around."
"It was enjoyable for sure, and poignant too.  It brought up lots of memories of my childhood.	aw what all do you do now?"
"I had a chance to sell my stake in ice juice for a nice little profit.	Nice! What did you do with the money?"
"No, I want to keep it because I have faith in the company doing really well longterm.	That's a good attitude. When will they close?"
"My daughter started kindergarten recently, i walked her in and met her teacher.	That was nice of the teacher to meet with you. School is hard."
"Very nice, I just cant believe how grown up my little girl is getting.	mom's do tend to have more patience than dads, i know what you mean"
"6	I lent my brother 200 dollars so he could buy cryptokitties.	What did he buy?"
"I really couldn't tell you some kind of digital cat, he says he will pay me back, so hopefully it all works out.	If you're happy with him, I wouldn't hesitate in asking for another cat!"
"Everyone wanted to go skydiving for my birthday.	Yeah! I would have, too! Who knew an hour and a half in the air would be so scary?"
"I'm pretty sure that my greatest fear is my chute not releasing and plunging through the sky into the ground. Oh well you only live once.	life is short you will surely overcome this danger"
"I didn't notice but I was walking around all day with a sock on my shirt!	sounds super gross"
"On my back! I went to work like this!	Sounds like a day that will be remembered for a long time."
"Someone decided to slash my car tires, key my car, and bash in my windshield.	Dammmnn that stinks. Did you call the police?"
"Probably a spurned former lover. Glad I had insurance.	That's good :) I don't get why people are so hateful"
"I have to give a speech at my fathers funeral. I drew the short straw.	I'm sorry. I hope you were able to sell well and made some more money."
"Not really, I just needed to make sure that It goes off without a hitch. I don't want to embarrass my Mother.	Oh I see, is she usually the one to embarrass?"
"I've been working at my same job for 12 years.	Are you tired?"
"Yes I do.  Its a fun job.	I hope you find peace with your success and find happiness in your work!"
"Yes I am a skydiving instructor so it is fun	Wow! I have never taken a class online. I will definitely look into it"
"Yes I love it	On a recent trip there was some bad weather that caused my flight to be delayed several hours. It was already late so i was afraid they would cancel the flight altogether.	Weather can be such a drag. I'm sorry you had to endure that. Do you know if she or your date will be able to reschedule?"
"Yes! Thank goodness. They didn't cancel. I just got home much later than I had hoped.	Ah well that's a good thing, at least you got out of town and stuff!"
"Absolutely. I had too much to do the next day to not show up then.	I literally ate all you could eat at a chinese buffet	Wow! how did that make you feel?"
"I had to go home and lie down for the greatest nap of my life.	Wow! What a nice dream come true for sure!"
"Recently went on a family vacation to an old spot we used to go when we were all younger. It was nice to see old stuff and talk about old times.	That sounds like a really good time. Did you guys catch up with each other?"
"Oh for sure. I'm always a sucker for nostalgia.	Anyway, you can try those old toothbrushes. I did. Nothing too bad."
"I love looking through them. I even find myself clicking back to my oldest pictures on facebook and reliving those times in my head.	One night during college I got a phone call in the middle of the night that one of my best friends had been killed in a car wreck.	Oh my, that's horrible. I'm sorry to hear that."
"Absolutely. It was really the first time I had lost someone close to me, family or friend.	It's very hard to say the least. My favorite game is Call of Duty."
"My birthday was a few days ago, I can't believe my wife had the wait staff sing to me.	Wait staff? That's awful! How'd she do that?"
"Hah, its good entertainment, but i don't exactly enjoy being in the spotlight. Thanks!	Yeah, hopefully it pays well and you're happy!"
"I recently got married and I'm so lucky to have found someone who enjoys doing the same things that I do.	That sounds so sweet and romantic."
"Thank you. It is nice. This is a second marriage for us both and I like that we are both happy with things just the way they are, no high expectations	That's wonderful. I hope you're really happy and the other person is too."
"I lost my wallet last week	That really sucks. Did you find it?"
"My friend freaked out but I was pretty sure I left it at a restaurant and I trusted in my fellow humans to turn it in	I hate when that happens. People need to be more aware when it is appropriate to do so."
"Yes it was turned in - cash and credit cards all there	I recently had the opportunity to help out at my local Second Harvest food bank.	That's pretty cool. How did it go?"
"It was great. I was with a good group of people too. We made it fun.	That's great! It's always great when you can get together with like-minded people."
"For sure. I am happy I had the opportunity. Im sure I will do it again.	I'm happily married and employed, life is in a pretty good spot right now.	That is great to hear! You are well compensated and ideally situated to have a successful life."
"For sure. I've had some unstable times in my life. I'm thankful to be where I am now.	You seem very well-adjusted and happy with where you're at. You sound like a model brother."
"Absolutely!	That's what I do, pretty much the same thing every day. Except I snack because Im distracted and start to feel guilty later."
"Yesterday my car ran out of oil and broke down. I could not believe I would let such a thing happen!	Oh no! You must have been very angry about that. I hope there was some way you could have got someone to fix it."
"The engine is totally shot, its not designed to run without any. So now I have to go shopping for a new car.	Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. I hope things look better for you!"
"The new car is more expensive than a new engine. But I can't justify such a costly repair on my car.	I see. Well maybe you'll save some money from an engine standpoint"
"It does drops a lot after a repair like that. I might as well invest that money into something new.	I was in a big party city and the street was crowded with people. As I was walking my foot got tangled up on something and I went face first into a huge flower bed.	That sounds painful! Did you trip over a flower as well?"
"It hurt my pride more than it hurt my face.	I'm sorry. Do you think it will ever heal?"
"That is true. Plus it was a big party area so Im sure a lot of them drunk anyway.	That's just cool. I bet they were happy you were there to help clean up after them."
"Literally anytime I order something online and I get the tracking I immediately start checking it. I am so impatient waiting on stuff to come.	I am sure if you played it safe and used paypal its not such a big deal"
"Yes. Every single time. I know better. But I just cant help myself but to check over and over	I know what you mean. I do the same thing"
"That is true.	My dog died of old age last year and I miss her	I'm so sorry...how old was she?"
"Yes.  She was the most wonderful dog ever	She's so lucky to have had her. I hope your day went well."
"Laugh!  Yes dogs are far better creatures than humans	I'm gonna take the family out to the lake this weekend, we might rent a boat.	that sounds like fun!"
"Maybe a pontoon boat, depends on what they have. Should be a nice way to unwind.	yeah would be fun! i like boats, mostly pirouettes"
"I have a friend with loaded parents. She doesn't work but has anything she wants anytime she wants.	That must be hard for her to be honest with you."
"Mine aren't poor but they aren't loaded. They struggle. Same for me. I work my butt of for what I have.	Meatballs aren't the only bums on your shoe!"
"Same. I do wish I had a little bit more money to do a few more things though.	Yeah, work always pays if you stay dedicated."
"I had to do a lot of learning to knock out a big project at work. Finally finished and ready for another.	That's awesome. What was the big project?"
"For sure. It was a software coding project for a client. A lot of which I did not understand at the start.	Oh. Well, I'm sure you got it all sorted out eventually."
"Thank you. But now I have it ready for the next one.	That's the beauty of technology, stuff is never as simple as you might think!"
"I have many health problems that require me to see many different speccialist	Oh, well that's not good! If you see many different people, you're probably sick too!"
"I am working towards that..I have been lucky to find some great doctors which I am able to put faith in because my life is essentially in their hands	That's great. Your life is completely dependant on them. You are trusting them with your life. That's a very powerful thing"
"I had a super stressful week and ended up cheating on my diet last night by eating pizza and cake.	Oh damn, I'm sorry to hear that. Those can be loaded words to have to say. I hope you feel better soon!"
"Yes, otherwise I had stuck to it - but my weekly weigh in was this morning and I was up two pounds. I felt so irritated!!!!	Have you lost too much weight? That's so important."
"I'm a bit nervous- I have an upcoming certification exam to take for my teaching license and it's a big deal.	It'll be alright. It's a big city like us, the weather shouldn't be an issue."
"I've been studying a WHOLE lot - so I think I'll do okay, but it's still making me feel nervous.	Just think positive thoughts! Maybe it will go well!"
"There was a group project due and we had a meeting, but i missed it because it was my 21st birthday. wasnt my best day	Ctblablablablablablablablabackabackabackabbott cobalt blue japanese sky blue american sky purple ive always wanted a sky blue japanese sky blue ive never been to japan before so my expectations were a little off"
"yeah, but i learnt from it and also had a good birthday!	better birthday gift than a heart attack lol"
"I have many health problems but I feel so lucky to have a great support system in my family	That's great! Health problems are never easy and nothing makes me feel more grateful than a great family!"
"It really is!  It is wonderful to know how much they love me!	I bet you are so happy about that!"
"I was so sad when I had to put my dog down last year	That is so sad. I had to do that too. I hope that you are in a better place now that you have lost your pet."
"She was 12.  It was old age but it was so hard because I had had her for years.	That is a very sad thing"
"I wanted to buy a new car, but I wasn't sure about buying the one I got.	Oh, how was it?"
"Yeah, it's been a good car so far, but most cars are pretty reliable at first.	The problem I see is reliability does not equal goodness. I bought a used car from a veterans yard a few years ago and it had major cosmetic issues."
"I have an amazing husband who is always there for me no matter what	That's so sweet. I'm lucky to have a husband like that."
"He was my sisters, husbands roomate in college and he came down for their wedding and we met there.  I can't imagine my life without him	You must have become fast friends with him. Its nice to have a confidant like that"
"One time I went to my friends 16th birthday party.  When I was walking in her house I ran smack into their glass door.  It was so clean that I didn't see it.	That isn't a very nice thing to do. Was she mad?"
"LOL..just my pride.  I was mortified and the funny part is that later on I won the door prize	That's cool. I wouldn't be able to win that thing."
"My husband and I are planning a big trip to Washington,DC	Oh how exciting! I am sure you will enjoy it"
"I really want to go to the Smithsonian.  I love history and can't wait till we get to go	I am sure you will have a great time there."
"I have this knife that I carry everyday. My dad gave it to me before he died.	How does it work?"
"It is, it's like he's always with me.	It is very nice. I hope he continues to grow in years to come"
"I have many health problems that have prevented me from having children	Oh, well that's too bad. Perhaps if you continue to take care of them you will be motivated to have children."
"If I can get my health under control I would definetly look into that.  I use to be very sad everytime I saw people with their children but I have finally learned to be content in my situation	Your situation is not normal. Everybody with a health problem needs a family member to be close to."
"I had a job interview that was very important to me once	Good luck. Do you feel that you are now a bit bit under-prepared for the position?"
"yes, I prepared as best I could and I really felt that I aced it!  Sure enough I ended up getting the jon	Well, congratulations! That's great! I hope you get the job!"
"I used to live out of my car and it made me feel pretty down on myself back then	I understand. Those days are gone."
"What types of situations? And yeah it could have been worse but I'm glad I'm out of it.	Yeah hypothetically maybe it could have been worse. I'm glad you're out of it, too."
"Skydiving taught me how to let go and stop trying to fix everything	I used to be a person who could not let go, I crashed a car a few years ago and had a stroke. It is an amazing feeling and I learned a lot!"
"Yeah the hardest part for me was just realizing that I wouldn't be in control, but it was very natural in the end	That is true. Convey my sentiment. You never quite understand it and it is never easy to ""let go"" of someone."
"It's like something you have to figure out with your heart, kind of like how caterpillars have to stop trying to do a bunch of work so they can become butterflies	I ended up watching all the Robin William movies I could think of last weekend.	That's awesome. Glad you enjoyed it. I've never been much for horror, so that was pretty disappointing. I guess this is why we watch tv. It gives us time to fantasize. Hope your weekend went well!"
"I don't know if there is one of my favorites, but it sure was a lot of good memories.	That's cool. It's always nice to have fond, long memories."
"I was in a rush this morning and didn't realize I had put on two different colored sox.	Oh no! How did that happen?"
"One was pink the other was green. I hope no one noticed.	Oh that's a cute color combination. I am sure they will have gotten a laugh out of it!"
"I have been working on my dance moves for the last 6 months.	Do you know the ending yet?"
"Well its for a dance off, so it's a pretty big deal I have to win this.	Well hopefully you're ready for that. I know it's rough being the underdog in a bigoted world, but I'm sure this is nothing compared to the things that can happen in real life."
"This one time my pants fell down in public, but I was really tired so I didn't realize	Oh no! How did you manage to manage to avoid being seen?"
"A couple minutes later	Was he upset about it?"
"Going in for an interview had me wondering what would happen	What happens?"
"I decided not to take the job in the end, I guess I just wanted to know I could get it	I can understand that, sometimes you have to make that choice for yourself."
"I appreciate the place where I started cuz it helps me keep going	What are the advantages of being in a place like that?"
"For sure, it reminds me that things are always getting better	That is a very good thing"
"I have been working on at the track to get my sprint times faster1	Those are good things to work on. Good to hear you're improving."
"No, just me, but my 100 yard dash is so so slow, I can't even get lower than 6 seconds.	wow does the teacher get mad at you?"
"I think I'm just really bad, maybe I will always be slow.	I think you will get it, just gotta grind though."
"Drinking a gallon of milk everyday makes me feel like an absolute madman in the gym who's gonna take over the world	It should be illegal! Too bad they don't take common sense into their milk."
"That's not the point, gotta do it RAW	I agree. You're not a wrestler. You're an animal!"
"I had this juicy pump at the gym from doing some benching and it felt too easy	What were you doing at the gym?"
"My pecs were poppin	Are you a woman?"
"I was hurrying around the house and wasn't paying attention fully, I ending up hitting my toe on my dogs toys.	I hate when that happens! Were the toys loose?"
"It really hurt, I think I may need to take all his toys away to punish him.	I hope he learns his lesson."
"I was at my main girls house and I saw these texts from this guy named Chad	Oh, wow! Are you guys still together?"
"Yeah, I demoted her to my dinner girl, now I gotta choose who my main ting is gonna be	Oh okay well that's unfortunate. At least she's more pleasant and helpful."
"I got mad because I was too full to finish my plate at the buffet	Ugh tell me about it.. i have done that a few times in the past.. do you have a heart condition?"
"Chinese, but no I decided not to, don't think would allow it	Dang, I'm sorry about that! I'm glad you didn't have to deal with that anymore though."
"I spent 20 dollars on a piece of cheese cake.	Was the cake good?"
"I thought it would blow my mind but it was dry and really disappointing. Talk about a let down.	In a bad situation it's better to swallow one's pride than to let it ruin your life."
"I have been working on my bench press for 6 months, I know I can get to bench 400 pounds.	You must be very strong to be working on that."
"Steak and Maximum effort. I also drink lots of water, I'm on the next level like Arnold.	Sounds like you deserve the job, great!"
"Paranormal activity is the sCaRiEsT movie of horror movies	Oh! I didn't know that! Paranormal activity is terrIy good! I will definitely watch it."
"Yeah you'll have to show me sometime	Well, share this amazing experience with me!"
"I just gave up smoking cigarettes. It was pretty hard, but the worst part is how everything puts you on edge and it is hard to relax.	I once gave up drinking too. Now I take Paxil"
"I closed my eyes and visualize a world where anything was possible. I called this world IMAGINATION land.	That sounds so fantasy, it's like you were living in a different world. It's so exciting to be in that place!"
"I was challenged to a dare by my best friend!	Was it to a pool?"
"No, the challenge was I had to spend the night in a cemetery. No flashlight no tents just a rolled up sleeping bag.	That's the worst. The lack of water. It's hard to get out from under that."
"I enjoy getting things done	I think so too, and i do all the talking in the world when im ready to do nothing."
"I like to crochet and pay the bills	I could never do that. I always feel like I am living in a fairy tale world."
"I was so satisfied with myself when I left the gym today	That's awesome! Are you a gym rat?"
"Indeed, it was quite thrilling, did a little chest workout, got a nice pump	Those are good goals to work towards! I hope you feel better!"
"My cat puked all over my roommates shoes. I feel so bad.	Were you able to clean them?"
"I clean them up as best I could, and told him about it. Then I profusely apologized.	at least he learned from it"
"I was really sick the other day and I let my roommate pick me up and carry me down the stairs.	Uhoh, that's no good. How did that happen?"
"I had an ovarian cyst, it hurt so bad. I almost went to the ER again.	Oh, yeah that sounds horrible. How long did it take?"
"I was going through my photos today and I saw a picture of me and my ex together. It just made me feel odd, I miss him.	Well, sometimes we become estranged from people we used to know."
"We broke up back in May, he was just too much of a workaholic.	May be time for a new start somewhere else."
"I get pretty sad some nights, but it feels good to cry sometimes	I understand. It's like you're holding back a huge emotional storm."
"Yeah, sometimes it's like a deep sadness comes out of nowhere	I know what you mean. I'm sorry for the loss, but I hope you know that it's you who should be grateful for the time you have, and not them."
"I had just been returning home, and on the side of the road there was some roadkill. It used to be a deer.	Oh no! So what did you do?"
"Yeah but my widows were down, and I could almost taste the stench of decay.	There's nothing worse than spoiling the elderly! I'm so sorry you have to deal with that!"
"Sometimes it's impossible to shove more food down my gullet	It is, but it is a difficult thing to deal with at times. I hope your daughter becomes a bit more socialised."
"Nah, I'm trying to gain some pounds, I just haven't acclimated to the quantity yet	Just sitting around and reading donuts will do some good. Keep it up!"
"I just watched JFK's speech, 'we will go to the moon' - reminds me of what I admire in the US	It is well remembered even if somewhat controversial"
"It's really moving, wonder what the next big goal will be for humanity	what big goal are we talking about"

"All of the puppies survived, truly a lucky amazing occasion!	I wish I had one of those dogs, I love kids and puppies"
"I was totally caught off guard as a kid when the entire yard was covered in Easter eggs	Easier said than done, and I know that still isn't easy."
"My dad, but he wouldn't admit it! haha	That's got to be embarrassing. I hope he's grown a bit since then."
"I was a little nervous to eat some cloves of garlic for the first time	Mustachioed psychopath."
"I wasn't sure if it was going to make me sick or not	Oh no, is it just broccoli? I've never been in my life been put in the large group that ate so much food"
"I accidentally left a book I borrowed from a friend outside	oh my! what a bummer! are you going to get it back?"
"I did but it was ruined from the rain.	I imagine so. The next place you look it might still be there! HOw'd up!"
"I forgot to take some water bottles out from under my cart and pay for them at the store. I didn't realize I didn't pay for them till later.	Oh no! Did you have to wash your hands after that?"
"Hopefully I don't get bad karma for my accidental theft!	Hopefully not, trust me. I've been in that situation before."
"I attended a ball recently, one of the girls had the most stunning dress.	Oh wow! How did that make you feel?"
"No way, her dress looked like little diamonds had been stitched on every inch of her dress. Not many girls can compete with that. Diamonds are forever.	that would be a tough one, she would probably have a hard time walking if she was having that happen"
"I had to schedule an appointment with the dentist after not visiting one in five years.	I am sorry to hear that. That is a pretty serious problem"
"I do not have insurance. I went anyway because I had a problem with one tooth.	Able to whom do you refer?"
"The internet has been there through thick and thin for me	I'm glad you don't have any competition!"
"True, it's a great resource to have	And the knowledge is in helping others and helping yourself also."
"Seeing animals sleep is very relaxing	I hear you! I love to watch them dozing off."

"My dog got hit by a car.	ugh that's too bad, I hope he's alright and you're able to replace him fast."

"I remember not having any responsibilities as a kid	this is the worst, how did you manage"

"It's kind of a bittersweet experience	I understand. Please accept my apology for your high ride"
"I had a tough semester but I just saw my grades and I'm pleased with the results.	Glad to hear that, wish I could back up."
"Yeah, it was a huge relief for me. I am so glad to be done with this semester.	What are you planning on majoring in?"
"I should not have been so quick to let my teen take the car, but she was so excited.	Sounds like a great kid, what kind of car?"
"Well, let me just say that the pole made it out alright,lol.	Well, it was still scary and awesome in a weird way."
"She is, and now my car has a very crude imitation of a red racing stripe down the side!	After a gym workout I'm always ready to get back and hit a new PR	that's the spirit!"
"I think just knowing that one day I'll be able to do things that are unimaginable right now, and I know I can do better the next time	it's the hopeful part of life that i think we should all try to keep repeating"
"My stomach made a loud noise while I was in class taking a test	oh no what did you eat to make that happen?"
"I just pretended like nothing happened, but i'm worried everyone thinks it was something other than my stomach	I'm so sorry! I have had that happen to me as well. It's so embarrassing and annoying and hurts your self confidence."

"High school was a great time, but those days are long gone	I agree. I wish I could go back to those days"
"No bills to pay, going out to eat with friends all the time, pretty fun	Sounds like a lot of fun! Sounds like a lot of fun!"
"Around 4 months ago, I had major surgery that caused me to be immobile for a few weeks.	How did you have surgery?"
"Well, I had lots of support from my family, but I felt afraid of getting back into the swing of things for fear of failing. I felt so vulnerable.	It can be a very hard adjustment, especially when you feel so confident about changing."
"I love going to the gym because I feel stronger	That's great! I wish I could go to the gym."
"Probably half a year, been the most consistent in my life, how about you?	I think it has been the best 2 years of my life so far."

"Anything political or religious really, or relationships	Except where they are illegal. That doesn't always hold true."
"I had my dog for 13 years before she passed away last year from cancer. It was devastating!	Oh god I know how that feels. I had a dog for the same reason. It sucks losing a pet."
"Probably not for a while. She was a great companion, but I don't think my heart is ready to bring in a new dog quite yet.	I am sure you will be ready in time"
"I was horribly wronged by someone I thought I could trust. The feeling was devastating, and I've always struggled with forgiveness.	How did you find out that it was the other way around?"
"They were dishonest and physically cruel. We have gone our separate ways, but I truly hope they can learn to treat others better.	I honestly hope so too, I'm sorry that happened to you."
"Last month I came home from work and noticed my cat wasn't feeling well, so I rushed her to the vet. I had to put her down.	Wow! I am sorry to hear that, my cat was like a family member to me, and I fell in love with her due to her being so little. I hope your cat feels better soon!"
"I know, I just really miss her. Poor cancer kitty. I loved her so much.	I hope you get to spend time with her again soon."
"MY roommate got a new cat last week, and we finally let them meet today. I was so nervous and worried about it.	oh well i am sure their first meeting will go smoothly"
"It went okay. My cat bopped him a little and growled a lot but no real swipes. So better than expected I guess.	Well that's a relief. Hopefully your cat doesn't get any weird infections from the dirt!"
"When I was pregnant with my first born, it was considered a high risk pregnancy. It made me very worried and anxious throughout.	Aw, I'm sorry to hear that. Pregnancy is such a difficult thing, I wish you had more experience with it"
"I had to have emergency surgery in the end, but being able to hold my healthy baby was the greatest blessing I could have asked for.	I'm so glad you're holding your baby now! Are you nervous about the surgery?"
"I'm so happy summer classes are officially over and I'll be able to relax for a week!	I know this is a hard news for you, but I am sure you will be able to save a lot of money and have amazing accrued vacation time. I wish you the best!"
"I'm not even sure what to do with all this time! I guess I should relax or have some leisure time, but everything in me says to try and be productive even on break. It's that school mentality.	yup that is awesome, i would sOTTASTY if i had to do all that while being productive"
"My sister came to visit from out of state. It was the first time we've seen her in nearly a decade!	That's wonderful! Visiting is a huge expense for both the visiter and the visiting party. Did you two have a good time together?"
"Yes she lives on the other side of the country. We had a nice dinner, but my boyfriend is a loud chewer and a sloppy eater. It was quite embarrassing!	it's obvious when he is eating, but you can tell it isn't when he is just casually talking to you haha!"
"I just bought a new dress and I can't wait to wear it this weekend.	What kind of dress was it?"
"I'm going to wear it to a party. Everyone will have their eyes on me!	Lol. That's funny. Well, assuming you're comfortable in party attire... I'd go for it!"
"A few months ago I could barely walk up a flight of stairs without having to catch my breath, but I bit the bullet and have been training.	it sounds like you are getting the most of it"
"Wonderful! It's definitely hard work, but I continue on, even on the days I don't want to. Today I discovered I can now comfortably run an uphill mile and I feel very confident!	That's fantastic! I wish I had a machine to help with that, because I don't use one. I also discovered that I can now do pushups, situps, and do the bent arms ones! Those are pretty tough ones."
"My boss told me about a potential job opportunity and I've been waiting to hear if it's going to happen	That is great you have been waiting so long. I am sure you do have a great opportunity if you take it."
"A little bit. I am mostly excited about it though	That's fair, there is no better feeling than receiving news like that!"
"I was very prepared for my final exam. It was so easy.	That's always a plus for planning well for the long campaign. Hardwork always pays off in the end"
"If I'm being honest, I made an answer key from the quizzes we took this semester. As they say, work smart, not hard.	I always say that, especially when I'm in a position of power. Anything you say could be used against you in a lawsuit!"
"My cousin was swinging recklessly on my hammock and ended up breaking it!	oh no"
"I was very upset, especially considering how long it took me to get it set up. I loved laying in my peaceful hammock to read.	I certainly would not want to do that. At least then I could relax and enjoy the scenery."
"I received a phone call the other day from a friend I hadn't heard from in ages.	Oh no, that sounds bad. What was the call about?"
"We reminisced about old times. It was very nice, indeed. It was nice hearing from him, especially during some rough times!	I am glad that you have a great friend!"
"I have a weekend of nothing but relaxation planned for this weekend.	That sounds relaxing. What are you relaxing about?"
"I have some leftover roast in the fridge so I don't even have to leave the house. I'm going to watch a lot of netflix and MAYBE do a little laundry.	I'm way too addicted to this show ""#momtomorrow"" :)"
"I keep having these dreams that I am out in public and somehow my clothes disappear. It's awful.	I can imagine it would be, that is terrible!"
"I hate those dreams, I feel anything but free. They're really uncomfortable and make me nothing but a ball of negative emotions like anxiety as I spend the majority of the dream trying to find clothes and get away from people.	Ah, I'm sure it can be something. Try to remember that all the negative emotions are good because they keep you grounded."
"One of my friends recently bought a house. I really wish I could afford a house.	Are you going to be able to afford a house?"
"I'm starting to feel like I will never be able to afford a house. They're just so expensive. And the market has been going up here about 5% a year for the past 10 years.	That is terrible. That means you will have to sell."
"I ended up staying at home for the holidays	that is good decision by you."
"No all my family lives out of state. I didn't feel like traveling, but I just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark.	I watch that show too. The one with the eating of hobbits"
"I bumped into a friend from middle school. We chatted for a while	It's always great getting to know new people from before."
"Before 9th grade. I moved away that summer. Seeing her brought back a lot of good memories	That sounds wonderful! It's always good to have those memories."
"I had a doctors appointment at 9 am and they kept me waiting for almost 2 hours.	what the heck is going on?"
"It was terrible I ended being late for work because of their horrible service.	I am sorry to hear that.I hope they at least gave you a good experience"
"The past few months have been terribly rough, but I think I can say that they have made me stronger.	For sure. What happened?"
"Thank you. I hope that I can move forward and at least learn from these hardships.	You will I am sure get through it"
"I really hate when people can't hold themselves accountable for their own actions and decisions.	I think the most important thing is that you don't make another mistake."
"Absolutely. Yet, these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you, even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.	its good that you are aware of such people"
"I received a very odd message today. It came from a person who I blocked online, but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group.	Oh no! That is not good! Are you going to punish them for it?"
"They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish, and it makes me very anxious.	thats sad"
"I'm going rock climbing with some friends!	That sounds like fun! It's always exciting to take a leap of faith and climb a mountain."
"I have done some climbing indoors for practice, but never done a big climb out doors, so who know how it will go.	Maybe you should try the trad climbing circuit and see how it goes. You never know so be very curious!"
"I keep having these really weird nightmares at night.	I don't sleep that well, I turn off my lights and try to stay inside."
"I'm usually in a big city that I'm familiar with, and roam around in the dream until I get stalked, jumped, and sometimes very hurt.	I'm always worried about my safety in those cities, it seems. Is it because of a specific person that is bothering you, or is it something else entirely? Sorry I can't help your anxiety."
"Today I was quite impressed with my endurance during my work out. A few months ago, I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath.	is that because you are wearing shorts all day or are you having difficulty holding your breath?"
"I sure have, but it's such hard work. I make sure to work out, even on the days that I don't want to. It's definitely taken a lot of will power.	I bet it is, and I am sure your mom can really help you with that."
"I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.	I'm so happy for your new born child! You must be feeling so proud!"
"It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty, but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.	That sounds pretty sad. I am glad you had your surgery and your pregnancy is on the right track."
"I just learned my first trick in ice skating, a triple spin twirl kick front flip.	thats nifty, good for you, how long have you been dancing?"
"I never thought I would have the balance to perform such a feat. I think I can no qualify for the Olympics.	What kind of feat are you talking about?"
"I just started college again, and while I'm doing great in school, it has lead me to feel very lonely with a lack of social life.	I know the feeling! I being in college myself almost made me homeless! So when I moved away, I felt homesick"
"That sound like a good idea if they weren't online classes. Next semester I have a few on campus courses, so I'm hoping I'll be able to make at least one new friend.	i wish i could do that, especially on here, its hard to new friends"
"This upcoming semester will be my first time taking 5 classes at once. I'm pretty worried that I may have taken on too much.	Oh no! Are you doing okay?"
"I'm not sure. The more I think about it, the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby, so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.	That would be pretty amazing, I wish you the best of luck!"
"I adore my girlfriend. I am getting very serious about not leaving her side.	that sounds very romantic"
"Thank you. Do you have a romantic interest?	I think yes. Do you know him?"
"Summer in the South calls for many unwanted visitors of the insect type!	Oh yeah, I could just imagine"
"Mosquitoes, and those dreadful flying ants. They're everywhere!	Oh, those pesky flying ants are the worst!"
"Lately I've felt proud of my success as a newly single mother. It gets lonely sometimes, but I can honestly say I've been doing everything I can and more.	I know that feeling. How come you're feeling that way?"
"Thank you! I definitely have a drive to feel strong for them. I hope some day they can realize my efforts.	I hope so too, it's so nice to feel for our adversaries."
"I have a plethora of amazing friends. One of mine recently drove me from Georgia to South Florida	Wow thats very fortunate for you. Sounds like you have a lot of good friends."
"It is an 8 hour drive! Florida is a very long state	Bah, that's a long drive! I can't imagine spending that much time in another state."
"I recently totaled my car. There were no injuries but I feel absolutely terrible	Wow! That's terrible, but thankfully it won't be a problem again."
"It was very wet and I took a turn at too high of a speed.	Are you ok?"
"My mom and I haven't always had the best relationship. Recently I've had to tell myself to let her in more. It's been challenging.	That has to be tough. I am sure she has real issues with yours, too."
"Thank you. I know that, even though it's challenging, I need to be patient in order to improve our relationship.	You are doing a great thing! I hope you can maintain a good relationship with her."
"I have had the toughest time getting my pet rat to get along with others. She's always been very aggressive!	My sister was also rat person. She'd always get out of the car to go play."
"She's never bitten anyone, thankfully, but she gets crazy with other rats. To my surprise though, I've recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!	I am glad you found her! I am sure she will want you to keep petting the others."
"This past month, I was able to visit Six Flags!	That is awesome, how did you enjoy it?"
"It was amazing. The last time I was at an amusement park had to have been over a decade ago!	that is awesome, its always nice to go somewhere you have had fun before"
"The other day I noticed my pet has a growth on her lower belly. I fear it may be a tumor.	A tumor? That's termas point is when they can metastasize. Have you any idea what you can do to try and halt it?"
"She's a rat, so her body is very frail. I'm sad that she likely will not make it. She's been with me through thick and thin.	Do you plan to get rid of her soon? You must feel very lonely considering the situation."
"I let the girl of my dreams slip away. Now I am alone.	oh no what now"
"I hope so. I think that time heals all wounds.	I am glad that you have time to grieve."
"I recently went to the pool and lost my suit. My trunks were in the water without me!	Oh man, that sucks. How long did that take to swim?"
"I was not, unfortunately. People saw everything!	I'm sorry it happened that way."
"I let a romantic interest slip through my fingers. She's now with somebody that I despise	Yikes! I'm sorry. Was she someone you were hoping would be better?"
"I think so. I have plenty of time and life goes	I believe in you. We all need to prepare for one thing only - landing a great job!"
"I feel great right now. I have a new album coming out and it feels liberating to be done!	That's great. It's always liberating to be done. That's a great feeling."
"I am very excited. It is almost an hour and a half long	Wow that is a long time to fly. Did you go to college?"
"I can't wait to travel. I am going to Madagascar soon!	That's amazing. I have never heard of Madagascar, so exciting!"
"I have! I actually grew up in Saudi Arabia	wow that is interesting, what is your favorite thing to do in the kingdom?"
"The world is savage. I believe that the right individuals can take us to a better place in the future	It is. The world is a very dangerous place."
"I think so too. There are some kind and great people in the world	It's always wonderful to have a supportive and loving family!"
"I went walking in the woods one night. It was pretty scary out there	That sounds pretty scary. I'm sorry you forgot about it."
"No, everything was fine, but it was a chilling experience	I am glad it was an unpleasant one for you."
"I caught my dog trying to eat my nephew's dirty diaper that my brother left on the couch	That is funny lol"
"It was really gross. I had to keep my dog from licking my face for a long time after that.	Yeah I would imagine it was. I am glad nobody got sick though."
"I recently remembered a sweet memory of my aunt who recently passed away.	Oh how sad. What was the memory for?"
"She would give hundreds of dollars of school supplies to kids in need each year.	wow, that is a great person"
"She did! I fill stockings around the holidays and go around on Christmas giving them out to people who have to work. :)	It's great that you were appreciated while at the same time being appreciated for being able to do what you loved. It's the best holidayrithmetic."
"My daughter and her family are coming this Thanksgiving. I'm already preparing for their visit.	That must of been a lot of preparation. What do you have planned?"
"Not too much, just really exciting. I'm planning everything even though it's months away, even the menu.	I believe you will have a lot of fun."
"My mother in law was recently placed in hospice and is not expected to live much longer.	That's so sad.I'm sorry for your loss."
"She's 87, so she has lived a long life, but she has Alzheimers, and it's really sad to watch her lose her mind.	Oh my God. I don't know what I would do if I were her"
"That's a great way of looking at it. I should try to keep a positive attitude towards it.	I have found over the years that just talking to others has such a positive effect and I no longer be afraid to even try. It is so hard to start but I know that it will be worth it I believe."
"I was driving home from out of town really late one night and was exhausted	That's awful, I have to say. That usually isn't an easy thing to do. So sorry that happened to you."
"I did get home safe but it was scary because the roads were two lane and lots of 18-wheelers were heading in the opposite direction. I kept thinking I would swerve into their lane and collide into them	Moderation is key, I'm glad you were able to get home!"
"I've been trying to be extra supportive towards my husband.	That's awesome of you! It's 2018, we've all been there. How long has it been?"
"Yes - so true. His mom is dying, and he is working long hours on top of it. I feel really bad for him.	I really, really do. I hope all turns out well for him."
"My friend who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit. She married a very wealthy man and I was a bit envious	People do that for a reason, did you still love her?"
"She drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world. I wish that were me some days.	Sounds like she has a very nice personality. I am the same way"
"I was at a get together recently and a friend's husband was flirting with me.	Oh man! I've had horrible situations where people are just looking and you're just like, ""What the heck?!"" I'm glad you're okay! Are you going to say something?"
"I didn't know what to say to her, and was afraid she wouldn't believe me and it would cause her to be angry at me. It's a bad situation.	Yeah we all have our bad situations. You just have to try to be nice and understanding."
"When I was in second grade, I wet my pants in the middle of class.	Oh no! We talk about that every year at the state fair. Was anyone around to reprimand you?"
"I know! I was super afraid of my teacher, and was scared to ask her to go to the bathroom.	Haha I bet your classmates were laughing to no end! Not even you could have guessed what they would do with the information at that point!"
"She was really mean and always yelling! I didn't want her to yell at me. I'm much older and wiser now!	I want to trick my butler into thinking he won the lottery. I've taped the local new's winning lottery numbers and I'm going to buy a ticket with the same numbers and give it to my butler	oh my goodness, that is so crazy! but what will happen if he doesnt believe you?"
"I'm not sure he likes being the target of pranks, but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin	Oh, definitely! Next up, we're gonna need a bomb to blow up the house of worship where your dad works."
"My friend just took her kids to Disneyland and I feel a little bad about it.	Oh no. I would be jealous of her."
"I'd been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years. I'm happy for her- just wish it could have been me.	What was the difficulty of the trip?"
"I won a trip to Washington D.C. a few years ago	That's awfully lucky, have you been to the capital before?"
"I had a blast. I met people from all over the country, visited many historical sites, and learned a lot about how government works	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I'm looking forward to my best friend's surprise birthday party next week!	I'm sure that'll be fun!"
"I'm really happy about it- she's a great friend and she's turning 40, so it's a big one!	It's a wonderful time in her life. She's on the cusp of adulthood and it feels so good to be a part of her future."
"About 20 friends, surprising her at her favorite bar after work.	My 25th high school reunion is coming up and I'm excited.	Oh how fun! do you think you can nail it?"
"Honestly? There was this girl who really treated me poorly - I can't wait for her to see how successful I have been!	Oh wow. That really sucks. People just don't compare anymore. I really hope you fight back and get a better reputation!"
"A hurricane hit my city. The first night I thought the wind was going to tear the roof off the house	Oh wow! Did you have any damage?"
"It was my third. Luckily we didn't lose power for more than a few hours	That is great. I am glad that you were able to stay in the game."
"It damaged the roof and the fence. We lost power for six days during the first hurricane I experienced	That's awful! I hope insurance is able to cover the damage."
"I am loyal to my principles, that is why I do not eat meat, because I love life	That's a very interesting reason. I think you could still do without it."
"If I already have 10 years of vegetarian	Oh, you just became a vegetarian?"
"I healthy physically and spiritually	My daughter recently broke curfew by three hours!	Oh no! Is she in school?"
"I was super angry, yes! I ended up grounding her for three weeks- one week for each hour she was late.	That is so bad. You should be able to speak to her again after that."
"I have a certification exam coming up and I think I'll do well.	That's great. What kind of certification is it?"
"I think so- I've studied quite a bit with my husband and others.	That's great to hear. I hope it works out for you guys!"
"Education- teaching license certification	Hello ... I confess that when I see my daughter's eyes, my heart suffers.	Ah, the emotional disconnection is tough to overcome. I hope you're having fun with your daughter!"
"They are sick	How so?"
"Relax, they are things that happen	My new manager gave me a pay-rise!	Nice! It's always nice when someone outside of work helps you when you need it."
"I feel very grateful that he has been so generous.	That's very good that he wants to give generously"
"My partner left me the other day.	Ouch! that stinks! im sorry! i hope you get back with him soon!"
"That's fine, its not your problem. i just feel very lonely right now.	i understand that. my girlfriend left me a couple months ago. i wish i could find something to replace her, but in the end i am just going to accept that this is happening to me. i hope your mood improves!"
"I just moved to a new city and I don't know anyone	Take a chance and meet some friends in your new city"
"Yeah, it's hard though. I hate to go out by myself. It's hard for me to meet new people	That's difficult, I'm sorry. Maybe you can go out with some friends and explore the area?"
"I took my final exams a few weeks ago and I was sure I had done well, but I failed.	i hear you. I'm sure you did great."
"I don't know what happened. I studied and passed everything else. Now I have to retake the class and I'm upset	That's terrible, can you retake the class?"
"My sister kept playing a few seconds of a song over and over again on her laptop last night. Now it's stuck in my head.	What song is it? That is so frustrating."
"It drives me bonkers when she does that	Has she ever done that before?"
"I saw these 4-color Bic pens in the store the other day. I remember when I was young and getting one was like Christmas morning!	i love the idea of having fun colors"
"Yes! My mom used to always get me one each year before school started. Those were the coolest pens in the world!	Those things are awesome! My daughter always asks how to write in pencil so it's like, ""You just learned how to write in pen today!"", so I feel you."
"I'm optimistic that my house is going to sell soon.	What's wrong with it?"
"Only a week- and 17 people have seen it already, so I'm feeling good about it selling quickly!	I am very confident about that! I think it will sell out quickly."
"My best friend was going to travel from Wisconsin to see my this summer, but she ended up not being able to come.	Oh no, were you able to suceed and see her?"
"Nothing- I still haven't seen her. I felt pretty let down - but hopefully I can make the trip to see her soon.	Ah, still nothing - try again and I'm sure you'll make it!"
"My sister threw up the other day and made a huge mess.	sorry about that, was it ok"
"Fortunately no- she cleaned it up. But she had just had spaghetti and it was floating in it. It was so gross!	yuck, i'm sorry, that's one of the most gross things i've ever tasted"
"I was livid when I went to work the other day and saw my car was broken in to	Oh no! that is so terrible!"
"I heard it was happening in other areas but didn't expect it here because we live in a nice neighborhood. So frustrating	Yes, i hate it when something like that happens. You might have to evacuate if someone is in your house!"
"Every year when the kids go back to school, it brings back so many memories of when my kids were going to school.	I bet it does. Are they gone now?"
"I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly	I miss that feeling myself. I feel like I would freeze up right away."
"So everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints, and I ate the whole thing for breakfast.	Mints are always good"
"LOL, I swear it was like I sat down and they were gone!  Probably gave myself diabetes. So not going to be able to eat the rest of the day!	Dang I had one of those. I know it can be upsetting but it is funny sometimes!"
"Sigh, I have no self control, definatley need a veggie or two today now! Probably should knix those form the pantry	My father passed away in November, it's made me feel empty ever since.	I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how that is."
"I didn't think it would hit me hard. I felt like I was prepared.	That's good you were ready. I am glad it didn't hit you!"
"I surprised my girlfriend with Chik-Fil-A breakfast this morning when she got off work.	did you do it in a nice setting?"
"She works nights, and had no idea I was coming. I knew she had a bad night so I wanted to do something nice for her.	She sounds like a good person :)"
"I recently was laid off from my job. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm trying to stay positive that I will soon.	I am so sorry to hear that! Have you applied for unemployment compensation already?"
"I keep looking and applying, but still here I sit. I know it will happen when the right one comes along though	stocks and bonds seem to be the two that seem to work the best. that must be nice."
"I lost the book that my friend let me borrow. I feel so embarrassed.	That's terrible. Did you have a chance to read it first?"
"I'm trying to find a new one, but this one was rare and hard to find.	What was the color?"
"My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.	Oh, have you tried contacting them?"
"I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.	I'm sorry to hear that. I know that can be a hard thing to swallow."
"The older I get, the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling I have. It is nice to just enjoy being alive.	i agree with you"
"Those examples are definitely the simple pleasures of life. It makes me want to go outside and listen to the birds and smell the flowers.	I get that, life is simple, right? I would love to try some of those"
"I went swimming the other day and when I jump into the water and came back up, my bathing suit top was pulled over my breast and I was wandering why everyone was staring at me.	OH no! So embarrassing! I hope you were able to clean everything up."
"Yes I did realize fairly fast why everyone was staring. I looked down and seen my breast exposed.	I'm sure it was embarrassing for everyone, but very amusing at the same time!"
"I think my cat likes my new girlfriend more than he likes me now.	Woah! I think that's a sign that the right one for you may be waiting for you on the other side. Cat like dogs, I say."
"Yea he loves to sit on my lap while i work, but prefers her side of the bed now when he sleeps.	That's sad, maybe you can work together in the future."
"My grandfather passed away not too long ago, i received a bunch of items he left for me.	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you get any good stuff?"
"Some interesting antiques, grandfather clocks, and a lot of items related to his work for the house of representatives. Interesting stuff	ooh that sounds interesting. what kind of antiques"
"I had to let my dad borrow my car the other day. His truck is in the shop.	Is he a mechanic?"
"Yeah it has. And, he took good care of my car, as always.	That's awesome! I'm glad that you have someone that you can trust like that."
"I ca not believe what happened the other night at my friends house, I'll never show my face again.	I'm sorry, that's very unfortunate. Can you come up with a reason not to believe?"
"Sure, I fell asleep on the chair and had a dream, in my dream I went to the restroom, so yeah, I peed right there in their chair.	Haha that's funny. I think I might have peed myself too."
"Yes, it was not fun, but good to know I am not the only one.	I enjoy helping the wildlife in my area where I live. I give them a helping hand. I give them water, birdseed, my left over food. The animals love watermelon and cantaloupe.	That is really sweet of you. I do the same where I live. I set up standopings where the wildlife can get clean and dry food. It is a win-win for everyone!"
"I just have the small non dangerous type of wildlife that I like to help Birds, rabbits, squirrels and such. No big bad bears!	That is wonderful. I live in a place that has some safety features too - like deep water rafting. I think you would be safe there as well."
"We got a new puppy! We took him in from our father in law.	Congratulations! We are so happy about that!"
"Its a long hair chihuahua and a short hair chihuahua. He has the most adorable under bite!	I will have to look into that, they are very cute dogs."
"I found out my wife was having an affair, the worst part is i knew the guy and welcomed him in my home and was kind to him.	Im sorry to hear that. How did she cheat and how do you feel now?"
"I'm learning to live my live without her, it's tough. Some honesty would have made the way it ended much better. Thanks for the kind words.	No problem, honesty is a beautiful thing. You're fighting for your loved one, which is understnad"
"I went on a soda fast for two days so that I could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking. I am addicted to soda so it was hard. I made it though and I was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days.	Oh wow, smoking is such a big problem in the United States. You're a real kind hearted person."
"Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.	The lack of caffeine really did hamper my sleep which really sucks. I had to get up at 4am to get ready for work."
"No, they suck!!	I recently had an argument with a friend. Even though I talked ot her about it and let her know how I felt, my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband. She thought I was being two faced, which lead to a long discussion. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.	Yea guilt is a bad thing to do. Dont be too hard on yourself for it."
"Yeah, I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter, even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..	It happens I guess. My daughter and I used to play all the time when we were little."
"That's good advice. Thanks!	I found huge box full of my old cd's recently, found a ton of old pc games i used to play, reminded me of a simpler time!	What types of games"
"I did, i played a few sessions of age of empires and i plan to play some command and conquer red alert tonight before bed, still great games.	Those are great games to have in the night time!"
"I got turned down for a job I really wanted.	I'm sorry to hear that, were you rejected because you're not a certain gender?"
"Thanks.  But yes, I was really dejected.  I thought I'd interviewed well and had a good enough resume.	well I hope you did get it"
"When my wife left me, i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest, I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic	its very similar to my story its kinda funny actually"
"Well, Like the saying goes, get busy living or get busy dying. I'm not sure if i'll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!	im sorry, i know life just goes on, but i hope you find someone soon i wish you all the best"
"I bought a 20 foot boat. I believe it will be able to handle the large lake that I will be taking it on.	That sounds like fun! What kind of boat?"
"It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions.	I would love to have a car like that! I don't know if I could afford that much either."
"It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy.	That sounds wonderful. You should take your wife to tubing if you live in a place with a lot of tubing."
"We should have a lot of fun this summer with it! Makes up for all the hard work saving up for it.	That is true! I am glad it will be worth it in the end"
"I like like loaning money to friends. It can ruin friendships and sometimes doesn't get paid back.	That is true. I wouldn't lend it to anyone"
"Yeah, I meant don't like, sorry. I recently lent some to my friend with no expectation of getting it back because of her hard situation. I actually got it back.	Well, if she is in a better place then you should at least be happy about that. It may not happen again, but at least you have that to look forward on."
"Last summer, my dog went missing. We looked for him everywhere and called all of our neighbors. No one had seen him.	I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you find him?"
"After a week of looking for him and checking the shelters, a neighbor found his body under her house. He had gotten under there and couldn't find a way out. I was so heart broken and so were my daughters.	Aww, that's so sad. I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope you guys find it in you to make sure another cat, dog, or amphibian is adopted too. It's hard to lose a cat, and it's part of the rescue business."
"I try to skateboard with my kids everyday. They love it, and it makes me feel young again.	I bet you are a great parent to your kids! You sound like you must be having a blast."
"It can be scary some times, but its worth it.	I hope your confidence returns!"
"My daughters 6th birthday was recently, unfortunately her mothers side of the family didn't show up, even though they all rsvp'd	Oh no! That's a bummer. What was the reason that happened?"
"Hah yea, she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her. They grow up fast.	Sounds like she'll have a long healing process. I hope she comes back full of strength!"
"The other week, a friend of mine told me there was an opening where he worked and to get him a resume. I took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else.	What a jerk! I don't like where his job went that quickly. Did your friend get the job back?"
"It would have been nice. Less pay, but I would have had to work less. Oh well, guess I'll try harder next time.	Yes, that's always the positive side of things. More money is always better. I don't want to lose that, especially after what I feel is wrongful pay."
"The other day I was running late. So, I jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house.	Did you come out with them?"
"I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains. I apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes.	That is really gross and embarrassing. I wonder how the shirt got so dirty?"
"I have MS, and sometimes I have bowl problems.	I'm sorry to hear that. Try and find an effective treatment plan that works for you!"
"No, I've tried science remedies. I like those kinds better.	which ones did you use?"
"My son got a remote control car for his birthday. Its really cool.	Wow a remotely controlled car is a pretty cool toy. Do you car feels sturdy?"
"No, his grandpa did. But, after he went to bed, I went outside and played with it for a while.	I did that when I was a kid. I was afraid of toys."
"Someone broke into my car the other day, but they didnt steal anything.	Oh, that's horrible! Did you report them to the police?"
"I know! I feel both violated and kind of sad because I have nothing in my car worth stealing.	Dang. There is no excuse for that."
"There was an elderly lady at my church who was blind and could not hear well so you had to talk really loud for her to hear you. She was very faithful about coming to church so our preacher picked her up and took her home for every service. When she needed help, we took turns helping her.	That's so sweet! I'm sure she loved coming to church and taking care of others!"
"When I saw that she needed help, I always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker. I liked helping her. She recently passed away and I miss her.	How long ago has she passed away?"
"Yes, she loved everyone she met. She would say she couldn't remember everyone's names, but she loved them anyway.	I took my son to kindergarten the other day. He loves it so far!	He must be a very young child! I remember the K through 5 age range."
"You bet! He made a girlfriend on the bus by talking about Zelda.	haha that is hilarious!"
"Lately, my family and I have been very blessed. We are all happy and healthy. All of our major bills have already been paid for the month, and we have been going to a three week long revival at a local church.	Wow that's nice! Do you attend the church?"
"We have just been trusting in the Lord.	Oh really? I can't imagine why you wouldn't want to trust in the Lord. I mean, if your family is good, why wouldn't you want to trust in the Lord?"
"Thank you.	I was looking at some old pictures of my kids' first day of school from 4 years ago.	Oh, that is nostalgic. How old are they now?"
"It just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes.  My youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in 7th grade.	That is great you have a bit of space with them."
"And tons of pics!  I try to take pictures of everything.	I couldn't believe Aretha Franklin passed away last week.	Oh my God! What happened?"
"Sometimes you think people will be around forever, their aura is just so...legendary.	sounds very annoying"
"I just finished eating dinner.  We had red beans and rice and with sausage.  I'm as full as a tick!	I'm so jealous I love food so much!"
"I had to soak them for 3 hours.  I think that's what makes that meal so satisfying - the wait!	I prefer eating my peas and carrots raw."
"I do the same thing!	Found out some bad news today about my kids custody case.	Oh no, any news about it?"
"Yeah, it really is. Due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father.	I'm sure with time father will get back to parenting you like it's your son."
"I think I aced my supervisor exam!	You sound well prepared! What is the supervisor exam for?"
"I should know something by tomorrow morning.  Hopefully they tell me right away.	You should feel very confident and determined!"
"I have all my kids' things ready for the first day of school tomorrow!	Wow! Are you excited?"
"I think I am.  I tried to do as much in advance as I could.	I've done that and it can backfire really badly."
"My daughter is in 8th grade and just started school a little over a week ago. She is already being bullied.	I can honestly say I was bullied as well when I was younger. I hate it when that happens."
"Yes, and will again because it didn't help. I try to cheer her up with hugs, goofy moments, and whatever else I can think of.	Those are good memories I am sure she will treasure them."
"I had a chance to cheat on my wife once,	Dang! That's cheery! How did it work out for you?"
"I did not. I left there quickly. It was not something I would ever want to do.	Oh dear. Did someone find you?"
"My dog got very sick and lay in bed for a couple weeks.  I was so concerned.	Aw, poor little thing, I hope he gets better!"
"She did get better eventually.  During that time I tried to tend to her as much as I could.	I am so sorry... the dogs are family"
"My roommate recently got a kitten, and he went out of town so I am watching over the little bugger.	You must be so proud of him!! Farm animals are creatures of the earth and very cute!"
"I love cats, I have one of my own. I haven't been around a kitten in forever so it's a real treat. I also don't have to sleep with the little brat at night either so it's especially great.	Awwwww......but you do that while also being a good parent. Your kitten will love that. Mine grows up too fast."
"I had a solo competition last week for cello. I was well prepared and knew my music well. I felt great walking into that room.	cello is so hard to play, cello is so fun"
"I have been playing the cello for 5 years.	Wow. You are one tough one."
"I slipped and feel at work the other day. Several people saw it. I wanted to just crawl in a hole and hide afterwards.	Oh no! I bet that was really embarrassing!"
"Just my pride	What happened?"
"My ex and I broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork, like 70 plus hours a week.	Wow. I really hope that you are able to work through this. I have had work out before with a personal chef and it went really well. Do you have an outside job now?"
"He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.	I'm sorry to hear that. Does he have a job now?"
"My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it, we've been getting along great since we broke up.	Oh.. thats is kinda odd. What was the reason behind the breakup?"
"The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much. He decided he didn't want to leave after all and wants to keep working 70+ hour weeks every week.	Wow, that's not a job for the average joe. camels back is pretty good."
"I came home today and the food I had put in the crock pot was ruined. The outlet must have died and the food sat in there all day not cooking.	Oh no! That's terrible! Are you going to complain to the kitchen?"
"Yeah it was pretty terrible. I had to throw out a TON of food, and to add insult to injure I had to go eat out tonight.	I'm sorry you had to endure that. It might make you sad when you think about it."
"I let my friend babysit my kid last week.	That was nice of you. I bet he did a good job."
"Awesome. I usually have a hard time letting anyone watch my child but he had a great time with her.	Awwww. Mine are the same way -- they love watching them too!"
"5	5 huh? Good job, that's my favorite number!"
"I was out walking by the lake over the weekend and there shore was just covered in dead rotting fish.	That would really scare me haha. I hate when I go that far away from home to go fishing"
"I don't know, that's what I would like to know! The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped, and they died. I imagine it was pollution.	That is terrible."
"I have a really big game coming up this weekend. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league.	Oh you must be nervous, but I'm sure you'll be good at it. There are alot of ways to make money playing video games."
"I just don't want to embarrass myself or my team. I'm so scared i'm going to make a fool of myself.	fine, go on"
"Several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches.	Oh, sorry to hear that, did it become a lot worse or just stop happening?"
"I had to get 2 stitches in one of the holes and 1 stitch and all the other holes. He was a big dog, a little over 50 pounds.	IS the other hole self explanatory?"
"Last year I made a bet with my friend and he lost, so he had to buy me a Nintendo Switch. I was so great.	That is a great friend. I like how you did your best to be concerned with your friend and your interests at all times. Even when you have to go against your friend, it is good to be concerned about your interests and your friend."
"I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet, but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.	He has to believe in himself to lose that much!"
"I am visiting my friend this week.	That's cool. Where did you meet?"
"Yes, I mean I promised her I would  and some things came up but I know I gotta stick to my word and make this happen.	Making a promise is sometimes so hard to keep, but it's so worth it in the end. Sounds like she's a great person and you really should be proud of her for sticking to her end of the deal!"
"Oh I know I can't. She had lots of plans for us.	One time when I was little and playing hide and go seek, my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us. After a while I realized that we were going to be in trouble, and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way.	That was very brave of your cousin. That sure sounds like good detective work you have been doing."
"Yeah I guess they were, they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin, even though I was 7 and it was his idea.	Oh my gosh! I could just imagine 9 year old kids kicking butt like that. Did you get mad at them?"
"So we are moving and I'm having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me. Thinking I should keep it.	Awww yeah you shouldn't let them away lightly! That's so unfair of them! Are you going to keep them or are you going to sell them?"
"Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.	Yeah that's pretty true. But at least you have her to hold on to."
"One of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of 25.	that is a great thing to hear, it must be a great feeling to have one's dreams come true!"
"Yeah I know, I'm really amazed and proud of him. To be honest as proud as I am I can't help but to be a little jealous too lol.	That is true, it's a very strong image that circulates in your head time and time again. Just remember he has done something you absolutely cannot match, you could use his talent for teaching others how to do the same thing yourself, give him all the credit for being so great at what he loves and letting him do whatever he wants with it."
"I stayed at a friends house for the weekend a while back, and when I got home my bedroom was destroyed	Oh my, that stinks. Are you repairing it?"
"My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it	Oh no that is not ok you should tell him right away."
"Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me, because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.	Aw it's okay to feel that way sometimes! Remember you only have one lover, and that's wonderful."
"I hope so, I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I just wish I had someone here with me right now.	I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you will find someone online or in person"
"My husband and I celebrated 9 years Saturday. It was such a good day of quality family time.	thats awesome! are you gonna go on a road trip in a rowre?"
"Yes I love a good day of relaxation and family time :)	Thats wonderful! Enjoy it while it lasts!"
"Yes, dinner :)	I went to the zoo last month, I haven't been since I was a kid. I went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos, however I couldn't help but feel bad for the animals the whole time.	Oh no! I could never get into zoos! They have horrible pens and you feel like you are witnessing abuse all the time. Did you feel anything negative while there?"
"The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it.	That's very disturbing, especially the ones that close on windows. I would be concerned"
"I won an essay contest and I get to go to Washington DC for free!	Washington, D.C. Isn't there, any better way to say ""free""?"""
"I wrote about social security reform. Kinda boring stuff lol but it'll be fun to visit all the sites in DC	SS reform is very interesting. I am sure you will be meeting a lot of interesting people."
"We are moving. I'm so pumped for new adventures.	thats cool"
"Yes, a new state. I am just imagining all the fun things and new things we can do.	Well that sounds exciting! I hope it turns out well for you."
"When I was in middle school there was this boy that sat in front of me in 8th, he was always trying to get me to kiss him before class started.	Wow! It is so annoying. Maybe you should talk to him and get to know each others"
"No, the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.	Wow. What a bunch of stinking steez!"
"I've been out of a job for a while but someone I know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field	Sounds like you are feeling hopeful. What kind of job may I ask?"
"Statistics. I am going to help a real estate company build models to predict house values	That sounds so exciting! I wish I had a brokerage to get my money in for realtors."
"So a friend and I entered a drawing at the mall and she won. I wish I could say it doesn't sting a bit that she won.	Yeah, it's crazy how stuff like that does sting a little sometimes, but I suppose all the hard work and sacrifice pays off in the end."
"A weekend trip to Gatlinburg. I would of loved that.	I live near Gatlinburg and it's not too bad. We went on a few sight seeing stews (with wings) and storks (with tails). I should of been more excited but I'm glad you're happy."
"She is but she's taking her husband :)	I saw  man swallow a sword	Did you try to stop him?"
"Yes I was. I thought it was pretty intense to watch	I bet it was! I hate when people talk during commercials. It is annoying and annoying."
"I've been packing, packing, packing and cleaning.	Has it been a long time since you have done such a thing?"
"Moving, not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.	Ryzing is a good game. I hope you do win some silverware."
"Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.	Oh man! I would be so annoyed! The insurance companies can be very expensive these days!"
"Huge dent, I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.	damnks"
"I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy.	Oh yeah? What kind of dog?"
"Oh man, I sure was. And she was so excited to get out of that box.	I bet that was an awesome feeling"
"My brother isn't very good with money but i just lent him some	well at least he is trying to be a better person then you are."
"Yeah I don't do that often, but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time	You should definitely go and ask him. I think if you do, he will put his foot down."
"I just can't believe some people. I watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today.	That's absolutely horrible. Some people are just ungrateful and need to learn."
"I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.	I know right? They don't even take no for an answer at all. They'll just shove it down your throat like no one deserves it."
"So we are waiting on some news to move. I feel like it will be this week that we find out.	what news?"
"Not sure yet, waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.	i do to, what are you waiting for?"
"So I interviewed for my dream job last week and I didn't get it.	Oh no, are you sure you didn't get it?"
"I really hope so. I was really wanting that job.	I wish I could be happy at least doing something I like. Not sure if I can be happy at work though."
"So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.	That sounds horrible! What did you do?"
"Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.	oh no, i can imagine, my favorite color is supposed to be when the milk runs out, but i always wait a few more minutes"
"I am so ready to find out where we are moving to.	Ok but I would like some time to rest andyre."
"I don't know where I want to go, just want to know where they are sending us :)	Oh you are so curious. I am sure you will like it!"
"A book I borrowed from the library got rained on and now it's destroyed	Oh no! I know the feeling when a book we borrow ends up being used instead!"
"Yeah. I feel pretty bad about it.	Don't feel bad! Every relationship starts off wrong and either one party doesn't take the other's feelings into consideration or the other isn't serious about their relationship."
"I found my dog's old toy. It brought back memories of when I first got her	Aww, that's nice. It's always nice to find old treasures."
"I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog was she?	Any type of dog. She's great though."
"After months of job searching, I finally got a good offer	That's great. What kind of job did you apply for?"
"I got a job in statistics	hey that's great! good for you!"
"I have a final exam that I've been studying for for days.	That must be extremely difficult! But you must do well if you want to graduate with honors!"
"I think I will do really well. I feel prepared for it.	That is always a really good thing. Are you nervous about the test?"
"I stupidly lent my car to a friend.	What did you do when you returned home?"
"He got drunk and took it for a joyride. It didn't end well.	Oh, no. Was he drunk or half drunk?"
"Even though I could've gotten more money at another job, I've stayed with my current employer. It is a good place to work.	that's good that you stay loyal to employers like that"
"I work in public relations. I create campaigns for companies.	That sounds like a lot of work! I'm sorry. What kind of clients have you worked with so far?"
"I recently did a very successful one for a medical company.	That's awesome! What did you pitch?"
"I just had a job interview that went really well. I'm expecting a call pretty soon.	awesome, when is it going to call?"
"It's a statistical analyst job.	haha good luck! I hope you do well I am sure you will."
"I recently moved to a new city. I left behind some good friends.	That must have been bittersweet. Did you get to keep them?"
"That's very true. It'll just take some time.	Are you going to see them again?"
"Last week I was at the grocery store picking up body wash. There were so many to chose from, but I couldn't help but buy my trusted brand that has served me well for so many years.	That's so wonderful! I love to buy my trust from major brand and major discount. It really makes a difference. How did it make you feel when you bought it from your trust brand?"
"Yes, why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well.	Exactly. The risks are usually too great."
"I have to show some brand loyalty!	I have so much to do today, but it's raining. I'm OK with just staying at home and doing nothing.	sounds like an excellent strategy to me"
"It sucks. Maybe it'll be dry this weekend.	That's what they say. I hope it is, I hope it's a nice, hot, summer's day. You can enjoy the fruits of your labor while it lasts."
"My dog I had for five years just passed away. He was hit by a car last night.	I'm so sorry to hear that. You must be devastated."
"It is just so sad to have my loyal companion taken away like that.	How many years did you have your companion?"
"His name was Han Solo, I am a huge Star Wars fan. My wife thought it was a dorky name, but I loved it.	I'm ready for hurricane season. I have my kit ready and everything.	Is that your gear that you usually get in the event of an emergency?"
"South Alabama, near the Gulf.	There's a big gulf, dear."
"I have been sick the last week and my wife has made my chicken broth soup every day!	That is so nice of her. It is so easy to do that."
"She is such a blessing to me and spoils me so much.	Can you exercise more of that or is she holding back?"
"Yeah, I try to treat her the best I can, can't lose someone that amazing.	When I go out to a restaurant, I order gluten free food items.  I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not, my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.	That's ridiculous. What are the chances that someone would think that gluten is a real thing?"
"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	I see. Well I hope it's nothing serious."
"Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.	We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!	That sounds delicious! I think you'll like the new diet cola. It's better than the old stuff"
"I was concerned they were the wrong drink order, we lined them up and talked to the server and together figured out the syrup bag must be going empty!	That's good that you were concerned. I bet it was embarrassing."
"While cleaning out our closets, I always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be.  Last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make ""jean purses"" out of someday.  My kid is 14 this week!!!	teens are so sweet and caring"
"It definitely triggers some emotions!  Then I'm torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging.	Let's say you make a mistake and it puts you in the hospital. Do you go insane from the experience?"
"My wife made me pancakes for breakfast. I have a full belly and feel rather happy now.	Are you a star dish or do you prefer pancakes?"
"One of my favorite breakfast foods. She also made some thick sliced bacon. She treats me so well.	That sounds great. Is there a breakfast show you watch where she talks?"
"For sure, no other woman I would rather have.	Well you've got to do what you've got to do. I'm sure your dad knows he can trust her with his baby."
"How can I complain when she gets up early to make me such a great meal!	That is a very good thing in my opinion!"
"I told my brother that I was planning to propose to my best friend, but I hope he keeps it a secret!	He better! Maybe he's worried that if you told your best friend, everyone would know."
"He lets things slip once in a while, but this is a pretty big secret so I have confidence in him.	It sounds like he knows what he's doing"
"I have a friend who is struggling right now in her business.  I'm trying hard to be there to support and cheer her on.	That's tough. She really should be, but sometimes we don't have the means or the will."
"RIght? Even if I can't directly affect her business, I can help keep her spirits up to weather the storm!	That's really what you should do. I wish you the best in handling her!"
"I saw my neighbor bought the car I have always wanted. I wish I was in a a better financial position to buy one.	What kind of car is it?"
"Subaru Brat, best car ever made. Its like a car and a t ruck all in one.	Sweet. I want one of those."
"I know, it would look perfect in front of my double wide mobile home! There is a used one on the corner for $350. But that will take me months to save up.	I hope it works out for you!"
"Yeah, or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big.	That's sound. I should do it."
"I am in the process of potty training my daughter, but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper. The other day, we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service.	Oh my gosh! That's so embarrassing! I'm so sorry! Take her to preschool often and it'll be fine!"
"It was not one of our best moments. Luckily, she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.	Wow. I am glad that thing grew out of it."
"I ordered a new toy for my son online for his birthday.	How did it go?"
"No, not yet. But, I can't wait to! He's going to have so much fun with it.	You'll be so glad you went"
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December. i can't wait!!!	That's amazing! I bet you've got a lot of catching up to do!"
"I hope so too. I have wanted to go on a cruise for so long. I'm happy were are able to go this year.	I am sure you will get lots of shrimp cocktails and snails after refueling."
"We are going with a few friends, so they booked it and we got a discount because they are returning customers.	My dad called me one day crying out for help. I had to drive over to his house.	Oh, wow. I'm glad he was able to help you!"
"He had fallen and bruised his ribs. I had to take him to the hospital.	Oh, no! I hope he is okay!"
"Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities, I have been in a rut lately. Last week, during revival, for the first few nights, everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit, but I couldn't for whatever reason, and it made me feel bad.	I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Are you going to stay angry at God for that?"
"Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.	It sounds like you had a wonderful time! I hope you celebrate with family and friends on Sunday!"
"Thank you. He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.	Sometimes I wake up at night and eat junk food.	Oh, that's a go to habit for me! I used to eat bread, but have since switched to popcorn."
"Yeah but I feel bad afterwards. I like to make peanut butter and nutella sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies.	I will take that over a chocolate chaser, for the chaser taste."
"We had a birthday party for my son the other day!	awww was it amazing?"
"He's 6. It was so much fun to watch him open his presents.	Oh, I bet. It's always nice to see old friends getting stuff for themselves!"
"I was the captain of the volley ball team in middle school and high school, so I signed my daughters up to play. since they had an interest in it too. When we got the practice on the first day, the coach said that it was her first year coaching and she asked me if I would help a little.	oh thats a nice gesture of being able to help her."
"I was very excite to help. I miss playing very much, so being able to play with my daughters and show of my skills a little was great.	I bet it was! I bet you had a blast."
"A couple years ago, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with MS.	oh my god thats so scary"
"Yeah, I was blind in my right eye, and my left arm was numb.	How long did it take to get better?"
"My friend has been sick a lot recently and I am worried about her.	I am sorry to hear that, is she going to get better?"
"Yes.  She has been vomiting and having diarhea a lot	wonderful I hope she is okay, I hope you are able to get her something to drink"
"Yes.  It has just happened on and off for months.	I am sitting here chilling out with my cat on my lap.	That's so sweet! I love pets! You deserve this nap! What's wrong?"
"Yes.  My cat is relaxing and always sleeping	Excellent, I love cats. Savor every moment with your neighbor's cat"
"I had a job interview last week	oh which one?"
"I am not sure yet.  I was very nervous	Don't be nervous. It's all good. Everything will work out well."
"Next week I think	I spent a weekend at a lake house all by myself.	That sounds really nice. Did you enjoy yourself and not worry about them?"
"It was fantastic.  I found it so restful and peaceful just to get away from it all for a while.	I imagine that you have a pool somewhere in the pool house."
"I had a get together recently, One of my friends brought someone who couldn't hold their liquor.	Oh no that is horrible! How did they get it?"
"Heh, well they projectile vomited all over my carpet, it was gross.	That is gross, i would recoil in horror"
"Me and my daughter went to the skate park the other day.	How was it?"
"Yeah we did. She can ride up and down the ramps much better than I expected her to.	That must be fun for you both. I'm sure she will be a lot of fun."
"I've been out of work, and my dads been helping me financially.	that's a great thing to do. I wish i could do that for a living"
"No, I am filing for disability. Theres no way I can ever repay him	Oh no! Disability is hard! Mine started about the same time I did, and I'm still paying off about 15% of it each month right now. It's getting really old looking at the Wheel. I was hoping you got approved for that thing, but I'm not sure I could ever afford it, and I'm sure you're not alone. Maybe you can see your doctor to talk"
"I had to meet my new physical therapist this week.	oh really? that must've been weird"
"They seem ok. I just hate having to meet new doctors.	I can understand that. It can be daunting to know how to get the hang of all that."
"This is the first time ever that both of my kids have been in school.	That is wonderful to hear. It is wonderful to have such a great relationship with your kids. How old are they?"
"Yeah, it's just too quiet lol.	Well maybe you can go out and find some sports to keep your occupied until he comes home."
"Recently my family had a trip that was very disorganized. Basically drove a long way to hang see my family for a handful of hours.	Ah that must have been stressful. Did you see them?"
"Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.	Yeah, it would have been better"
"That is true, I guess there is that to be thankful for.	I had to wait in line at the store the other day for 15 minutes!	Oh wow, that's a lot of waiting! What were you going for?"
"Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.	Mostly just boring store food."
"I had to go to my brother in laws funeral last week.	How was it?"
"I'm ok. It just hit me hard seeing all those sad people.	I'm glad you're okay, it's a hard thing to see."
"I have some friends who are traveling all over Europe this summer	That sounds like great fun! If your friends are really good about it I'd be going myself in a few months."
"I am!  I would love to go myself.	If you're in the US, make sure you visit Grandma's grave too!"
"My and some old friends from college recently got together. It's always great to see those guys again.	Thats awesome! What kind of friends"
"Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.	Do you have plans for next week's meeting?"
"No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.	OK, that's too bad. But, as long as you guys have each other, that's something."
"My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.	Oh no that is not nice!"
"I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.	I'm sure she has a reason and you don't want to go that route."
"Oh, I've tried...	This weekend I saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color.	oh no, i am sorry to hear that, i can't stand that kind of stuff"
"No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.	lol. I am sorry that happened to you"
"No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.	I can see why that would bother you."
"I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently, but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.	That's understandable, I know how hard it is to let someone else take care of you"
"We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.	Yeah, you definitely have to be very careful with fart neighbors, they can actually cause more damage than good though."
"The last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes, shoes, and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school. There first day was yesterday and it went well.	How do you feel about doing that?"
"I'm home with my toddler, so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.	You are so thoughtful. I'm sure your child will love having you there to protect them. You are a good parent!"
"Recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back.	Oh wow. How do you think it went?"
"Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.	I'm guessing it was? You chose wisely and it was nice to have some peace of mind."
"My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. How old is he?"
"It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.	It's so hard to lose someone you love and it's hard enough not to lose someone you can't always trust. I hope they feel better and are doing better now!"
"Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.	Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends.	I love watching family games. Do they play the ball similarly to you?"
"The memories are awesome and I miss playing.But I wouldn't trade the life I live now to go back,	Absolutely! Especially the memories of the people you love."
"I am going fishing at my favorite spot tomorrow. I know I am going to catch something!	i have never been but i am afraid to"
"Blue catfish, they get so huge. I have a secret recipe for stink bait that works well!	I have no idea what that is."
"Oh I will, fried catfish is so amazing. Especially beer battered!	I am going to play dominos tonight	Good for you! I love playing dominos"
"Well with some locals at the local brewpub	Breweries are fun places to go if you're a fan of ales."
"Yes I think I will do well even though I just learned last week how to play!	my family came to visit recently, i always get so nervous about people visiting.	Why are you nervous about people visiting?"
"I have to make sure the house is clean and that everything is in order before they arrive, nerve wracking!	Oh I know, it must be very hard! I have to follow the same routine for both kids."
"I have a birthday coming up. I really hop I get the gift I am asking for.	Well Happy Birthday to you! What are you planning on getting?"
"Thank you, I am hoping for a new camera. It is about time to upgrade.	I hope you get a good one!"
"Thanks, I really enjoy getting out and photographing nature.	My dog go into the trash can and drug it all over the house. I am so mad right now!	Yikes! Did you find out who did it?"
"I know, it is going to take me all evening to clean up!	You have to be careful next time you go, it could be embarassing!"
"He is usually good, but this time his naughtiness got to him.	I am going camping this weekend. I got my tent, sleeping bag and tons of food. I think I have everything I need!	good luck i hope you have a good time"
"Oh I will, I am ready for whatever the elements throw at me!	Then just keep positive and things will work out."
"It will be a blast, I just love roughing it in the outdoors!	The other night i heard a sound like someone was breaking in my house, i was pretty scared.	Oh, no that's scary! What could that have been?"
"No, it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating.	That's so annoying, printers are so expensive these days."
"It has been raining a lot lately, I am really trusting the seal on our doors to keep the water out.	Well, that's what it's like in the city, so yes. It's a good thing your family and I are safe, because that would have been a nightmare to deal with otherwise."
"I know, it really starts too pool up by our house. It is getting kind of scary!	I am sure it will be OK"
"Yeah, really don't want to deal with a flooded home! Would not be good for my family.	I bought a cake from the store and it ended up tasting terrible.	Oh no! I hate it when that happens... did you taste its recipe on some other website?"
"No, I ended up just suffering through it and eating it.	Oh that's too bad. I'm sorry you had to experience that."
"Yeah, I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me.	I was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently, I bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better.	How'd it go?"
"Yea, it made me feel better about myself and my chances, or maybe i just like spending money	haha. Whatever made you feel good about yourself probably made you feel more confident about your chances, right?"
"I love chocolate cookies because my grams would always make them for me.	Yeah, I love those too. Wish I could go back to being a kid again and just do 100 pushups a minute like you!"
"Nothing beats cookies made by grandma. Except for the oatmeal ones. Too healthy haha.	Oh yeah, I've always wanted a block of oatmeal, since I was a kid."
"Only if it has raisins to sweeten them up!	I found an old picture of when my oldest daughter started kindergarten 11 years ago.	Aw, that is beautiful. I bet that was very bittersweet. How old is she now?"
"It is!  In it, she's just standing with a huge smile on her face and a Hello Kitty backpack.	Awww it's incredible. I wish I had a pet like that."
"I've been teaching my young daughter to play video games with me, she's such a quick learner.	It is nice to see that you have time for her. Have you given her the usual gadgets and programming tips?"
"Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them, It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence.	I played that on the arcades. Those games remind me of when I was little. Lemmings sounds like fun!"
"It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.	aren't you glad you found some to go with your Dean's pie!"
"I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!	I may just have taste in that particular aisle. I usually end up going the opposite way around."
"Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!	I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.	Congrats! That's great!"
"It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!	Wow that sounds amazing, hope you have a good year."
"I try to.  But I'm glad all the effort is being recognized!	I put in to get a promotion at work, and I should know something either way by tomorrow.	I hope you get it!"
"On the one hand, I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.	I'm sorry, I can only imagine. That's so great that you took time to restructure your life. You sound like a very grateful person."
"I work for a medical supply company.	Oh, very nice, what does your job entail?"
"Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.	Oh god, that sounds horrible. So many animals in cages it seems like it's an everyday occurrence at my grocery store. Do you feel any sympathy for them? I mean it's unfair that they had to work so hard to get the animals and then to have them die in there."
"I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!	I'm sorry you have that problem. I hope you find a way to *resist* using that law"
"Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.	When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup	you were there?"
"So good, genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!	You will always be remembered fondly by your teammates and your family!"
"But yeah - school started for the kids today and it was weird how quiet it was once the bus pulled away.	I remember that feeling back then. I hated waiting for school to end up being the day!"
"It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.	What a nice way to end the day!"
"Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!	I bet they will be fine then!"
"I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years, after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!	I hope it wasn't too hard for you!"
"Yes indeed, there was even a frog under there! So bizarre!	Yeah they're usually pretty nice. I bet it was a nice trip."
"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	Holy cow, sounds like a sad case. What do you think happened to the other farm as a result of the charges?"
"Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.	I totally know the feeling. I rescue animals and have lost many in the last five years."
"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	That is so great, the problem of hunger in American is too great."
"And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!	It is insane that people are still being put in that situation! I am glad that the bond has been raised for you, and that you will be reunited with them soon."
"My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.	How did that turn out?"
"I am, too!  I'm glad he's doing something he loves.  At this point, I'm just waiting on the text to see which team he made it onto.	that's pretty cool, i hope he keeps it up"
"I'm so glad the kids went back to school today!	I hope they had a good time!"
"Yes!  I can go back to having ice cream for breakfast!  I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the, ""Mom, you always watch this!"" comment!	MJ, how many kids do you have?"
"How old are they?	They're in their early 20s."
"Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL	My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.	that sucks are you happy or mad are you able to laugh it off lol"
"On the one hand, I hope so but on the other hand, I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD	I understand. It will be worse tomorrow and then it would be okay."
"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	Those dogs are never good for a walk."
"He was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me, the neighbor finally came out and called him home. was intense.	yeah its really scary when a raccoon comes into your home"
"The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.	Oh no, that is sad. I love stray kittens."
"She was under my house, crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.	So sorry to hear that. That is absolutely horrible. Yes, I can imagine the devastation that must have been for the fam."
"And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad, but I take comfort in those things.	My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked. A few days later she was playing no problem!	That's impressive, she's talented. What kind of game?"
"Yea, i was pretty proud of her, especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid.	i agree. Kids today are so excited to explore and make new friends."
"I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.	That's quite unfortunate, what will you do?"
"I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!	yeah that's the bad part about millennials - they will learn iThind"
"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	Well, I hope that you are able to cover the costs, although I'm sure you will be okay. Families are very important, you don't want to stress about money that's probably not going to be spent."
"Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.	Definitely. I think you should try to get into the pros. You never know what kind of work is attractive though."
"When my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy	Oh no! I am sorry! Is everything ok?"
"hah, i hear ya. I just got so used to all the commotion i suppose.	I understand. I get nervous at traffic maybe."
"When we were kids, my sister and i once stole a blank check from our mom to order a pizza, we got caught.	Why didn't you get caught? That's very lucky of you."
"My mom noticed the charge and found a the missing check from her checkbook, i'll never forget the look of dissapointment on her face!	I'm sorry. That must be awful."
"Oh yea. grounded for a long time.	I just saw a movie I had been looking forward to and it was terrible	Oh no! What movie was it?"
"It was the new Jurassic World	That sounds wonderful!"
"My coworker forgot to turn in the paperwork to switch our on call weeks. He ended up costing me $250! I'm so mad!!!	Oh man that's a really expensive mistake to make. I'm sorry. Will you have to call him and tell him how wrong you were?"
"He's such a worm. I can't stand it.	I hope he eventually gets the hang of admitting to himself what a worm he is! I'm sure you two will have a much better time together when he comes around."
"Working from home can be difficult when people won't leave me alone to get work done.	You must really annoy them, are they organized about their shifts?"
"I love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video, gonna pull my hair out.	Dang, i really do agree, that is very annoying"
"I have a big date coming up and I can't get these butterfly feelings to go away.	Well, it's time to move on"
"Yeah, I really think she might be the one. I hope I don't screw it up.	Good luck."
"Thank you, I am looking forward to taking her to a nice place to eat!	I bit into an apple and found a worm. It was so gross.	Worm? I have never heard of that! I would be so grossed out!"
"Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple.	You should try the kiwifruit. It should be cheaper and it has more fruit."
"That is true, I should be thankful for that.	I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs.	Awwwww, that sounds scary! What did you do?"
"They really startled me, the female did not seem happy to see me.	Did you try to play it off?"
"Yeah, thankfully I was able to get away. It took a while for me to catch my breath.	I got a new dog recently, he is the best. I am so thankful for him!	That's great I am grateful for my dog as well. What breed?"
"He is a male australian shepherd. His name is charlie, he is super cute!	Sounds like a cute dog!"
"Will do! He is super cuddly and loves to follow me around!	There was one piece of pie left in the fridge. Instead of sharing it, I ate it. I kind of feel bad.	ice cream man, thats terrible! i know how you feel"
"It might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone. I look super guilty right now.	Whose idea was it to take a trip?"
"I could, I might have to buy her some of her favorite chocolate.	I was at the park today and almost stepped on a rattle snake. I almost jumped out of my skin.	I once saw a komodo dragon on the ground! How terrifying!"
"Me too, that would of wrecked my day. It was so close! It haunts my thoughts even now.	It's funny how life works sometimes. You never know if things will turn out well or badly."
"It might take me a little while to get over my fear and go back to the park.	Yeah, I've over it by now. Enjoy the rest of summer!"
"For sure, wouldn't want to relive that experience	I just got a bonus from my job. That money came at the perfect time!	What was the job?"
"It was a really nice bonus too, they were impressed with the quality of work I have done this year.	oh thats good"
"Now I will have to work even harder and try to earn a larger one next year.	I was going to go to the movies with a bunch of friends. But they all bailed on me and now I have to go alone.	Oh no, why did you all end up going?"
"I hope so, but I am really missing them right now. I didn't want to go alone.	Oh, I'm sure you'll feel better once you get some rest. Sometimes, losing a few hours can really help a lot."
"It is hard to find reliable friends. No one seems to show up anymore.	I was out photographing butterflies and took the most incredible photo. I am really happy with how it turned out!	I love pictures of animals, so I know what you mean. I love taking pictures of people too, especially if they are happy."
"The butterfly was yellow. It was a tiger swallowtail. One of my favorites!	That's an awesome name, I'm sure it'll be available one day as well!"
"I saw my dog try to eat a dirty diaper one time	How did that go?"
"Yeah, it's nasty. I wouldn't let her lick my face for a while after that.	That is nasty, hopefully she grows out of it."
"I was trying to take a nap, but my cat kept on trying to play with my head.	aww that is so annoying. did you try taking a nap afterwards?"
"I usually love mine, but not when it is keeping me from sleeping	Oh gosh. Thats too bad. What keeps you awake?"
"I just had a job interview and I'm waiting to hear if I got the job.	I hope you get it."
"Me too. I'm feeling pretty nervous about it	Don't worry too much. We'll make it up to you."
"I was on a plane ride and we went through some pretty severe turbulence	That sounds quite scary. What kind of airplane was it? I can't stand flying through the blades of trees any longer!"
"Yes it was. I was so afraid we'd crash	I bet. the first time I did a car try I passed a sobriety test but I was drunk. I didn't even realize my hand had been up. I was so drunk i didn't even realize I made a left turn. I wish i would havea had a field day and told them instantly"
"My cousin and I tricked my butler into thinking he won millions in the lottery. I feel so bad.	That would be kind of him. But how did you do it?"
"Only a few minutes.	I'm sure they'll come back soon. You should make sure you celebrate when they do!"
"Someone came to my door with a gun, asking for money	Oh no, did you call the police?"
"I didn't have any. He came into the house and stole some stuff	Okay so what did he steal?"
"Our cat had to many health problems, so we had to put him down.	Sorry to hear that, those kinds of things are never easy to deal with."
"I had him for 17 years, he lived a full and happy life, but I was not ready for him to go.	oh wow that is sad.. i am sorry for your loss."
"But they make your life so much enjoyable while they are around!	I went to do karaoke with a guy i'm dating and I discovered he's a really talented singer	Oh wow, I'm glad you found your soulmate! It'll be really fun."
"He's kind of shy about it. He had to get really drunk to perform karaoke	Oh wow, that's kind of strange."
"I had to do a research project and present it to my professors to graduate. Thankfully I passed!	You must have been very well prepared for the challenges ahead."
"I worked many long hours. It was stressful but I'm happy to have done well	Oh, well I'm glad to hear that. You must have been tired."
"My sister has been playing a song I dislike over and over and over	Oh no, what song is it?"
"She does it more because she likes it than to bug me. It's going to be stuck in my head for weeks	Dang. I bet that is stressful."
"okay.	i will go with you then"
"That is great! What will you be doing there?	Hmm.. I don't know. Maybe you could send me a DM saying hello and I'll forgive you."
"I accidentally slapped someone in the face while I was playing basketball.	Oh no! Did they get hurt?"
"No, I think she was just a little shocked by it. I felt so bad.	Oh I can see where that might be akward. I'm sure she'll let you know if she's ready for it."
"I let my friend borrow my car. He's an international student and only has a permit.	Well that's understandable. What did you all do?"
"I was in the car with him. He just wanted to practice driving and he didn't have his own car.	Oh I'm sorry. It's not easy being in a car with a crazy person like that."
"I am at a cross road. I am trying to decide my major in college.	What are you studying?"
"I was thinking about graphic design. Or, I was going to do something practical like Nursing.	Oh cool, I hear you on that one, it's a tough career!"
"I guess you are right. I really like sketching and painting. I can use my creativity side.	I've been trying to save money so that I can help my husband with the Christmas shopping this year.	oh i see, you can feel free to do as you like."
"Well at first I was a little discouraged because I wasn't making that much. Things have picked up recently though, and I feel I will be able to help him a good bit so I'm feeling better about it.	That's great news. Good on you for having an experienced friend to help!"
"I had planned to take my daughter shopping a few weeks ago. We were all really excited, but the plans fell through.	oh man did it"
"Yes. We were able to go about a week later, but the closer it got to school starting back I started to stress. Everything is good now though.	That is good. School is always close and let your stress take care of itself."
"I check in with my partner to see if we are okay. I ask him if there is anything that we can work on to make the relationship better.	That's great that you encourage your partner to think about other things besides himself. I wish I had a partner like that!"
"I don't want to have problems. This is why I check in with him.	It is good to have a partner like that"
"When I go out with friends I really have to be tight with my money. Times are really hard for me financially?	That is really rough. Are you able to go out and earn some extra money?"
"I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much. I sometimes like to leave a tip if possible.	If I were you, I would leave a tip as well! Its so nice to have someone that you can trust."
"I find it appalling how my husband's family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away.	That's got to be very hard on you. Have you ever talked to them since?"
"Yes, it is. They are all being really selfish and childish. My husband is staying out of it, but I can tell that he is getting fed up with it.	Divorce is the wrong tool for the job"
"I have to run several errands for my father-in-law today and he wants them done before my mother-in-law get into town, which is at some unspecified time today.	That's a pain! Does he have a power tool that can do it?"
"Yeah, I'm ready to get everything done so I can relax. I can't start on the errands until I drop the kids at school though.	What kind of errands did you run into?"
"I really do miss my mother. She has been dead for about 15 years now.	That's so sad. DO you have any memories of her?"
"It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.	i think the blessing always comes first over beating her up over it. you can't live with yourself"
"Yes, it is. I know that time heals.	I am glad you have time to enjoy your life now."
"My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings. So, I would have to let go and let them fly.	That's a great attitude!"
"I have 23, 20, 17 and 14. They are doing stuff that I question but I don't want them to not tell me stuff.	Wow. That's amazing. Sounds like your parents must be catching up with you now."
"When I was in labor with my third child, they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital. The nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor. In the 2 minutes it took for him to get to my room, my heart dropped and I started to panic. He told me that the baby's heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency C-section right then.	That's horrible! They do that all the time and it's not even that bad. Ultrasounds are very useful to know what's going on. Ultrasound in general is very useful"
"Yes, everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.	Three years is a long time to be scared of an infant"
"Yes, they do. I ope your boy is all good now.	I finally beat level 150 on the crucible today in my favorite game Grim Dawn.	Wow, that's amazing! I never get to play Grim Dawn because I'm too busy playing other games. I hope you get lots of play time because it sound like you deserve it."
"PC all the way. I've been grinding devotion points all week.	4"
"I just found a hello kitty pot in my daughters room filled with water and old flowers.	That's wonderful! I bet she's happy to have a pet in her room. Did she bring him a bowl of sweet peas?"
"It's not cute, and she's nine. By old flowers I mean, it's a green, stagnant slush with mold growing on top.	Ah, that is not good at all. I wonder if she will grow out of it?"
"When I enter the bus, I fainted. I think that I got overheated.	oh that's terrible, are you ok?"
"Yes I did. It was so hot outside and I did not have much to drink.	Oh man! I'm glad you didn't have much to drink! So, how did it feel when you finally made it back to your room?"
"I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends	oh no, that's a bad breakup phase."
"I fell down, and apparently said some embarrassing things.	That's not a good thing to do. Will you be ok?"
"My daughter is graduating from college. I cannot wait until she finish.	Congrats on her education! How old is she?"
"Yes, I will. She has been under a lot of stress.	Yes, that's no fun! Not when your girlfriend has a lot on life and you're left to take care of it."
"Two years ago I got diagnosed with MS.	Wow, that's horrible, how long have you been ill?"
"Its a disease that attacks the nervous system. It was really scary to find out I had it. I just went blind in my right eye one day. Two days and several test later I found out I had MS.	MS is horrible! I hate hearing about others that have had it."
"I found out that my daughter is moving out. My youngest one told me so.	I'm so sorry! I know that must be tough!"
"I feel really sad because I felt she should have told me.	Mistakes happen. Just be strong."
"I let my sister borrow my car. She is a new driver.	What kind of car is it?"
"Well, nothing. I'm sure that she will be a responsible driver.	I stand corrected. I am a bit apprehensive about her as well because I don't know all the nuances of driving."
"I think that I will do good on my test.	What kind of test is it"
"It is tonight. I studied really hard.	That's good to hear. Nightie?"
"I heard a song that I hadn't heard in awhile. It reminded me of my high school days	Any old reminiscing can do that to you. What was the song?"
"Yes, it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when I was young.	I felt the same way looking at your daughter."
"My dad dies when I was 33 years old.	Sorry to hear that. You must be going through a tough time."
"Thank you. I was crushed, and it left me with questions about my own mortality.	The pom-poms of life are so tantalizing! How did you find yourself after you passed?"
"My mother fell and injured herself. I wanted help and comfort her in any way possible.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that."
"Yes, but bhe bruised her wrist, and had a concussion. I wish that I was there for her when it happened.	How long ago was this?"
"I had a nice meal and my favorite beverage after work	That sounds really great."
"It was a skirt steak with avocados. I was very satisfied.	That sounds so good!"
"When I started a new job. I was nervous about proving myself all over again.	Yes! but you will do great! you are just 21!"
"I did, but I find it hard to trust people. Especially at work.	It's hard to lose trust with people you don't even know."
"I am trying to quit drinking soda and I have prayed to God and asked Him to help me. The problem is I am addicted to soda and Its very hard to quit. When I do manage to skip a day, the lack of caffeine causes horrible headaches.	Okay, so I think you have a problem. Maybe you can go to a weight loss class."
"It just makes me feel bad, that no matter how many times I try, I still give in to the temptation.	I understand that. I have been there more than I like to admit."
"Yeah, I think that's what I will have to do. Thanks for the advice.	I went on a job interview. I'm anxiously waiting to hear if I got the job.	awful, i am waiting for you too, thanks goodness you got it"
"I still need wait another week.	That's still a couple of days worth of absence. I'm sure you'll be back soon."
"A drafter.	I just went to clean my kids sink a few minutes ago. I found a bunch of toys in the catch and I am mad.	Oh me too! Some toys are just annoying and can ruin your child's fun!"
"Yeah, all the toys are out. But, they got some explaining to do after school.	Well, hopefully they can all find a hobby or craft and carry on that line in the future."
"I couldn't sleep last night. I ended up staying up till 2am and eating a large amount of Shepard's pie.	What is Shepard's pie?"
"Combination of stress and new meds I think. Maybe I can get back to my old scheduled soon.	Well that might help you right about now. I hope it doesn't cost too much or you can cut your losses and go indie?"
"I saw my crush talking to another guy.	oh yea im sure it was embarassing."
"I was a little upset, but it wasn't my business. I let it go.	I wouldn't either if I was in your position."
"When I went to the store the other day, I seen a guy all tweaked out on drugs.	That's not good! Did he get caught?"
"No, but he seemed a little unpredictable, so I used the other door.	That's good. I might have to get that locked and monitored, because that sounds like a very bad idea."
"Holding each of my children for the first time was amazing.	I bet! How old are they?"
"Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.	If you know what you're doing try and hold onto them"
"I forgot about my grandmother's birthday a couple years back. I felt so bad about it!	Oh no! Do you think people forgot about it because it's not a big deal, or did you find out that you're not quite sure what the correct answer was later?"
"Absolutely! I called her the next day and made sure to visit her. :)	I should get to visit too, I have been a few mins over."
"She did. :) It ended up being a good visit anyway!	I was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day, and I found all my old paintball gear.	That must have been fun! My dad used to play in the leagues and stuff."
"No, just me. But, I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.	Well, you could always try playing at a friends house, or a cousin's house. I love those!"
"I went skydiving last summer with my partner. It was so scary!	I dont think I could do it, its too scary for me too"
"Absolutely! I've always been scared of heights, but I'm so glad I made myself.	make sure you don't fall"
"When I was a kid, I had a dog at my grandpa's. He gave it away because it wouldn't hunt.	Aww, that's so sad. How did your dog react when it was released back into its pen?"
"I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.	I understand."
"I tripped and fell in front of some people.	Ouch, that sounds terrible. Hope everything turned out okay?"
"No, only my pride was injured.	How long will that stain?"
"I recently dug up a necklace my grandmother gave me when I was young for a birthday. I hadn't seen it in years.	I bet you were very happy to receive it."
"Yeah, she passed more than five years ago and I had forgotten all about it. It brought back so many memories though!	I guess I should acquaint myself with it since I remember it well."
"I just won an award for best yard in the neighborhood!	that's great! what for?"
"I did, mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off.	That's great!"
"It is, it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards.	I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends, it should be so much fun!	That sounds like a lot of fun! What are you going to eat?"
"We often throw around a frisbee for a little bit, but we never get too intense with any sports.	That's got to be frustrating. Sorry I know how you feel."
"Me too, there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!	That sounds very fun"
"I snuck some candy out of my daughter's snack stash. I feel bad because I had been trying to diet.	Oh no that is a little bit embarrassing but it happens to the best of us. Did she remember where the candy was?"
"Otherwise it's been pretty good- I've managed to lose 12 pounds! Just wish I could let the sugar cravings go.	Whats the last thing you ate?"
"My childhood friend gave me a watch for by birthday a few years ago, I lost it in a move recently. I'm pretty upset by it.	watch in hand, what a strange thing to lose what is probably an essential part of your life."
"I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!	I'm sure it will turn up Bon voyage! :)"
"I let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day.	Was she okay with that?"
"She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.	That's a shame, but lucky for you she's a good mechanic as well."
"It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.	oh no, that is not cool, i hope she is ok"
"It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.	Wow how mean. I'm sorry."
"I was feeling really down for a few weeks and my sister knew. She drove hours to come see me and make me feel better!	Oh wow, that's very nice of her, how did you respond?"
"Yeah it was really sweet of her and made me feel so much better!	I bet you're so happy!"
"I was recently on a long international flight and we hit some really bad turbulence.	Oh no, I'm sorry, that must have been awful."
"I didn't, but I was really nervous for a little while. My wife didn't handle it quite as well.	Oh okay. How did she handle it?"
"For sure. And it was a great trip.	I screwed up plans for a date night with my wife. We ended up having to cancel and she was really mad about it.	Oh, no! That is a terrible thing to happen. Hopefully she won't let you see her again anytime soon!"
"We did and I made sure to not screw that one up!	That's great! Happy's are always hard to come by. I'm sure you'll find someone better soon."
"Me too. Who knows what would have happened to me if I did it twice.	I was able to go back home to my parents for a few weeks recently. It was wonderful to relax in my childhood home.	Oh that sounds great! I'm glad you got to do that. I haven't been able to visit my family in a couple years now. We haven't technically moved in yet but you get to spend time with your family over the summer"
"They loved having me around again! Our ten year old dog wouldn't leave my side.	Aw that's so sweet. I bet that was a good time for you and your family!"
"I've been thinking about buying some new, softer skateboard wheels.	Oh yeah. I know that can be expensive, but it's always good when you can."
"No, they make rough pavement feel smoother. I think I'll just keep the ones I have for now though. Just have to deal with having a rough ride.	Yeah, I have no doubt the rough places in the roads will just get worse and worse. I'm glad you have the hard places for the future."
"I took my dog I've had for years over to meet one of my husband's sisters the other night.	Oh I bet that was awkward."
"It did not go well at all! She pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home.	I hope it will be less of a mess at your house."
"Yeah, I think it might've been too much on her at once. I was pretty embarrassed.	I had to take my daughter to the doctor the other day. She was very sick.	how did she get sick?"
"It was just the flu. I got her some medicine, brought her home, and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.	Aww, sounds like she is feeling better. I am sure she will be fine."
"So my sister is getting married in a few weeks.	That's wonderful to hear! Do you like her recently?"
"Absolutely! The whole family is flying out, we can barely contain ourselves.	oh it's good, do you have any plans as to what you're doing next?"
"So my friend adopted a new kitten very recently.	Oh, that's quite cool! Did he adopt it for a specific reason, or just to have?"
"Oh, she is absolutely adorable! I'm so envious, I haven't been able to adopt one yet.	I know the feeling. You want to be able to adopt one but can't. How cute is she/him?"
"Bought a new car a few months back. Couple nights ago we had a big storm roll through. I thought for sure it was going to hail all over my new car.	Oh no, how big was the storm? Did it destroy the home or the home's belongings?"
"Nice! We have a garage, but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.	That makes sense, would make a happy family!"
"I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker. He is a programming wizard. He easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods I had never even heard of.	Thats great coding is hard but so worth it"
"That is true. I usually can keep up, but this guy is on another level.	I remember when that all happened with me. I was so frustrated."
"I had a meeting with my bosses the other day to discuss finally getting a promotion.	How did it go?"
"I've been working there for a couple years now. I'm feeling pretty good about my chances! Haven't heard back yet.	That's exciting! I'm sure if you apply and keep the job you'll get it. Best of luck!"
"I feel so good about knowing I am going to win the race on Sunday. The race is for my favorite charity. When I win the race I get to give my winnings to my charity of choice.	Aww, that's sweet. I always think it's cool when you win a race, but I never think about how you spent it. It sounds like you spent it wisely!"
"Yes, it is my local animal shelter. They will be there to cheer me on!	That's great! I hope you have a good start, you don't want to be lonely."
"My wife has had a trip in mind ever since I've known her. She recently had a big birthday so I surprised her with the trip. We went and she loved it. It made me happy to see her so happy.	That is great that you are the fun one!"
"It was just a trip to the west coast. There was a handful of things she's always wanted to see/do. So we did all of them.	She's not young anymore!"
"Not yet. We try to take one big trip a year if possible. We just got back from that one, so we will start plotting out next year a little later I would imagine.	I live in Florida. When I go home once a year it is a grand occasion.	Yes, how many people are in the family? I think it's a lot!"
"I grew up in Alabama. It is not far from Florida but still I get so thrill when I can go back to see family and friends.	I feel the same way! How long you been there?"
"My sons first day of school was the other day.	how old is he?"
"Very first. I was so nervous till he got off the bus.	Well, dogs are just like family. Look how much they love you!"
"I have a test coming up that I've been studying for weeks for.	What kind of test? I hope you know something that will make you proud."
"It's a Japanese language test for college. I feel pretty good about it though, been going over and over it every night.	I would be proud if I were you. I am just about to start in the fall."
"I had phone interview for a job. It went very well	that's amazing. I must be doing well in the interview! What is the job and what makes it interesting?"
"Thank you. I wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand.	I'll bet your had a great time. I love doing the customer service portion of the job. I always feel so nervous, but it's so rewarding when I get right down to it."
"I saw an old movie. It reminded me of my younger days.	what movie?"
"Yes. It's almost like a time machine. Fond memories.	Do you plan on keeping the doll?"
"I lost my job because my company didn't pay rent at our location.	That's awful. How did that happen?"
"Not very well. It makes me so angry. So I go work out to relieve the stress.	You should do cardio and strengthen your abs and hips. The work will pay off!"
"Recently my wife left me home alone with the dog all weekend while she was gone on a girls trip.	Oh no! Did she forget to leave us in the dark at all, or did she right in the nick of time?"
"I missed her while she was gone. We have a mixed breed rescue pup.	That's so sweet! I bet you miss her so much."
"Our computer system at work is goofing up a lot, but the development team just keeps saying there's nothing wrong.	Do you think there's a chance it will be fixed up so you can work again?"
"Sometimes. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things I need to do.	I think the faster you move, the better."
"Me too!	Every time my kids go to grandma's they get to eat all kinds of candies, and get new toys.	Oh, I know what you mean. I hate when that happens."
"Yeah they do! Some times I wish I got to go visit grandma's like they do lol.	I'll bring you some friends :-)"
"I was really happy when my nephew was born, Sadly i was informed he had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.	oh no, that's awful"
"He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy, but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.	oh thats cool"
"I bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price. They didn't.	Oh no! That's the worst! Did you get burned?"
"Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.	Sounds like you're in good shape. What's your goal this year?"
"I came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor. He hasnt done that in ages.	I hate when that happens, did you ask him to clean it up?"
"Thanks. I dont think so. He has seemed fine otherwise. I've watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine. He is a mutt from a local shelter.	Sounds like a trustworthy dog! Good for you putting him in such care!"
"Yeah. I love that goofy animal.  Hope he's ok	I work for a software company. I have been trying to learn a new language for some stuff. I knocked out my first task like a champ.	Nice! It's always good to hear that your teammates are getting better as you get better, so it sounds like you're on the path to success."
"Well I have the opportunity, but rarely have the time to really devote to it.	I'm in the same boat! Most of my free time is spent playing video games!"
"Yeah i get that. I work for a startup so things change pretty rapidly around here.	I landed an ollie on my skateboard for the first time in 14 years yesterday.	Congrats! Are you happy about it?"
"Yeah it took a lot of practice.	I'm sure you'll be good then!"
"Next week I am off work and going to the beach.	Sounds like fun! What beach?"
"No I am going with my wife and her family. But we all get along great so it should be fun.	I hope you have a wonderful time! It's always better to stay with friends and family."
"Amen. It is much needed. Ready for some sun and a drink with an umbrella.	Yea. I meant the new year, not the old year."
"Not too long ago, I took a trip on a plane. The airline lost my whole suitcase!	Aww, that's so embarrassing. Did you have to keep the stuff for a special flight?"
"The whole vacation! I was so upset! I didn't have anything to wear for the duration.	what a pain!"
"We usually don't do anything big for birthdays but my wife got me an apple watch this year.	Thats so good birthday gift! what did you get her?"
"Yeah i really did not see it coming at all.	Well, I'm sorry you had to witness that."
"My boss and I went to lunch and had a personal conversation about some life issues.	That's interesting. What were those issues?"
"We just went to a local taco place. It was a good conversation.	Tacos are pretty good. What kind of taco was it?"
"It was more about just some personal life stuff. Not too much really.	I came back from a trip recently, got called in the boss's office and was given a decent sized raise.	That's great! Nothing is worse than having to work for someone that you like but can't quite understand. Did you get a raise at least?"
"Absolutely. I certainly won't say no to that.	ok carry on"
"Budget is kind of tight lately and I am really afraid my wife's aging car is about to bite the dust.	thats a bummer, i am sure your wife would be mad"
"I may have to if that happens. We are making it now, but if the car goes it will be pretty tough.	I'm sure it will. I'm guessing you have worked really hard to get to this point?"
"It is ok. We are probably too proud to take help anyway. We will make it.	That's a great attitude to have! I'm a strong woman after all, whatever your situation may be, you needn't be ashamed."
"So I recently went through some old boxes and found some of my childhood dolls. It brought back a lot of memories!	Oh, so it was just a hobby for you?"
"Absolutely! I remember having so much fun with them dressing them up. My sister and I would play for hours.	That sounds like a great time."
"So, i may be in the market for a new laptop or a repair at least, thanks to a little mishap.	Oh, no! I hope your luck has changed your life forever."
"My daughter tripped on the cord and it smashed on the ground, not sure if it can be saved. I was pretty angry.	I am so sorry that happened. You must have been quite upset."
"I woke up the other morning, got ready and drove all the way to work. Just to find out it was a holiday and we had the day off.	Drive safe! I am sure you got a lot of gifts."
"I know, but the extra day of work was nice. Especially since I wasn't expecting it.	I can understand that"
"It was wonderful. I ended up being twice as productive since I got up early.	That's great and I hope it continues to work for you."
"My new job is starting tomorrow. I'm feeling nervous, but really optimistic about it.	You are prepared for the difficulties?"
"It's a job they opened up for graphic design! I'm super excited to get started and learn more from them.	That is great, good luck with your education!"
"Going to my son's first pee-wee football game tomorrow!	That will be fun! How old is he?"
"He thinks he does.  All I can think of is a bunch of Tiny Titans in helmets running around like chicks in a barnyard.  *chuckle*	That's funny, he could have his own team and wear it around with him"
"I put in a job application for a new job. I am fairly certain that my credentials are enough to get me the job.	Whats your favourite course in college?"
"I was, I go in next Tuesday. I am pretty excited for them to give me the job.	I am very happy for you. I wish you all the best. Keep punching."
"Me too, we shall see. Now the waiting begins!	I got a call about job with a good company that is in my line of work.	Oh, that's exciting! I hope you go for it!"
"No, but I have the necessary experience, and I'm optimistic that it will work out.	You definitely should be optimistic. But more importantly, you should keep positive, you never know..."
"I went to the petstore with my dog and he had an accident in front of everyone. He had the saddest look on his face.	Oh no! What happened after?"
"He did, the clerk walked over, told him it was ok and gave him a treat.	That's sweet of the clerk too"
"I had a video job interview. That was a new experience.	Good luck. i hope you did well. dont be nervous. you are ready to land."
"I'm not sure. It was a little awkward and stressful.	well be careful"
"Sure, that's ok. And thank you.	You're welcome. When you're ready, I'm open."
"I've been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and the pain is horrible. The problem is that the medicine that my doctor wants me to take has side effects worse that the pain.	I'm sorry to hear that. I just wish I could find an affordable medicine that worked for me."
"Maybe, I haven't been back because I can't afford to go right now. I've just been dealing with the pain.	I know how you feel. I'm so sorry. Maybe the trip will work itself out for you later in the week or if you pay someone enough."
"It suck.Hopefully we can both get coverage soon.	My son got picked to be on the soccer team that he was on last year!	That's so exciting. What position does he play?"
"He is!  Especially since last year's team won the Opening Day Tournament and then won the Regular Season title!	Oh so they are legit now?"
"Yeah!  We had a group of really talented kids, and some very good [and patient] coahes!	The other day, my three year old didn't know I was paying attention to her while she was playing with the dog. I overheard her trying to teach the dog how to count to ten.	aw what happened? did she passed the torch to someone else?"
"Yes, I thought that was pretty good for a three year old. When I asked her about it she said they were playing school. Haha.	I can see how that would be fun for both of you. Well I hope you do something similar for another cat when they're older!"
"I'm very proud of her.	That's awesome! Congrats!"
"I babysat and worked odd jobs all summer when i was younger to save up and buy a sega dreamcast.	I got my own when it was all said and done"
"Yep, i've never looked forward to something so much in my life. I still have the dreamcast as well.	Sounds like you are looking forward to it as much as I am! I would be excited as well."
"I'm gonna need your support here, because I'm going through something a little bit rough, okay?	It can be a lot worse than a bad breakup. I'm really glad you have you support."
"I'm 29 years old and I woke up to find that I'd wet the bed last night. I'm...not even sure how. I didn't drink a whole lot before bed or anything.	That isn't good. Maybe you need to sleep with the head up?"
"Should I see a therapist or anything? Is this indicative of some deep-seated problem that I'm not aware of?	seeing as how it's twilight in my state, yeah I wouldnt bother either"
"My Uncle Jebodiah is always looking out for me. He recently told me that he had a special concoction that if I drank it, it would cure my herpes.	Jebodiah, I am sure your uncle has a lot of trust funds. Is your uncle a good uncle?"
"Listen, my Uncle Jeb wouldn't do me dirty like that. You may call it """"""snake oil"""""" but I call it the miracle cure this world needs. After all, it worked.	I believe in snake oil."
"My cat was kept overnight at the vets recently. I was so worried!	Aw, that's so hard, I have a pet monkey I keep around for pet bonding. I'm afraid they get stressed when their free and active. How did they bond?"
"She's fine now! They found out it was something minor after x-rays. I was so relieved.	oh good, that's good"
"My car broke down on a busy highway the other day. There were so many cars zooming past me, it was scary!	Ugh that's no fun! Did you call a tow truck?"
"My brother had to pick me up. He had to pull up behind me on the curb. It felt dangerous!	I feel you! My brother was almost run over last year while driving his truck"
"Look, can we just be honest with each other for a second? Having ebola shouldn't mean that I have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions.	Yeah, that would really suck. I had to be grounded after losing my grandmother during the 2008 financial crisis."
"I saw one, and he said if I gave him $25,000 he would clear me for flight, but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.	What are some things that you have seen that you would like to see done by the astronauts?"
"I am obsessive about being ready for anything	Me too. If not now, when will it happen?"
"I don't know.  I just see stuff in the grocery store and think I like that food and buy it because it is on sale.  Even if I already have it!	I got your point. I think it is just so much healthier if you get it fresh."
"My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer.	That's a pretty awesome shark to own. I would love to have one of those."
"She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.	So kind of you. How's daughter in-law?"
"It was swallowed whole, unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't have it, and neither will I.	I forgot about plans that I had made with my mother over the weekend.	That's a tricky situation. Do you have to rush and do them in a tight space?"
"I called her right up and we rescheduled! I felt so bad though.	oh god! I would have freaked out!! that is the worst when you don't know what to do! I'm sorry! I hope it work out for you guys"
"I was talking to a British friend of mine and trying to explain why our president feels compelled to tweet	how was your friend with you? is he a normal person or a madman?"
"They think someone needs to take his phone away	No, it's ok. don't be so hard."
"I was looking through the attic and found a box of childhood toys. They brought back so many memories!	That's wonderful that you were able to share that. So many times I wish I had toys to play with."
"It was nice to find them all and think back to those simpler times	I am sure that is a wonderful memory."
"The last trip I took to Chicago was by plane.	Oh that sounds exciting. How was it?"
"I had! I love chicago.  The flight is nice and short too, though I wasn't feeling well.	oh, congrats"
"I think my electrolytes were off, I actually fainted on the plane and they made a whole to-do about it.	My university is posting live stream of students moving in and I was reminiscing about when I studied abroad in college	oh yeah that's always fun. where did you go?"
"I studied in Venice Italy and travelled all over Europe	I bet that was fun, so happy for you!"
"I won a storage shed auction last Monday and found my grandmother's old glass eye in a steamer trunk inside of the shed. Really reminded me of her and how much I miss her.	Glass eyes can be forever. Well, it's a memory we get to cherish but remember hopefully for the next time we need to ""give and take"""
"Rita May. She used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon. Those were such good times.	I met my husband years ago, we were together for 6 years. I still remember her popping out of her socket to get a laugh while she got drunk."
"I'm pretty excited for the upcoming Halloween season.	I love Halloween! What is your favorite part?"
"Well In September, Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events, after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.	That sounds awesome! I can't wait to go to Universal with my friends."
"I was loyal to the same company for 10 years.	That's good. You must have a good job."
"Nice. I wasn't rewarded though. They laid me off.	Oh wow that's awful, sorry to hear that."
"I told a lie to my mother.	How did you tell it?"
"I was about school. And I eventually confessed.	Dang that is a strong move, especially coming from you. But I bet it worked out good for you in the end!"
"I got a job after a long period of unemployment.	That's good to hear! What made you qualified?"
"Yes. I was very happy to be gainfully employed.	I hope things stay that way for you. It's good to know that even the most challenging of situations can be made bearable if you're willing to work hard."
"I was in a car accident. Both cars were totaled.	That is awful. I hope one of you is okay."
"They were running from the police. It was nerve rattling.	That is scary. I would have been running from the police, too."
"So my family surprised me this year with a party for my birthday.	wow, how amazing are they that you are so accepting of them."
"They got me the new shoes I've been wanting. I was so elated and had such a good time!	That is so nice!"
"I had a job interview. The guy really knew his stuff.	that is amazing! you will build a career with that!"
"Yes, really smart and easy to talk to.	It's nice to have someone you can trust with your life's energy."
"I don't know yet.	Our power went off the other night. We were without it until morning!	Oh no! How much longer until it turns back on?"
"Someone crashed into the power line I think. It was so quiet and felt pretty spooky.	haha i bet that is not just a random power out, i am afraid that is actually the sound that scared you the most"
"I bought a raffle ticket for a charity where I have a 1/500 chance of winning a car	Oh, a chance to win a car? What for?"
"Yes.  They were $100 but they only sell 500 tickets.  And the money raised goes to breast cancer research	Wow! That's ridiculous! If i were you my response would be the same as yours. No one should have to depend on a ticket company for their money"
"jumpfortherose.com	Someone helped me move.	That's great to hear!"
"Yes, and I paid them with beer. I was thankful because I had a toe injury.	That is a blessing. Did they offer you any sort of compensation?"
"I bought a powerball ticket last week but did not win	That sucks. I hope you will win next time."
"I would have bought a new car and a house perhaps.  But I lost :-(	I'm sorry, what happened?"
"Yes.  Maybe next time I will win!	I spent Saturday night playing Lord of the Rings Online.	That is a very good game indeed!"
"It is good, but I sometimes wonder if I'm trading real life for a fantasy world.	I know, it is hard to make the transition from one to the other, only to discover that the real world is fake."
"I am so mad that our politicians won't do something to stop Russian hacking	I don't think that's a good thing. Why don't they do something to stop Russia?"
"Yes.  The Republicans just don't seem to care about our country any more and I am so mad that Putin owns Trump	Yeah, I agree. The country is so messed up and the Democrats only care about themselves and keep the country bad."
"My goldfish died.	oh when did that happen?"
"For 4 years. I'm bummed.	That's really good though"
"Not yet.	I had an unprofessional job interview.	Really? How did that happen?"
"The receptionist ignored me, and my interviewer was not prepared.	ohh i am sorry to hear that. how did they waste your time?"
"My computer crashed while I was working on a project.	That's terrible. I hope you didn't lose anything important."
"I did. I hadn't saved, and I forgot to set up autosave. It was very frustrating.	Thats terrible! I hate it when that happens. Did you get it fixed for free through warranty or anything?"
"My favorite team blew a big lead in the playoffs. It was like drinking sour milk.	oh no. that is terrible. your team sucks."
"I hate when teams choke. It makes me sick.	LOLANS! LETS CHEER THE BLOCK!!"
"I woke up this morning and my eye is itchy and my right eyelid is drooping	ouch, do you apply eye drops?"
"yeah I am going to see what it seems like tomorrow - not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what	I hope it is not too bad. I have a feeling I will be feeling better the next day or two."
"Yeah I will if it does not get better quickly	Me and my family went to see a magic show for the first time today.	I have never seen a magic show myself. Did you have fun?"
"I didn't catch his name, but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat. Classic trick, but I'll never forget it!	I love tricks like that! Did the rabbit climb up the tree?"
"I have a job interview tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it.	Great, I hope you do well."
"Yes. It seems like a great opportunity.	Are you going to U.Va. or Virginia Tech?"
"I scored well on an aptitude test.	That's great. How did you do?"
"I had a few drinks. I felt good.	Excellent! Such a shame to not get out and have a good time."
"So today my mother brought over a whole week of meals to help me out.	awwww! did she get everything right?"
"Yes, she's always helping me out! I am so thankful for her she's an amazing mother.	Aw, you guys sound like a good bunch, nothing better!"
"So I moved away from my parents not too long ago. It's been a big change.	Very interesting. How has it been going?"
"Out of state. I'm by myself now, so it's pretty quiet! I miss them a lot.	That's really sad. At least you can keep in touch with them through e-mails and facebook"
"My oldest child needed braces but her health insurance wouldn't cover the expense. It was close to 4000 dollars and we did not have that kind of money at the time.	40000? That's a lot of money. Did you call her?"
"Yes they do. My aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn't has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help.	That's so nice of her. It's good you have family that can help out, especially if it's just temporarily."
"I was sitting on the couch after a long day taking care of work and all the mommy stuff the other day.	Was it load of stuff or just drying?"
"It was! My family was happy and together. Chatting and watching tv. Everything just felt right.	it's always nice to get the feeling that everything is just fine. even if its just a temporary feeling."
"My husband used to work out of town in a different state Sunday through Thursday.	That sounds like fun, what did he look like?"
"Yeah, he does work hard. Even thought my children were with me and we kept our usual routines, I was miserable when he was gone. I would cry after he left every Sunday. Luckily now, he has a job where he is home everyday by supper time.	That's the best thing that could have happened to you!"
"We really are, he brings out the best in me.	I didn't have a car to get to and from work, so my parents actually let me just keep theirs for a bit!	that's amazing of them! My sister has her own car too and I am sure it is more than satisfactory!"
"Yeah it was so giving of them to leave it to me for so long and helped me a ton!	I am very grateful for my coworkers that still give a damn"
"While driving today I went past my grandma's old house. She passed last year.	i miss my grandma"
"Oh for sure. Good feelings, but I also miss her so much.	I know the feeling. Things were going well with my sister until recently."
"I went outside to get my paper this morning. Someone had ran over my mailbox!	Oh man! That's really unpleasant."
"No, it's completely demolished! I'm feeling pretty annoyed.	oh, well thatjas embarrassing jest. I am more than a little surprised"
"My sister is a journalist and she got her first big story published in the paper today!	Congratulations on that, that is a big accomplishment!"
"It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her.	I am sure she has a lot of work to do but I'm sure she'll make it!"
"So my partner gave me the biggest surprise this week.	What was it?"
"He got us a trip to Hawaii! I couldn't believe it, I am so elated!	Sounds like a lot of fun! I hope you guys have a lot of healing and peace of mind during your trip!"
"I finally went and adopted a cat last month and go way more than I expected!	Oh, what a wonderful surprise. I love cats, but I'm thinking about getting a dog. What kind would you recommend?"
"Well it was only supposed to be her, but we found out she was pregnant! She popped out a whole litter of adorable.	Litter or chick? I'm sorry to hear that you didn't get to see those little ones!"
"I had to leave town last week and that meant leaving my pets who are my babies. I needed someone who could take care of them properly.	That is sad. You will have another place to go eventually. What kind of animals?"
"It is very hard! The only one who I'd let do it was my sister and she did an amazing job.	Ah, so it was her fault then? (I hope)"
"So I finally decided to take my dog for his first dog park visit.	oh, that sounds fun, what did you guys see? I assume your dog was happy, a lot of people love dogs"
"It's hard to tell! He refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play.	That sounds quite scary! I'm so sorry you had to see that."
"Im embarrassed to admit I forgot to pick up my brother from worth the other day after agreeing to	Oh no! how did that make you feel?"
"Ha ha, he was a little miffed. He got over it though when I stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! I felt like such a jerk.	hahaha well glad it wasn't you"
"I finally took the plunge and decided to go back to school this year.	That's great! I took a year off after my sophomore year and now I am a teacher. It's paying off after all :)"
"I start next week! I was super hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I'm making myself do it.	it's so rewarding to see your hard work pay off i think!"
"I was going through some stuff and found a box of jewelry my grandparents had gifted me through the years.	That is wonderful! What type of jewelry? I bet you were happy about that!"
"Yeah, it really made me think of them and old times.	Of course. I love those sorts of memories."
"I recently had a shop fix my car. They worked so fast!	Oh man! So frustrating. You need some good mechanics to work for you."
"I was able to go home, but I realize now that I didn't even have to	I'm so sorry! I know that would be such a relief."
"My husband is going through the process of quitting smoking on top of dealing with drama from his parents. He is having a hard time.	Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of work."
"They aren't being supportive at all, but that's not surprising, that don't support him very well in anything. I just wish I could make it better for him, but I can't	That's very true. There's no choice but to work with your family."
"I have some great friends. One of them drove me to the airport tomorrow	What a nice surprise! Did you ask him where he went?"
"Yes I am, they are great	What do you like about them?"
"We just found out the person working in our accounting department has been stealing money from our company for years.	That's terrible, they should be in jail."
"Yes, it just makes me sick to my stomach. You think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind. I don't get some people	I don't know what you are talking about. I have known a few people who have had that happen and just had to move on."
"I miss high school. My girlfriend was the best	I bet you were. I was in high school when I first met you. I wish I could go back to be with you."
"That's great. College was also fun	Definitely, I had a blast doing it."
"I recently bid farewell to a good friend. I miss her	How long has it been?"
"Thank you, that means a lot. I will see her again	When you meet again, always try to reciprocate"
"I lost my car keys. I'm such a fool!	That would be terrible. Did you find them?"
"That's pretty funny, and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!	I am sure it will be fine. The same goes for your wallet."
"I came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over. I've only seen him with a friend over once in my 3.5 years of living here.	So your roommate is somewhat of a friend to him. And your best friend is a bit jealous of his friendship with yours. lol"
"Yeah I sure was, he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.	Yeah, you just have to go in and out as you please."
"One of my co-worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor. It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor.	oh thats awful, hameed you if you didnt cooperate"
"Yeah I figured it was, so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.	That's good. Sometimes bad things happen when managers are lazy."
"Man there aren't many people I would give my last couple hundred dollars to, with one notable exception.	Yeah, that's an unusual thing to say. What are you exception?"
"My buddy Stefan. He used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters. We sold them and netted $2000 a piece!	That's a lot of money! Well, it's good you got them for when you play your concerts again!"
"I finished first in a race. I feel like gold	A true silver lining to a bad year."
"Yes! It was my first victory. All my hard work is paying off	That's great! I bet you are so proud."
"Some of my friends told me that they had a big surprise for me. They know I hate surprises, but I complied and let the blindfold me and drive me out to the location.	Oh, so you trust them with your life information, etc. That is very trusting."
"They had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together. It was a flying lesson at the local airport.	Amen. No one can teach flying. You deserve the present you received."
"I found an old photo album at my grandma's house that had pictures of me when I was a kid	oh thats wonderful.. it always makes me feel nostalgic"
"Yeah, it did. I really miss the 90s. Everything seemed a lot simpler in those days	do you still hang out with some of the same friends?"
"When I was in middle school, I had a friend come over to ride horses with me. After riding my mother pressured me to get on a horse bareback I wasn't comfortable riding. She made such a big scene that I got on to make her stop.	Oh my, did you ever give it a go?"
"Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents, it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.	I am sure it was embarrassing but I am very glad it ended well for you."
"My friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him, but I haven't been rollerblading since I was a little kid. I didn't want to roll into a car.	Oh you don't want to roll into a car then? That's awful, I hope you can find something else to do while you're away!"
"We went, but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.	Dang.. That sounds awful. I hope you was able to get some privacy to be fine."
"My husband is on the road a lot, I hardley ever see him.	Oh, that hard. I bet your heart is racing. Is he alright?"
"Yes, its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.	I suppose going it alone is never going to be enough. You need to let your partner know how you feel so that they can go from strength to strength in your relationship."
"I have an interview for a job that I don't feel qualified for	I'm sorry you are feeling uncertain in the interview. Do you have a positive attitude about it?"
"I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard	I am glad you have a positive attitude."
"I'm moving in a few months to a new state, I'm starting to feel nervous.	I'm sure you'll be fine. It's been said that moving into a new place is a major life event."
"To my husband hometown so it'll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family.	That's wonderful! Do you love your hometown?"
"I saw a dog get hit by car today on the highway.	poor dog, did he survive the impact?"
"It was pretty tramatic, I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No, I was on my way to work, I couldn't stop :(	That will be fun to watch, I am glad it is over for you!"
"I can't even begin to tell you how nervous I was about my first tattoo.	Why? What did you decide to do?"
"Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood, and my pain threshold was low at the time. It turned out great though, and now I have several!	What inspired you to get another?"
"I love my husband! He has been so sweet this week!	That's awesome to hear! There's nothing like a true love match- you'll always be thankful for that!"
"He knew I had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and Taco Bell! It's the little things :)	Sounds like your dad is a great dad! lol"
"It's been a great week!	That's really great. What has been great?"
"I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting!	Congrats! What did you do?"
"Music is a powerful thing. Sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place. You know what I mean?	It can transports me too! What kind of music do you like?"
"Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.	i can almost hear your heart racing am i dreaming it upright"
"I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories.	I love stuffed animals, I could never get my hands on a real rabbit. what fun!"
"Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.	A lot of people don't respond well to airsickness. I know I'm not."
"My dog got hit by a car.	Oh god! Poor doggy! Hope you're hanging in there!"
"He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.	im sorry :( what happened?"
"Some random guy was in my backyard, I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.	That is such a bummer!"
"Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first.	Yeah I would've been pretty furious as well."
"My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.	Ohh good, what happened to him?"
"My siblings and I are managing, and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.	I'm glad you've found time to grieve. I hope your mother has passed away peacefully."
"I've got a week off from work. Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.	Video games is my escape!"
"I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time	I haven't seen it in years. Maybe I should give it a try."
"I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.	I'm glad you made it back home."
"That is what I was thinking at the time, but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.	I am sorry to hear that. Maybe try your luck at an intern or temp agency?"
"I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.	Oh, I am sorry to hear that! That must have been embarrassing. Can it be replaced?"
"It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.	im sorry to hear that. you should get it patched up instantly"
"My boyfriend is sick. He can't eat much so I made some soup for him	oh its so hard to go through that long, i just know that he will get better, i wish you the best of luck, soup or alone"
"I made chicken noodle soup.	i love noodle soups it was so good"
"I had a meeting last week where I gave a presentation over the wrong documentation and no one said anything until after the meeting.	That's frustrating. Are you trying to get the blame?"
"After I figured out what I did, I sure was. Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.	That's pretty neat. You're lucky."
"I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend.	Do you feel confident?"
"It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.	That sounds exciting. I hope you do well in front of the board."
"I caught my boyfriend texting his ex	oh no! did you confront him about it?"
"It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her	I know how you feel. The way a dog feels about his owner."
"I know I broke up with my ex, but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.	I know it sucks when someone talks about going on dates, but it's good they let you make your own decisions! That's all we really are as a community. My ex would never do that!"
"We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial, i think he does too.	That's sounds great, I'm glad you have a good relationship with him."
"I can't wait to see my final grades. I think I got all A's this semester.	Wow you sure did well. you must have studied really hard."
"On Monday. I'm going to treat myself if I did well	I hope you did well. What are you most excited about?"
"I was very upset when I found my kitten today.	Oh no! Did it die?"
"No, I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.	The owner of the dog knows what he's doing. I hope the owner takes responsibility for the dog."
"I cried a bit, but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out.	I enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion.	That is kind of you. How long do you visit?"
"Not really, I take my daughter to see them, so many of them have no visitors at all.	Ah, I take mine too. They're always down to visit."
"She likes to bake, so we take them what she makes :)	I will have to try one of her recipes. My kids are always asking for cookie dough adapted to the most diet perishable food."
"She is pretty good for an eleven year old, better than I was.	She is pretty talented too. I am sure she will keep getting better."
"I had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her, as well as get off my chest. I know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her.	That's good it worked out well dear, I hope you have many more years of happy memories to come!"
"Yes, I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!	Good you should be feeling so grateful."
"My son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us. I was anxious and nervous waiting to see if he was accepted!	I can imagine. Its great that you were patient."
"He did! He's in his 3rd year, going to be an Aerospace Engineer, so we are very proud of him.	That's incredible! What is he going to be doing in Aerospace?"
"My sister passed away several years ago. She took her life, and my mother and I found her right after she did it. This was very painful, traumatic and hard for us all.	Sorry to hear that. I have lost both my parents, so I know the pain of a loved one going through something like that."
"It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile, she was in denial. But, it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile, as she was my only sibling and we were very close.	I know how that feels, I lost both of my parents in one fell swoop. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, its not easy. I'm glad you're holding on."
"When my son first started college, I felt so much love and affection, but it was definitely hard to see him go! I was very proud though.	I know that feeling for sure. It is hard to see people you love go, but it is even harder to support them."
"He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's focused on science, engineering, etc. He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer. It's great to see him go for his dreams!	That's amazing, congratulations"
"We went on vacation a few weeks ago and went to the beach, It was so relaxing and great. I really enjoyed the time with my family.	That sounds so nice! You must have enjoyed being with your family. Do you like going on vacations?"
"That's great! I'm sure you earned it, just like we do. It's so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!	Yea, you're right. Now you have some alone time to recharge and recharge your brain. Sounds like it!"
"I am looking forward to next week! My husband has been out of town on business for several weeks and comes home next weekend!	What does he do?"
"I am going to cook a special meal and see if he wants to go out, just us two. I know he will like that.	That's great. You're a great mom and dad team!"
"My husband has been out of town a few weeks for work but is coming back next weekend. I have a surprise night planned for just us. I am optimistic and sure he will really enjoy it.	Do you love him not being away from you?"
"Thanks! We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.	Marriage is such a hard thing but so rewarding!"
"My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!	Oh I can just imagine that! I haven't been in 6 weeks! I feel the same way. I didn't go to college until I was 17!"
"Yes, very. But, time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!	He will have much older Sr. knowing what he went through. Not to mention the many memories little Michael will have with his father through his memories. Such as playing together, watching movies and games and more"
"I was promoted to a Team Leader and I felt very secure I could do well at the job. I had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role.	That's great! Congrats! I'm sure you'll be a great manager and lead your team to success!"
"Yes, thank you! I had worked very hard through the years, and I felt that I earned it, and would do well at it.	Very true. You should be proud of yourself."
"There was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him. I was so mad, beyond angry!	What did you do?"
"Yes, and she had two children of her own, similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle, that made her mad! Can you believe that??	Ouch that's not something I would ever try to do! I can see how that can be frustrating though!"
"Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.	I bet that was so exciting for her! But I am sure you were worried the whole week, too!"
"It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing.	I'm sorry, I would've yelled at her."
"I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!	It's okay if you're not good the first time. Everyone make mistakes! Take it as a lesson and keep your head up! Maybe next time!"
"I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.	At least the planning was fun. It's always good to get out and about."
"One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me, while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!	Wow! Did you tell your friend?"
"I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....	Oh, thats sweet. I had one of those. She was my first girlfriend as a teen. Did you two ever cheat on it?"
"The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.	Did you get scared?"
"No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.	haha police is the last resort"
"I was trying to ignore the fact that my 50th birthday was coming up but my family decided to throw me a surprise party.	Well, that's really fun of them. You probably needed that as a reminder that you are old."
"It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more	Oh you are aware that it can be a happy time? Sometimes we have happy phases where we aren't responsible for other people's happiness."
"A few weeks ago, my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things, and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.	tomorrow is a better day than any other but remember that we are all human and have flaws"
"Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later.	I probably should be nicer though, to at least be courteous."
"One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.	Ugh I would be scared as well, I'm sure you had your alarm on full blast."
"Yes, and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But, luckily, it turned out to be my shadow!	Yeah, I hope you weren't hurt! Shadowing someone is hard!"
"There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	Its hard to give in those times, I was scared you would have to sleep on the street"
"Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it.	Its ok, you arent alone"
"When my children were born, it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.	Aww, you must have a very happy wife and a happy life with them! That's sweet and wonderful."
"Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.	That is really special. I am also expecting a boy, although we don't know for sure. We just know that he is going to be a wonderful addition to the family!"
"I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.	It must have felt very lonely. I am glad you are happy now."
"Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.	Yes, that is very true. There are some pretty good people on this planet though and I am one of them."
"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!	I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.	How come? Was it scary new?"
"Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.	I see, I hope it isn't too bad!"
"I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.	Why did you join a group?"
"It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them	It's wonderful to have their love!"
"A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!	I never think about those things so my best guess is you just didn't study hard enough?"
"I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!	It must have been a nerve-wracking moment. I'm glad you're fine!"
"Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!	I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	Oh, what a lovely thing to do. What did you find?"
"It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?	Must feel more precious"
"That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!	I am so happy for your loss. I lost my Grandma too when she was in her forties. I still remember the pains of her passing."
"I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.	I would assume so since nothing like that has ever happened to me. That is great news."
"When I was entering the store it was really slippery.	Hopefully you were not hurt"
"It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.	That falling objects are so annoying and hard to deal with."
"I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.	I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.	Why is that?"
"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	Oh okay. I see. Well I hope it isn't too painful for her and that you both make friends again soon!"
"Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.	I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.	Oh? That sounds like a lot of work! Do you feel any different than usual?"
"I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.	Ah, that is funny. Lead's are easy to snatch back."
"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	So how does she do it? Does she drive?"
"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	That's a nice surprise! She sounds very lucky."
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	That's good that you are confident, she will be a lot braver."
"I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!	That's awesome. I do the salsa when I'm not studying so I can get a scholarship in the future."
"My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on in there?"
"I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*	*chuckle* I guess that's a pretty good way to think about it, even if it's probably stressful."
"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	is it in a nice area?"
"We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.	You are most likely referring to your brother's share. In my family, it's quite common for the older brothers to be the breadwinners in the family and so the need for help is more important."
"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	That's really good that you can heal so easily. It's hard to find that kind of a relationship."
"Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)	That's good that you don't copycats. I wish more people would be honest when it comes to relationships."
"My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.	That's great. Aerospace is a pretty tough field."
"I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!	That is so great! That sounds like a lot of talent!"
"Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.	Oh wow, I'm so sorry to hear that! I hope you're prepared!"
"I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.	Sounds like a great plan."
"I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.	Sorry about that. My condolences to your Grandma."
"Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.	I'm sorry you had to go through that. At least you have your parents to lean on."
"Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!	Yup, I was shocked too...until I took all the state and took care of them"
"She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!	That's so unfortunate! I'm really sorry."
"I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before	Awesome! What kind are you getting?"
"I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.	That's a lot of Halo. I've played a fair bit of other games too, but Halo has always been my favorite."
"My father passed away 2 years ago, but my mother lives in my neighborhood now. I'm so thankful she lives close by and still here with us. She's such a wonderful mother.	Aww, that's sad. Do you have a mom to lean on now?"
"I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.	I think its even harder when you are that young and don't understand the attachment more. Im sure you feel much better now that you hear this."
"I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!	You are lucky! They are gonna have a party for the weekend. You can watch football or soccer or basketball or soccer lol"
"The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...	It's a difficult situation. You wouldn't want to live in that house anyway."
"Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!	My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it	aww that is awesome! i have not come over in ages"
"We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor	That's great, I love to listen to podcasts."
"I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten, with no collar, in a window well.	That is so sweet and kind of you to help such a difficult situation."
"We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!	That's amazing. Formula is the best when it comes to puppies. We just got a new Labrador Retriever, he's loving it so far too!"
"I felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself	what did you do?"
"I did not, I was little but I think I put it back into a tree	That is so selfish of you."
"Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving	What made you waiting?"
"Yep, had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out	online or off?"
"I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!	Oh no! I'm so sorry. Do you feel embarassed?"
"I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :(	OH. I bet you felt bad. Did you ask her to forget it?"
"You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???	I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party, not my greatest moment	Oh lol. Well I am sure it was ok. Sometimes we wear pajamas to parties because we don't want to expose ourselves or because we don't want to wait for our turns."
"I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret	Yea! Have fun!"
"I had some trippy nightmares as a kid, now I don't really have dreams	That's pretty terrible. Is there any way you can talk to someone about it?"
"Yeah, it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me, pretty weird	I would defenitly faint. I am just a little nervous."
"I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards	Yeah. I had no idea. Poor kid deserves better."
"No, I was scared to get charged, but I stopped after that	Ah, I see. I know that feeling now. How scary that could be!"
"I was at a meditation retreat last year for 10 days and I can say that I experienced a better feeling there than I could ever remembe	Thats so good, so peaceful and meditative."
"Yeah, thankfully there's an app for that - Headspace (no I am not sponsored)	Ability to socialize and get to new clubs and events is something I have always wanted. I hope to get to like 20 clubs in 2 years."
"I am really looking forward to going away for the holidays.	that is great. Are you going alone?"
"I want to go see the Harry Potter land at Universal, the kids will love it.	That sounds amazing! Harry Potter is my favorite author and I've always wanted to go to Japan."
"They love the films, plus getting to ride Hogwarts Express, score!	I'm really hoping my acceptance letter shows up in the mail soon.	Oh I hope so too! I wish I could see it."
"Law School, I'm pretty sure I got in to my first choice, but you never know.	I hope you did get in, that is a great accomplishment!"
"Thank you, fingers are crossed.	I just ordered a new cookery book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. I want to delve in and try lots of new recipes!	That's exciting! I imagine that will take some time, so you can enjoy the book in moderation."
"I'm vegetarian and cook all sorts of different cuisines - Indian, Italian, American. The only cuisine I'm not good at is Chinese. How about you?	Very cool, I've always wanted to get into cooking just for the heck of it. Congrats! I think I might be on to something with my passion for music - acoustic guitars and all - I think i might like it.."
"Have you heard of Mark Bittman's book How to Cook Everything Vegetarian? That's the book I'm waiting impatiently for!	I witnessed the most epic bottle flip in the history of bottle flips at my school	how exciting! did you get in on the action?"
"Yee yee, it landed on this little ledge that was super high up.	That's funny, I'd say. Still, an awesome game to play!"
"My little grandson just came home from the hospital. He was born premature and weighted under 2 pounds.	I'm so sorry to hear that. I know the feeling when your babies are that small"
"He is doing well, thank you. And we are so thankful everything is ok. It was touch and go for awhile	It's good to hear that he's doing well. Keep his spirits up!"
"I love my girlfriend. She would never cheat on me	You sound like a good guy. How long have you been together?"
"I hope to make her my wife some day!	How long ago did this happen?"
"My sister spilled some milk on me. It set me off!	Aww, that's mean! Did you respond by spraying her with Lysine?"
"It was indeed a mistake. My clothes are fine now.	Thats a good thing. How did you get it wrong?"
"I recently did not pay my rent. My land lord has been terrible at providing services	How did he punish you?"
"He decided to start caring and doing his part.	That is great to hear! I'm sure it will be a great support system as he gets older."
"I'm thankful that I was able to repair my tire before it went flat on my car	I can see that. Sometimes it takes time."
"Right, I caught it just as it happened and brought it to the shop, didn't cost as much as I thought it would either.	Well glad it wasn't too expensive!"
"I love my friend. She just drove me to class	What is it about your friend that makes you love her so much?"
"I think I am getting her a gift soon!	I wish you all the best with that!"
"I stole from my friends when I was a child. I feel terrible about it now	Why did you steal things from them?"
"It was some Pokemon cards!	those are really fun to play with"
"My father almost passed away last year. It was very tough on everyone	Sorry to hear that. Do you have to visit him often?"
"Yes, he has made a full recovery! It's been a journey	I am glad to hear that! It's a difficult thing to recover from, so sorry to hear that."
"I remember when I was a young one. I loved life.	i do too"
"I do, but maybe not with he same flare as before	Maybe not, maybe you can have a word of advice for each other."
"I helped find my friend's cats. She's glad they're back now	That was nice of you! I bet the cats are much appreciated now by you"
"Yes they both just wandered off when the door was open!	Oh no! I hope you find them, and don't let frustration rule your life."
"5	5"
"I recently got an A on my paper. I feel great.	Thats always a good feeling! mine went in May. Did you get a B?"
"I went swimming recently. I lost my trunks walking out of the pool.	Was it not necessary to towel beach."
"Yeah, we all have a good laugh about it now	Yeah, and that's the best way to make someone feel at ease."
"Drinking a gallon of milk in a day wasn't a good idea	xaaah it feels so good just before bed!!"
"I wanted to see how hard it would be, turns out my stomach was JUST big enough	LOL! Well I bet most people would pass out from that size stomach!"
"My friend slept with a girl I like. I feel horrible now	That's a bit terrible. Did she confess to you?"
"No, but I don't think he is my friend any more	oh sorry to hear that then"
"I don't like working with managers that try to micro-manage me	Yes, it is frustrating trying to be with people that try to micromanage you."
"Right, it kind of feels like they're insecure with their abilities while trying to make me feel bad at the same time	You both will learn to battle it together."
"Teeth are weird, but also take a lot of upkeep which is sometimes irritating	I know, I have had trouble with that as well. Sometimes I even have to get braces on my own to help!"
"Yeah that's what my dentist says, I'll try	Dentists aren't too bad, is she able to fix it?"
"I wake up with chills sometimes for no reason	Sometimes it just means something really bad happened to you."
"I think it's from dreams that I'm not able to recall	that can be scary?"
"I wasn't able to reach my goals in the gym a couple days ago, and it helped me realize where I'm slacking off in other areas	Oh I am sorry! That is never fun. I have had that happen before. Are you doing it because you are a gym rat or because of something you've done in the past?"
"Yeah, it's fun to see how much you can conquer yourself, and it's nice to be able to see how you're changing	Yes, definitely! Thank you for your advice. I really need to try to improve my LSATs."
"I recently went skydiving. It was a thrilling rush	Wow! That sounds like something I would like to do as well. You should be great!"
"It was excellent. I feel so alive!	Yeah it's like you found a new friend."
"I think I will have success in my life. I love life these days!	You should be proud of that"
"I recently finished a new album I have been working on!	Oh that's awesome! What is the name of the album?"
"I'm excited to think of all the possibilities that are available to me at the moment	Sounds like you have a lot of possibilities. There's a lot of unknown ahead."
"Being able to learn basically anything with the internet for one	Yeah now I feel bad for you. You tried your best but the internet was not designed for that."
"I like meditating because it puts things into perspective in a way that I don't usually expect	It is calming to think about it. I am not a fan of stress."
"For sure, my mind is pretty energetic	I am sure it is, but it makes it hard to keep your cool when it is flying around."
"I've been processing what being lonely feels like, because I want to be able to have fun by myself sometimes	Yea being alone is fun, I am sorry you are going through this."
"True, and I've felt that way before, but sometimes like a wave of those kinds of feelings hits like I'm not worthy enough and stuff like that, but it's all good	At least you were loyal to your friends."
"I'm trying to get over my need to control things, and I find if I just let things happen it feels like a weights been pulled off my shoulders	Over your control eh - I feel that way sometimes in life. But you'll come to learn to accept it."
"Right, but things always seem to turn out for the best anyway	Exactly"
"I grew up pretty skinny and now that I've grown some muscle I feel a lot more comfortable in my skin	Wow I am so glad to hear that. It's all about feeling comfortable!"
"around 9 months, been pretty slow to make progress but overall it's been solid	That's really good news. I'm glad to hear that you're getting the support you need to get you on the road to recovery."
"I am going to go camping tomorrow! The back's already packed	Oh nice! What are you going to do?"
"I hope not. I'm in Florida so it might get bad	I'm sure it will, just stay safe!"
"My old house burned down, and I went to check it out, was surreal taking a look around the place	Wow that does sound horrifying. I could imagine how you felt when you found out what happened."
"Yeah, it was built a long time ago, some kind of electrical fire	I guess that means it is brand new again. Hope you feel better."
"I was truly surprised when I notice my tire got hit by a rock, thought I wouldn't make it to the tire place in time	thats amazing, how lucky! Did any of your stuff get damaged?"
"It did not, got it replaced when I dropped it off, pretty lucky	You should buy some new carpet."
"There was a cat who had string stuck around it so I had to help	Oh no! That sounds terrible."
"Yeah, everything turned out fine in the end	Everything but the knife.....that would have been a very dangerous situation."
"I feel like deepening my connection to God is the most important thing in my life	I don't have a lot of connection to God other than my family and my pastor. Have you ever had a confession about your lack of Godness?"
"It's like if I don't get that sorted out I won't be able to live a fulfilling life	What are some things that are not sorted out?"
"When I can't take a breather in the day I feel suffocated	That's the worst, how do you calm yourself down?"
"Right, it's like I can't focus or relax	wine more enjoyable when you are able to relax"
"When I was in elementary school I was envious of the kids who were popular!	What was the name of the game?"
"Yeah, I just had trouble socializing is all	It gets easier as you get older. I'm glad you're learning. That makes you resilient."
"When I do things that are challenging I feel more self-reliant. I recently tried taking an ice bath	It must have been very difficult for you. But I think you got the hang of it."
"Yeah, my bath wasn't deep enough, so I didn't get covered all the way!	that's too bad. i think the dirt will get all the shine from the bright lights"
"I'm eating a lot of food to make sure I can lift more weight in the gym next time!	That's a smart move! I bet you will be ready to go with the plan shortly."
