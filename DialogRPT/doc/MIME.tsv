"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you do not have to deal with that ."

"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	that is a good thing to do . i am sure you will do great ."

"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	that is awesome ! how old is your son ?"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	that is awesome . i bet that is a fun time ."
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	that is so sweet of you . what did you do ?"
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	that is so sweet . i am sure he will be fine ."

"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	i am sorry to hear that . what happened ?"

"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	that is so nice ! i hope you guys have a great time !"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	i am sorry to hear that . what happened ?"
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you get it ."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	i am sorry to hear that . i am sorry to hear that ."
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you get it ."

"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	that is great ! i am sure you will do great !"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	that is great ! i hope you get it !"

Just glad to be alive!	i am sorry to hear that . i hope he was able to do that ."

No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	i am sorry to hear that . what kind of dog was it ?"

"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you have a great time !"
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you have a good relationship"

"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you have a good time !"
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	that sounds like fun !"
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	i am sorry to hear that . i hope you have a good time ."

"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	i am sure he will be fine ."
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	that is good , i am glad you are okay !"
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	that is a good thing to do . i am sure he will be fine ."

"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	that is great ! how long have you been together ?"
