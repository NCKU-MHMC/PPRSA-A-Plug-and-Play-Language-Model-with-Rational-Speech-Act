"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.	I am sure that must have been very frightening."
"No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.	That was terrible! I hope you didn't have to go to jail for that!"
"I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.	Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places	ye i went to school with a girl from my home"
"Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?	I am fine, I just got home from work and I saw the drunk driver driving away. I was walking home with my dog. I was looking up and I saw a car that was driving very slowly and I thought it was a taxi. I got to the taxi stop and I saw another car coming towards me and I was running away when a taxi stopped and I got into it and the taxi driver called the drunk guy over and he gave him his license number. I hope that the drunk"
"I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together	That sucks. What happened?  Did you guys fight about something?"
"Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world	That sucks, what happened? Did they break up with you?"
"I couldn't wait to go to the concert.	That sounds like fun! What kind concert was it?"
"The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!	oh wow! thats a bargin price to pay for tickets!"
"I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors	That's a terrible reason for a baby girl to die. I'm so sad that she died like that."
"she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying	That is terrible.  I wish that was not the way it was.  I had a premature son who is still very healthy and the only issue is he has asthma.  He had to be born early and he's never had medication given to him in his whole life."
"yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors	so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up	That sounds so scary! Did he need stitches?"
"i was singing nursery songs :)	That's really nice of you. Did the nurse do anything to treat him?"
"If you happy and you know it :)	my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon	I am so sorry to hear that.  How can you help him?"
"thank you so much!	I know the struggle is real. Hopefully he finds a full-time job soon too"
"he is an armed guard	i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods!	That's so crazy! How badly did he/she hurt them?"
"I do! I want to be able to protect my son	That must have been scary! Did they catch them yet or is it still an open investigation?"
"i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years	That's awesome! Where do they live now?"
"I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry	That's really cool! What did they do while you're away?"
"I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident	I would not do anything like that to a co-worker."
"Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.	That is very interesting how technology has made everything easier, but also more complicated. I don't know if I would have covered the co workers shift. I wouldn't know the right to do. But I know how that can happen."
"Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.	So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer	That's terrible. You could have gotten it cheaper elsewhere."
"Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!	Yeah, it is always like that when you really believe you are getting something for a certain price, then you are getting a different thing"
"Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed	My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!	Yeah, that's the way we should all be."
"I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!	Yeah, sometimes it's better to let people down gently and not to hurt their feelings. But sometimes it is necessary to tell them the hard way.  It's like when you have to let them go, and then come back later with a better offer"
"my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house	Oh my goodness! That sounds lovely! How old are you?"
"i totally agree with you!	Yeah, it can be very peaceful and quiet."
"hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country	That's really tough. Maybe try to join a club or organization?"
"i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms	That sucks. I know what that feels like. I live in the same area and I have to join a group to be friends. I wish you had someone like that."
"I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.	I would have just called the police on him, and also the store he bought the game from.  I think it would be a good idea to get a good insurance policy so that you can replace your game if something like happens in the future.  And maybe you could also consider talking to a lawyer about the possibility."
"Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!	I hate when that happens to kids. I wish I had some advice to share with you about it.  What happened?"
"I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died	I'm sure it won't bite or sting you! I bet it's a bit of gross to look back on now."
"Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy	I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.	that's so sweet of her."
"Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.	I hope they are both doing alright."
"Thank you! That means a lot.	One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.	I have one coming up! I am excited too!"
"Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.	I agree. I feel it's something that people forget."
"Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!	That has happened.  I was at a restaurant the other day and I ordered my meal but my food was missing when I got to the counter to have them fix it for me.  I asked and they said that was just an error in their system and that I would get a new one sent to my address asap.  I got a new meal and I got my money as well.  I was so happy that they finally figured out the problem.  It couldnt have happened"
"Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.	Yeah, that happens a lot. I once had a credit card declined because of a technical glitch that left it on my credit card statement for 4 days after the fact, and I ended up having to pay the whole $500 billate the credit card company for the declined card."
"Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend	I know what that's like. What happened?"
"My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be	it's always nice to see someone through hard times. I hope she gets better."
"Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you	I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.	That makes sense. I've always been one who trusts her intuition."
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.	It is very helpful, especially when dealing with people and animals."
"I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best!	that's so kind of them to throw a surprise."
"I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there	That is really sweet of your mom."
"I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely	That's nice of you to be lonely though, it means you care a lot about your girls' well be!"
"Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes	I understand how you might feel lonely, I've had friends like you before, where everyone else is in relationships but you're not and you're just feeling the loneliness"
"As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.	I love kids that way too, but my 6 month old is still a baby and my 18 year old is still a baby."
"One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!	That's interesting how they turned out."
"The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.	I love Chick-Fill-Up! What was it?"
"Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.	I know right, that's what happens sometimes, you think the craving will be gone but it comes back when you least need it."
"I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family	That's a great story! What orphanage did you visit? I love kids!"
"Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him	that's very cool. what type was it?"
"My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!	i know right! it is so hard when parents don't get along. i had a parent and child relationship conflict and they both ended. it was so hard."
"That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?	You're right though. I've been married to my best friend since 2003. I don't know if I'm ready to let go. I hope it works out. I just don't know if I'm ready to let her in. I'm a 50-year-old man who's been married for 45. I don't think I've ever even kissed another woman before.  I just knew I'd end up breaking up. I just knew I'd end up breaking her"
"But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!	I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.	That's terrible, what happened?"
"Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!	It's never easy to look at the mistakes you've made in the future, but I hope you can forgive yourself for those mistakes. It's easy for others to do the forgiveness, though I hope you can. I'm sorry you had to experience that as a kid though"
"Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.	That's terrible. I'm so sorry for you. I hope she's at peace. I know that she would have wanted you to be there. I'm so glad you were there for her."
"I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.	That's a good thing to hear."
"That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?	That sounds like a great leader."
"That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?	That's the right kind! I'm glad to be a part of it."
"My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!	That sounds so exciting. What happened?"
"It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.	That must have made it tough."
"Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!	Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!	That's awesome! Congratulations! What was that marathon for, if you know!"
"Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!	Yeah! That was one awesome experience! What city was your favorite?"
"We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)	That's great!"
"I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	That's really sad. Did they say something like that to you or do you think they did? What happened?"
"She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.	That's terrible. What happened? Did they say anything like that before they started dating?"
"I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.	I agree.  There has never been as much to fight against as there has been in recent history.  I hope we see more people standing up against bulling behavior."
"How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	It is a good question. I have found that I try to focus my energy on finding solutions.  I try to see things as a problem rather than a solution to the issue at hand."
"Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)	One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.	That's terrible. I'm sorry she's missing her cat."
"She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.	That is very kind of her, I'm sure she will do alright."
"I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!	oh yeah thats so much better than the movies lol"
"Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!	I have never been there."
"California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.	I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.	I bet you enjoyed it."
"We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.	That's great! What kind is he looking at?"
"Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!	That's a really kind thing to do. I've never had my mom's house cleaned and organized. I like that kind of thing. I like my space to myself, but it's nice for my family too"
"Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.	It sounds like you are a neat person. I like how you mention your mom-in law because it is always good to be thankful to those people who care about you."
"I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.	That is weird. I have had people do that. I guess it can be rude."
"It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?	I agree.  I've got to respond to my coworkers every day to keep up.  And sometimes I have to respond to emails.  It can be a lot sometimes when people don't respond to my emails."
"I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.	That is terrible, did they resolve the issue?"
"I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.	That's unfortunate that happened to both you and your sister, I hope that issue will be resolved."
"I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!	That's terrible. What country were they in?"
"From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!	that's nice"
"One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	It is so frustrating when people don't realize their own abilities. It can make you feel inadequate and unconfident."
"That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	That's great that they came out okay. I'm glad you were there to remind them of that."
"Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.	That's a pretty typical husband situation.  You guys need to learn to be honest with each other."
"Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess	I think it is always better to tell him what to do. He can't just let things go and expect them to happen. It would be better if he was happy and you didn't do that to him."
"There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!	Oh my, that's awful. Did he apologize him later?"
"Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us.	That sounds terrible."
"Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.	I have been doing that for years."
"Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?	I'm a little jealous, actually. I wish I could do more. I wish to be healthier, and I wish I had someone who cares to be healthy. I wish for myself to be able to help. I wish for the people I love. But sometimes life's hard, too. Sometimes we just get older, or we get older and healthier, but still. We have to try. And sometimes we just get lucky and healthy! I'm lucky, I think."
"Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.	That is a bitterst feeling. I wish you guys all my happiness and that you can look back on those days with happiness. I miss those days a lot myself."
"Are your kids adults now?	That is so true, I look at my pictures and feel old, but I know that my life was full and I'm so happy for my kids. I'm proud of them.  It's nice that you have pictures from when they were younger, though it reminds of how you used to do things when you were younger too.  I look at my kids all the time, especially the kids!"
"I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!	I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!	Oh, that is awesome! I have a sister and she looks amazing every day of her wedding, and every time. She's a supermodel and supermodeler!"
"I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.	Oh yeah, it was great. I'm sure you will get there eventually. You just have to keep working towards it. I'm sure you're a very capable and beautiful woman!"
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.	That's cool. I have never worked alone before. How did you two meet up?"
"We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.	It's nice. I wish you both the best. I hope your husband finds success."
"I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.	I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected	That's okay, it's okay to still enjoy the relationship even if it's not working as planned."
"Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.	Oh. Well that was awkward."
"I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.	My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!	That is awesome. What are you and the family looking for in the condo"
"We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!	I bet it's nice."
"I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.	I love that word.  What kind was it?  Was it French?"
"Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!	That is a bummer, did she respond quickly enough? I would have left without going back to her house.  What was the plan to go for brunch?"
"Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!	Oh, I bet that was so scary!  Did you call the grocery store police to report him to?"
"Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!	I would have asked the police to come"
"Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.	Yeah I did, what happened?"
"She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!	That is horrible.  I am sorry.  I hope she is okay."
"Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party!	I bet she saw that!  What happened?"
"Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.	Oh my goodness, what happened there. I hope you made it home in the same clothes as your work attire."
"Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?	I did not hear."
"Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT!	It did, I am sorry to hear"
"You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...	Oh, wow! Did you guess? I bet! Did he or her?"
"My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!	that sounds pretty interesting. I bet you guys had some wild times! Did you end up hanging out again?"
"Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!	I'm happy you have gifts from your husband."
"I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!	I love surprises like that.  It shows that you care and want to make an effort to do so much."
"I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!	oh that sucks that happened to me last year"
"This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?	Oh, really good! What kind is the work they're doing here?"
"Did I ever tell you about the time I ""got taken hostage""?	What happened?"
"As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!	That's crazy! What happened after?"
"I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!	That's awful. Did you let him off that easy?"
"I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.	I would feel the way you feel."
"This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!	its normal for a few things to go out of order sometimes"
"Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!	That's the truth! You'd think it's easier to call and ask when things are broken or something, but people don't think that way."
"I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it.	That's terrible! Did you tell your friend?"
"I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.	I feel you, I once told a friend that her boyfriend had made a pass at me and she never told me that her boyfriend was her financial partner and that she loved him."
"I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?	that's cute!"
"Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching	that's funny, I would have done that too"
"THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!	I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!	That sounds amazing! I bet you're really excited!"
"Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.	It should be very nice!"
"I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!	That's a good point. She's so smart and capable."
"That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))	I remember that. You were so proud of her.  What did you do with her money?"
"Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.	Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!	I totally get that.  It can be frustrating."
"Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)	You should have a ""No Store"" sign on your door."
"WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)	I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!	That's really cool! What a lucky day! Did you guys already know?"
"We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.	that must be amazing! i wish you the best."
"Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second	I love being in the ""flow"" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.	That's really interesting. What kind of flow are we talking?"
"I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)	Yeah, I am! It is a very common practice in business meetings and presentations."
"That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!	I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered ""better"".	Yeah! It is.  I had to leave my company recently.  I felt like I left behind my friends and colleagues.  But then I started to think about why they were so happy to leave and it wasn't so bad.  They just didn't like where the money was going and were not happy to keep working.  I am trying to do something similar now."
"It's just too many leaders want ""yes men"" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!	It really makes sense. I donot know why."
"I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)	That was a fun time."
"Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as ""Dot"", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.	That must have been exciting."
"This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt	That's really cool, what happened? Was it your first Mother's day?"
"Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards	That sounds wonderful! How many did you have?"
"THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?	It went wrong for me when my car crashed into another"
"Did they give you any feedback?	I don't know.  It just happened.  I guess I'll just have to keep trying."
"That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.	I am always looking over my shoulders and waiting for people to yell at me. I wish they had given me any feedback. I am a teacher and I am always worried about my students. I am always trying my way of things to make sure I am doing the right way to make them learn and not to make them feel bad about themselves."
"So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.	Yeah, that's great.  What's the baby going to name them selfs?"
"I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July	I'm so happy for them. I'm a single mother myself and I would be so nervous. I would be too if I found out."
"Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting	Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?	I was watching Netflix! I'm so lazy!"
"Yes, I do. I recently watched the series ""Dark."" It's the German one.	I watched it! I loved it! The atmosphere of it is so creepy. I wish I lived in Germany so badly."
"It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.	I have never heard about it. I will look into it."
"It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	i hate it, when they say unemployment, it's not the best situation."
"Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.	That's good news. What happened next?"
"Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job	Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!	Oh man. That is the worst part of traffic. I hate how congested the streets can be."
"Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes	That's no good at all!"
"The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.	that's terrible"
"And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.	Yeah, I saw that one too.  I'm glad I'm not that young again!"
"My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.	That's cool. I have to ask though did she actually go on to get a degree in her field of study?"
"She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.	That's awesome! I'm glad to have friends like you that can be such supportive friends.  What kind are the two kids of?"
"I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.	Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.	That sucks! What are you growing there?"
"I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.	That must be frustrating. I hope you can figure out the issue soon."
"I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too.	I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out	That's so awesome! What breed is it gonna be?"
"Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!	That's great news! I'm sure the dog will be wonderful!"
"When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them	Yeah thats cool, but how did they pay bills?"
"Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed	I wish I had my parents."
"Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.	Yeah, but sometimes they're not the right people for us.  I don't want to be around my parents all the time, so I choose when and where.  I just found that sometimes they can be a little too expensive.  So, I moved out and started a life."
"Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married	That sounds like you are on the path to independence."
"My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.	I can understand that."
"Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.	That's great that you're thinking about the sacrifices that people make."
"True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.	I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future	That sounds exciting. What are your majors in?"
"I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path	That sounds awesome! What major are you going for?"
"That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?	oh, i was thinking of doing something about it"
"You could chat to them and complain!	I agree, it is. I think we should all just stand together. It is a problem that affects us and others."
"Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are.	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.	That's really kind. It's always hard to get a place when you're young"
"I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.	That's so cool! What neighborhood are you looking at?"
"She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.	it's great to hear that."
"I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.	Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood	That was a fun place."
"I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era	I agree with that era, they have some good nostalgic memories."
"The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.	That was funny. I bet you were a teenager then."
"Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.	It's great how nostalgic things have become for us today"
"How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.	I was born 2 months ago, so I am only about to enter my teenage years"
"Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.	I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.	I hate bullies. They are the worst!"
"Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?	I agree. I don't like them either. Sometimes they are kids but other times they are adults. I like kids better because they are so innocent."
"I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.	I bet you're a huge fan! What movie was it about this time around?"
"Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.	That's pretty weird how you feel about movies, but yeah, it was definitely a good movie. I was a little worried about the plot."
"My parents keep taking my money	Oh that's really not something to be mad. They are just taking it for emergencies."
"They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.	That's terrible, you should be able to get your money back. Do you have to go back and get it from them again."
"So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a ""mommy"" will come along to clean up after them?!	I hate to hear people complaining."
"LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)	It is not that common to clean in the business environment. I work at a hospital and my doctors wife works there too."
"The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.	That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss."
"She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.	That is terrible.  I am so sorry.  I am so sorry.  My friend died of cancer too.  She was  8 years old.  She was so full of love for life."
"It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.	That's sad. I've lost my sister to cancer and her daughter is still trying to cope with her death."
"It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.	Yeah that was hard, but that was my first."
"A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.	That must have been tough. Did he get you a car for free or was it an expense you had to cover yourself."
"We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!	Yeah thats awesome that someone helped you out"
"Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind.	It really is. It really does. I feel like it's hard to find good people like them nowadays though"
"Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.	i dont remember any thing like this."
"That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year.	I haven't. I don't celebrate birthdays."
"Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops.	It was raining hard one night and the power shut off	Oh, that was so bad! Did anyone call the power company to report it?"
"Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles	That's crazy. I hate when the power goes out and you have candles to use as fire."
"One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam. It was hard and I studied all night.	That's so cool! What did you study on that exam?"
"I ended up actually getting a 98%!	That's awesome. I've always wanted to be a psychology major. I'm so impressed that you did that."
"Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.	Do you have any pets?	I do have a cat.  He's really sick though. I am going through his vet."
"Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff.	I'm sorry, I didn't understand."
"My son graduated.	I have never been that old before graduation day.  Congratulations!"
"Highschool.	That's a pretty accomplishment.  What year?"
"One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.	That sucks. I hope they were okay."
"I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.	I am sorry.  That sounds awful.  I hope things get better for you."
"It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.	I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.	Oh yeah, that's awesome. What is he in the business of?"
"He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.	That sounds amazing. He's got to have some great skills to be so successful at such a young age."
"I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.	That's okay, pack rats can be a little bit."
"I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said ""Special Sister"". I'm probably a jerk..	That was such sweet of your parents. I know how packrats people can get. I think you should try to be kinder to them next time they talk about it. They are just stressed about their health and all. I'm sure they would understand."
"No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.	I feel bad that she is passing on the necklace."
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?	I love old songs on the radio. I can get a lot of nostalgia."
"Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..	I totally agree, I think music has that power."
"lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)	I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.	That's terrible. I'm sure he's happy and at rest."
"It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(	Oh no, that's terrible.  My cat crossed the street yesterday and I'm worried he's going to do the same."
"Thank you. I appreciate that.	I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.	Oh, yeah. I lost mine too. I feel for you."
"The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha	That is terrible. I lost a dog last year. It was a long and hard time."
"Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.	Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends, so gross.	That's not good, what happened after?"
"Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it	It was oyster season and I just wanted to try it out."
"You don't care for sushi that much?	I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!	That sounds pretty funny. I bet that it was hilarious. Did you guys hang up your life?"
"I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!	Oh my goodness! What kind of friend is that?"
"My boyfriend of five years and I broke up. I don't know what to do with my life.	That's terrible. Did he want a break? Or was it just you?"
"I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.	That sucks. Do you think it could work?"
"I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.	It's always good to consider the potential.  But, at the end of the day you have to think about yourself too. I think I will talk to my dad and see what his opinion is on this whole thing."
"We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha	I can understand the feeling. I am happy my kids will be close to family"
"I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.	Oh, that is terrible. Why wouldn't she?  She could be anyone. I mean, she's got everything she could ever want."
"I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.	I understand how you're feel. It will happen. You just need time."
"I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.	Oh, that sounds good. What is she like? Have a special someone?"
"I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.	I love the feeling when you are really ready for a relationship."
"I am very lucky, my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?	ye,my best birthday was with my dad, and my most worst was with my friend,they got into some fight"
"Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!	Yeah, that does make me jealous a little.  I have never been married and have never been in love.  I think I am going to be a bachelor.  I know this is weird talking about myself like I'm a bachelor, but I feel so lonely and lonely feels.  I have a lot of great friends, though so maybe I should go out and celebrate with some guys.  I don't think that's going to work, though because they all get really drunk with"
"For sure, maybe you need new friends!	5	I have never heard of such thing before. How does it work?"
"I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.	That can be annoying, but at the end, you're both happy and you can move past the disagreement"
"I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.	That's scary. Did you call the police?"
"Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt, though.	It sounds scary. I hope everything was fine."
"Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?	It is so good"
"Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha	It's always nice to have some relaxation and warmth on a cold day"
"I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.	I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me, even to this day.	That's so awesome. I have a mom like that too, but mine's been deceased so I don't have to worry about money anymore"
"I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.	I have the feeling we all do the same."
"You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?	i bet. What are you going through now?"
"But you failed the exam? Did you revise?	I failed because I didn't study enough. I'm really upset about it."
"At least you know for next time eh?	My mom helped me buy a car. She's the best.	That's so nice of your mother! How old was she when she bought the car for the first time?"
"She's amazing. Do you love your mom?	That's very kind of your. How did she help you buy the car? Was she helping you with the money?"
"I think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else. I feel very sad about it.	That's terrible. Maybe try to move on. There are plenty of other people out in there waiting to be loved by."
"It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month, so I will likely discuss it when she returns.	That is tough, I hope you get over this soon."
"That sounds tough. What do you do/	I do some exercise.  I am going to the gym tomorrow."
"That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.	Yes I was fired from my last company. I am going to a new country to work. I am nervous about it. But I know I have to do what I have to. I am going to make a new country for the people I will be working with."
"Fair enough. As long as you look after your back""	I have only a few more semesters in college. I feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing.	That is great! What are your plans after graduating from college?"
"Environmental engineering! I enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.	That's cool. I've always wanted to study something environmental"
"I watch so many scary movies that I haven't been able to sleep alone in years due to fear.	That is crazy! I love a little thriller horror movie, what kind of scary things frighten you?"
"I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.	I hope I don't have the same problem one day."
"I've been telling myself that for years, I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?	I'm not very good with self control. I get bored with myself. I'd be out all day watching a movie"
"What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?	I have a weakness for the ""creepy abandoned asylms"" movies. I've seen them all multiple times over the years."
"Donald Trump is now the president. It makes me feel bad about life.	That is a sad time for us all."
"I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him, too.	What are his views?"
"I am now going to be a master's student. I will got to he University of Florida	That sounds pretty cool. What major are they going into?  I'm a master's myself. I'm thinking I want to be in education."
"Environmental Engineering is my major. I enjoy it.	that's a great choice, you'll probably have a lot of fun in college."
"I have been feeling very faithful these days. My lover treats me so well.	That's so nice. I've been feeling that way to my girlfriend as well, but I think she is a little bit more of an idiot than me."
"He is really nice and provides for me well. He is also very sweet and very respectful.	That sounds great! I wish you the very best and I am sure everything works out for the best for you."
"Do you like to go through old family pictures?	I do love going through old family pictures. I love going to the old antique store and I like looking at old family pictures"
"Absolutely. I love to hear my mÃ¡mÃ¡ tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.	That's so cool. I love looking at old family pictures. I have a lot of old family pictures from the 70's and I love to flip through them and hear about my grandparents' childhood."
"I also love to look through the old scrapbooks my mom made when I was a baby and young child. I find it's so funny to see what you looked like as a child.	I recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another. I am incredibly jealous of him.	I hate jealousy. How can you feel jealous of her? He's not even even in the picture."
"I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.	That's tough. Have you tried talking to him and getting her perspective on the situation?"
"How long?	That is a long time since I last spoke."
"About what exactly?	That is quite a long sentence. I assume you are asking about how long?"
"Now that is an interesting perspective!	My mother recently went to the bank for me. I love her so much.	I know how that feels. It must have been hard for her to deal with."
"Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!	I hate when people are inconsiderate.  I hope your mom gets the rest of her money soon."
"My father almost died. His recent health problems have been devastating.	It's sad how people don't have the empathy to care about others health"
"It is tough, but I think I will make it.	That is terrible.  I hope he gets well soon."
"My friend bought a new car. This makes me so jealous!	That's awesome! What kind of car? I have always been wanting to own a Mustang!  I love Mustang!"
"It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.	I get it, but you should be happy for him."
"I recently met a new person that I am very fond of. I want to give her my love and care.	That sounds like you are in love!"
"I am very happy, too. Do you have someone special in your life?	That sounds like you've really found someone you're serious with.  I've found someone I really care about too, but I think I'm ready to move forward and get into that level of relationship.  I'm just not ready yet though."
"My family is very loving. They care about me so much.	That's really cool. What kind family?"
"I agree. I hope you are also close to your family!	That's good. I'm very close to all of my family. We all love eachother."
"I stole my friend's Pokemon card when we were 7. I still feel guilty about it.	I remember that. That was a long time ago"
"Yes	That's okay! It's just a card."
"I one time lost my trunks in the pool! People saw me in a way I didn't want!	That would have been embarrassing. Did anyone help find your trunks?"
"I covered my body and then went to the bathroom and got a towel!	oh no that must've been really embarrassing.  Did anyone ever make you pay back for it though?"
"I recently graduated from college. I loved it and now I feel great about my life!	That's awesome. What are you going to study next?"
"I agree. I am thinking about moving to the West Coast of the USA.	That's cool. I don't think I could handle the stress though.  How far away is your school?"
"we went for a doctor visit because she was	Did everything go okay?"
"sorry lol. because she was ""late"". but she told me the result was negative, not pregnant. so then we went to a furniture store just to browse	That's nice. Did you get anything?"
"well here's the thing. We are married. Been together 5 years. So as I'm walking around looking at stuff in this store, I notice a bookmark hanging off the ear of a wooden rocking horse!	Having the whole house to your self sometimes isn't as good as it may seem!	Oh? Why is that."
"My whole family is out the house for a few months. I'm going to be so bored with no one around...	Oh man, that would be boring, but on a good level? I mean, you can't go too crazy.  Do you have anything to keep you from being too lazy and bored?  Like, a hobby to keep yourself occupied?"
"I have a huge chance to win a PS4!	I bet. What are the chances that you win it?"
"There's only 2 other people in the final round! Winning a PS4 will be awesome!	That's awesome! I have one but don't really get to play much."
"My son really needs to cut down on the amount of sugary snacks he has!	That is true.  I always thought it was the kids who were the ones that ate the junk.  But now that my kids are growing up, I see that they are the ones who have to deal with the junk."
"Well, my wife gets them on deals, so likes to hoard them in the cupboard.	That's cool! I don't get hoarder. Do you hoarde food too, I love to hoard."
"the house is very quiet now that she's been gone for four days visiting with her family	That's great. I love when people come back from time travel."
"because she hasn't seen them in almost 2 years. Misses them	I love my mom"
"In the middle of the station, on my new suit, a seagull threw up on me!	I would not have let you touch your face!"
"I was! I had to travel all the way home with a huge mess on me!	Oh no! That's disgusting. Did you clean it up?"
"Paddington Train Station.	I can't believe someone half my age got promoted instead of me!	That can be frustrating. What did they do?"
"Have you ever missed out on a promotion?	oh man thats a tough. I have missed out. I am a little older and have a lot more experience but still I am not as confident as I was at 25."
"My wife cried quite a lot at her mothers funeral. They had a very close bond.	oh man, that's tough. I'm sorry to here that. My mother passed away last year and I was really close with her. I know I'll miss her, but I think I'll be okay. Do you think your relationship will get strained with her grieving about yours? I know I would have if mine had to pass too soon."
"Unfortunately she passed away, hence the funeral.	It was sad. I hope she recovered quickly. She must have been very sad."
"Getting this new job should be easy. I am easily the best person that applied.	That sounds good. What kind was it?"
"CEO of Apple. I figured they need a Steve 2.0 to take them forward!	I can see that you are a genius. I am a bit jealous. I am not."
"ok, so after 5 years and the baby, there was disconnect. Things like not sleeping at the same times, not even hardly talking. Just avoiding each other really	Yeah, that happens. It's like they're trying to avoid each other."
"plenty lol. kicked them out long time ago. now with new wife of 5 years haha. but point is, i never cheated even during those 8 months of feeling alone, heck, BEING alone	That sucks.  I would have cheated.  But you never cheated.  You kept it clean and honest.  I'm glad to hear that it worked for both you."
"as bill & ted would say: Excellent! {guitar}	That's really cool. It's not like you felt lonely for long, right."
"My son is such a rascal! He took my car for a joy ride!	That's a billy badger story!"
"He's only 13! I didn't even think he had that in him!	I'm sorry to see that he's not responsible enough to take care of a car."
"My brother...Dating an A list supermodel... I don't know what to think!	I think I understand. I would be jealous, and worried, too."
"He's dating Kylie Jenner. Have you heard of her?	I don't, but I have heard of it.  I don't know if she's worth dating though.  I would hope she's good.  I think she's good.  I think she's worth it."
"Justin Beiber.	Have anything to tell me about?	I have nothing to say. I think you should have something"
"Oh wow, I can imagine. How old was it?	That must have been something terrible."
"That's rough, but I'm sure you can get past that.	Starbucks always get's my order wrong!	yea its a pretty bad habit"
"They definitely are expensive. What's your favourite drink to get?	I like my coffee very strong and it always comes out wrong."
"I'm so happy for my son, went to his graduation from Harvard last week.	That's a big accomplishment. Congrats! What degree did he get in the end of the week's?"
"Thank you! Looks like there's going to be another Doctor in the family!	That's awesome. I'm happy you could be there.  What's he going into? Medicine or law?"
"My pizza I bought fell all over the floor on my way home!	That's a bummer. Did you get it?"
"The pizza was from my favourite pizza shop as well! Quite the sad moment.	That must have been very frustrating"
"I was getting keys out of my pocket, and then WHAM, right on the floor. The pineapple slices were the first to fall on the floor.	Why does McDonalds always get my order wrong! I said no lettuce!	It's always something right?"
"Sometimes I think the management don't even care!	That's a little bit rude. I don't get it either. They should have to get my order right. I guess they don't!"
"I ate so much of my wife's cookies, but she shouldn't make them so irresistible.	That is pretty typical."
"She made me pay twice what they would have sold for at the bake sale. The cookies were for charity, you see.	That's a bit harsh, right there in public."
"Just my luck I step into a huge pile of dog mess...	It is so gross!"
"That is true, cow poop is much worst! But I was wearing brand new Gucci flip flops!	Oh, I know what you mean! I have been wearing my flip flopper for the first 2 years."
"The key to making good chicken and rice, is following the recipe precisely	its always the same. I always follow the same recipe"
"You've got to cut up all the ingredients, and put it in small containers, before finally cooking all at once.	That makes sense, how do you do that?"
"we asked the doc to put the ultrasound in an envelope so we could record our reaction to the gender reveal. I was very happy when I finally saw it!	I bet! That sounds so exciting!"
"thanks. no mistake about it, it's a boy! lol. Takes after his father ;)	That sounds like fun. I bet you guys were excited!"
"Holy Moses!! don't quit trying :)	My son failed his exams! Can you believe it! I don't know what to do!	It really stings to have your child fail."
"He spent all his time playing football instead of studying! I warned him about this!	That's terrible."
"Without prayer, I don't know if I would have passed that important test!	That's great you were so lucky. I pray every single day."
"It was a test in Numeracy, so counting 1 - 100. I've always found that difficult, but god made it possible!	I am very bad at math too. I'm a math teacher, I've always found that I'm the worst teacher in the math department at my university lol"
"Hey! I saw a blind man play a guitar once. Was so surreal and I was so impressed	That's pretty cool. Did he have any hearing aids on him as I would have been worried."
"Yea. I think he was. His story was crazy too. He is an orphan	Yeah, that was a great story. He's a pretty amazing person."
"we were 20 mins from the airport and the car broke down, overheated and would not start !	It was a terrible day for us"
"had to hitch hike. made it on time for check in though. now the cars been in the shop 4 days, no progress. kinda getting worried about it	That's awful. What were you hitching for?"
"My son was just born, my first boy after 11 girls!	That must have felt great. How long has your son been born to you?"
"It's easier if you had 12 different baby mamas, that's my trick anyway. This last labour was 6 hours long!	Wow, that's crazy long labor. What kind of woman did that last labour last night with your baby boy in her?"
"Some times at night, I can hear some shouting ""AHHHHHHH"", ""HEE HEE"".	that would be creepy.  What happens?"
"No, the spooky thing is... I think it's the ghost of Michael Jackson. I even saw him dancing to Billie Jean.	I am shocked.  I would be too.  I would be looking for the camera to see him.  I am shocked that it is Michael.  I thought it might have been the ghost."
"My best friend is doing 30 years in prison. I miss my good friend.	That's terrible. How did he get there of all people?"
"I can't visit him. I've had to flee the country. We were robbing banks together, and he got caught with half the cash. I'm currently in the Bahamas.	That sucks."
"My son worked for many years to be a footballer, he finally signed a pro contract!	That's very good! I bet you're very happy for your son. I bet you worked really hard too!"
"He's just joined Juventus. Can't be more happy for the lad.	I am happy for you too!"
"4 months later he will be here. It has taken me around 3 months to save up enough money to be ready for him when he's born	yeh thats kinda cool that you are ready for his birth"
"yes it is. I am very happy	That's good to hear he will be okay!"
"only child for now. name is RAIDEN (god of thunder) :D	On my way home from work, a massive bat chased me!	That sounds like quite an experience.  Did you run for your car?"
"I know! This one was absolutely huge, almost human sized. Chased me for a whole hour. The more I think about it, it might have been the batman! I shouldn't have stolen those diamonds!	I think Batman is a cat, so maybe you should steal from a cat instead!"
"Every day I thank God for my blessings. I'd be in hole right now if it weren't for HIM	I agree with you. I'd probably be homeless right now too if I was a poor single black homeless man like I am right now."
"especially since he takes care of us even though don't deserve it	You're a very lucky person to be blessed."
"Once during an important school sporting event, my entire sports team was counting on me but mid-way through my event, my shorts fell down and I tripped	I hate tripping."
"yea! it was! I thought everyone would be annoyed at me but the next day when I went back to school, everyone just made it a joke so its alright. This was about 5-6 years ago now haha	That is awesome. I love it when people can just laugh at themselves and move forward."
"I love youtube. been listening to all my classic tracks. Tupac forever	I agree. I've been listening to his music since I was 17."
"I started out with one hit wonders but ended up at Pac. I miss my youth lol	It's awesome how people are still making music"
"When I was younger, my dog died. He was getting up there in age, but he was still on the young side. Later, we heard the pet food we had been feeding him had been recalled because of similiar fatalities.	that sucks. i am sorry you had to go. i had to give away a few years old labrador a few months later"
"No, they just had a recall. Apparently they didn't clean out their machines properly when making the food, so it got contaminated.	I had to buy new food for my dog. It was really expensive."
"Seeing people who have less than me just makes me so grateful for the blessings I have been given	What's your income level like?"
"absolutely! Always give to people who have less than myself :)	You're right, I do feel for them. I just can't understand it when someone is so selfish"
"hiding for almost 2 years but I'm still not over my paranoia that one day I will have to pay for what I did. Don't ask what it was	Oh, that's terrible! How bad did you do it?"
"no way. I just pray she can forgive me. I could never admit to this sin. Jesus save me	I don't know if I believe you can forgive you. I think it takes a long to realize you were wrong to forgive you. I would probably want to stay away from you."
"When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So, when he had his back turned, I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.	That is a great idea. I like to do things to people who treat others badly. I like the feeling. I will have to do it again."
"Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.	I am sorry that happened"
"after she got her 1st job and new car, she started doing girls night out. Out until 3am one morning. I checked her chat history and sure enough she had kissed another guy >:(	oh no! that sucks. how old is she? 17?"
"jealous isn't the one I felt. I wanted to rip her apart lol	That sucks, but at least she didn't have to deal with you lol"
"My dad always worked his ass off at a job he didn't like in order to support us, doing a lot of back breaking work as a caretaker. He even had a second job at Wal-mart for a while. I have no idea how he managed to do that sort of thing.	It's great that he had a supportive wife! How old are you?"
"Yeah, especially because we were single income. My mom homeschooled my brother and I. I think he took only a handful of sick days his entire time working, had something like 600 days saved up when he retired.	that's really cool that he took only a few sick days off, he must have been tired all the time he worked there"
"I think he got 3 weeks a year, only used like 5 days.	That's amazing. What kind of work does he do."
"my instincts are never wrong. I found out her lies when I checked her facebook chat history.	I love Facebook, but sometimes I wish people wouldn just tell you the truth."
"she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t-shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other. Made me so mad	That's crazy! Did she apologize to you?"
"I never thought she would tell anyone and make it seem like I did something wrong. I didn't force her	That was very rude. Did you tell the truth?"
"ye and so I had to leave the country because of her	I know how you felt.  It was hard for you right?"
"Public school really sucks sometimes. Making boys shower all together. I didn't want to but had to or else fail PE	That sucks. It's a lot of work to make sure that's clean. I don't think it should ever happen. It should be all girls or just girls and women's."
"yes. Well it was a long time ago but I haven't forgotten	That's terrible! Are you still having nightmares about it?"
"My mom homeschooled me when I was little. I was in public school till first grade, but after that I was homeschooled. Did take a semester in grade 11 though to make sure I was up to current standards.	that's awesome"
"Really? I didn't even know that was an option. Then again I'm 25 so it may not have been available then.	That sounds like a nice way to go about education, I hope you had a good experience with her. Did you end up going to public school again?  I went for 2 years before homeschooking. It can work out, but I think some parents just can't seem to find the time or energy to get up off their couch and go."
"I still haven't got over it. Brandon Lee RIP. I was 17 when I found out he died during filming. I visited the area he took his last steps a couple years ago	That's a bitterspring. I'm glad he passed."
"Now the remake is well on its way. Maybe it can lift this depression I feel if they stay true to the story. Jason Mamoa isn't bad looking	I agree with that."
"I had to adapt to life. I had to change to survive. Now I feel better	Oh I understand. That must have taken courage and resilience"
"I am reminded every day that I can survive anything. A friend gave me a special bracelet (paracord)	That sounds awesome.  What kind was that of?"
"I recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years.	I would tell them, they have a problem."
"Very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way. It makes me think less of her as a person.	I'm sure it's not easy to deal with that kind of situation."
"I was sucker punched when I was 17. The guy broke his hand and fled the scene. I saw him one time after this riding a bicycle but didn't do anything.	that's a bumpy start"
"I wasn't confident. Now I regret not punishing him.	That must have been scary."
"I recently completed my masters degree in education at almost 40 years old. I feel really pleased with myself.	It is a good achievement"
"Thanks! It was a huge challenge, and I'm SO glad to have it behind me!	That's great! What's next? Are you going to go back?"
"Being a mom is great, too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks!	That sounds awesome! I've always wanted to go back. What made the decision to go back?  Did you want to go to school?"
"I feel happy about the new house I have and that I can work from home. Thanks be to God	That's great, what made you decide on the new place"
"It took me 9 months of determination and sacrifice. But worth it.	That is amazing. I hope you continue to work hard at home. You must feel proud about your new home as well"
"I blamed myself for her fall because I wasn't close enough to prevent it. I took care of her for months afterwards.	Oh no!  That was scary.  Why didn't anyone tell you it was a medical condition?"
"I was distracted by the sound of running water.	I am sure it had nothing to with you"
"I can't get enough of music today. Especially all my songs/bands from when I was in my twenties.	That sounds fun! What kind music do you like?"
"Its true though, they can't make good music these days. Not in ANY genre.	I love that too, especially rock."
"I get paid today and I'm getting this new game I've been waiting on to be released!	that sounds like fun"
"I'm thinking about getting FarCry 5. I pre-order for the early release! I'm really excited about it.	That's awesome! I hope you get FarCry 5! I hope you get your new gaming game too!  You should be able to play FarCry 5 as soon as possible, and get the new gaming game at some point soon."
"Hi, I joined a firm 6 months ago and then I got a promotion for Junior Manager	I hope you keep doing great work!"
"yes, They thought that I have some extraordinary talent and that is the reason I got that position	I hope you keep doing well"
"Maybe yes, Haha, Now I am looking for a Manager post and then become a senior manager	that will be interesting to watch."
"Hi, I have applied for a driving license thrice and I have failed in all the thee	That's terrible. Did they ask why you failed?"
"Yes, I am a little uncomfortable driving backwards. I just can't do that.	I know right? I'm a little uncomfortable myself. I know exactly why I am not allowed to, but I am determined to get a driving test pass today."
"every time I try not to hit that cone but those are so close.	I feel you. I get so anxious and nervous driving backwards. I think I might have gotten used enough driving backwards to be okay."
"I still can't believe my life is where it's at, especially if you look at the past few years. I would never believe you if you told me I would be here.	That sounds like you have had an amazing journey. What brought about all of this?"
"Well, for many years I was an alcoholic, working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!	I can't believe how far you have come since then. That must be really great."
"It does. I worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests, and I couldn't believe when I passed with flying colors!	That's great news! Congrats on turning over to the right place to get help to stay on track and you're doing it!"
"Yesterday, I was standing in a lift and a man next to me whispered in my ears that your zip is open.	i hope not."
"It was just very creepy situation	oh no! that would be a creepy situation!"
"lol thats funny	My hubby lost his job a couple of months ago but he has an interview this friday so i pray he will get that job	Oh wow, I hope so too! You're really hoping for it too. I'm sure you're going over all the possibilities in your mind to make sure you're prepared. It's a scary job losing your job, but I hope he does well in the end!"
"armed security	That's good! I'm glad to see he's still looking. I've been looking for a job for months. It's hard when you're working. But hopefully soon you'll both be working again. I'm a little jealous of your job! I've never really been interested in that kind of work."
"I stayed alone at night in a office due to excessive work and was much scared.	That's so scary! What happened?"
"no, I was on a 10th floor and security was down. I was scared even with a single noise.	That's crazy! Was it scary to the extent that it scared away your work?"
"I have been awarded with a degree in marketing.	That's nice! What kind degree is that in?"
"it took 4 years but at last got it	That's great! Congratulations!"
"Yeah,  I have  a job that I was looking for and now I am really enjoying my life.	Hey, have you ever been in a car wreck?	That can be really scary! I have been in a couple but not a wreck itself but I did have to deal with a bunch of other cars crashing."
"I was in one about 2 years ago. No one was hurt, but it totaled both of our cars.	Yeah, I have been in one.  I was driving with some kids in the car."
"Have you everr been in a fist fight with anyone?	Oh yeah, I was in one.  I'm a little aggressive and I'm a little aggressive sometimes.  I got into one and it was a guy."
"I got in a fist fight with my step father once. It wasn't a fun experience as you can imagine.	that's so cool"
"Have you ever played and old video game called Everquest?	I haven't, I'm curious though.  What's it about?  I'll look into it.  Do you have a favorite EverQuest? I haven't either, I'm not really sure what to think."
"It came out in 1999. I used to play it when i was a teen. I installed it the other day and had a good time playing.	Oh man I haven! I loved that. I played it a lot."
"Have you ever eaten at Hardee's?	I haven't.  I haven't been there in a while but I'm always looking to go there!"
"I like it too, but I'm not a big fan of their new sliders. They're so tiny, and just one of them cost almost 2 dollars!	Yeah, I love that one. They're the only place in Texas for me.  I haven't tried the new one, but it's just a slider. I love the one they make at home too."
"Have you ever had a sleep paralysis dream?	yea, i once had one, but it was a few years back"
"Yeah, in mine I saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me. I've never been more scared in my life.	i have never had that. what you saw?"
"Have you ever rode on a roller coaster?	I have not rode one yet, but I think I might. What is it called?"
"I hate riding them, but i used to machine components for their drive chain when I was a machinist.	I have never. I am not sure why you would want that."
"A while back my friend's boyfriend tried to get me to have an intimate relationship with him. He knew I had been married a very long time, as well as he was in a relationship with my friend. I turned him down flat, as I love my husband very much.	That must've been hard on your friend."
"Yes, I let him know that was wrong and disgusting. I couldn't believe he did it!	That must've been hard, but I bet it's good for you to have stood your ground like that.  How long have you been married to?"
"Yes, as I am honest with him. But, I didn't want trouble.	I'm going overseas and I think I packed everything i need!	I do too.  Are you nervous?"
"Going to Kazakhstan. That's where i was born. My parents still live there and i miss them so much	That must be nice! I hope you can spend some time with them while you are away!"
"Hi, My girlfriend was recently let go of her job, but she put so much work in to finding a new job and got one with better pay!	That must have been really hard for her."
"Yes I agree, she was so happy when she found out the job was hers	Yeah she worked hard for that!"
"She wasn't really fired, her position was no more. Schools don't have much room left for Home Ec teachers. Sad	Oh man. That is a lot to deal with. I am sure you are relieved though. I bet you were for a while there."
"Yeah she has a passion for teaching. These kids will be great to work with.	So about a year ago now, my girlfriend decided to surprise me with a puppy!	That is nice! What is his breed?"
"Yes, so nice!! It was the best thing that could've happened! It's a German Shepherd!	Oh great! German Shepherd's are great dogs. I'm glad you were happy."
"There was this one time I was fairly drunk at a bar and this attractive girl was trying to make moves on me, but I did my best to ignore it all.. Having a girlfriend and all.	That sounds kinda awkward."
"I was very proud definitely when I woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!	Oh wow, what a relief. Did you end up with her?"
"There was this one time my girlfriend and I had plans to meet a Longhorn steakhouse for a date.. She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.	That's so rude.  What would you have done if you were home?"
"Yes, she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!	That's no good. What would you have done if she hadnt kept you waiting?"
"I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!	That is the only day that comes around every month for me, so I'm super stoked."
"i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long... but i'm a mom so i don't sleep in. ever	that's good you have kids. what movies"
"I had to cancel a trip to see my brother after it started snowing heavily.	That's too bad! Snow is my favorite thing. Did you still go anyway?"
"Yes, when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous, and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.	That sounds scary.  I hope you are okay.  I hate driving in the snow."
"It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.	That is so scary!  I hope the next time you do travel you have a safe route to follow."
"When my parents got divorced when I was a kid, it was one of the hardest things for me.	I am sure. How did you cope with it?"
"It does definitely get easier over time I suppose.. Now that I see my life I guess it was for the best.	I agree it does get easier. But it's always good to know your parents history."
"Just the other day my girlfriend and I were getting ready for the beach, but right before we left it started to pour rain.	It can be disappointing. I had planned out the whole day to go to the beach and it turned out it was cancelled because of the weather."
"Well, when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!	That is funny!  I have never gone to beach with rain!"
"There was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family.	That's so sweet! Did everyone like it?"
"Yes, the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.	That's awesome! What happened next after that party?"
"There was this one time I stole a shirt from my friend, and I feel pretty guilty about it.	I know how you feel.  How did you feel guilty about it?"
"Because I really liked it, and didn't think he'd care.	That's okay, it happened to the best. It was just a silly mistake."
"My girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week, I was very lonely during this experience.	That can be very lonely, I bet. What kind of work was she in charge? I hope you are not lonely anymore. Is there anyone else she is traveling with?"
"I mainly just played video games and watched tv.	Oh that sucks. Hopefully you can make the time pass quickly. Do anything fun with it?"
"I moved to a new apartment and they didn't accept my dog breed, so I had to give her up. :(	That sucks.  Did you find another apartment?"
"Because here in my area in Florida, there isn't too many options for me.	I have been in the same situation before.  I was moving out of state, but they had a ""no dogs allowed"" policy."
"My mom doesn't have a ton of money, but last christmas she made sure to get me some awesome things!	That's so awesome! What did she get you with your money?"
"She got me a brand new laptop I had been wanting for gaming!	oh wow! That must have been great. What kind laptop?  Was it a budget laptop or a high-end laptop?"
"I went on this ride at the beach called the Slingshot.. It shoots you super high up in the air.. It was so teriffying, I had so much faith in the ride I wouldn't die!	I bet that was fun! What was your experience like?  Did you have any issues?"
"It was seriously so scary, I almost pooped myself!	I am so jealous of you.. I have never gone on that ride"
"There was this time I went to the bar with my girlfriend and once I came out of the restroom, I saw her talking to some guy!	Oh, I'm sure she's not interested with him."
"Well I get super jealous and angry of course.. But in the end it was just a work friend.. Oops!	Yeah, that can happen anytime you go out. You can't help it sometimes. I guess it wasn't the best timing though.."
"My dog randomly got up on my couch last week, and just started peeing.. Like what!?!?!??!?!	That's the worst! What kind of dog is that?"
"Not since lunch, so it's actually been about 4 hours.. I hate living on the top floor!	Oh my goodness!  What did you do?"
"I finally graduated college last year, it felt like it took SO long!	That did take long. Congraduate in what? I'm curious!"
"Yes, I am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!	Yeah, it is nice to finally accomplish things you have been putting off"
"My girlfriend saw me kissing another girl, who was kissing ME at the bar.. I was very drunk..	That's awful. Did you confront the other girl about it?  I would be!"
"No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.	That's great you realized that mistake quickly and you handled yourself."
"There was this one time I was driving down the road, and this guy on a sports bike popped a wheelie.. It was so sick!	That's pretty rad. Did you get mad at him?"
"I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!	That's cool. I love watching those videos online"
"When i was younger, I came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead.	I am so sorry. What happened to your pet?"
"He was very old, so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!	Oh no. That is so heartbreaking. What happened to him?"
"My dog chewed a hole in my carpet 2 weeks ago.. I was very disgusted to say the least!	Oh no!"
"Oh dang, I guess I can't complain too much then, that's brutal!	That sounds like your dog chewed on the carpet."
"I have to go to confession at the church... i was a little mean to my mom, sometimes its difficult to be always nice	I can understand that. I used to do that too. I used to feel mean to my mom and my friends, but then I realized that I needed to change. I started volunteering for my school and helping out my mom and my friends and now they love to do stuff for us.  We all just became best of friends."
"Well yes when i shouted and i inmeaditelly apologize but i feel really bad	That is good that the church has a confession."
"We walked, we ate ice cream, we rode a bike, we laughed a lot, we enjoyed the outdoors, we were exhausted	That was fun! Where you in?"
"I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul	I love the feeling you're talking about! What was your name?"
"Sometimes one gives priority to work	The world is very beautiful	I know that feeling."
"Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice	I know. It really makes you think about life."
"People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life	I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.	That sucks.  I had a guy that I thought was great.  He turned out terrible."
"Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself, is it?	That is true, it makes you look at people you really admire in the same light again. I have to say I have a bit more faith now that I am 38, and can look at people more objectively."
"As a kid, I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.	I remember that! We had a tornado last summer. I was scared too. I just ran inside the car with my mom."
"That's the thing -- NO! I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!	That's awful."
"My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said ""You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that."" For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)	That makes sense."
"I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated, really.	that is pretty common for adults."
"Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.	That's great to hear about. You can't let yourself get too worked out over things you said, but if it's really good to talk, that's okay, it's good."
"I do look at that as a strength, in anyone. Being able to say ""I'm sorry"" and ""I made a mistake.""	I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!	That's really cool. Where are you moving to?  Are you moving for school or just to work?"
"I highly, highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.	I agree that culture shock is a big thing to worry about, but it's a great opportunity to see the world and be exposed."
"i would fear my gift	What kind is that? Is it something scary or not?"
"my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me	That's a pretty cool phone! How old were they when they gave you it?"
"yes but its a valuable gift to me	Oh wow that must have been exciting"
"yeah but this gift is definitely different for me	I have such an amazing husband! He works so hard so i could stay home with our baby	That's awesome. I'm so proud of you guys for being so supportive of each other and being so understanding of all things.  I'm a bit jealous, I've always wanted to be a stay-at-home-mom."
"he is an armed guard	That's great that you have a good husband. How long is the baby?  6 weeks?  12 weeks?"
"I have a pretty bad vision so i'm so scared to drive at night	That is a problem. Are you able to drive during daylight hours?"
"yes, i even have glasses but because of astigmatism i don't see good at night even when i have glasses on	That is terrible!  Do you think you can still drive safely?  Do you need to ask someone else for driving assistance at all?  I hope you get your vision fixed."
"It seems like today everyone in the grocery store was in such a rush. Hurrying around!	I know, it's so annoying."
"Yes! They cut in front, and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it	Oh no. I'm so sorry that happened to you. I hate when that happens too. I'm sure it was frustrating and made you want to be angry at the people around you."
"I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible	That is so frustrating, but also necessary to protect your child from potential harm, I hope everything works itself and that the baby gets some rest soon. I've been there, too...it can be a little scary sometimes."
"i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible	That's terrible, how old are your baby? I've had to yell a lot, but not as often, but sometimes to calm him down when he's having trouble sleeping."
"I love being around them and it's great to see them each year.	I do that with my wife, we have two dogs."
"O I'm sorry, my niece and nephews, only seem in the summer. Do you get company during the summer?	Yeah, but they're all out swimming and playing around the neighborhood.  They have a pool, and a swing set."
"My kids are going into 7th and 8th grade in a couple weeks. They really are growing up well	That's so cool. What are they going to do?"
"My oldest daughter has some learning disabilities so I'm really proud of how she is doing. They're both growing up so fast	It's amazing how kids can just grow up."
"i paid all my bills today, i feel so relived and good	That's the best feeling right there, having all bills taken care for for a month!"
"rent and electricity. we've been struggling financially so it's such a relieve to pay bills	Yeah, that's what you work for, right? You have no money to pay bills, and you're stuck."
"I studied so hard for my bar exam so that I could become a lawyer. I prepared for almost 3 months straight!	Oh, wow. That's amazing. I wish I studied like hard for my bar, I think I would have passed if it weren't for my lack."
"I did pass! It was a rough 3 months, but once I got there, I felt like I was ready.	That's great news! Congrats on your success!"
"I was about to book a flight for my baby and i and i was so surprised to find out i didn't need to pay for my baby'sticket	That is nice to know that the government or organization is covering the cost for a family"
"i know! now i can spend the rest of the money on something cool	That's cool. I don't think I've ever heard of anything cool that you could spend the rest of the money on."
"my husband called me a punk today for no reason. and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn't even understand why	That's a little harsh. Maybe you could talk to a counselor about that?"
"no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes	Oh wow. Did he not realize? He can be mean sometimes. He needs to learn to apologize more often instead of being so rude"
"When I was younger, I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive, because i didn't want to get into an accident.	I know! I got mine when I was 16 too!"
"I tried to tell myself that, but my dad got into a really bad accident once, and it has scared me ever since.	I was afraid of being in an accident, too. My dad was really hurt once, and it made me realize that driving was scary too.  I was afraid of driving too much until my husband told me about how he drove without a license, and how he drove without a license for years before getting his license."
"I recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches.	I am not sure what to do with tomato."
"Yea, i put them in a glass of water for a week or two and they grow their own roots, wasn't expecting much.	That sounds cool. I bet it took a lot to expect it. I'm always trying new ways of growing plants."
"I do yes! and since the method i used is working, i have tons of tomatoes!	I was surprised when I saw tomatoes grow!"
"Around town it seems like traffic has been horrible lately. Driving around town is just crazy.	Oh yeah. I was in the same area yesterday and it seemed like every 2 seconds someone slammed into me!"
"Yes, exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!	That sounds like the usual traffic jam."
"A few years ago, I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other, so we met up in person!	What game?"
"I'd say it's going pretty well, we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?	I am a big fan of video games. I met him through a game."
"OKay. I care for everyone	oh man i dont know. what happened?"
"Thanks, I hope I am. You sound like one too	Yeah, I am good.  I just want people who are kind and don't judge each other. I want to be around good people."
"because you gave me a compliment, which I feel is a genuine one	I recently had a one night stand with a woman from my past. It caught both of us off guard	I'm sorry, but why did you have that?"
"Yes, it was a very interesting time. I wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations	That's great! I'm glad to hear that things worked out for you."
"My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!	I'm sorry, how is that possible?  She has to pay a large sum of money to attend a 4 year school?"
"She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.	That's awesome. I have always wanted to go back to school, but didn't think I needed it anymore with my career path set out"
"I walked my dog outside, and she still pooped in the house! Ugh.	That's horrible! Did you clean up?"
"Yeah...Even though I take her outside, 10 minutes later, she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?	Oh man. That's the worst part."
"I think being with my husband makes me a better person	That's awesome! What a lovely husband you must have."
"Definetly, he's my best friend forever.	I agree. I think the most important person in the world is the one you are with when you are with."
"I really don't like when things happen when noone is home.	That's pretty annoying"
"Like stuff falling off shelfes because a dog runs into them! Hah, crazy I know.	That's the kind of thing that could happen, right?"
"I really love my life right now.	I do too. What's going well for you?"
"Nothing really! I just love that I can work at home and have time to clean or cook whenever I want.	That sounds nice! What kind of work do you do?"
"Right? And no having to interact with others unless we choose too.	It is nice. I work at home."
"So i just got home and all of my friends were there for a birthday party i have no clue! can you imagine my reaction?	That's awesome! I'm sure you'll have a blast."
"Well the party was for me, hahaha they really got me on that one!	That's so funny! I love parties that surprise people like that! Did you feel embarrassed for a second there?"
"Its not fun being reminded of things you've forgotten.	i know how you feel. I'm so embarrassed about the fact that I have a 12-year-old son who's never even seen the movie he loves! I'm working on getting him to watch ""The Dark Knight""."
"Owed money to my mother in law for something, $15, she reminded me in a less then nice way.	That's terrible, did she say something specific about the money?"
"Exactly, especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.	I went to San Antonio the other day, was great to see that city.	Oh yeah? Where is San Antonio?"
"O really? What's your favorite thing there?	oh yeah it's awesome"
"I just got back from my graduation! can you imagine after 5 years i graduated with the highest score of my college in the past 20 years!	oh wow congratulations! that's awesome"
"Yes! i studied so hard, can you imagine how i feel? i cannot believe it!	That's awesome! Congradulations!  What field of science or study did they graduate in?  I hope they have a job lined out."
"I hate the sight of someone throwing up. My nephew did that the other and day and man.	That is terrible. I hate people throwing up on my floor or in my face."
"Yea, he had eaten to much sugar and well, it didn't end well	Oh man, I've thrown up after drinking. What happened?"
"I came home from work and step barefoot on one of my sons legos, i was so pissed!	I hate lego.  What happened?"
"Yes, i was so mad i always tell them to pick the toys up.	I hate stepping on my son's toys."
"My mother in law got to eat Qdoba today, one of my favorite places I haven't had in awhile	That's so funny!  How did she enjoy it though?"
"No way. queso all the way! They don't have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did.	I love Qdubbos queso! I haven't had it in a while either!  I think it's time for me to go up north!"
"Yesterday i watch on tv a kid who could speak 4 different languages at age 3, i was in shook!	I'm glad he could speak multiple languages at 3 years old.  That's quite amazing!"
"Well they are called wonder kids! i was in wonder, i also read about one who just graduated from college at age 11	That sounds like amazing abilities. I can't imagine. I hope they continue to develop and become even more skilled in languages."
"My husband is quite impressive to me.	That's very kind of him"
"Yea, he's become the best manager in his market in just 3 years.	That's good.  I have to admit, I was a huge football player in highschool.  I'm glad he is good enough."
"This afternoon i went to my sons soccer game and he scored three goals! happiest dad ever!	That sounds amazing!  What a day!  How did he score three goals in one day of soccer practice?"
"Yes! i love him so dad, but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play, he dedicated the three goals to me!	Yeah! Soccer game can bring you together."
"I was doing a presentation for work, and tried to tell a story about something kind of related to break the ice.  No one laughed or even really cracked a smile, so it put me off for the rest of the presentation.	I know how you felt."
"Yeah, and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking, but at least should have gotten a chuckle.	I feel for ya, dude. Sometimes you gotta try the ""oldie but goodie"" or a story that's been kinda told before. I guess sometimes you just gotta suck it up."
"My wife went to Germany to attend a language course at the end of June.  I've been mostly spending time with my dogs while she's been gone since we recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	That sucks.  How old is she?"
"That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me, I should look into that.	That's great that you have dogs."
"Something I did not expect from a neighbor, this morning he gave me some beautiful flowers	Oh, wow. That must have been really nice of them! What type were they?"
"It was a nice gesture on his part. But I do not know	That's nice. I'm glad you appreciated them."
"But beyond that. Small gestures make others' lives happier	My neighbor has a really annoying little dog that she always brings outside when she's smoking.  It barks constantly at everything and she doesn't try to keep it quiet.	I'm sure that is annoying."
"A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically, but this one is just terrible.	I understand, I have a dog and I know what you are talking about. My dog is so much work."
"This morning my husband received a call, he got nervous, I think it was a woman ... difficult	ohh that's so weird"
"I think so ... I'm a little worried, because of the situation	I hope everything works out for you!"
"Thank you for your solidarity	I have a great picture from my wedding where my friends and I are in a circle having a shot, makes me want to go hang out with them again.	Yeah that's the way to do a wedding shot"
"Yeah, we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to Graduate school.	I bet you guys are having some fun times since moving away from your hometown.  I am sure your wedding picture will be a fun conversation piece"
"Yesterday, a difficult day, the anniversary of the death of my mother	What happened?  Did your parents get divorced?"
"Thank you for your solidarity	What happened to your mom? I'm so so sorry. I'm so here with you on that. I know that's a tough time.  I'm sure she's in a good place. I know how that feels."
"seven years .... I miss her	I went for an interview for a job I really wanted and ended up waiting a long time before I heard anything.  I managed to keep my spirits up for a good long while.	That can be nerve wrecking.  Did you get it?"
"I did actually!  It's a good job, especially since the market where I am isn't great for my field.	That's good. Sometimes the wait can be stressful. I'm glad you kept your hopes up. It's good to keep your mind on what could go wrong and focus on what could go right."
"My daughter is angry with me, she says she does not need me, because I scolded her	That's terrible! What's wrong with her?"
"She is 9 years old but she is a very focused girl	That must be tough.  What do you do to keep the peace of a young one?"
"that's right ... but I think I've surpassed	Hello, tomorrow I have the cooking test and I feel safe. I am sure that I will approve with an excellent rating	That's great! What is it for cooking?"
"have my own restaurant	That's great. Good for you."
"with work, effort and clarity in the goal ... I will surely arrive	I'm so happy i made enough money yesterday to pay my bills!	Oh that sounds great! How much money made? Was that your main source or a side?"
"yes, such a relieve!	That's great! How much money made you?"
"Sometimes we have angels, called friends, I'm happy because God sent me mine	That sounds so nice. I love how He loves us."
"We are 12 years old, but we have had difficult moments, but we have overcome it	That is really nice of God.  What kind are you and what kind of things do they do for you?  I am glad to hear you have good people.  I am 12.  What kind of things do your do?  I am not good with the computer so much but sometimes my friends will send pictures and videos.  I am a pretty good boy so I hope to get good friends too"
"That's right ... I'm happy	my son behaved badly with his friend, I treat him badly, I had to punish him	Oh, sorry.  How did you punish him?"
"He is 12 years old, but he must understand that friendship is something sacred	Oh wow, that's tough, did you talk about why he did that?"
"he hit him and said a bad word	When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. It was so fucking annoying	I know right. I feel you."
"I do my best but sometimes that's super hard. I guess that's just one of those things everyone got to deal with.	I know how you feel about this situation."
"You too, thank you!	I went to a job interview a few days ago, and I feel like I totally rocked it!	That sounds great! How old were you?  Did they offer you the job?"
"Thanks a bunch! It pays much better than my current job, so I really hope I do, but I think I got it in the bag.	Oh, you're lucky!"
"I went through some of my old stuff yesterday, and I found my security blanket that I used when I was a kid!	Oh that must've brought back good memories. What age were you when it happened?"
"It really did. It kinda made me sad, because it was all tattered and dirty. I ended up washing it.	that sucks"
"You know, I see all the back to school shopping and I think parents have their priorities mixed up.	I agree, I think they have a bad idea of what's best for their child."
"Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor.	It's a waste of money to buy all the supplies that you need to have for school.  I think they just make money by selling it"
"I found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road, and I nursed him back to full health. Poor thing.	You did the kitten a favor!"
"I did! His name is Alphy.	I would love a pet.  Is he healthy enough to go outside now?"
"It's hard as a parent, when your kids are teenagers and have to handle their own problems	That can be tough.  I am a single parent myself, and I hate having to deal with teenagers!"
"I know, they mommy in me wants to just jump in and fix it all like I used to	Yeah, they have to figure out their own ways."
"My wife called me this morning and told me she scored a new job with Microsoft!	I love it!"
"She is so excited. She's even making more than I am.	That's great news!  Congrats!"
"I felt bad my dogs ears have been bothering him. We had to finally take him to the vet yesterday.	I hope he got the treatment he needed."
"Yeah, it was ear mites and he got medicine for it. You can tell he isn't feeling good from side effects so I've been babying him.	That is awful, I hope he gets back to normal soon."
"I bought a chocolate bar for my wife at the store, and I was going to give it to her, but I ended up eating it...I feel bad.	oh that is funny! did you get it from her?"
"lol I didn't tell her...Should i?	I would feel the same way if someone bought me chocolate and then I ended up eating it."
"Don't you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn't do? My boss got mad at me for someone else's mistake.	I'm sure it was an honest person."
"Yeah, that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.	That sucks, did you try talking to them about it?"
"I'm taking a vacation and going on a cruise to Alaska next week!	That's a beautiful country"
"I've never been, so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.	I've had seasick spells of my own, but I think you are ready for this!"
"Hello, I think I will not forget the beauty of her hair, the sweetness of her lips and the clarity of her eyes	That's great. What happened?"
"she died ... my mother	What happened?  Was she sick?  Did something terrible happen?"
"It is true...	Hello, I never imagined the violence that can unleash a dog attacking a bird ... I was impressed	That's the most exciting part of a story like this. What breed of dog was it?"
"in a big dog ... in the park	That's so scary. What kind dog was it?"
"I did not have the strength to control it	My poor neighboor is suffeing a lot without her husband	That is terrible.  What happened?"
"He passed away from cancer.	That is so very sad.  I am so sorry.  I am so sorry.  I lost mine recently.  He was a great husband to me and an even great father.  He was very sick for a few years before he passed.  He was a great man and I will miss him."
"I enjoyed my day the other day, found out something good! Newphew may come to live with us for ayear.	I bet that was fun!"
"11, he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.	That's great! I bet you guys are excited about that."
"I lost something of my mother in laws the other day, I feel so bad.	I am so sorry. What did you lose?"
"I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear, it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!	That's a bit excessive, but I get why. It's hard when someone you care about passes."
"I may do that!	I was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award	That's exciting! What did you get?"
"Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for	That's good news. What award was you looking to receive?"
"I appreciate that. Thank you	Wow! Congrats on your new job! I can understand why you are apprehensive, but it sounds like a good opportunity.	I agree, it sounds like you've found the perfect place to work at this stage."
"No problem! Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.	I am happy, I hope it works well. I am not worried."
"I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!	I feel you. It's like your body is screaming at your mind saying ""YOU'RE NOT GOING THERE!"
"I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?	I have. I think that's the best."
"It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!	I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.	That is true.  I know that I'm not perfect,  but I just want my kids to be happy.  And I know that I'm not gonna let them down.  What is perfect?"
"It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.	That's not good for anyone involved with children, especially toddlers.  I would make sure to teach them that they need to stay on a path or not go off a path and stay on a path that is marked with signs.  You could also teach them how to hold a leash correctly, which is a sign of responsibility and helps prevent accidents with children and pets and other animals.  You might need to also make it clear what happens when a child is off a leash."
"I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.	That can happen. What happens when you try talking? Do people ignore? Do people not listen?"
"Well, for the most part it's my family. My husband, kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!	Yeah that sucks. You need to talk to them about how you feel. It's a big deal!"
"My daughter is a teenager now so we don't spend as much time together as we used to.	That's sad. How old is your daughter?"
"Yeah, luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.	That sounds like fun! I used to go shopping with a girl all the time."
"I'm really looking forward to this trip I have planned next week.	It is going to be fun! Where you going?  I am going to the Rockies.  Have you ever been?"
"I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.	It is going to be great! What national parks will you be visiting?  I am so jealous!"
"I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend, and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.	That must have been gross!  Did you catch her?"
"It WAS. Since she was wet, the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.	Oh my gosh that is ridiculous. I hope she wasnt hurt."
"Been having a good day, relaxing on my couch watching Netflix. I got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap.	That is great! I am happy for you."
"Yeah, it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.	I hope it's not too stressful."
"I had a job interview yesterday. I was really nervous before it started.	Oh, you did okay? Did they offer you the job?"
"It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room, then we took a lab tour afterwards.	That is a good way to go."
"i am very faithful	I'm too. What keeps you so faithful?"
"yes my behavior refereed to people	I like to be a faithful partner too."
"thank you	That's very sweet of someone to do that.  How do you thank people like that?  Is it a habit you get into?"
"nothing	That was a very long text."
"thank you	That sounds like you had a good day. What happened?"
"nothing	That was a very unusual response. What's that supposed mean?"
"i am going to garden	I love gardening! What plants are you planting?"
"thank you	That's a great idea. I have never been one for the traditional kind of things."
"It was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake	That is the worst."
"placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it, so they gave me something else without telling me	That's a bummer! What kind did you order?"
"Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen	Yeah, I think so."
"I really was distraught	I am sorry to hear that. What was distressing about that event?"
"yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok	i feel you. I had a really bad breakup last year and it made it hard for me."
"it made me proud he was my rep	That's awesome. That's what reps do."
"the president represented us at this association	It's awesome when your kids do things well.  What kind of organization was this?"
"International Ceramic trading	It has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation. No one to talk to.	I'm sorry to hear that! Have you tried calling her friends to hang out?"
"I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.	that is sad."
"I can't wait to travel south to get my favorite take out. Can't find it here.	I love take out too. What city has the favorite take out?"
"About an hour. But it'll be worth it.	Yeah, but it's a little too late. I have no time to wait."
"I'm quite happy with where I live. I have 3 swimming pools to use anytime I want and also a gym.	Oh yeah that's cool. What kind is the gym?"
"Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.	That's great that you can use it for exercise. Do you have kids?"
"I have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing.	That sounds pretty sweet.  Was it a small or large one?"
"It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up, go to work, etc. but I was wrong about that!	ohhh that's cool.  Did you know it before he threw you the surprise?"
"Yes, last week. Thank you!	It was a long 3 weeks but I'm so happy it's over and she's back now	That's good to hear! What was she for?  Did you guys have a long time apart?"
"She went to visit her family	That's good. How was it over?"
"It was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother	I'm sorry. What happened?"
"Thank you for your solidarity	I'm so glad you're okay, that's really tough. My mom passed away when my father and I were kids, so I know that loss is something you never want to experience. I hope your experience didn be too hard for you. I know I didn't have to go through it, but I know that many did, so I know what it's like and how to help someone through it."
"thanks	We knew she was pregnant, but didn't know the gender yet. Imagine my shock when I saw the ultrasound for the gender!	That's so cool! What kind was the sex of?"
"Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met	That's great news! Congats on the new addition! I have a little boy myself, so I'm glad you're excited!"
"Even though there are plenty of flirts around, I remain loyal to my wife.	That must be tough. I don't really understand it."
"It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one, which was 5 years ago now.	That's a nice thing to say."
"My friend got a new truck, I'm really envious of him.	That sounds pretty cool."
"I agree, if I work hard I could buy that truck.	I would, but I'm a car enthusiast and I have a passion for cars."
"I should, I just need the drive to get out there and do it. I need to stop wasting money.	Hello, I feel that today is going to be a wonderful day .... I will enjoy it	That is the right attitude.  I agree today is going to be a great day."
"If I really like to be positive, despite the difficulties	I know how you feel about that, but sometimes things go wrong."
"so it is ... a big hug	I have been looking after my wife this week. She has the flu	Did you do anything fun while looking after her?"
"It seems so. Sleeping all day today lol	I bet. She sounds like you care a lot."
"This morning and I saw a tree, I never detailed it, but this time I saw it beautiful ... I realized God exists	That's very interesting! I've always been fascinated by the way that our world can go from one day of the year being sunny and the next it's completely snowing!"
"I gave thanks in spite of the difficulties	That's really cool. I haven't thought about God existing in that light before."
"thank you for your comments	Today I realized that my daughter sings wonderful, I enjoy it a lot ... I was impressed	I love my daughters. What kind songs does your daughter sing?"
"she is 9 years old ... she is a nice girl	I love my 13 year-old son singing. He's got a good range."
"that's right ... thanks for your comment	Hi, I feel bad because I've realized that I do not love my husband, but I do not have the courage to tell him	That's terrible, why not try to build up some self-esteem first?"
"You're right	Oh, that is sad to see that way things went that far down.  It takes a lot of courage to do things like that.  I think you could still try, even if you don't love him.  Maybe you're just waiting for the right person to come along.  Maybe you just need to focus more on yourself and try to get your life to get back to a point that makes it easier."
"thanks	I'm looking for a new job, and I'm feeling pretty good about my options.	That's good! What kind are the options?"
"There's a lot of openings for tech jobs lately, especially technical support.	I have to start a tech business soon!"
"My wife just went out of town for school for 2 months.  I don't really know anyone here, so I don't know what I'm going to do while she's gone.	That sucks. Do you have anyone here to talk to?"
"I'm sure it is great for her, but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.	I'm sure it'll be alright. You'll find a new routine soon. You don't know how hard it can be. It'll be better in time."
"Hello, I made a serious mistake. I made a comment without bad intentions of the elders. I related them to the dinosaurs, and my father heard it ... he looked me in the eyes ... and he told me that you too could be one of them ... I felt bad	That's terrible. Did you tell them?"
"yes, but I feel like a cockroach	I think dinosaurs are awesome creatures"
"thanks	I'm supposed to be on a diet, but I couldn't help myself and I ate three chocolate bars.	I know right?!"
"But I'm supposed to be on a diet! I can't lose weight if I have no self control :(	Oh, well I'm sure it will come back to you.  I'm sure you won't be eating any more of that stuff."
"my husband lost his job a couple of months ago and yesterday he finally got a new job!!	Oh that's amazing!  What kind was it?"
"He is such a hard working man! He works so much so i could stay home with our baby	I can understand why!"
"I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.	Yeah dogs can be a pain. They are always trying something new and they can wake everyone in the house."
"Ugh, that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.	I can understand why she wouldn be.  She's a dog."
"I lost my favorite hoodie somewhere. I'm so upset. Like how could i lose a hoodie? it's so big, did i just leave it somewhere?	That's frustrating. Did you find it anywhere?"
"I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it	That stinks. Did it smell bad or was there some stain on it?"
"I'm going to see my parents in 3 weeks!! I didn't see them since 2014! I'm so excited	That's awesome! How old were you when you last saw them?"
"no, with my little baby. they've never met my son, they can't wait	Oh wow, That's great! You guys should totally take them out for dinner sometime."
"My wife had been out of the country for 2 months for school.  I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.	That's so cool. Did you have fun together?"
"Yeah, it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	That is unfortunate. Did she like your place?"
"I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.	It can be frustrating when they do that. Do they live next to you or not?"
"No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.	That sucks, they probably just wanted to sleep in. Maybe they can just start smoking again?"
"Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!	my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing	oh thats not embarrassment, that's just honesty"
"she did, she didn't say anything but i know she heard it	That is a little embarrassing. I have fart in public too. But I think it's usually more of a small one. I'm sure she didn't think about it, though. I hope it didn't make you too sick. I would have done something else, like just get up to go to bed."
"My girlfriend went on a week trip with her friends, and left me alone to fend for myself.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have she returned? Or is she gone on another one of her adventures?"
"Mostly been playing video games, but it's so boring without her.	That's terrible. You're going to call her?"
"Hello ... I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not, the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth	That's so cool. You're talking about gratitude and how to appreciate the good things in your life. I've always thought that the key to a happy and fulfilling life was to focus on the good things.  I think you're a very introspective thinker, and I'm sure you're a lot like me. What do some people call it?  I think it's called a positive psychology.  Is that something you've heard of before?  It's like a way of looking"
"For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it	That makes sense. You are saying that you have learned from your experiences."
"for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible	That sounds tough. What did you learn from it?"
"condition the mind and spirit	I understand what your saying.  It takes a lot of hard work and determination to take responsibility for your own life."
"I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.	I'm so sorry to hear. I know how that must be so hard."
"yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort	That is very brave of you. I hope it helps."
"I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some.	I had plans to move from Florida to California, but I'm starting to get cold feet...	Oh that is terrible! What is wrong?"
"Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.	I think you might be right, and maybe you should.  It's a big move!"
"today I think today is a day to learn, to hug, to smile, to make someone happy	I agree.  What did today mean?  Was it a holiday?"
"that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that, to my children I kiss them, my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something	That sounds wonderful. I have two of your children myself. I love them and always want to make sure they know how loved they are. I also always want to make sure they know how to be good neighbors and friends to everyone."
"It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile	I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends, no husband, no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life	I am sure it will get you a girl! You just need to put yourself out ther!"
"not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward	That's not very good. You have to try and find people to talk to or join groups."
"My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.  I can't wait to go pick her up at the airport!	That sounds great! Where are you picking her up from?"
"I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.	I'm glad she's back. She must be happy you're coming back. How long was her trip?"
"Germany for a language immersion course.	I am so thrilled to be able to go on a short but long overdue vacation	That's awesome! I've been on vacation a few days ago. What's going on while you are on your vacation?"
"A short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water.	That sounds like so much of a fun trip."
"Down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks. It is around the current river	I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.	That's so cool that you didn your your way and didn the caterer.  Did you end up with them or someone else?"
"Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.	I think you might have just had a bad experience.  I would try again and find another caterer."
"I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.	I know what that means, you're talking about how you ordered it, but didn't pay for it?"
"The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.	That's a good girl though! I would've felt the same way about it.  It was nice of them to ask though and let me take responsibility."
"Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.	how was your day?	I was. It went well. How was it?"
"yeah good. whats your name?	i know, its been great. just working on getting out of bed"
"oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend	hello how was your day?	I hope it was good. I had the same thing happen yesterday."
"yeah fine great day	I'm fine, thanks. How about you? How was yours?"
"yeah nice to talk to you.	I wore wrong pair of socks to the college. But, no was there to spot it. But, when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes. At, that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes. They made a fun of me. That was very awkward situation.	That's hilarious! Did you ever find out who had worn the wrong shoes?  And did they get teased about it too much for you?"
"My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.	I hate when people can see right into you."
"ohh	I went for a job interview, and it seemed to go pretty well.	I went for a interview a few weeks back. It was for a job at my local park. They hired someone else. I thought they were going with me, but they hired the wrong person"
"It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.	I bet it went well too"
"I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.	Oh yeah? How are you handling the separation of time?"
"Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.	That is cool. I moved from my hometown for college."
"I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.	I would have been upset. How long was it for"
"Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.  We just moved recently and I don't really know anyone outside of work.	That's okay, it's just that first trip out of town by yourself can be really scary"
"Germany for a language course.	I almost got in a fight in a drive-thru lineup.	oh thats not good, what happened in that drive-thu line up?"
"No, the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.	That's crazy. I would have just called the police to have it resolved quickly and easily."
"Yes, afterwards I regretted the confrontation.  I thought I could have easily been shot.	I got on a stranger's boat by accident at the marina.	That sounds scary! Did you have a ticket?"
"Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off, but I sure felt stupid about it.	That is a bit embarrassing."
"Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.	I was looking at old pictures from my first ""adult"" apartment, and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates.	that's a good memory, what kind was?"
"It can, but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore, but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.	I feel for that, but sometimes you just need to move forward and not dwell. I hope you find happiness."
"Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to. I was in a house full of people screaming and yelling.	That is awful. Did you get any help?"
"My friend and her mom were fighting about money, and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.	I would be at home right now, but I am at work right now. It's a crazy world we live in."
"I hope so too. I plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this.	I had a job interview today and i think it really well.	That's great. What did they offer you as the pay rate and work conditions?"
"The interviewer told me that I was his favorite interview so far. And I think my qualifications are a really good match for the company.	That must be great news! I bet you are excited about it. What is it?"
"I saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so I called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog, but it turned out I was wrong.  Whoops.	That's hilarious! I'm glad you were wrong. Did you call out the person?"
"Yeah, I don't like calling people out in general, don't know what made me think to do it this time.	That's hilarious, how did they respond?"
"I'm surprised the police are going to let they get away with it.	I am shocked too, how could you not press for justice?"
"I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.	That's the mailman's job, right?"
"My test results come back today. I do hope everythings ok.	Oh that would be good news. What is it for the first time taking the test? Are they good?"
"I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.	That must be scary. Did it come out okay?"
"Absolutely! I'm just over-worrying because I've always been so healthy. Just a little stressed out.	I went back to my home where I grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me. I had so many fun times with my best friends when I was a child.	That's really cool. Did you go swimming in the lake near your house?"
"Playing outside in the summer time. Many fun summer times. Swimming holes, icecream, catching fireflies.	I have gone through many summers like that too. It's so nice to remember."
"Me too!	My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.	That's really nice of your parents! I bet you'll drive around and go to the store in no rush at all. What kind was it?  I'm a little jealous"
"Thanks, now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.	Oh man, that's awesome. I've always wanted a car like that."
"The more problems I have to deal with, the more faith, and faithful I become. I am stronger in my faith when bad things happen in my life and around me.	That makes a sense. I hate being in the middle of all of this and I hate the feeling that comes from having to deal with problems. It's nice to hear someone else has your back though"
"I was told once by a dear departed friend that ""what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt.	I agree with you about that. I am very much the same way. When things are going good and bad things start to happen, I am not as worried about what I am going through.  I just trust God to take it from there. I am a very weak person and sometimes bad news happens in a way that makes me want to go crazy, but when things start to fall, I am not as good at being mad at them."
"yeh to that	I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well, but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.	I'm sorry that happened. I know you thought you got the job."
"I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.	Oh man, I'm sorry."
"I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.	You should try."
"You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.	It was just so hard to get the promotion. I was not sure I had enough skills for it. I just hope I will get one day"
"Okay, I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.	I just got a puppy, but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.	That is terrible. What breed is it?"
"Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.	That sounds like fun.  I bet he gets bored.  I'm glad you let him run.  I don't want to see him.  I hate it when dogs run wild."
"Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.	I know that feeling, how long have you known the law?"
"If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.	I have done that in the past and I have regreted it."
"My dog disappeared while I was away at college.	I'm sorry to hear that! Did they come back?"
"My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.	That's awful. I bet you were devastated."
"Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.	I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!	Oh that must've been hard!"
"Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby.	Yeah, it can't wait until then. I bet it was 2 long months since you saw her."
"Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors!	I hope you guys can figure things out.  I've been having to take on a lot more childcare responsibilities.  I'm not a mom, but I've always wanted to.  I feel like it's my time.  I just wish you guys had more luck in this area!  I've heard horror stories about how things work!"
"Oh cool! What kind of doctor?	Oh, I know what you're talking to.  I've been going through my mother since her husband passed away last year, she has been in the hospital every two months for some health issue, I know what it's like!"
"Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.	That's right, she's been working really hard for this.  I think I might have to get her a little gift to show her appreciation"
"My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.	I am so happy for your mother. She must have worked hard to achieve her goal."
"I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.	Oh, how sad. What made it so bad for him?"
"Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.	That really hits close to home for you. I used to live in a city and worked long hours and never had a problem with poverty in my area of the city."
"A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.	That's terrible. Did the tree fall on anyone's house?"
"No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.	That's so generous of them. I hope they get some credit for it. I don't mind cutting it down myself, but I would like them to do it."
"I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.	That's really interesting. Who was that person?"
"She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.	That's unfortunate, but also inspiring, that you are aware and care about what you see."
"Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.	Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!	Yeah, life can change. But we can still try to make new memories. What is it about those times that you miss the most now?"
"Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!	I agree, and I think I've been living my life too slow."
"That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.	Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time, but now I worry that they will come back.	oh my. that's scary. did you call the police and the sheriffs to report?"
"Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.	That sucks. Did you call the cops?"
"I woke up this morning, and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.	that's crazy! Did you take photos of it?"
"I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.	That's terrible. Did they hit your car?"
"I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well, but I guess not.	ye, thats okay. you can get another job"
"Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.	That is tough, but sometimes things just happen. I'm sorry you did not get the one you wanted."
"Last week, my pants fell down in gym class. The elastic strap holding them up broke.	I bet that broke because of all those sweat drops you put down there"
"I ran out of the gym crying, and the whole class pointed and laughed.	That sucks, did you go back and fix the pants?  Or wear shorts?"
"I love my cat, but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.	That's a bit of a problem, isn't it!"
"She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles.	Yeah, that's cute.  But also, annoying because she keeps walking right past your face and you think you can swip your face away, but then she keeps walking and you're like ""Oh, she's going to rub against my face.  You can do that.""  And she just does it.  And then you have the cat just look at her like ""What? What? Why would I be mad at you?""  And then just walk right on over and keep"
"I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!	That sounds like fun! What are the plans?  I love to go to the beach!"
"We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to, and we will be seeing the ocean as well!	Oh wow, that's amazing! What are your plans while you are in there?"
"I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.	oh thats soooo funny, i bet you got in trouble for that one."
"Yes, it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.	That's awful, what kind is that?"
"I won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy, proud	that sounds fun, did the prize come out in something like a quiz or something?"
"It was for a chess competition.	That's a pretty cool thing to win. What prize did it be for?  Was everyone there cheering?"
"They gave a cash money of 200$. Isn't that cool? Have you won any?	I have a coworker that will not stop talking. He mostly talks about himself	That's no cool.  How long has this going on?"
"Yes, it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people, but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.	That sucks.  Maybe you should talk to HR about it.  They might be able to do something to stop him."
"I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.	That's so cool! Did you open it?"
"Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be, so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting, I guess.	That's frustrating. Are you expecting the package now or waiting for the package to arrive?"
"I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around, and people laughed at me.	That's pretty embarrassing. Did you hit your head on anything in the fall"
"That is good advice. I feel better about this.	That must be annoying. Did you report the incident?"
"I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.	Oh, what happened? Did anything special happen?"
"It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week, not 20 years ago.	That must've felt great! How old is this friend?"
"I just saw the craziest thing! A baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!	I would be a bit shocked too! I bet that baby's owner thought that was a great way to get the attention."
"She couldn't have been older than one!	I know right? I would never leave my dog alone with my baby!"
"I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly, it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do, even though I put my best work and most effort into it.	That sucks! Maybe try getting another job?"
"It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.	Yeah, it's tough.  Sometimes I think it would be good to just give up, but then sometimes things will turn around and you'll get back what you need."
"That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!	I'm worried that if my Aunt doesn't answer her phone, I won't be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend.	That's awesome! Are she and the little kids going to watch the little kids' sports game?"
"Yes, I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.	That's awful."
"I am always suffering due to lack of money and I wish I could be rich someday	That must be hard.  What kind of things are making it hard for you?"
"That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks	I know! I hate to do the same thing.  I want more than what I have.  I want a house, a car, and a vacation spot.  I know that's not going anywhere."
"ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair	That's so true, my mom and dad have to deal with dementia."
"That is so true. But to lead a happy life, money is necessary to some extent.	I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.	It was not your fault, what happened?  Is there anything you can do about it?"
"Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere.	That's terrible. I'm sure you'll get a job somewhere else. I've been there myself."
"I feel sorry for me too!	I know that you will get out of here."
"They are very helpful and I always will be faithful to them	Oh wow, are you a fan?"
"Yes, what about you? Do you feel likewise?	Yeah, but I am not sure."
"Do you follow any particular denomination?	I'm so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend. I was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up	that sounds like a great day"
"yes, and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money	that sounds like she's really supportive and caring. how long you two been best friends?"
"I saw this kid on a skateboard the other day.  I thought he was gonna wipe out hard, but he pulled off some kind of multi-flip jump thing that really shocked me.	Yeah that's cool. I'm not sure I'd want a skateboard, I'm afraid of falling off and getting a concussion."
"I know, right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid, made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line, never managed to do anything else.	I love the story! I want to try skate again. I bet I'd end up wiping it all over the sidewalk."
"I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!	It does happen. What do you do?"
"I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them	That is interesting. What do people say about other moms?"
"I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(	That sucks. Do you have any idea what it might hurt? It's the first time he's got a tooth coming."
"I know he will, i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky	oh man, that's terrible.  Tylenol is not safe and it's not recommended to use it on kids, I would try some other options first."
"I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.	I would have chased the dog!  How long have my dogs been with you?"
"Yeah, I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one, but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.	Yeah that's terrible, I hope they are okay."
"I just recently finished potty training my dog, that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.	Yeah, it's a lot work."
"I can imagine a rescue, generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get, can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!	Yeah, it's a lot of stress for the whole household."
"My dog started looking really sick and in pain, but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet, so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.	oh wow thats tough, how long have you been having trouble with that?"
"Yeah, he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing, but he got medicine and rest and is good now.	That sucks. I'm sorry. Was it a dog breed thing?"
"I was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life. It was great . You ever have any of those moments?	Yeah, I do all that often. I just like to take time for it and enjoy the moment. It is always good to have a little peace and happiness in life"
"I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?	That is exactly how I like to feel. I like to look at life in small terms and appreciate the little things.  I think that can help a lot of people feel more positive about life."
"Oh I can agree with that completely!	I interviewed for a job a while back that I was waiting on hearing about.  I felt like it went well.	I hope you got it."
"A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!	That's great! What kind of lab?"
"Have you ever had to file for disability?	I have never had to do so. I am healthy and able to work. I am 50 years old and I was never in a car wreck or got in an accident where I was injured and unable to work for an extended period of time. I am not sure I would have to file for it."
"I've had to recently. Its been really tough.	That must have been tough. How did you deal?"
"Do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?	I do sometimes see kids that are 3 years older than their kids. That is just not something I would do"
"My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first, but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.	I have heard that. I have had to block out my kids talking."
"I've had to help take care of others before as well.	That must have taken up time. How long have you been able to do that?"
"Yeah, I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.	That's awful."
"I failed my driving test twice, but I was really encouraged and did better the next time.	oh wow! how long did you take the test for?"
"I agree, I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.	It's not easy, I know that. I failed my driving test the first and last times I ever took, and I felt like I'd be driving a forklift for the rest of my life."
"I once went a restaurant, and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen!	That must've scared you."
"I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out, how can a place like that operate!?	That must've been really grossing you out"
"Do any of your kids play any sports?	I'm not sure if mine will start playing sports this summer. They haven't started playing yet this summer so I'm not sure they'll start.  I don't know what sports they're interested in playing."
"My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.	I don't know anything about your daughter's activities, I'm not really sure she has any kids. I'm not sure where to send my questions. I'm just happy to see you have a healthy relationship."
"I was so late for work one day, I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!	That's hilarious! Did you wear them to work? I wear mine to work and then back on at lunch!"
"I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on, I was so in shock, even the neighbors saw. It was bad.	Oh, that must have been embarrassing, but at least it didn't cause any serious problems at work."
"I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.	That's the worst part, isn't it. When you're so impatient you just yell and throw things in the trash.  That was really my experience with that."
"The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.	I understand.  That sounds frustrating.  I hope it was just one bad cashier and not a pattern problem with employees."
"I was so excited when I got my new puppy, it was awesome!	I'm sure it was! What breed is your dog?"
"I agree with you, the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions, positive ones of course!	It sounds like a wonderful experience! I have never been an owner myself but I would like to."
"Those were simpler times, I wish I could go back and relive those days!	I agree.  I miss those days.  I have so many memories of my childhood."
"Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.	I agree. I am trying to appreciate now the good old days when I had no worries about money or bills to stress about. I am not sure I am ready to go back. I want to live now."
"It was great, so much time running around outside without a care in the world.	I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child.	That's really cool. Did it happen by accident or was it planned out ahead of time?  I've always been fascinated with chemistry. Did it spark your interest in chemistry?"
"My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest, was the one that released the most gas.	I can imagine! What kind was the science fair?"
"I'm sleep training my toddler, he never slept in his crib before. He is crying and it makes me feel so bad	That sounds terrible! How are you handling the situation? Are you going back for him?"
"how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry	That is great that you have co-sleeping, but sometimes it is just not right for your lifestyle or preferences, and it's okay to prioritize your life.  It is your baby after all and you have to let them know that you will always be with them, no matter the location.  It just makes it easier to establish routines and to be consistent with their development and sleep schedule, which you are already doing. It might be a little harder to establish routines and sleep schedules,"
"I just got back from my vacation. We stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there, it was so much fun! We really had a blast!	That's great! What vacation did you take to the beach?"
"It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years, due to personal reasons, so you can imagine how we felt when we went!	That's great! Did you go snorkling or scuba diving?"
"As I look at my 21 year old son, I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!	That does. What is he doing now? Is he in college?"
"Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.	That sounds great! I hope you have many more fun times together."
"I want to go on a vacation next month but now I cant.	That sucks. Is there anything to do in that place you could do instead?"
"Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.	That is a terrible situation. What are your options?  I know a couple that went on a vacation."
"My son is in his last year of college! We are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!	That's exciting.  How many credits is he taking now that you can tell!"
"He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.	I bet that's awesome. I have a brother too who's going into college."
"We took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!	That's great. What's wrong with your kid?"
"I hope so. Do you have any kids?	That's good to know. What's going wrong with him?"
"I went to the flea market last weekend!	Oh that was fun! What did you find there?"
"Well, kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies, haha.	That sounds like so much fun! I love collecting. I love old Beanie Baby pictures. What was it about the Beaneebee that made them so popular?"
"I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s.	I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.	That's really sweet. What age was your son? I'm sure it is nice to see your kids taking care for each other"
"haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol	I have a 6 year daughter too. She's a chore monster!"
"My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!	I would be very angry at the pet rat.  Did you get it neuter?"
"It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.	I think the mom rat would do it again if given a chance!"
"She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!	My mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital. I was so concerned, but she became better after a few days. Such a huge relief!	that's so good to hear about her."
"Thanks, she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it, so it could have been much, much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!	That's really good news.  What happened?  Is she ok now?"
"I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.	I bet that cat loved the food"
"The cat appeared very relaxed, but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.	Yeah, it's funny how long cats take when they first trust you, I guess. I had to give it some time, too"
"One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.	That must've been scary. Did you find your way?"
"If that wasn't frightening enough, I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!	That's crazy. Did the stranger end up attacking you?"
"I didn't force her into anything. She seemed to know what she was doing anyway	That's good. What did she do?  Did you guys like it?"
"I wish it never happened now.	I'm sorry. What happened?"
"she was 8	That's terrible! What happened? Is she still with you? I'm sorry to hear that!"
"A little while ago, my friend went on another beach vacation. It was her 3rd one for the year. My family and I hadn't been on vacation for several years, due to issues beyond our control, so I begrudged her trip a bit.	That's nice that she got to go to the beach.  I haven't been in years."
"Yes, true, I know they tend to let bills go for things like that, which I don't do.	Oh no, I hope everything worked itself out in the end. It's good she went, I'm sure."
"I am so happy it's a boy	That is always fun.  How is it faring?"
"He'll be here in about 3 months	That will be fun."
"Hey, I just started the keto diet!	That can help with weight gain."
"It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first, but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.	I hope you like it"
"Thank you, I wanted to be completely ready, so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.	Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy	That's great news! Congratulations, you're going to be a proud parent!"
"I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha	That's great news! I am so excited!"
"I just had my Sweet 16 party...	That sounds fun!"
"Well, about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...	That is nice!"
"A BLUE one! I'm so devastated. I don't know what to do.	I recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out 6 years ago.	That must have brought back a floodgate of emotions and nostalgia"
"I was scared about it at first, but so far I have all A's. I must say, I'm proud of myself!	that's great news! good luck"
"Over the past year I've been on a weight loss journey of over 100 pounds.	I am happy for your progress, keep going!"
"As well as exercise and diet, by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.	What motivated your weight loss journey?"
"I never liked milk growing up, because my family drank skim.	I bet. Was it really that important to your family?"
"Well, first I tried whole milk, and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk, and I like it!	Yeah milk has been a bit weird growing up. But then you try it with different brands and it just won't taste good."
"I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.	That's good. I tried whole milk for the last year of my pregnancy and was so gross. I had tried it at the hospital and thought that was fine, but once I had the kid, I hated the milk!"
"No, but I am satisfied with my choice.	That's good news! What did you choose?"
"I just got back from our vacation, but the drive there was so nerve wracking. There was heavy rain and traffic, and some nighttime driving. Had me on edge	That is terrifying! Was it worth it?"
"Yes, well, it was just one of those things I know, but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.	I bet, but at least you got a break now?"
"Recently, I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.	That's really sad. I hope you were able to help him get help. What's your ex boyfriend like?"
"It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.	I'm so glad you are okay.  What happened?"
"On my recent vacation to Florida, there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving! It was such a hassle!	I am sorry to hear that, I can't believe you drove for 5 hours and then got stopped at a 45 minute toll."
"I wanted to pull my hair out lol. But, knew once we were past it, there was the beautiful ocean on the other side...finally!	I agree that once you're past the tolls the drive is much faster and you get to see more of the area."
"Robby got me flowers today.	I love that.  How did you get the flowers for yourself?"
"Yes, how could you forget? It was a nice surprise, but then he said.. ""happy anniversary.""	Yeah, he said that. He always says that. He's a very romantic person."
"Thanks, but I'm so embarrassed that I forgot!! D;	dad caught me kissing my half aunt	I am sure you felt a lot of guilt"
"I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her	oh that's a bumpy road."
"Me found cave.	I bet that was cool."
"Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.	That must have made you very excited! Did you paint a big mammoth on the wall of the cave?"
"Me miss BC. Me miss wife.	One of the scariest, yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that I was going to have a baby.	I love that you have to be prepared for the worst, but also that you get excited for the best.  How long is you due to go?"
"Oh, we were totally unprepared. In fact, my partner and I were working out of state in a compromising environment. We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!	Yeah that's scary and amazing all at once. I hope everything works out well."
"When I was pregnant, I felt ill until it was over. The doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby.	Oh, that's terrible. Did you have a miscarce?"
"Usually the sickness stops within the first few months, so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all, I had a healthy, bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.	Yeah, it was a blessing. You can be worried about the worst-case scenario and still be happy with your baby."
"When my dog passed away, I felt so helpless. She was old and suffering and I felt angry that there was nothing I could do other than put her down.	that's so hard to see. I hope you get to see your other dog again."
"She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough, I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.	That's really sad. I'm sorry. I can't imagine losing my dog. I had them for a lot longer than you did. I wish I could have spent more time with her."
"I had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him	oh that is a pretty gross thing"
"I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted	oh, man that's a hard thing to swallow.  I hate when that happens"
"My son is in college and about to return for his Junior year. We have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs.	that's so good of your"
"We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!	I feel your sentiments. My parents are struggling financially and can't save much for college, but they are trying! They can't save for college for themselves. It makes me sad that they don't. But it also makes them try! I wish them well too. I'm glad you are taking this step. It will help them financially and emotionally as well."
"After a long few months of being a hermit, I went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!	Oh no! I am so sad for you! What kind pups were they?"
"It was definitely exciting for me! I haven't been able to play with a dog since my own passed away.	That sounds like fun!"
"I've been feeling a bit blue and overwhelmed lately.	yea? i hope you are ok. what's going on?"
"I could definitely use one! However, I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!	That sucks.  But, you got this!"
"These days my skin has never looked better. My diet is good, my family life is good, I've got good grades. Life is good!	That's good! You sound like a very good person and you seem to take care of your self! Keep that positivity going!"
"Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water. It's amazing how much the little changes can impact.	That sounds like you are doing everything right."
"I flew all the way to New York City to buy a designer dress for the prom.	That's so far away! Did you finally get it?  How did you get there?"
"I am, thanks, but I wouldn't go there... Becky STILL managed to get the same dress as me! I am so mad!	That's a bummer. Was it expensive?"
"I just love playing retro games. Takes me back	Yeah, I love playing retro too!"
"Oh yeah? Cool. I like the old Sega Mega Drive games. The music is just classic on those games	It really is so nostalgic. I play retro games a bit too, I have the console and all the games."
"One night, I was home alone, when suddenly, I heard a loud BANG!	oh thats creepy"
"It was a ghost! I ran into the kitchen to investigate, and I saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window.	That must've scared you, right?"
"Recently my daughter was voted 'Most Artistic' by her peers! She is so talented and we feel lucky to be her parents.	That's nice! What kind art do they do at her school or community center?"
"Yes, she has a natural talent, but really puts much practice and time into it.	I love art. I have three."
"what does that mean?	I have no idea, but I think it is a very ominous phrase."
"this has obviously gone all wrong somewhere	oh i feel bad, what do they mean?"
"5	A year ago, I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.	That must have scared the hell out of me. Did you bring it home?"
"I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat, Muffin.	Oh that sounds so sweet! Did you raise Muffie?"
"I'm proud that she traveled across the world all by herself. 2 big suitcases and all	That's a really big job. I bet it was very lonely."
"Wife. And she was 6 months pregnant to boot!	that sounds like a really long time to travel."
"There was a storm the other day, close to our home. There was a tornado warning near it, so I was afraid and nervous!	Oh no. Did it actually happen near you?"
"Yes, it luckily passed our home, but you just never know!	I'm glad you are okay. I hope it didn't affect you. Did it?"
"My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend, I'm really happy for him. :)	That's so cool. Congratulations to him!"
"Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money, but still wanted her to have something nice.	That's really thoughtful of your brother, I'm glad he's thinking about what she'll be happy to have in her life. It shows he values the ring more than the ring. I'm sure she appreciates that."
"I can't wait to get a new car soon	I bet! What car is it? I am looking for a car myself."
"I want a compact SUV, like maybe something like a Toyota RAV4	I've been wanting that too. I'm looking for a new car myself."
"not yet ready for the baby, need fix up his room	That must have been so stressful.  What age baby?"
"Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!	Oh wow, you have 4 more months. I'm sure you will be ready. I know how it goes sometimes, but you have a lot of fun with it."
"I couldn't buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an A, because apparently they don't ship to Canada from their .com website. :(	That's a bizzare thing.  I've ordered a lot online and never had that problem."
"Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.	I feel bad that I feel this way.  I know that shipping to Canada is not a simple thing, and it's hard to get it there."
"she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap	That's a bad deal. How much did she take you for?"
"It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it	That's a lot to pay out so fast. What happened?"
"Sat here by myself for 10 days straight. Car was in the shop being repaired	I bet that sucked! Did you try anything new while you were doing that? Maybe try something new when you come out of it?"
"It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again	Oh wow, that's awful!  Do you think you'll be able to save up enough to buy a car again?"
"For 8 months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place. Lies	I bet. That was bad. Did you guys get what he promised or was he just a liar?"
"Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!	That sucks. I'm sorry. That sounds like a very stressful time."
"At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently	Oh man, I hope it worked for you.  I hate having people do something to me without my knowledge.  Did you get it reversed?"
"Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special	I hope she liked it"
"I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant	That is great, how old was she then?"
"Yes. It's a boy	That's very brave of them"
"My child got sick and I had just made arrangements to go out of town on business.	That's great. I'm sorry to hear they got sick, but I'm glad you had a backup plan."
"I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.	that's awful, did you get your business trip cancelled?"
"I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him	Oh, that is nice! Why is she sitting with you instead?  Did you guys have a long time to get to that?"
"In the club	oh no what did she do"
"I don't feel bad. It's not like I made her do it. She wanted to	Oh wow! Did she do it willingly or against her wishes?"
"She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew	That's good! What happened?"
"I know I will save the money I need for the baby	that's great, you must feel so proud of yourself!"
"Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday	That sounds like you're doing your best you'll pay for everything yourself.  You're doing great."
"I wish I never did it now. I thought it wasn't going to come out	oh yeah? what was it? i think we all wish we never had done it in the first place."
"Kinda. I thought it was a secret	That's terrible, why? You did what? Why did it come out? What happened?"
"it was brutal	Oh yeah, what happened?"
"i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato.	Oh that stank thingy you mean?"
"yes. homeless for a bit	oh wow. i bet it stunk pretty bad. i showered for 30 mins the other day. and then again after work. but that is a few days. what happened after that?"
"i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend.. i cant even look her in the eye	I would feel the same way about cheating with a friend."
"it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her	Oh wow, you cheated, that's terrible.  I hope she can handle herself and not get upset."
"i was heartbroken when my dad passed away.. still not over it.	I'm sorry for your loss. I know that loss. My father passed away in 1974, 9 years before the Vietnam war.  He was a Navy man and was on a patrol in the jungles of Vietnam."
"5 years..	ye thats really hard"
"i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition.. she seems like a born artist	That's awesome! Congratulations!  I have a son myself who's into painting."
"yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her	That's so cool! I have two kids and I'm pretty proud when my kids show interest in something they've been interested in. What was it that they won with in the competition?"
"i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents	I lie to my parents sometimes too!  What do they know about it?  Do they find it out?"
"yeah, but still.. that feeling never went away	That can be tough, but you did what you felt like was right in the moment.  I know you feel guilty about it, but sometimes we have to do what we have done."
"i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere	I never get anxious about knowing that I'm prepared for any event. What makes you feel that way?"
"well, i guess women are more detail oriented	I think it has to have to be men that are anxious!"
"i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates.. i can never cheat on her	I feel the same about my husband and wife"
"yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me, i escaped from there right awat	Oh wow! How long have you guys known?"
"my dog passed away earlier this year	I'm so sorry, that's really tough. I lost my dog a few years ago."
"yeah.. but its too soon i feel	That is too soon. I have never lost my dog."
"some guy drove past me so fast last week.. i was furious	Oh that? What happened?"
"yeah.. i barely escaped!	That is not an excuse. If you did not drive so close to me you would not have had to react that way."
"1	That's a very unusual one."
"soory it was mistakenly typed.	I know what happened, did you miss your flight?"
"how was your day?	I'm taking the California Bar exam to become an attorney in February and I'm sooo nervous!	That's exciting! Are you a law school type person?"
"I played a video game when I was younger, called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and it made me want to become one!	That's awesome! I hope you do great!"
"once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life	Oh, that is terrible. What happened?"
"yeah that really sucks.	That's awful. How did it happen?"
"I fell down at work, and my khaki pants ripped open.	Oh no!  What did happen?"
"I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.	ohh that must have been soooooo embarrassing! did anyone laugh at that point?"
"My grandpa is coming to visit!,5|5|5_5|5|5,	That's so exciting, how do you know him so long?"
"He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!	Oh that sounds like so much fun. What are your grandpas like?"
"I ate a gas station burrito for lunch. It was not very appetizing. Actually, it was absolutely horrible.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	It was a gas station burrito? What kind? What toppings did it have?"
"Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.	I feel you man."
"how was your day?	I am having an amazing day, thanks for the well done! What happened? Did something amazing?"
"yeah its an another good day	Oh that was good. I am having the best day of my week right?"
"oh how was the climate there/	That is true, though it is a very hot summer in Brazil"
"I managed to accidently flash a dozen people	I am sure it happened by accident.  I bet it was."
"it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like ""oops!	That's kinda gross. Did you try to cover? It's not something I'd ever done."
"Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive	i have always more trust on my girlfriend	Oh yeah? Why's that? Did you two get together easily or was there something that made you two more trusting?"
"yeah i do. i love her a lot	I have too. I am married, but I have been with my partner for about a year now. We met when she was on tour. I met her on tour. We stayed in touch and then met again. We got together and it turned out really good"
"what about you?	I have a big exam coming up! My nerves are getting to me.	It can't be bad. What's it about? Is it for school or work?"
"Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.	Oh wow, you're right in time for summer classes. I've had to deal with that situation before."
"I get to go the the zoo tomorrow! They opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal, the sloth!	That is so cool! I love sloths! I have a big pet sloth that lives with me."
"They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!	That is really cool. I have always loved animals. How long has it been since I last went to the zoo."
"I had a guest over that used my restroom, and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! They didn't event tell me about it!	That's a bit rude! Did you tell your guest? I would have had to throw my trash out the door."
"Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?	That's disgusting. You should definitely talk to them. I wouldnnt want anything to happen to them"
"i have been more happy	I like that word! What made you happy? Was it something big like winning the lottery?"
"happier now beacuse i have been built a new house	That must of been really hard work"
"Back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now.	I can understand why. The cost is just going to keep on going up."
"I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal	I wish you the very best"
"i have watched races in tv	I'm a fan of racing too! Do you watch any particular races?"
"nope iam a street racer	I love watching racing videos online.  What kind do you watch?  Is it NASCAR, IndyCar, or Formula 1?"
"i feels happy	I bet. You like to go fishing, don't you?"
"because i built a new house	That sounds great. What city is your house in?"
"i have been more happy that i have bought a car	That is awesome. How did you buy the car?"
"audi q7	That sounds awesome! What color was it?"
"My wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! She is such a sweetheart.	That's very kind of your."
"She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version.	that's awesome! I'm glad I got one too!"
"I just graduated from college! I feel so accomplished.	Oh wow, that's amazing! Congrats!"
"I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.	That's great news! Congrats on making such great of a big impact on the world."
"I am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that I just finished. I took the final exam yesterday, and I am not sure what score I will receive.,5|5|5_5|5|5,	That's good. Did you study for it?"
"I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.	I hope you get good grade."
"I recently had intercourse with somebody that I hate. I feel terrible.	That's okay! It doesn't mean you're bad. Everyone has done it."
"No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.	that's terrible. why did they not make you happy?"
"My mom got really sick for a long time before she died. I was doing my best to see are as often as I could but I had work and lived 6 hours away.	That must have been tough on you."
"The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off	Oh no, I hope she's okay."
"I recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean. The whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable.	That must've made you feel uneasy. What restaurant was it?"
"I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.	Oh, well, maybe you just got off on the right side of it.  Maybe you just didn't know that it was dirty and didn't smell that bad.  Maybe you just just didn't get the right food.  I mean, I would say that, but, I wouldn't go out there and eat it again just yet, just because of how dirty the place looked and smelled.  I just think about it now, maybe it was dirty, maybe you got it from"
"I recently returned to my childhood home, and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories. I am feeling quite sentimental.	That's really cool! Did you go back to school there?"
"Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?	Yes, I was quite close to my grandfather. He passed away when I was just 6 years younger, so I miss him terribly."
"I was going through some boxes the other day. I found some old pictures of my kids I thought were gone	That's cool. I have some old family pictures that I haven't seen them with the family. What age range are these kids?"
"Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.	That was cool. What happened next was good, too"
"We had to get out of the house because of Hurricane Matthew. It was a scary experience, but luckily we'd already packed what we needed into the car, so could just leave.	I love how you can use the car to escape from the storm."
"Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?	I was okay, but I was really concerned for the people who didn't!"
"Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!	I recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous.	That's okay! What happened during the doctor visit? Was it scary?"
"It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.	that's horrible. what kind?"
"My neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! I couldn't believe how fast they completed the project!	I love your enthusiasm!  How many kids?  Is that typical for them?"
"Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?	I have, but I'm sure it was a lot of work. I never thought about it that much. I just built it."
"I recently had to attend a funeral. That's never a fun day.	That can be tough."
"Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.	That must have sucked."
"I once went to a doc appointment where I literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent 5 min with me	That's a bit of a long wait time, but at the end, the doc did make it to talk with me!"
"I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	I hate waiting!"
"Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!	I hate those people. They think they can just take up someone's time without even saying a word."
"I am waiting to take a big test coming up! I feel prepared, yet I am anxious.	That is normal. Are you taking it for school or work?"
"Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking.	That is cool that you are taking a class about data science!"
"I am taking a vacation to Orange Beach, Alabama in a week! My wife and I visited the area about two years ago, and we loved it!	I am taking a vacation next week.  I love the beach!"
"We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?	I have not been to the beach. I have been there in the summer, but I have never gone there for a vacation. I've never been to Orange Beach."
"One time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a Bed and Breakfast!	Oh wow. That's so exciting. Did you like the Bed and Breakfast?"
"We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!	I love surprises.  I hope you have many."
"It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?	I do. It's like, you can't explain why you don't know what you know you want to know, you know?"
"Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top	I do, I know exactly what you mean. I had one of my kids try to take it off and I found it so funny."
"I went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip.	That's awful! Did you run out?"
"I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.	Oh that is terrible."
"I suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party, I suspect he is going to see someone	that's not good. are you in love or just having sex thoughts?"
"I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution	That's nice of him to think about you, I bet you're looking forward to the party! What a guy you are for thinking that way."
"sure ... thanks	My sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice me.	Yeah, it's like when your siblings start bragging about you."
"I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?	That's not the best way to handle it. If you really wanted to talk about your feelings, you could tell them about the time you did the same for your sister. That might change their perspective."
"My boss finally realized all the hard work I've been doing lately.	It is good."
"Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!	That's so good. What kind is it?"
"Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.	I was on an airplane last week, and someone's baby would not stop crying. I know it isn't right to be upset about such things, but it really bothered me.	That is a little annoying."
"I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.	I love how you're self aware of it. I think it is okay to be upset about that kind of stuff. You're not the person that's causing the baby's problem to cry, and you're not the parents that are going to leave it there. You're right, though - it's still kinda irrational to be upset. But it's also kinda hard to rationalize why it bothers us as much, I think. Maybe that baby is just so used to being held and rocking"
"I was given a job offer at a new company. I decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty.	That's good of them! What did they say?"
"Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.	That is good news!  How much do your new company offer you per hour worked?"
"My grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! She is such a sweet lady.	I am so jealous."
"I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.	I'm sorry to be rude, but I think I need some time to think about how I should respond."
"A tornado blew through my town last week. My family hid in our storm shelter, but I wasn't sure if we were going to survive it unscathed.	That is awful! I live in Texas and it happened recently."
"Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.	I agree they are a scary force of nature. I've lived in this area for most of 30 plus years and I've never really experienced a tornado, so I'm a little more aware of the potential."
"Hello the plants in my garden I water them, I move the earth, I try to keep them happy	That's so cool! I love plants! What's in your garden?"
"Especially when you feel something special by nature	I have never thought of doing things like this with my garden. I just plant the plants and let them grow on their own. I don't do it like that."
"I hope this feeling increases	My wife has a big birthday coming up and I've got a great weekend all laid out for her.	I love my wife as much you love your wife."
"We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.	that's really nice."
"Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.	That's awesome! I'm glad you have such wonderful people around you!"
"Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!	That's a little better, but you should have just been honest about how you feel."
"Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.	Yeah, sometimes you just don't know if you should just tell them.  Or if they're not going anywhere anyway.  But sometimes you just need to do it for the other side.  But in this case it probably wasn't worth it.  Maybe just a lesson for not lying and just being honest, even if it hurts someone you care about!  Maybe you should just just be honest and move forward and move forward and not dwell on the memory.  It's just ice"
"Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.	It was probably just gas or a food you ate. I have been there.  I hope your coworkers are not offended.  They have to deal with the stench every day!"
"Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'	That's terrible. Did you tell them about it?"
"I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!	That sounds disgusting. I would never go to a gas station that was that dirty. I'm glad they had a good phone charger. I wouldn't have wanted to call to ask if it was okay to stay there."
"I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!	Oh my gosh, I hate when people don't know what they're talking about when it comes to bathroom maintenance. I hope they got a good tip!  :"
"I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!	That's cool, maybe it's for a home or something you're interested in. I'm glad you stole it."
"Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?	Yeah, you're probably right. It was a nice surprise gift for my wife's birthday, but I probably should have been honest. 80kwhd TV? That's not something to steal, right! Maybe I'll get her one. Or maybe I'll just tell her it was for a good friend. Or, maybe I'll just get her a good TV for herself."
"it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.	Oh wow. What kind of food do she want you read mind for?"
"Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.	I hate that. I have that issue with my wife too. I wish I wouldnt have gotten into this. It's hard to explain.  I think I am the more of the controlling partner. She wants me to read her mind and I am not good with it. I guess I am just a bad communicator about it.  I think I should just tell her I want to go to the other place she suggested and we'll go from then."
"I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.	That's so good! Did you guys go to the same college?"
"it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.	That's really cool! What kind did you do?"
"I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.	It was a chore but it was worth the effort."
"Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!	That's great that you're taking classes. How long are you in for your second class? 1 course is usually 8 weeks and another is usually 4 courses (or so I've heard from my friend who's mom is in college)"
"Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.	Yeah, that's good, it's always nice to be able afford the things you need and not have to beg."
"Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!	Yeah that's great! What are you guys planning on?"
"My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness	That is true. I'm very lucky to have good people around. I feel sad when I am alone, but with them, everything is alright. They are always there for me, no matter what."
"I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering	that's nice of them"
"Thanks for your comprehension	Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.	that sounds like it. What did you do?"
"By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.	that was a horrible experience"
"I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.	That's terrible.  Do you have any treatments for the Lupus you have?"
"No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed	That sucks. Is there anything you can do to help manage it?"
"no it is an autoimmune disease	Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"
"one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel	That is tough.  I hope you will find happiness again someday."
"is that he loved her	This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.	I hope you found the source of it."
"Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.	Yeah, that's why they put filters under sinks now."
"I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.	That's awful! Hopefully, things get better from here. What happened?"
"We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.	That sucks, but you can't control how others react to situations. You should try to make the best of future situations with her."
"If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	A lot of people are so disorganized these days. They need to get their act together. I'm a little old lady, so I've been around the block or so I thought."
"You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.	I agree with you. My upstairs neighbor is one of those people who will be woken up by the soundest of noises."
"Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.	It's not nice, but sometimes people don't know. I just tell them I love to be around people who don't mind noise and they just stop yelling at 6 or 6 and move on."
"I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!	Oh, I see! Well, if you want me to suggest something, I'd be happy to!"
"I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!	That sounds scary, but hopefully it will work out!"
"I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	I hope that works!"
"From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?	That's terrible. It's like they just don't care."
"Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.	I am so angry at these creeps. I don't know what the world is coming to when some people can't get along to begining with. I just got out of a horrible surgery and I know it's a miracle if I can ever walk right out without a huge pain in the butt lawsuit hanging over my head. I hope my lawyer can't take them down. I am going to be sick to death of all these creeps. I just can't believe some of the people"
"The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.	That's awesome! I live near the Gulf of Mexico."
"I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.	that sounds like a fun day to me too! how long have it been so warm?"
"Writing speeches makes me nervous	That does make you nervous? What is it about that that makes you nervous?  Is it the nervousness of speaking or the nervousness of making the wrong joke?"
"Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience	I agree, it takes time"
"True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say	I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days, but they always bring back fond memories	ohh that is okay. Kids can be very annoying."
"I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!	I agree, I do enjoy those movies too"
"Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react	I agree, but sometimes I just like to go back and watch them again for fun"
"Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything	I agree, sometimes I find the more recent ones are not suitable"
"Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life	I'm glad to see you having more freedom."
"Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town	I can imagine.  Did you have to work there?"
"True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.	That was my favorite, I used it for milkshrooms, burgers and more"
"Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either	Yeah, so most people work really hard, but there aren't many that really work hard enough. And most people don't work hard at all!"
"Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day	I agree. People are always doing something kind and good. I have a lot of friends that are very good at doing good for others.  I'm always trying to do good for them. I feel like people need people and sometimes that means doing good things for others."
"Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!	That's a nice thing to see! I like it."
"Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing	Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking	That was crazy! I love downhill!"
"I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill	Oh, I bet! Did you get hit?"
"Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed	When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks	That's not a man, that's a woman with a towel on!  I would have been a little more upset about it, but not as much as I would have been about a man taking a towel off his body and then just staring at you in the sauna like a maniac.  That's a woman with a towel!  I think I would be a little embarrassed, and also, I think I might be a man myself, and that's why I would have been upset"
"Yeah, I'm not good with confrontations	I agree, I'm a bit uneasy about that"
"I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong	I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!	That's great, congratulations! I'm glad you're one step closer. What department?"
"Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!	That's great news! Congrats on being one of the top performers for the district. I'm so happy that happened to you"
"How long have you been there?	I can relate to this situation. It's not very nice, right. I've been working there for a couple years now and sometimes when they want to let someone go it's a really bad thing to find out."
"I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?	I don't think I've ever been to this place before. I am not very good at talking about myself so I don't know what I'm talking about."
"My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!	That is really nice of your bank.  What happened?"
"Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.	That is awesome.  I have had that happen to me before too. I hope you use it wisely."
"If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*	I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!	Oh, congratulations! That must be great news!"
"I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.	Yeah, it is. But when it comes to gifts like that it makes you think you're getting something for something good."
"I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.	So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.	Oh man.  I would have forgotten myself."
"He kinda gave me the ""Mom, really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*	What a relief you didn't get him mad. I would have probably been upset and would have had him cry. I think I would have asked him to go to school tomorrow instead of today. I would be mad too. I would probably be like the worst parent in the world."
"I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].	I think I need to work with kids a bit to understand that.  I can understand that they have their own needs and stuff they tend not to remember."
"It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD	That's hilarious. I have to keep a list too, but I think I've lost it this week."
"I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.	Oh well I hope he enjoys the rest he probably has to eat the leftover chips from me."
"No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.	That was fun!  I have forgotten before.  I will make sure to get a bigger bag next time."
"Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*	That's funny. I'm not surprised."
"Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!	My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.	That is so kind of the landlady. I have a lot of trusty landlads."
"I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.	That's so kind of your landlady. I'm glad she was understanding."
"Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.	I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!	It's good you felt comfortable enough with the content to do well. Did you have any issues with the presentation itself?"
"I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.	that sounds awesome, what did they think of it?"
"Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.	I broke up with my boyfriend last week.	That is terrible. What happened? Did he leave you for someone better?"
"Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.	It can be tough.  I hope everything works out for you."
"Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.	I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!	That sounds great! Congratulations! I'm sure you're very excited about that. What district are you in?"
"I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL	That's awesome news to hear."
"This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!	I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!	That's wonderful!  I had a boy and a girl and both babies were perfect! I feel like it makes all the hard times worth it."
"15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?	That is the life."
"Ah, make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)	Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is, it	that sucks, did you call them back?"
"Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!	It happens, we all make mistakes sometimes."
"The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!	That does happen, right?"
"It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks.	Yeah i think thats pretty normal to do, especially if they are older, but its always good."
"The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.	Yeah, sometimes you just get those days where you're like ""man, what is going on with me?!"" But sometimes you're like ""no way, you're just having it tough. It's okay. You're not crazy!""  And then you just go on your way with it.  You're right!  You're not crazy!"
"It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving.	Oh, that's hilarious. Did you end the day with any purchases?"
"really didnt want to anything for days	Oh? really? Why?"
"I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it"".	Oh no! That's terrible! What happened? Did you fail?"
"it is indeed. wont happen again though	I was attending a conference and heard the minister speak. he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district"".	Oh wow. What kind conference was it?"
"it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now	I love it! I'm always looking to move to new places and I think it's always good to meet new people and learn about the world they come from"
"I feel uneasy because I don't know if I will be able to save enough money in time	That is bad news."
"Baby is due in less than 3 months	I am sure everything goes well for you both then."
"I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me	I hate waiting for exams. It takes forever! But, it's worth waiting for right?"
"5 months to find out !	That's frustrating, but you'll do great."
"I tried so hard for that exam, when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!	That must have been so exciting!"
"thanks. now onto bigger things	That's great! Did you do good in school before taking the test?"
"starting a clinic	it was the grand opening for our restaurant. The whole town was there. almost double the number of people we were expecting	Oh, I'm sorry. Did everything run smoothly?"
"thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town	that's pretty awesome, what did they serve for lunch?"
"I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this	Oh, that is terrible! What happened? Did you try dating anyone?"
"Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym	That's great you've changed your perspective."
"I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change	That's good. Change can be a stress."
"Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.	That is good. I am glad you are happy. What is it?  Is it food or something?"
"I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline	oh, okay. Good for that. How much exercise do you plan on doing?"
"I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing	That's a good attitude. What kind of goals do you want to achieve?"
"the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls	That's terrible. Did you contact your insurance and ask about the issue?"
"Last week. we're in temporary housing now	oh no i hope they pay out asap, that must be so upsetting!"
"I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!	That's terrible. What did he do? Did you guys never meet?"
"I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.	That's awful. Did he get found out of hand?"
"I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.	That must be great, to catch her up"
"Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.	Oh, nice! What kind book is that?"
"I can't find another way to earn money	That's frustrating, what did you do?"
"I just want to work from home	I am working from home right now, I wish I didn't."
"I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now	I love babies!  What kind of toys does your baby boy like?"
"You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap	That sounds exciting! I've never had a baby boy. How are they progressing so quickly?"
"I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials	That can be stressful. I hope everything works well for you."
"I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back	I hope everything works out.  It's always hard to save up for a baby."
"She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.	I bet that she was."
"Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors	That sounds awful! How long were they dating?"
"I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding	That is the problem of not having patience."
"I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again	That can happen, but it sounds like you're being understanding about it"
"I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.	It's great that she's learning and having fun!"
"She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.	That must've been fun for her though! I hope she loves it and gets a lot of use!"
"I did so much practice running in preparation for my 50 metre sprint race at my school!	That's really cool! I've never run a sprint race before. Did you run well at all?"
"I do! I am so motivated to win and I believe I am one of the fastest at my school.	Oh, wow! That is awesome! What kind school is this? Is this for the school championship or just a competition? I want to run!"
"I feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro	I have never been there. What games? Are they on consoles?"
"Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation	I know what you're talking about, man. Those games are so much fun to play on my nintendo.  I wish we had more nostalgia for the old days."
"I was so scared of going onto the train!	I don't blame you. I'm not too fond myself. What happened?"
"No but I hate going in objects that travel fast, I really did not want to go on it.	I know right? I hate going on trains too, but they're so convenient to get around."
"I am going to get us a new car!	I bet! What kind of car do you want?"
"I'm not sure yet. Maybe a Toyota	That sounds awesome. Are you going with a Toyota?"
"I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.	Oh that movie was good. What movie was it?"
"She loved it.  She's 17, I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.	That's awesome. I haven't really thought of it in a long time since."
"I can't seem to feel happy but I'm not depressed	What makes you unhappy? Do you think it has to do anything to with your health or something?"
"I just feel kinda stuck in life	I feel your feelings, I feel you."
"I had pizza at a restaurant a couple days ago and found a hair on my pizza!	I bet!  What kind of hair?"
"I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.	That is a gross mistake. I would never order food there."
"I finally got a new bike! I've been wanting one for so long!	That sounds like fun! What kind of bike did you get?"
"I hope so, my new bike has so many gears. Such an upgrade from my last one! I can't wait to take it out.	I've been waiting forever too! I think I need one now!"
"Pretty soon I'll be taking over my parents mortgage.  Homeownership is on the horizon.	That sounds exciting! Congratulations on the new chapter!"
"A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.	Yeah, it will be nice to be a homeowner and not have to worry about rent anymore!"
"I'm the only one who cares about paying bills. It's very frustrating	That's okay, you should talk to your employer about it"
"Unfortunately no. It's very hard on me because I have to be disciplined with spending. Makes life very boring	That sucks, but it can't be easy either."
"I have a beautiful gray cat named Stormy.  Unfortunately she's contracted feline AIDS.	that is terrible"
"Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.	That's so sad!"
"I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid.	Oh well! That's okay! You can always ask your professor for an extension or ask your professor for a meeting!"
"I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.	oh thats so sad.  computer work is for some.  i work at a computer all day.  i think you should try getting an actual paper copy of the work done."
"I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.	That's really cool. What's in the picture of Great Grandma?"
"Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young.	that's really sweet of them"
"I got a letter from my parents this past Friday with a wonderul surprise in it.	Oh? What was it?"
"Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous, but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with.	That's so sweet! What did they get you?  Did you go on vacation?"
"Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town, I was a bit scared.	Oh, what happened? Did something terrible happen?"
"I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.	That's good you listened to yourself and are more safe now!"
"When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything.	I can imagine! Did you get in trouble for it?"
"No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now.	that's terrible, I hope you learned something from it"
"I was one percent off from passing my math test, I was devastated.	That's terrible."
"I agree, I should of studied harder too. Practice makes perfect!	Yeah I was in the same boat. I studied hard but still failed the test."
"Last night I was minding my own business walking down a street in a not so good area of town when someone started to chase me!	That's scary! I would have run away from that person. I don't know what they wanted, but I don't like them!"
"I managed to get away after a few smart quick turns, but I was shaking and in fear at the end of the chase. It was wild.	I am sorry you had to go that way."
"I was looking through old stuff in my basement and found my old baseball cards! Finding those was like being a kid all over again!	oh man!  That is amazing.  I had no idea I still have them.  I used to collect baseball cards and have so much of them!"
"I used to collect so many when I was younger, it was such an awesome feeling to see them again!	I'm sure that was awesome. What kind of baseball did you collect the cards of?"
"I was feeling so optimistic about getting a new job at Houston a while back	I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? Did you get it?"
"Yeah actually, i am still working on it. So much fun!	That is good. What are you working on?"
"I was so much in awe when i saw Hamilton!	That's such an amazing play by Linny I have seen so many."
"Neither, i am talking about the broadway show :D	That's pretty amazing. Have you seen the show before or is this your first time seeing it on Broadway."
"I went to the beach other day.. such an awesome feeling standing there	I know right! It was so relaxing!"
"I most certainly did.. There is something about looking at the calm and glory of the ocean.	I agree.  The calm and tranquility of the beach is very relaxing and calming"
"I felt so bad about cheating on my science exam, it was terrible	I feel you, I cheated on an English exam."

"I'm taking my wife out this coming weekend to dance.	That's a fun way to spend time together! What kind are they going dance to?"
"We haven't been able to go out in quite a long time.  Family and life stuff just gets in the way sometimes.	That sounds like fun.  What are you doing with dance classes?"

"I always get sad thinking about my dad.	I feel for that. My father passed away 2 weeks before my wedding."
"Yeah.. he did. He had cancer.	I'm sorry about that.  I hope he is okay now."
"I went to the beach other day	Oh that's so boring. What happened?"

"I was so happy that i got to see Hamilton the other day	That's cool! What show was that of?  I have never seen anything like that!"
"Yeah, the same. Lin Manuel is a genius to say the least!	Yeah, he's a genius!  He should be on Broadway!"
"I went to visit my family the other day	That's always fun. What did you do?  Did you go to the beach or something fun?"
"It was such a joyful experience. They always warm my heart	Oh wow, what kind family is it with. I haven't been able to see my parents in a while, so I feel bad you had such an experience"
"A dog chased me through a street the other day	That is crazy! What happened?"

"I feel so caring of my little sister	That's very kind of you"
"Yeah.. I always look out for her no matter what the problem is	That's so kind of you! I'm happy for you. How's your relationship like with your little sister?  Is she older or younger than you?  I have a little sister who's 4 years old and my 2-year-old. They're best of the best."
"I was really nervous when i went to meet my girl's parents	I hate meeting the parents.  I've had to do that for my parents and it's always a little scary."
"It turned out well actually, we had a nice time	I was at my parents house for the first time. It turned out well. What a lovely experience."
"A dog chased me through our street last night	That's crazy. Did you run?"

"I really envy people who can sing	I'm sorry.  What kind was your singing style?"
"Yeah.. i did. i never got the chance to pursue that	What kind of singing do you do?"
"I had to leave the house for a bit, before I left I gave my kids instructions on what I wanted them to do around the house.	That sounds like they would have a blast playing and cleaning up around there on their own."
"I figured they would just goof off.  However; when I returned all chores were comples.  I was pretty impressed.	Oh wow! That is quite impressive. I would have loved that kind of control and authority over my kids. I bet it made them feel great to have you be the boss man of the man."
"i found a bunch of dead mice the other day	Oh no! What did you do?"
"it was! i felt sick seeing that	I am sure it made you feel sick too."
"how sweet. bless you!	I don not understand. why?"
"5	Oh man, I am happy for you."
"5	My Mother came into town unannounced.  She hardly ever does that.	That sounds so exciting! How long was it going on for?"
"No.  Thankfully it was just a visit.  She took us all to dinner, it was nice.	That's so kind of your mom"
"i was so furious when i found out that my best friend and girl friend had made out	That must've sucked! How long you two been friends?"
"I have not confronted them. I am still thinking over it.	I know how you're saying that, it really makes you mad.  But sometimes it's not the confrontation itself but the aftermath that makes it even. I know what it did for me and it made my best friend mad at first but it made me realize that sometimes the things that are the best for you are the things that you need to deal with first."
"A big brown roach crawled across the floor in my direction last night.	Oh that sucks. Did you kill it?"
"Yes, but this one didn't fly.  He just decided to go under the chair I was sitting in.	That must've been so annoying!"
"My bills and mortgage payment is coming up soon.  I not sure if I can cover them all.	That would be stressful."

"i felt so guilty after lying to my girlfriend	That can be so painful."
"I kissed a mutual friend of ours. I lied when she checked up on me. It was a one time thing, i did not wanted to hurt her.	That must have been difficult for her."
"I once lied about kissing the most popular girl at my school. and my friend found out about it	that's crazy! why would you do such things?"
"I was, so very much! I avoided my friends for a whole week thenafter	that sucks"
"My four year old daughter came up and told me she thought I needed a big hug and kiss.	That must have been so nice."

"I felt so very nervous after i agreed to meet my girlfriend's parents	That can happen. What was it for?"
"Well, i lost a few pounds on the weeks leading upto it. But the actual meeting went well	That must have been nerve-wracked! What did they think of?  Did everything work well?"
"I have always wanted to join a college faculty.  I went to school to study philosophy for that reason.	I have never been to college."
"Unfortunately not.  In the end I ran out of money and had to leave that dream behind.	That's terrible. Did you ever try to go back to school to get your master's?"
"I feel so sad this time of the year. My dad passed away this time last year	What happened to him? Did he pass away suddenly?"
"I'm sorry? Are you still talking about the cops?	I know. He passed in February."
"I feel heartbroken whenever i see a picture of my dog	That's understandable, dogs bring us joy"
"It is ok.. She passed away few months ago	My son and I went to the track yesterday to run.	I have never run track before. How fast can kids go?"
"No, but he did end up puking all over the parking lot afterwards.	That stink, I hate running!"
"That is really cool. i bet it felt nice watching those	That's a good question!"
"I envy people who can dance really well	Yes I can't dance but I try my hardest"
"I was stunned with fear to find a rattlesnake right where i was about to step into last week	That's crazy! Did you get rid it?"
"I stood there speechless for a moment, turned back and ran for my life!	That's crazy! Did you hit the ground hard after?"
"Needing some extra money, I used the spare change in my car to buy a scratch off ticket.	I love those. What kind did you buy?"
"It was Blackjack.  I didn't win anything though.	that's cool, what did you end up winning?"
"I once ate a piece of cake, it was old.  After the first bite I noticed spots of mold on it.	That's gross! Did you throw up afterwards?"
"No I spit it out and listerined my mouth.	oh wow, i can't stand old food"

"I am so angry to see so much fake news floating around in the media	I hate fake news! It makes me so angry!"
"Very true! Why does news have to be so hyped up?	I am so with you! I am tired of seeing people believe fake news over real news. It is like watching a train wreck."
"My little girl loves to wake up at night and ask for chocolate milk.	That's a pretty common thing kids do."
"I have an 18 year old doing the same.  What my 4 year old doesn't know is I giver her the sugar free version.	That's cute. I have two kids too."
"I lost a good job a few years back	I'm sure that's not a good thing. I lost my job a few weeks before retirement."
"The company got bought by someone else and we all got laid off.  Lost my family home and all.  But things are slowly improving.	That is a tough spot."
"So i used to shop in walmart and i thought it was the cheapest place to shop at but yesterday i went grocery shopping at aldi's and i was so surprised to see how much cheaper it is to shop there	oh, aldy is it?"
"you should give it a try! They have their own brands which are super cheap and the quality is great	That's true, and I used to shop at Target."

"He had lung cancer..	I'm sorry for your loss. I know how that goes, but it's hard."
"My friends are saying my girlfriend is cheating behind my back, but i trust her	I am so jealous. Is she cheating on her ex-boyfriend?"
"May be. But i have known her all my life, she would die before going behind my back	That's so frustrating. I can see why you are trusting her though, you have known her all your life."
"I have a lot of stuff coming up due this month.  I also have a lot of purchasing goals as well.  I am confident I will be able to meet all of them.	That's a lot of things to accomplish."

"It is the broadway show, by Lin manuel miranda	that's cool you liked it"
"My dog started walking again after an accident she had	That is so nice of her."
"She fell down from the first floor..	Oh wow. That must have been a relief for you."
"I used to be a member of a very cool dance crew. I miss those days	I bet! What was it?"
"mostly hip hop. We were travelling and battling with other teams. It was really fun	That's cool, what type of crew?"
"i wan to participate in a bodybuilding contest! I'm sure i will win it!	That's a fun event. What are you training for specifically for it?"
"That's not true! I'm actually vegan and I don't make steroids and I looks pretty amazing. I don't need to use none to participate or win	I am very jealous of those bodybuilders."
"I felt so proud when my son got good grades in school last month	That's awesome. I'm not really into sports or school, I'm more of of a ""work hard, play hard"" type."
"Oh alright then, feel good	i feel alone whenever i think about my dad, he passed away last year	I'm sorry. That is tough."
"yeah.. i know.. memories still haunt though..	I feel you. I lost a family pet, but it is a different kind of loneliness."
"I was really nervous when my girl asked me to meet her parents	That's always a nervous moment, but it's always worth meeting the in-laws.  What did you guys do?"
"I was really close to running away, but i somehow managed to pull it off	That's so exciting! What happened next?"
"my friend bought a big house and i'm happy for her but at the same time i'm a little bit jealous	I bet that's normal for you and your friendships."
"true, but there is so much space for her kid to run and play at and I live in a tiny apartment with my son	That is understandable. I am sure you are happy for her. I know it is hard to let go of a big move."
"I was so mad when i found out my cousin asked out my girlfriend once	That's a little weird, what did he/she say?  How did you react?  Did you tell them to just leave her be or what.  Did you guys break things off and stuff?"
"Sort of, yes. He did it anyways. I yelled at him.	That must've hurt. What did you yell at him about?"
"I feel happy when I am outside in nature	That sounds wonderful!"
"I love to garden. Organic gardening, I plant peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and a bunch of other goodies.	oh nice"
"Just get outside and started playing / digging  in the dirt, You will soon catch on to what works for you.	i was so in awe when i saw hamilton	Oh yeah! What show is that?"
"It was really awesome dude, the full show covers it all up	That's a really unique production."
"I took my daughter out to the skate park today.	That's a fun day! Did she enjoy it?"
"Awesome! She went down the big ramp today for the first time. It was so cool.	That was awesome! What age?"
"It really bothers me when people come into where we live at night and ride their dirt bikes	That does, and it's usually just kids trying it."
"There is many paths leading to faith	Oh, I understand. I live near the woods so I have to be aware of the possibility of dirt bikes coming into the area at all times of night."
"It takes a path to find ones faith	Are you a parent.	yea i have a son of three and i have a daughter of two, they are my favorite"
"When you become one, you will never forget the day it happens. You'll weep of happiness.	that sounds nice, i am not a parent yet, but will be soon!  I think I will be happy when my kids go off to school. I'm a teacher."
"I think i have anxiety attacks! I didn't even know that anxiety causes some physical pain. like the other day i felt like somebody was chocking me	That's terrible. What happened? Did you try anything?"
"yes! And i felt like that for 3 days on and off!	That's awful. Did you try anything to help you relax?"
"We planned our honeymoon and booked a flight but I was so nervous about flying.	That can be nerve racking. Did you end up having a safe flight?"
"I found that out, after many sleepless nights. Now we fly all the time and I love it. I feel kind of silly.	I was too nervous about flying. I hope you have many fun times!"
"My sister recently paid off her house. I felt so envious of her as I've been trying to pay mine down.	oh thats so good"
"I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal, and I genuinely am pleased she did it!	I know you feel the way you do."
"I used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating.	I bet that!"
"Yes, but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly, it was more about my own insecurities than about him, you know? As I grew more into myself, the jealousy loosened its hold.	That's really sweet of your boyfriend."
"My daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us.	It's so hard when you have to deal with a lot of people and a lot of noise, but it's good that you have a good group of people!"
"I prepared for weeks. I could not wait for them to get here. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen them and they have a new baby.	That's great! Did they come right on?"
"I cosigned a loan with my son, expecting he would make the payments and he has let me down by being late every month.	That's a tough place."
"I've helped me create a repayment plan where I have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me. I just really feel frustrated because he has the money, but he wastes it.	Oh, that's bad. He probably should've just saved up instead of taking on debt.  I would talk to him about why.  Maybe he can explain it to me.  I think he might have a financial literacy issue or something else going on that he's not aware of, and maybe it's a pattern.  Maybe he just needs to learn how to handle finances better.  Maybe he just needs to be more responsible and responsible.  Maybe.  Maybe he needs some"
"I was anticipating a great weight loss after my first week on my diet!	That's great! I'm sure the weight will come soon! I have to get back into shape too. What diet is it you are following?"
"I lost 7 pounds! I am SO thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long.	It was challenging to follow the plan all week long.  What is the plan?  I am curious about that.  I have tried a similar plan and it was a challenge.  I think I might need some advice on that.  I would say start by getting a good nutritionist.  Then you could start with a simple diet.  I started by getting rid of the foods I liked and I started by eating a lot more vegetables and fruits."
"I have felt some of the best moments of pure happiness seeing someone I love getting something they've worked hard for -- like my daughter's acceptance into her college and major of choice!	Wow that sounds amazing. What college is she going?"
"Absolutely! Of course, now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah, so happy for her!	That's really nice! I hope you get to experience that with someone else someday."
"I was disappointed when I realized someone close to me was not who I thought they were.	I hate when that. Did they do it on social media?"
"Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own ""vision"" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know?	I understand, it is easy to see others flaws.  I once knew a man.  I thought him a good man.  But he did a terrible job on his wife.  He cheated her out.  He cheated me too.  It was very hard to accept.  I felt guilty."
"I've definitely worked through that! Happily, it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)	I recently met up with a friend I had not seen in a while. I want to see him again soon and I think I will!	That sounds great! What a nice reunion!"
"I agree. We went to high school and middle school together.	That's really cool! Did you go back to your hometown recently?"
"In college I studied very hard for an upcoming exam that I was very interested in getting a very high score. I was confident that I did so.	That's so awesome! Did you end up doing okay?  Did you study enough?"
"I was very excited with my result. I am very competitive. Sometimes I wish I were not so competitive.	I understand the drive and competition in college. It's good to have that drive."
"You are completely right. It is very important to not lose sight of what is important in life.	A have a friend that is going to be visiting me this week! I cannot wait!	I love when you get to see your friends."
"She was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south.	That's so cool! What's the plan for your visit with your friend?"
"I am currently dealing with epilepsy unfortunately, and the doctors have not found a treatment yet.	That's terrible.  Have you tried any treatments yet?"
"Thanks. I have to go to a Monitoring Unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location. Not going to be fun.	That's terrible.  I hope they can find something."
"Thanks again. I have lots of support so I am fortunate	I've felt so incredibly sad whenever we've had to say goodbye to any of our dogs.	That is so sad. I know that I have lost a few of my dogs in the years I've been around."
"I know -- I needed to just come out and say ""when we had to put them down"". Always age or illness related -- but man, SO tough.	I understand. I hope you get through this. It's not easy saying it out. I have lost a few myself too. They are always hard to let go. I just hope they're in a better state than when I found out. That makes it even harder. I just try to think about the rest of the time we had with them, and the memories we have created together. I try not to think about the time they are going to be with me no more."
"My friend has been on the couch for a few weeks. He is getting under my skin now.	That is annoying, I hope you talk it over with her and get her back to normal."
"No, he is a friend that recently got fired and needs some help.	I've been on a couch a lot too. I'm not sure if he is trying to escape or try to escape from something else, I hope it's the former"
"I have been trying to lose weight in a group and while i made it to 4 lbs, my friends made it to 15. :(	That sucks. I've tried that too. I'm not sure if it's better or worse that they made more weight loss. I think that they made it easier. I made it harder. I don't know how to feel better. 15 lbs. That's a lot!"
"i guess they worked harder but	oh no! i bet that's disappointing"
"I went on a road trip with some friends. We had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping, too!	That's cool. Did you guys have any crazy or fun experiences on your trip?"
"Yes, sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more.	I bet that was fun! What did they do on their trip?"
"We paid 600$ for a cruise, but they canceled it with not refunds one week before. so mad	That's terrible.  What happened?"
"we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company, so they dont know what they're in for	Oh wow, I would have demanded more money.  What kind cruise did you go on?"
"I had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago. I wonder if I will see her again any time soon.	that's great"
"We went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends.	That is so nice!"
"I live alone. Sometimes it can be hard with nobody around.	That's understandable, what kind do you live in?"
"I think that's a great idea. I will try to go out this weekend.	That is nice.  You are going out with friends?"
"I saw a huge spider in my car yesterday. I scared me so!	That is a scary thing to have in your car!  I'm glad I was driving."
"I stopped the car and got out and ushered it out of the car.	I'm sure that spider is going straight back to its spiderhole somewhere."
"I hope that this summer I can go to Florida with my family	That's always a fun time."
"Summer is not over until Labor Day! We still have the whole month of August!!	I can't wait! I'm going with my family for vacation!  It's a 3 hour drive from my house!"
"Summer can be over in July for teachers sometimes. Are you a teacher?	My roommate eats my food sometimes. This makes me so angry!	That's not very nice of your.  Maybe you can find another roomate?"
"I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.	It's annoying. But I guess it's not the end world."
"I recently lost my sister to breast cancer. She was very young and has left three little girls. I have been devastated.	That sucks. I hope the cancer doesn't come back."
"My parents health has deteriorated rapidly, and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.	That sounds like a tragedy."
"It's why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own.	I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can't always get what you want.	I understand that, but it's hard to accept rejection when you want it so badly!"
"Life is not fair, but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with	I completely agree with you, it's hard to accept sometimes, but life is what it is, we should try and do our part in making the best of the life"
"I'm a little anxious about an upcoming move. It's to a *very* different state with a *very* different climate and way of life!	That's exciting! What kind are you moving for?"
"We've been great with change, including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot, and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man, those looooong winters!	That's awesome that you and the wife have been through it so many times. I'm sure it's going to work for them."
"Ha! Not likely in the city....but hey...who knows! I WILL use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski.	That is awesome! I hope you enjoy your time!  It's going to be cold"
"The economy has been doing well. The future looks bright.	I know right!  We're really on a great economic roll right?"
"Hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations.	I'm so excited for the future!"
"My sister unfortunately will not seek help for her alcohol problems, and she will not even admit to them. I am extremely sad apprehensive about what might happen to her.	That's awful, what can be done to change her mind?  Do she know that it's going to make her worse to not?  Has she ever tried to stop?"
"I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention, but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.	Yeah, I think she might have a problem with addiction, or maybe even a drinking problem, but she's too scared to seek help. I'm trying to be supportive and help her, but I wish others around me could see the potential in her that could change her life for the better, if only she'd just take a step back."
"It was still so unexpected when my husband and I -- who were open to getting pregnant -- found out that we actually were!	Oh wow! Congratulations. What kind was it?"
"Oh, that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day, Halloween, visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.	That's awesome!"
"The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful, in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!	Oh, that's a lovely story. I bet the baby beluga was adorable!"
"The horror film I saw last night can cause nightmares. It was so scary!	Oh my, was it a scary movie?"
"I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.	I've heard that. I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight."
"My daughter was accepted into Harvard. She starts in the fall.	I am so proud. That is amazing."
"She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!	it's cool"
"My friend purchased a new car. The ride is sweet!	I love the word ""sweet!"" What car did your friend get?"
"They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.	that is awesome news"
"I graduated college recently. I'm so glad!	That's such awesome news! I am sure you are very excited about it!"
"I majored in environmental engineering!	That sounds cool."
"I cheated on my girlfriend recently. I feel horrible about myself right now.	I would never do that to my partner, why? Because you know how much it hurt when that happens."
"I plan on coming clean at some point, but I'm not sure how to break the news.	I understand, it's hard to admit mistakes. But you should try to be honest with yourself and with her. It is the first time you are admitting to a wrong, and you can learn a lesson from this."
"I can not wait until some of my family come in to town. They will be coming in to town in two weeks.	That's exciting! What are they coming for?  Are you expecting a visit?"
"I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.	I am sure they will have some crazy story to share with you guys"
"I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.	oh, high school. good times"
"Yes, I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.	I'm sorry, I think I got the text wrong. I thought you had some good friends in high school. I thought you were a lonker kid who didn't like anyone. I was the one who always left school early."
"I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!	yea horror movies are the worst"
"A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.	Oh no! What was it? Did you watch a horror film?"
"I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary	That's so sweet. Where was that place?"
"Yes, it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.	That's awesome! Where did you go on your last visit?"
"I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.	I'm so sorry to hear, I've heard about that. I've had a few of our dogs go through heart issues, it's really a tough time. I lost my first one, I was so sad. I've been trying to get my daughter involved, but it's really hard. I just don't understand it yet."
"Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much	That's so nice of you. I have a 2-year old Chihuahuas and I understand the love and the loss you feel. I hope everything gets okay with you."
"I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.	That was a shock."
"We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.	It's going to take years for the damage to stop being noticed"
"Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!	that is no good.  How did they react?"
"Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.	Oh man, that sounds terrible.  I hope it heals correctly and you can go visit them soon!"
"Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions	I love my family"
"No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance	That's awesome! What did you do in Alabama?"
"I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight.	It is bad when your team loses because you worked together."
"Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad!	It happens a lot in projects like this, but I guess that's why teamwork is so important. I hope you got it done in time for your deadline though, and hope your team is understanding."
"I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.	That must have scared you? I don't like bees either"
"I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.	I understand the frustration, but maybe take precautions and wear gloves when mowering the yard!"
"Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing.	that's really cool. are you safe now?"
"It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!	That would scare the pants out me as well, but at the end I have cash on my credit cards, and that would have been good."
"Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.	I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times	That's so cool! Did you ride horses again after you left them?  Did they grow?"
"A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse	that's so cool"
"Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work.	The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.	That is awesome! You must have a lot to carry around there!"
"I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.	That must have been frustrating.  I've never had one flat in my entire life.  I've gotten some flat tires too, so I'm glad you didn't have to deal with that."
"One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.	That's so brave of them! Did you jump out of hand?"
"Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.	That must have been very scary!"
"My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!	Oh that's awesome!"
"I am, but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here, bored stupid! I know, I'm being selfish.	That sucks, you could try to visit there and meet up with Kris and see if you can't go together. It might not be the same but it could be fun to try out your golf skills in a beautiful setting."
"I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.	I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!	That is exciting! Where you moving to from?"
"Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!	I can't even begin to imagine moving. Are you excited or are there fears about leaving family?"
"I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate	I do too! I like to do a few times a day.  I feel very relaxed when that happens!  What do you meditate on?"
"No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy.	that sounds good"
"My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis	Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.	That would be pretty creepy. Did you call the police?"
"Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.	That must have been frightening. I always lock up my house and keep the doors closed, especially in an area where there are no windows on the ground level"
"I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.	oh wow that sucks, did he or did he not do it at all?"
"Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.	That sucks. Did they explain themselves?"
"I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.	That is terrible. What happened? Did you fail your presentation class or did you just freak out and run away from your desk and hide under your bedspread and underpants"
"Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.	I feel for that. I would have probably done the same thing."
"I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!	That's really nice of the man, how long was it taking?"
"Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.	That's awesome you're so happy to live in such a wonderful place."
"Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!	I'm a golf fanatic myself!"
"I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.	I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.	Oh wow. What happened?"
"Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck	I hope so for you!"
"Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!	So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.	That's terrible! Did they get upset?"
"Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.	That's horrible. Did you apologize and try to make up for it?"
"I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.	It's always better to remember happy times than stressful ones, but I understand your point."
"Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha	I feel you. I wish things were easier for me back."
"I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.	That is very cool. I think that's what we all want. We want to be happy, we don't want to feel unhappy or unloved"
"I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.	That's great. I'm a trainer myself. What kind of company are you working for?  I work with a company called Team Building Games."
"I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.	oh man, thats harsh. i would probably just go and find a different place to go"
"I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!	I feel for the friend."
"Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.	That is funny. You should have him over at for dinner sometime. I'm not sure he'd like it, but I'm sure you'd like having him over for dinner sometime."
"Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!	I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.	That's awesome! What lottery did they win at?"
"She won $5,000 and never offered to share.	That must have been fun to wait to see if your number was on the winning ticket!  I hope she's happy though"
"I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.	That's great! What kind exam was it for?"
"I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.	That's good you studied well and that's good that a group helped. That is really smart of them."
"I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.	I know that sounds exciting! I bet it's. What are you going to do with it all the limestone?"
"Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on	It's a big deal for your and for the environment."
"I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!	That's crazy! What happened next?"
"Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.	That was scary!"
"Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said ""Good morning. Can't sleep either?"" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!	My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	I am sure that is hard."
"Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?	I do move far away sometimes, but it's usually just a short distance.  I can usually move my things online."
"I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.	I am so sorry to hear that. What happened? Was it an important presentation?"
"There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.	Well you will get through this thing"
"Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!	That can be annoying!  I don't understand why you'd get annoyed.  They just honked.  It's just a car, after all.  I honk at my car drivers all day, too."
"Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe	It does make things even more dangerous. I hate it when people cut you off"
"I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.	That's good news. What are you going for in this field of engineering?"
"I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?	I have, but I was accepted into a program at my university that was for computer engineering. I was so excited to be accepted! I'm going to start in August. I've never been accepted to electrical before, so I'm a little worried."
"I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.	That is so scary! Was it a tornado?"
"Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!	That is terrible, I hope everyone is safe. I hope you can relax now that the storm is over."
"I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.	It is indeed very unfortunate. It is not like he was a bad guy, but he had his own way."
"Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.	It really is a tragic disease and it seems to affect everyone differently. I'm sorry you lost a loved one"
"It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.	My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.	That sounds kinda weird. Did something weirdly interesting happen?"
"I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.	Oh! That sounds awesome! I bet you were proud!"
"I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!	Oh no! What happened? Did something go terribly awry?"
"I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?	I do! I go there every summer."
"I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.	That's really smart. How long have you been saving?"
"That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.	that's good to hear. what kind of things happen that require an emergency fund?"
"We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.	That is so sweet of your sister!"
"Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.	that's a fun time"
"I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.	I would tell my dog to stop."
"That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!	That sounds really upsetting.  I hope that it wasn't the first one to do so.  I hope you are okay."
"I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.	I agree, I watch too much TV."
"Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.	That can be so hard to get out of, but sometimes it helps to remember a different time in your life when things are not so sad."
"Nah, I don't get to to bad.	I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!	That is a fun place to be!  Are you going on vacation or just visiting?  Where is your family from?"
"I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa?	I went in Tampa last week. I am very excited for Busch Gardens next week."
"Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.	That makes a good point."
"This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.	Yeah, kids are pretty clueless.  I dropped my candy bar on the ground and it was gone in a second.  I guess I'll go buy some more candy."
"Not even a little.	I would never eat that candy bar. It's probably rotten."
"I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.	Oh that's really good of them! What kind are it?"
"Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems	That's awesome that they let you give medicine to them, I hope they don't get worse!"
"I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house	That must have been scary."
"It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.	its bad.  i bet it was scary"
"Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.	I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.	oh, you were in high school? I bet it brought back good memories."
"Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.	Yeah, that's cool. It's good to have those memories from the past."
"I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.	I love when family comes to visit! What city is this house located?"
"No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?	I bet you do! I wish you all the fun times with them! I've been away for a while so I know what you're going through."
"I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.	oh my golly, what did they do?"
"She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.	that's so cool! I've never been much of a dance fan."
"You know you could still do it. I know you can.	That's so cool! What kind did she do?  Was it something like a dance or something else?"
"My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.	That sounds like fun.  Did you guys have fun moving everything?"
"He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!	That's awesome that your son helped out."
"You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.	that's awesome! what job?"
"It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.	I'm sure you'll do just great, good for you to get that job."
"I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.	that stunk, hope you threw it"
"Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.	That's disgusting that it was in the back of the refrigerator."
"Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.	Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.	That sounds like fun! I have always wanted to open up my own retail store."
"It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.	Yeah, sometimes the small ones do a better business than the big ones."
"I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her.	That sounds fun! What store is she working at?"
"I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!	Oh wow. How old was baby when they first moved?"
"It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!	That must've been challenging! I hope everything worked out for you guys though. Did you move to a different area?"
"Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!	That's amazing! What was it like living abroad?"
"I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.	I am sorry to hear that. I hope you get back to good health soon."
"Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.	That sounds like you have been through some struggles.  Hopefully, you're back on the road soon.  I know you have great family watching out over you."
"I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.	that they made the wrong choice is a good thing."
"We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!	I agree, and it's sad to me how many people rationalize bad behavior."
"Me too! <fist bump> ;-)	So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.	That's rude. Did they meet online or in person before that long?"
"He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.	I would have told me."
"I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.	That stunk. I have done the exact thing before and it was a nightmare."
"I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?	You should have a fight back. I had a fight back the other day too. I cut off the person, but I got a ticket anyway. I felt so annoyed."
"You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.	I'm sorry to hear. I've lost my brother-in-law a year after his wife passed away. He had not been feeling right for a long."
"She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.	It's not easy to lose anyone, especially a sister."
"I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.	I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.	That's frustrating, but it will come around.  Keep at your current pace."
"Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too.	I feel for that, I was there.  I was job hunting for years and never got a call. It took me 6 months to finally get the call from the company I ended up working.  I worked there for 2 months.  I'm trying to stay positive and keep trying different jobs and find something that will work for the next year."
"One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.	That's really exciting!  Congratulations!  What are her plans for after graduation?"
"She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year.	Yeah, it can be really hard."
"June and July are very busy, June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.	That's so cool! What are some plans?"
"So much for relaxing during the summer?	I can't imagine relaxing in June."
"Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.	That is amazing. Did you get scared while sky diving?"
"It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.	I've done sky diving. I'm not sure if I did it right. I'm 20 years old and I did it for the first time this year. I think I might have done it in the right order, though!"
"You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.	That is so nice. I love doing my prayers. I hope to do it every single day. I think that will help me to be good and kind.  What about the prayers? How do they help?"
"I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food	That's really interesting. I've never tried it myself. Do you eat any fish?"
"I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all	That's awesome. I love to be kinder to my body and the environment. What kind are your favorite foods to eat now that you have started?  Do you eat fruits and veggies every single day?"
"I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.	It is so hard to deal."
"oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great	When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.	That is good of you. It is always tough when someone is going through that."
"I was and she was had a full recovery.	I bet that was hard to watch her go through. I'm sorry. Did she have kids after her cancer was treated?"
"Me neither, my mom means so much to me.	That's so kind. I wish I had someone like her."
"Do you get to see your mom often?	I do. My parents divorced and I was very upset. But I know they were just stressed. They were so stressed and I felt like they didn't want to be around anymore. So I stayed with my friends and family. And then I went back to my parents. And now I visit my parents a lot."
"I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!	That sounds awesome! What made you so excited about it?"
"It was blue with white racing stripes.	Yeah that is a pretty cool."
"Same here, they are pretty expensive.	My dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day. Now I have to throw them out.	That sucks! I have never lost my shoes. What did you get your dog to chew up instead of your shoes?"
"This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.	Oh, well, at least it's not the first time she's chewed up your shoes!"
"My wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner.	Wow that sounds delicious! What did she cook up for dinner for you two of?"
"She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert.	That sounds like a very special dinner!"
"Thank you! What is your favorite meal?	That was so sweet of your friend. What's the best meal of your day?"
"Me too, do you have a favorite flavor?	My long term boyfriend and I broke up recently. I'm so lost right now.	That's tough.  What do you think you're lost about."
"I know, it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together.	I feel for ya, how long were you together for?"
"My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry.	That is great. What kind dinner did you make for them?"
"He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.	What made you want to go over?"
"I got a promotion in work. I am so excited for the raise and added responsibility.	I get excited too"
"Thank you, I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.	that's great, how much more will it give you?"
"I work in the military	My daughter can say so many new words, love to see her thrive!	It's amazing how fast she learns.  She can say 10 words in one minute now.  She's 2!"
"Yes, thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?	I do too. I think children are the best thing."
"I've got all of my bags packed, passport ready, and i'm not even leaving for vacation until next week.	That sounds like you had everything ready for your vacation."
"I'm going to Japan. I'm so excited, I've never been.	That sounds like a great time. Have fun!"
"So my parents took me out to dinner for my birthday tonight.	I love going out to dinner. What did they get you for dinner?"
"Thanks! I had an awesome time. I went to a sushi place and it was delicious.	That's awesome! What kind of sushi place did they go?"
"I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had, haha.	That's so right! I was at this sushi place and I ordered the most delicious thing."
"So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!	That sounds wonderful! Where was the park?"
"It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?	That is nice."
"It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.	That is nice, do you like to spend a lot of time alone?  Or do you like the family a lot but just like to chill by yourself?"
"That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!	That is nice that you have a great attitude about it though"
"Whenever we moved abroad, I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.	That's so true! I moved from the US to the UK and was so scared of moving, and then when we got there, it was like home!"
"Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.	that makes a lot sense, I've been abroad for a few years and learned a lot about trusting your instincts and living life on your own terms"
"Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive! We've lived in Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Zurich -- Alaska may be next. (And Italy is awesome, by the way!)	It's my brother's 16th birthday in a couple days and he's probably getting a nicer car than I currently have. I'm 24.	Oh no, that's sad. I hope you have fun."
"I certainly am! Of course, I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.	That's awesome. I wish I could afford something like that."
"So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore. Score!	That's awesome! I'm 16 soon and I'm going through so much."
"Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?	That's cool. What will I do with them now that I don't have to drive them around?  Maybe I'll just let them go out to get some money!"
"I saw somebody I hadn't in years. It was a nice meeting.	That sounds really cool. Who did it meet up? Did you guys talk for long time?"
"Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.	That must be nice. Did you talk?"
"I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!	It's a trade-off, but I think it's worth the sacrifice.  How about you?  Do you miss your hometown?"
"Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?	I do. I try to get there as often as possible. I live in New England so we are like, a few hour's ride from most places."
"I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman.	That's weird, did she hit on you because you were interested in someone, or just because she liked guys?"
"I respectfully told her I was not interested, I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.	Oh that's good. It can be hard when that kind of attention comes out of nowhere."
"I recently attended a play. My friend's acting was significant!	That's so cool! Did you enjoy the performance of the play?  What play was that?"
"I am very glad that I went and supported him.	That sounds like fun! Did you see his acting?"
"Sometimes when I'm driving home after a holiday, such as christmas, I get an overwhelming sense of being alone.	I feel the way. It is nice to be home."
"No I haven't, but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!	That makes sense, sometimes having no one else around you makes things seem even more lonely. I'm glad you got to have your holiday with family. I've had my holiday with family and friends as well, but sometimes having too much company makes it even more stressful and uncomfortable. Maybe try to mix it up next time around?"
"So I recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe I found and it turned out great!	that's really interesting. I've always just used store-b buffalo wing sauce"
"Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.	That's awesome! What did it taste like?"
"I recently completed some additional training at my job. Perhaps a promotion is on its' way?	That is exciting. What kind of job is it?"
"Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.	I do that all time with my work too!"
"I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!	That sounds exciting! I wish I had that.  What do you think about the baby's appearance? Are you excited about meeting them in person?"
"I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.	That sounds amazing! I've been waiting so long! I'm excited for you too! I hope everything goes well!"
"So last night I was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone.	I bet that was terrifying."
"Yes, I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?	That's pretty rare to have in the age of the TV and YouTube. I'm glad you didn't get too scared. I hope you enjoyed it."
"I'm ready for football season to start, NFL preseason started this week, and I can't wait for regular season and I'm really looking forward to the NCAA kickoff!	That sounds like fun! What sport is it?  I love football, and baseball too."
"In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama	That is cool! I love the college football season!"
"I visited the BMX park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike, it was insane!	Oh that's really cool. What was that?"
"I agree, years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV	I agree, it's amazing what people are capable."
"My car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop. I think I'm going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks.	That sounds really kind of him!"
"It was just the carburetor, which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.	That's so cool that your car broke and that your friend helped!"
"I was so set on getting an A on my math test that I studied so hard to do good on it. I studied for days!	That sounds like it, did you finally get an A?"
"I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.	oh nice! thats good"
"My friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago, I'm still in shock.	Oh no. I'm sorry to here about that. I'm sorry you're having a tough day."
"They've been really closed up about the whole thing, I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time, I could not imagine.	Oh my, I'm so sad for you. That must be really tough. I hope they can talk about their death soon and that will make it easier for them to move forward."
"I realized yesterday I was pregnant, I was in shock!	Oh my! Congratulations! That's awesome! Congratulations!"
"I am still in awe, I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.	Yeah that's crazy how unexpected things are, but it's great that everything is going well so far."
"When the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area, I was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood.	I hope it doesnnt get bad."
"I had an emergency generator, extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.	That sounds like a good preparedness plan."
"I stole a candy and drink from the gas station once, I felt terrible about the whole ordeal.	I know how you feel, that happens to a lot of us."
"I was 17, at that age I should of known better.	That is terrible, what did you do after?"
"My friend has had the flu, and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.	That's nice of them!"
"Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well, just whiny.	That sucks. Hopefully he recovers soon. Hopefully you get sick soon."
"I managed to get on the A honor roll at my school, I was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing.	That's great! Congratulations on achieving your academic success. How long did it take you to achieve the A honor roll?"
"I'm just happy that I got it, it took a lot of hard work.	I had to work hard for it"
"The last time I hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie.	That is a bummer!  Did anyone laugh at it?"
"Yeah, it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it, making fun of the movie while it was on.	I used to be the same. I love making people happy with my movies. I love making fun of people. It's fun."
"I remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview.  I was sweating and couldn't stop my leg from shaking.	I can't wait until my interview tomorrow!"
"The interview went well and I ended up getting the job, so I guess I worried for nothing :)	Oh, nice! What did they offer you?"
"The other day I had to take my dogs out before work, but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so I couldn't get out.	Yeah that would be awful, I would have been very upset about that.  Did you end up calling the local authorities to report the dog's owner for that?"
"She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work, but not this time.	Oh man, that's terrible that happened. Did you try to talk to her about how to avoid such situations?  I hope you were able to have that conversation. I hate to think people like smoking so much and not having a good time."
"I was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and I fell to the floor. Everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor. My face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up.	that's kinda gross, i guess it's a pizza place, but it was so funny!"
"Now I can laugh, but when I was on the floor I was not laughing, I just wanted to leave.	I have been there. It is embarrassing. But once you see people looking at you and helping, it is funny.  I was at the mall once, and I was at the food court and someone spilled food all over me. The whole mall went to work to clean it off my clothes and clean my floor and all of the people in line behind me."
"My son is 16 months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork. I've been trying to teach him for a couple of months!	That's great!  What type spoon do you use for that age?"
"He is still very messy but he really enjoys eating like a big boy	Oh that's great. I'm 16 months too and just starting out with my son too"
"When my wife and I started dating, our second date ended up lasting like 12 hours.	That sounds like a really long time. Did things go well?"
"Lunch, a zoo, my apartment for a while, and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P	Yeah, sometimes it's nice to go slow and enjoy each other. I'm glad you two have such a good relationship."
"Years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure.  I found him in the kitchen in the morning, he did not go easily :(	It's hard to lose a pet.  They are like family.  How did your dog die?"
"Yeah, he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.	That sounds really tough. I hope he died a good way"
"I remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail	That sounds like a good memory!"
"Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one	I do too. I can't believe I remember it. I'm going to try that again! I'm a little nervous."
"I realized that my bus that I ride to work in every day is a revamped school bus	That sounds scary! Are you okay with that?"
"Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is!	That must have been scary, did you call to complain?  I would too if it happened to my bus. How cheaply are we talking here?"
"I broke up with my girlfriend last week and it was really hard	I'm so sorry to hear this. How long were they with each for before you broke up with them."
"Yeah we where together for about 2 years but im getting over it now	I broke my girlfriend's heart too"
"I was out at dinner with my family, and when coming back to the table from the bathroom I somehow accidentally sat down with a different family.	That's a bumpy way to start a dinner. Did anyone notice? I'm pretty sure your family members saw what you did."
"Yeah, it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P	That must have felt so awkward. Did you guys ever talk it out about who you were sitting with?"
"We are getting our son to go back to college in a few days and it really made me stop and think back to him when he was smaller, and how time flies by so fast!	That does happen, doesn't it. I remember my son going from middle school to high school. I feel like that's gone by in the time I've known him."
"I know, that's about how I felt too! I think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!	That's great news! I hope it's a good experience for him."
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped and fell. There were so many people around that saw me hit the ground. You can imagine how I felt!	Yeah I can imagine!"
"I scuffed my knees a bit, but I was okay. I was also with a person that I really liked, so that made it even worse. But, I jumped up super quick lol	Oh yeah? Did you end the fair?"
"i stold some spare change from my parents	What do you do with that money?"
"maybe like 19, but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner	It sounds like you did the only thing you thought was the only right."
"Yeah i told them as well	My sister passed away several years ago. I really had a hard time with the grief and couldn't really relate to anyone that tried to help me with it.	That's really sad. I'm sorry."
"Yes, I'm sure you can relate as well. Ironically, that was the same age that my sister passed away. She took her own life, which my mother and I found her, and it was very hard for us all. But, I couldn't burden my parents with my pain, I felt.	Yeah, it really was tough for us, but we tried to be as supportive as we could."
"Having a good job is something to thank	It definitely is!  I have had to work hard for mine though."
"to life God to that higher energy	I know right, I feel like I'm just stuck on the couch a lot of days."
"Nobody ... that's why I'm grateful	I love life, life is great."
"I'm an administrative assistant for a construction company	That sounds interesting. What do construction jobs involve?  Do you get to work on the job?"
"I was devastated when I lost my phone	oh no thats a bummer, how long has it happened?"
"I did but it took a while	Oh no! What happened? Did something happen to it?"
"I was surprised when my family threw me a surprise party	I'm not a party poopers. How many people were?"
"I turned 34	I bet. That must've been a surprise party. Did you have any idea it was coming up on you?"
"i didn't see my parents since 2014! I miss them so much. it's so sad that i live in a different country	I feel your. I live in a different country. My family and I haven't seen our parents in over a year now that we've been working. We can visit but we are not able to live with each one of us.  I miss them so much!"
"actually in 2 weeks! I'm so excited about it. I'm going there with my son! They've never met him	I hope you have fun!"
"I was annoyed when my favorite show wasn't on	That's not good, why not?"
"I ended up watching Impractical Jokers	That show has been off for a while now. I used to watch it, but I stopped when they started making the videos longer and longer.  I stopped after a while."
"I love when I need to show someone how to do something and everything goes off without a hitch.	That sounds like it was easy. What was easy to do?"
"Fortunately it's usually just not having the best answer for what they ask. I've learned and prepared a lot more this time.	I am a little clumsy."
"I tend to know a thing or two on occasion.	I am taking a long overdue and much needed vacation this week. I wish i didnt have to fly.	That's too late. You should have booked your vacation a week in advance."
"I usually do pretty good on short flights. Longer ones make me a little nervous.	Oh yeah, I know that. I am a bit nervous about long trips too."
"I hate turbulence too.	I didnt think to invite my sister to a party I recently helped put on.	Oh, I am sure she was happy to go!  What kind was it?"
"No she wasnt. In all fairness it was a group of people I never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with.	Oh well, at least you are not letting her get on her highness high all the time."
"you are right. Guess I know better for next time.	My sunday was great. All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.	That sounds nice. What chores?"
"I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.	What chores do your chores usually entail?"
"ouch! I would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way.	That's awful. I can imagine. It sounds like your yard has become like the Wild. I hope you don a have a way to stop weeds from growing."
"My husband has to travel a lot for work. It can be hard on a marriage, but after almost 23 years of marriage, I have faith he is loyal and faithful when he does.	that's cool, he seems like someone you would stay loyal to"
"He is an iron worker, so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings.	that's awesome, I bet it's hard on him too"
"I've been married almost 23 years, but many years ago, my husband was acting a bit too ""chivalrous"" to a female acquaintance of ours. He said he was only being nice, but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice', which made me feel a bit upset.	I think you made the best decision."
"Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.	That's terrible."
"My niece is super talented lately.	I love when that happens!"
"Art, she was accepted into a special program for high school.	Oh wow! Congratulations! I am so jealous that my son's daughter was in the program."
"Mostly drawing. And she's in advanced level classes in most subjects.	One day my 10 year old daughter came home crying after she got off the bus. A teenage boy purposely tripped her as she was getting off and she got hurt. Needless to say, I was very, very upset!	I would have been so upset too."
"I actually knew his father, so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.	that's awful."
"I really dont like my husbands job right now.	Oh, what kind is it?"
"Retail, but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks	That is awful. Are you going out of town soon?"
"We are hoping with in a few months.	Each year my husband usually gets a bonus this month or next. It's not promised, but it has happened for several years now. I am really wishing it will be this year too!	That's really nice. I'm so happy you get to see your spouse get things you work so hard for"
"Well, we have college tuition, just got back from an expensive beach vacation, etc. So, if anything replenish some savings, right!	I am sure it will happen!  I am sure."
"I hate watching movies that are full of gore! I just saw one today and so gross!	I know right. I hate it too."
"Yes, I was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off. yuck!	I'm sorry you didn't have a better option. I hope the next day is better."
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	That is true.  Sometimes you just have to wait for the money to come.   I am just so nervous."
"My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!	I hope you get that bonus soon!"
"He is a welder and iron worker, so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel. He has earned it!	I've been married a long time, but my husband is gone quite a bit for work. I feel a bit by myself at times because of this :(	that is very sad. I know you are not by yourself for long periods of time, but still it's hard sometimes"
"Luckily, my children still live at home, but it's not quite the same. Plus, it won't be too long before they are ready to move out	I understand how you'd miss having a family close to home but you have to work hard too."
"My youngest child started high school this year. It really made me think back to her starting kindergarten, and how time really goes by. I can just see her learning to read!	Yeah, it's crazy how fast time is."
"Yes, it really is bittersweet. But, the older they get, the easier it is to think back to the younger days!	I love that you're thinking about the younger days like that!"
"I was so scared when i heard a gunshot sound while i was walking through the streets the other day	That's terrifying! Did you run away?"
"No, i felt it would be better if i dont go looking for it. i managed to get the hell out of there	oh god, did you find anything else?"
"I feel so sad whenever thoughts about my dad come to me, he passed away last year	It's normal to feel sad. I'm sorry for your pain"
"He had terminal stage brain cancer.. we did all we could, but..	I'm so sorry. I hope you can find the right way to deal"
"i felt really good about myself when i got a new job at a reputed firm	That's awesome. What did you do at that firm?"
"i was so angry when i found out my girlfriend kissed a friend of mine	That must have been bad timing for you. Did you confront her about it?  My wife has a tendency to do the opposite side of the street on a first date."
"i have not confronted them. still thinking about it	I'm sure everything worked out."
"I went to the beach last week	Oh that's too long ago!"
"yeah. so much memories of me and family spending time in beach came to me	I am very jealous of you."
"I was so furious when i found out a coworker badmouthed me to my boss	I would be furious aswell! How could he bad mouth someone in front of everyone?"
"Yeah. i outperform this person, and he started throwing shade on me out of pure jealousy	oh, wow, what did he do? Did he try out of anger?"
"I went to see Hamilton last month in NYC	That's cool. What was your impression of the play and movie."
"It was such a stunning show. Lin manuel should get a grammy for this	It's awesome to hear you."
"I was so ashamed when i threw up in public the other day	oh that, what happened then?"
"Yeah, i felt like i was coming down with something. i rushed to get a cab, but i couldn't help it	That's terrible. Did you get sick?"
"My girlfriend asked me to meet her parents next week	That's nice of your. What's your relationship like with her?"
"I am not sure to be honest. i am feeling so nervous about it	that's understandable. i hope everything works out for the best"
"i felt betrayed when my girlfriend kissed another guy at a party	That's terrible. What a jerk."
"Nothing. She was drunk, so i let it go. I still feel disappointed	That can be disappointing. Did she realize her feelings?"
"I was really upset when my daughter went into labor and I couldn't be there.	That's a terrible situation. Did you have to go away from work?"
"She lives in another state and wasn't due for several more months. Everyone is fine now though, so it has turned out to be very joyous.	Oh, that's great! I'm glad to hear! What a wonderful family you must have."
"I was in total shock the night my fiance proposed to me at a concert.	I would have been shocked too."
"They started playing one of our special songs and the next think I knew he was down on one knee. I said yes, of course!	Oh wow that is amazing news! Congats on getting married"
"I admire my boss because he does not act like a boss. He acts more like a friend and he is so down to earth.	That sounds awesome. I would like to be like that."
"He is not just friendly, he is a good leader and knows how to treat his workers.	That sounds awesome. What kind of job?"
"I remember when I was a kid and in the summertime I used to catch fireflies and place them in a jar by my bedside at night.	That is so cool. I love catching fireflies"
"The fireflies would blink in the jar all night long.	What happens to the fireflies?"
"I'm so tired this morning, I went to bed early, but it seems when I go to bed early I wake up more tired. It aggravates me!	Yeah it happens to me all the time. I wish I had a nap after work every now and then."
"I hate it! I feel more energized when I get 4 hours of sleep than I do when I get 8!	I feel you, I am always trying to go for a 4hr and 5hr sleep and when I wake up I feel tired."
"I'm in contract to buy my first house, fingers crossed closing goes well and I close next Friday!	That's a great achievement!  I have never bought a home before.  What is it like to live there after it's all said and done."
"I'm definitely excited. The house just now got built and I saw it for the first time last Monday.	Wow that is exciting news, you should be happy and excited"
"My Mother and I made plans to hang out and do lunch this past week.	Oh, what did she do?"
"Unfortunately she was unable to make it because her diabetes is wreking her health.	I'm sorry to hear about that.  I had no idea you and your mom were battling diabetes."
"I am feeling bad because my grandchild wants me to play all the time but I have to work a lot.	I understand that. I have 7 kids and work a lot. I just wish they would be older so I could take them out more."
"She doesn't understand why I always have so many other things to do, but she would literally play 24/7 if I had the time.	Yeah, kids these day. They don't understand. I wish they had more time."
"My four year old daughter came to me beaming with pride and showing me a drawing she did of me.	I've had some amazing drawings from my kids over the years too! What did she draw you?"
"I was really surpised.  I expected a stick figure, but she drew a lot of features including my beard and mustache.	that sounds cool."
"I had to run some errands.  While gone I instructed my older daughters to complete some math assignments.	I bet you were so proud of yourself."
"When I returned I found them playing video games, the math work was not even attempted.  I tunred their stuff off and we did it together.	I was disappointed too! It's hard to let your kids do your math for a little!"
"A recruiter contacted me the other day about potential job openings, so I'm hoping I may have a job soon!	That sounds exciting.  What kind of work was it?"
"Me too. I've been dying to get out of my current job, but having a recruiter makes me feel at ease.	That's great! I'm happy for you both!"
"I found a box of old photos in my closet yesterday.	oh man. that's creepy. where was the last time you had those photos?"
"A lot of them where photos of my sister and I when we were toddlers.  It was a good trip down memory lane.	That's really cool. I used that to go on vacation last year."
"I was disgusted when my dad left me	I hate that parents! What happened?"
"I'm not sure. I guess he just didn't want anything to do with me.	I hate that kind. I hope he comes around soon though"
"I have been rehearsing for a job interview for a couple of weeks now, and I am so ready!	Oh, wow! Congratulations! What job is it that? I'm a little jealous that you got it."
"I don't normally prepare for interviews, but I really want this job, so I put in a lot of practice.	That's great you are so ready, you will definitely make it!"
"I went to the fride and was surprised to find what I thought was an ice cream cake.	Oh, what kind was that?"
"It turned out to not even be an ice cream cake.  It was some kind of pinapple cake.  I still had a piece but it was disappointing.	It's always disappointing to find out that something that you were looking forward to is actually not. I hate disappointment when I am disappointed!"
"I was surprised when my wife left me	I'm sorry to hear that. What did she leave?"
"We were married for 10 years	That's terrible.  What happened?"
"I was annoyed when my family missed my birthday	That would be a bittersweet day. What happened?"
"Yeah that's very true. Doesn't mean we aren't important though	Yeah that is true, but I'm a single guy, I don't really need people's attention"
"Interestingly, I also had a job interview recently, although I've already heard back and I got it!	That's awesome! Congratulations! How did it go down?"
"A lab manager for a Physics department at a University.	That is awesome!  You should be proud!"
"I had a terrifying experience what using the restroom yesterday.	That's terrible. What happened?"
"As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise.  When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.	That sucks. Did you call the poison control hotline?"
"When I was younger, my dad got into a motor cycle accident. It made me not want to learn how to drive for almost 2 years.	I have had a bike before driving a bike."
"I did learn, but it took a long time to overcome my fear. I'm glad I eventually did!	I am so sorry!  That is terrible! Did he survive?"
"I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience, and not altogether pleasant.	Yeah, it can't be easy to deal with. Did you have any issues figuring it out yourself?"
"Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard, but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident.	Oh, yeah. I've had issues like this before.  I hope it went well and that it's easy to fix."
"In college I was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper.	Oh, what kind idea was stolen?"
"It's ok.  I'm basically over it now, but it was really angering then.	Oh no, I hope she is remorseful. What a jerk. Did you get an A on the paper anyway?"
"I was grateful when I married my wife	That's great."
"We met at a store	Oh wow, how old were you guys?"
"When I was in college an older woman in a class of mine stole my ideas for a paper.	That's really rude. Did she have the right? I'm not a law student but I think that's a pretty common thing you hear about."
"Well, ranted about it to my girlfriend for a while then talked to the professor to make it clear what she did.	That's awful. I hope the professor understood and didn't punish the student for it. It's hard to see someone you like and care about taking advantage of you."
"My family and I are close to aquiring a new home.	I bet that will bring you even more closer togeter"
"IIt is an older home in need of some repairs.  We can't wait to get started on renovations.	That sounds like a great project.  How long have you been doing house renovations before this?"
"I was excited when I bought my car	That is so exciting! Did you choose your car?"
"It was a mustang. I saved up enough money and purchased it outright	Oh man that was awesome. Did you have to pay for it?  Was it worth saving up for?"
"I was fast asleep this morning when my cat pounced on me and jolted me awake.	i love my cat"
"It came out of nowhere. I almost fell out of bed!	I hate when my cat jumps on me. He jumps on my bed every time!"
"I'm feeling a little down right now. The weather is perfect, but I miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset. Those were great times!	I hope things turn around for you. I hope you get some sunsets soon."
"Yeah, we would take a bottle of wine with us, watch the surfers and just kick back. Wish those days would return.	I hope things turn around. I miss you. I hope things turn around."
"Maybe one day. That was when I lived in Northern California - the best place on the planet, imho!	I am confident that I will win that spelling bee tomorrow	oh yeah, good, good for you. what are the chances of winning?"
"I have. I've studied for 3 week now	that sounds awesome"
"I've been trying lately to potty train my youngest daughter.	I'm sure that she can do it. What kind of issues have you experienced?"
"It's been a challenge.  Yesterday she got on the toilet herself though.  She said she didn't want to be a baby anymore.	Yeah I remember when kids didn't say a lot and were very vocal."
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a while.  Dropping her off at the airport was really hard.	Oh, that's tough. Did you have a plan, or was it a last-minute thing?"
"Yeah, we talk by text all the time and call every day.  It's still hard though, we haven't been apart longer than a couple days since we met.	I know right? I feel that way about some of the people I meet."
"I was sad when my dog died	That is sad. I lost two dogs in the past, both of them from the same family."
"Its ok. It's just been rough without him. I miss him	That is understandable.  I lost a few of mine last few years, and it was hard"
"My wife is coming home after being out of the country for 2 months.  I can't wait!	That's so good!"
"I am!  We've never been apart this long, so it's been tough.	Oh that's great! I'm glad you can't wait."
"I was afraid when I watched a horror film	Oh yeah? What was it?"
"Some have pop ups and they are creepy	It can be scary to watch those"
"I'm going on vacation for the first time in several years!	That's nice! What are your going to do on this vacation?"
"I'm taking a cruise to Alaska. I'm soooo excited.	That's really cool. Where are you going to Alaska for?"
"My wife is coming back into the country at the end of the weeks after 2 months away.  I can't wait!	That sounds awesome! Where are she coming from?"
"Germany for a language course.	That's cool. I'm sure it was good for you to go. Did you learn any German?"
"I was prepared for tonights big dinner	Oh no! Did everything turn out as well planned as it should be doing?"
"It's going to be at my house. We are going to have a lot of food	Oh, great! I hope it goes well then."
"I was terrified when I watched that horror movie	AHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  That was so scary!"
"It was Scream	You must have been scared for sure. What movie is it? I haven't heard of it."
"I was digging through some old stuff I had and I found letters that my wife wrote me when we were still dating. They were so sweet.	That's awesome. Did you keep them all?"
"Yeah! It gave me all of the feels. I read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again.	That's really cool!"
"I managed to spook myself really bad once watching too many horror movies and being in a house alone by the woods.	I hate horror movies. They freak me out."
"Yeah.  I kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods.	i was in the same situation"
"I'm so proud of my wife	That's great! What happened?"
"She really is	That's great. What's her name?  Is she married to anyone?"
"I was angry when my son destroyed my car	That is pretty annoying. Did he just smash the car?"
"no not salvagable. i had to buy a new one.	That is a lot of money.  Did you take him to school?"
"its okay. gave me an opportunity for a new adventure	I'm starting a new job next week, and while I am excited, I am also very nervous!	That can happen with any job, how long is it for you?"
"That's true, but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous.	I hate it. I hate the uncertainty. I wish you the best of the luck."
"I had to go out of town and leave my dogs with a friend, I was worried about them.	Oh. That's terrible! Did everything okay?"
"Yeah.  They annoyed my friend some, but overall it was fine.	That sounds fine.  How long did you stay out for?"
"My wife has been in Germany for 2 months.  I can't wait till she gets home.	That's great! Where is your wife from originally in Germany?"
"It sucks, but it's best to keep busy with whatever you can.  Videogames helped a lot :P	I love video games, they can be so relaxing! I have to play them on breaks from playing video games."
"My wife has been out of the country for 2 months.  She's coming back soon, but it's been tough without her.	I know it's tough but you'll get through this.  You're not alone."
"I'm looking forward to it :)	That must have been tough, how are you coping?"
"I'm planning on moving to a new city, but I'm starting to get cold feet.	It will be a good thing for you."
"I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there?	I'm sure the new city is wonderful, but you never know.  It's a risk to take new things in your life, so make sure you think about the potential risks."
"One of the things I had to do when I started my job was be in charge of moving a department.  When we were doing it, one of my coworkers bailed on me.	Oh no. That's awful! Did you guys work together well enough?"
"There were others, but we needed all the help we could get.	Oh man, that's terrible. I hope nothin happened to them"
"Everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! That movie was so amazing, I feel like i was holding my breath the whole time	Oh man, that's the kind of movie I like, what movie was it?  It's called the Dark Side of Celine Dion."
"omg, you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it, it's about aliens	That's really interesting, I didn't know aliens had a special movie!  What movie is it?  Did you see it recently?"
"it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff, and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it.	that's definitely true for me. I don't have the time for all the stuff I want"
"Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice.	That's cool, what kind stuff do they get to do?  Are they rich?  I am curious about that."
"I was disgusted when I noticed the food on the table	That can happen when someone doesn't do their cleaning up."
"It was brussel sprouts and Liver	That's disgusting!"
"I have a lab mix and he is so well behaved and listens to commands so well. I'm glad I got him as a puppy.	It sounds like you have a very well-trained dog! How long has it taken?"
"oh yea. Basically started the day we got him. That definitely helped.	That's really cool. I have always wanted a lab mix. What breed is it?"
"Yes. I couldnt' handle a dog I have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff.	Oh wow.  That's great.  What kind is he?"
"My friend just recently moved to California...It makes me sad because I have always wanted to live there.	that's too bad your not there yet"
"Yeah...I really am. I've wanted to live there since I was a little girl. Someday I will!	Yeah, it's hard when people move to where you want to live but can never."
"When I was planning my wedding, the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication.	That's terrible.  Did you call out the caterer and tell them to get off their d*** ass?"
"Yeah, we dropped them with enough time to find someone else, but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.	It was so stressful, but glad we found the other caterer."
"It is so frustrating having to deal with difficult customers that don't want to pay their bills/	I know how you mean. I used to work in retail and used to work in customer service for a bank, but now I just work in retail again.  It's so much harder to deal with them who want to complain and be rude."
"Normally I would agree. It only seems to be a few here and there. Most of the time I dont have problems.	That's good. You don't have to deal with difficult people. I'm not saying they are difficult people but sometimes people are."
"We are a retail outfit. So we have some big customers that pay on established terms.	I'm going overseas in 2 weeks! I will be on vacaion for 1 months and I just CAN NOT wait@	That's so exciting. Where are you going? What country?"
"Where did you go?	That's so cool. Where are you going?"
"I just about had a figurative heart attack the other night.	That's scary. I hope you're alright."
"I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door.	That's creepy. Did you call the police to see if it was anyone who was trying something bad on himself."
"I'm very annoyed because my friend didn't give me my money back	Oh, well, that is the worst he could have done.  Maybe he was trying to avoid paying taxes on it."
"Yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back	That's terrible! Did he just steal from you?"
"I typically procrastinate when needing to pack for a trip. But this time I got my butt in gear and it's all done several days early.	That must have been good luck"
"Thanks. I usually get somewhere and realize I forgot a bunch of stuff I need cause I packed in a rush 30 minutes before leaving.	That makes sense but still procrastinate sometimes, it's hard to get anything right before."
"Fortunately, my wife usually comes to the rescue on me.	Yeah, that can be a bummer, but at the least she is aware of the fact that you were rushing and that's all."
"My wife was working yesterday, but she ended up taking the rest of the day off to spend time with me! I was shocked.	That is awesome!"
"We did! We went out for lunch and hung out on the beach. It was very relaxing and a nice change.	oh wow that is nice, how long have you been married?"
"I went to a restaurant my wife really likes with some friends while she was at work.  It's not a big thing, but I felt a little bad about it :P	I bet she appreciated it though!"
"Not like really bad, just kind of bad that I went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn't go.  It's not a big deal, but I feel bad when I do things like that.	Oh man, I'm sorry. It's not a big deal, and I'm sure she's not even going to notice!"
"That horror movie made me terrified	I loved that movie."
"Scream	I love horror movies. What is the worst one you've watched so far?"
"I really want to have another baby. Baby fever is real lol I don't want to be all crazy about it, don't wanna track ovulation and do all this but i really wanna get pregnant asap	Yeah baby fever. It really gets on your mind a bit too"
"thank you :) oh yeah, you can track ovulation, measure basal body temperature, etc. I'm not gonna go into details	I'm a nurse midwif and I can help a woman have another baby if needed."
"My mom bought be a book online.  It should be here today I'm just waiting on the delivery man.	That's cool. Did you order it from a new website?"
"Yes it is.  She wanted two options so I wouldn't know which she'd pick.  She picked the right one so now it's just a waiting game.	That's great that she got the right one! What kind is it?"
"It is nice to have in-laws that are accepting and loving. So many people don't have a good relationship with their in-laws.	That must be sad. How do they handle it when their in-laws don't like them?"
"Aw I'm sorry. Mine is only a few years old but it's been smooth sailing so far.	I have my own in laws and they're great!"
"I have been trying to get my oldest son to be more responsible.  I started out small by asking him to adopt a good sleep schedule.  After several weeks he still hasn't.	I'm sorry he's still not. Maybe try to make it harder to sleep.  He might need to learn."
"He does well enough in school.  I think that might make him think he doesn't need any disciple in everyday life.  Make me worry a bit.	I think he'll come around eventually. I have faith in him."
"My wife usually sniffs out anything going on, but I was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing.	That sounds like fun! Did you guys like it?"
"Yes. Friends, family, cake, all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.	That's really sweet. I'm glad she got it."
"Thank you. Probably wont be able to do it again, but happy it worked this time.	I am so grateful for my wife	That's really sweet of her. What happened?"
"She really is! I couldn't be where I am without her	That's so true, she must have worked so much for us!"
"I can handle, bees, scorpions, wasps, crickets, and spiders.  But for some reason I lose my mind around roaches.	That is a common reaction, many people have a certain fear of roaches. They are a threat to our very way of life."
"I take some conselation in that, however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.	I lose it every day."
"I feel guilty because I couldn't go to my friends party	Oh no! Did you not invite anyone to the party?"
"I was working and I couldn't leave early	That is bad, I hope everything worked out in your life."
"As a momma's boy I always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time.	Oh that. I miss my mom when she is away. She was the only one who took care for my kids."
"Fortunately, she rarely was gone for long periods of time, but I always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do.	That sucks! What type work was she going to be at?"
"Oh it's great.	I am so excited about going to the movies	I love movies. What movie are you seeing?"
"I'm going to see the purge. I have been waiting to see it for a while	It's going to be a good time."
"I saw a homeless lady and i felt so bad for her because it was so hot outside so went to five guys and bought her some food and cold drinks	Oh wow. That is kind of you to go out of your way."
"blessing bags?? what are those?	I feel the same way.  I am always feeling sorry for people who are struggling financially.  I wish I had the same luck she does."
"wow that's a great idea! I will do the same! thanks for sharing	The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.	That's really cool. I've always been curious about the puzzles our friends used to make. Did you find the puzzle?"
"Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it, so I don't really know which one, but you can find a bunch on there.	I'm glad you framed it. I've got it framed too. It looks great. It's a picture I took. I took it to an art class to print and frame it."
"Well, what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems, and I was right.	That's a long road. What made you decide that?  Was there any traffic problems?  Did you see the beautiful views along the way?"
"Six days in all, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.	That's awesome.  How long did it last?"
"It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas, some with free coffee!	That sounds great! Where are some of the places you went?"
"Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!	That is a good way to put things into words! It really is!"
"I have big renovation plans for my house.  I've made a money plan and have kept to it so far.	That's good!  What kind of renovation are we doing?  Is it a kitchen renovation or something else?"
"Yes, hopefully it will all go as planned.  So far so good.	That's good, good for you to keep it that good!"
"I was so anxious for my kid to graduate	It can't come fast enough right now."
"It did. I'm very proud of him	That's great! Congratulations!"
"I didn't really try to use weight but i started going to the pool and i actually lost a couple of lbs	That's awesome. What's changed?"
"it's really fun and it's also a great exercise! Plus water is so relaxing	That sounds like a fun way to spend time.  What kind of pool is that you're talking about?"
"I hope when I get older, Im not lonely as I am now	It will happen."
"I was engaged but my woman left me	I agree. I feel lonely too"
"I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.	I have a huge collection! What album is it from?"
"Yeah, for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.	Yeah, I was a kid when that came on. I was 8."
"I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.	That's understandable. What motivated him to not do his schoolwork?"
"True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.	That can happen to anyone.  I'm sure he'll figure it out eventually."
"K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there, but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.	It is good that the house was scary, but also that you ran back. I bet you were scared!"
"It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.	I think I'm going crazy."
"Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified, but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.	I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.	It really does, I had one for about a year before switching to another one."
"Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie, and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.	I feel for that. Sometimes it feels like we have to go out of our comfort zones and pay extra fees to get the things we want. But it's worth it, because the movies are so much fun to watch."
"My eldest niece, who helps take care of her younger disabled sister, graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.	That's nice."
"Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.	I'm glad for her, and the people around her, who care so much for her."
"I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.	I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.	I know. It makes you wonder what's going on in her head, and what's going to happen next. But you have to be honest. If you want to be friends, just be yourself and see where things take it. It sounds like a good plan to me, so go for it!"
"Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.	You could just ask her."
"I really wanted to try bison meet and I went all the way to that whole foods store like 57 miles away and they didn't have it, what a waste of time	that's crazy!"
"thank you! I hope i can find it somewhere locally. i've heard bison meat is very lean and good	That sounds delicious. I love bison too. I've had bison meat a few places. It's so tender and flavorful! I think it would be great in a burger."
"My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.	Oh no! That sounds like it could be quite smelly. Is it okay?"
"Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.	I bet that smell was gross"
"It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.	That's tough, how old is the toddler?"
"I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(	I hate it! When is he coming back?"
"I once walkd around the grocery store without knowing my fly was down.	That was the fun part! What did happen next?"
"I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.	That's a little creepy."
"It's been a hard day today, its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.	I feel for that, I've never gone to my parents' home by myself."
"In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!	That is tough. I hope you can enjoy your time and not get bored. It's good for your mental health. I know how hard that can be when it comes on the family."
"My young niece, who is disabled, was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.	Oh, that's terrible!"
"Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.	I hope everything is better now?"
"It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too, but they live in Scotland.	I have this cat that loves to cause issues	I hate when I get caught with my hand tied behind back. What is the cat's name?"
"Like last night. She decided that she wanted to jump on the table	Oh that's so gross. Did you try putting her in a cage?"
"I have tried to complete a work assigment three times now without sucuess.	I am sorry to hear that. What kind is it that?"
"Doubtful.  I will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull.	That sucks. Sometimes we need to ask someone for help"
"I couldn't go to movies to watch The greatest showman when it came out so my husband bought this movie when it came out. he is sweet	That must be nice. What movie is it about?"
"it's called The Greatest Showman. it's a musical! So good!! I watched it so many times already	that's cool!  what did he buy it for you for?"
"A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would.	That's terrible. Wasn't it hard for you?"
"It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker.	That is annoying. Did you call them back to apologize for the inconvenience you had?"
"That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover.	My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.	That's horrible! Did you get her back yet? I hope she had an easy flight!"
"Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.	I know the feeling. I was at a restaurant and the waiter told me my wife is getting back."
"It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.	oh that must be nice."
"After such a long time we certainly will.  I can't wait to start making the house into our home.	That's great!  You're going to have a lot more time on your side!"
"Our pet cat will need to be put down soon.	That's so terrible. I'm really sorry to hear this. How old is the cat?"
"Yes we've had her since the begining.  She is older now and has suffered with feline AIDS for awhile.	that sucks, cats are so cute and so much trouble, i have two dogs and one is a muti-cat."
"It really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street	I can understand why you feel that way, but there are always ways to get back up and keep moving."
"I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity	That is so nice! You should volunteer more!"
"My husband shocked me the other day	That sounds really cool! What happened? Did he do something you didn't expect?"
"He threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death!	That is so sweet of your.  I bet you loved it!  How long has it's been?"
"I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.	I have cheated. I feel like I cheated on my wife. I was tired, and I thought I was tired enough to cheat. But I didn't cheat, and I feel like I cheated my way out of my marriage."
"No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?	That is so nice of saying. I think it's a matter of not having anything better to do than cheat. They seem like great partners, I think they just didn't have the best time when they met each other"
"I was planning to view the stars last night, but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.	that's a bummer.  did they cancel it?"
"It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.	That is unfortunate. I hope you can go back out tonight!"
"A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.	That is true, but we'll just spend more time together and just be."
"Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.	I'm jealous, that's why I said baby steps"
"My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!	That's nice. I have a lot of respect for my mom. She's always been a good role model."
"I'm sure that's hard at times. I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.	That's true, but sometimes you just gotta put up with it for love's sake"
"I am dreading the two hour trip to the grocery store this week.	That's a long one"
"Me too!! Being so far out, it takes forever to get anywhere. I miss civilization lol.	Oh wow. Are you going alone or with friends and kids?"
"We are workcamping in the mountains of NM. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours to get anywhere lol. We havent seen new faces around here in months lol.	im really exited to go to disneyland on vacation next summer	I am happy for that too! Where you go next?"
"yes im staying at the hotel for the first time i am really happy	That's a fun trip! What are your favorite Disney things?"
"I finished a class and most of my classmates got an A! It took a lot of work.	That's cool! What class is that for? I'm in accounting class, but I'm not that smart. Did you feel proud of your work?"
"It sure does! I am so proud of the hard work that everyone put in!	That's awesome! Congratulations! How did you finish it off?"
"I have the best kids in the world.	That's great. What do they like to do for you kids to be so special."
"Lots of little stuff.  They love to draw me pictures, crack jokes, and give lots of kisses.	That sounds like they have great parents."
"My husband has been putting in so many extra hours at work	That stinks. Is he working extra hours at work or at the gym?"
"Oh I am pampering the heck out of him! It got him a promotion!	that is nice of you to do that for him"
"I just got laid off from my job. I need the paycheck so this is not a good situation.	That's terrible! I am sorry to hear that you were let down."
"I am going to apply for new positions. Hopefully I will get something soon.	That's terrible.  You will find something soon though you just have to keep looking"
"I work in I.T.! Thanks for asking!	I just applied for a new job! It is a job that I have always wanted.	It should be great! How did they respond to you so fast?"
"Thank you! Have you ever applied to your dream job?	I have. I applied last year. I am waiting to see if I get it."
"i ahte when my Girlfriend goes to the club alone	It is nice when you have a trusted girlfriend"
"Yeah it makes me really jelous when guys talk to her	Oh, well you could go too, right?  I mean, you're not going there right?  It's not your girlfriend.  Maybe just ask her out?  I don't think she's that type of person to not know.  I mean, she's not going to be in a relationship right now, so why bother?"
"When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!	That's a great coincidence! Did you catch the train?"
"It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!	that's a good thing to be grateful for."
"We certainly did. Where I was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs, restaurants etc. so we'd go to the beach and then party at night. Brilliant fun!	My Keurig just died. This is the third coffee pot in less than a year!	its probably just old. i had a coffee pot like this before."
"I agree! I am so disgusted right now!!! We drink a lot of coffee lol. Its a 2 hour drive to the closest town to get another one too.	I hate when you try to fix it and it doesn't fix it! You need to get it replaced."
"We travel fill-time in our RV so I don't really have room to carry a back up. I hope our next location is more accessible to civilization.	I just had to move across country to a new job.	I know how hard it can be.  Do you live in the east coast?"
"I am actually! I was so ready for it. I basically studied moving so that everything would be easy	That must have been really stressful but you did great!"
"One day my daughter got off the bus and was crying. An older boy intentionally tripped her as she got off the bus and she got hurt. This made me very upset and mad!	That's horrible. What happened after?"
"He just thought it would be funny! He was also several years older than her and a teenager. Too old to know better!	I hate that kind of people"
"We recently found out that our 15 year old son has a rare, degenerative neurological disease.	That's terrible.  Did he have it for a while before we knew about his father?"
"No, the doctors tell us there is no cure. They are trying to treat the symptoms but thus far its been unsuccessful.	I'm sorry. I didn't expect it to happen at my age. I hope they can help."
"Thank you, its been scary. He has good days and bad.	The door bell rang last month. I wasn't expecting anyone, but it was my daughter and her family from way up north.	That must have been fun. Did they stay for a while?"
"I couldn't believe it. It had been almost a year since I saw them and she never even gave me a hint they were coming.	That sounds so cool! Did they bring their kids with them too?"
"I've studied hard all night in order to make myself ready for tomorrow's test	That's so smart! What type test is this?  Is it for school or work?"
"Repititions and exposure are my strategies.  Sumer semesters really ramp things up.	that's so smart of you, good for the future."
"Going through an unused drawer I found old drawing from when my kids were little	That's really sweet. I bet they must have some funny drawings in it."
"While the actual incidents of each drawing are lost in time it did make me think back to when they were younger.	That sounds like some fun. What kind were those?"
"I just had my husband remind me of when I fainted when he proposed!	That must've made you very happy! What happened that day was pretty cool. What did he say to make you remember?"
"I was so happy when I saw him get down on one knee that I just blacked out lmao	That's great! I love when that kind of surprise happens"
"The news announced a tornado warning. I ignored it at first, but then the city tornado siren went off.	that would have scared me."
"I almost panicked as the winds started to gust, but thankfully it missed us. A few miles up the road weren't so lucky though. Always listen to those warnings	What a scary situation. It's always good that people are prepared. I hope everything is alright down here."
"I got a new puppy for my birthday! She is a cutie!	That's so sweet! What breed is she?"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	oh my, bassets can be a bit gruff"
"I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.	That sounds adorable! What kind is it"
"My neighbor ran into my car! They didn't even leave a note!	That is very rude."
"I could tell by the color of the paint left on my car, and their car now has a scrape with the color of my car. I don't know what to do.	Oh, oh, that's bad! Did you call the insurance?"
"A thunderstorm raged all of last night! It kept me awake all night!	That's pretty wild. Were you okay?"
"It is quite frightening! I wish that I could overcome my fear.	yea thunderstorm scares me"
"I just applied for graduate school! I feel good about my chances!	oh great good luck with that"

"I remember just taking a deep breath the other day in the garden and just feeling happy	That must have felt great! How was the day going?  Did you do something fun?"
"I have a garden so fully packed that I can't see my neighbors at all!	That sounds lovely! Do you have a big yard?"
"My neighbor really helped me out recently after a big windstorm.	That was nice of your neighbor. Did he help you with your repairs or your roof?"
"No, they generously helped me clean up my yard and cut up a tree with their chainsaw, and they asked for nothing in return.	That sounds really kind of your neighbor!  What city did the windstorm hit in?"
"My son just graduated from high school! He has worked so hard, and he even earned a scholarship.	That's really cool. Congratulations!"
"Thank you! He is going to study Computer Science!	That's great. I'm happy to hear!"
"I am taking a trip to Disney World next month! My wife is going for the first time!	That's so cool! Where is Disney?"
"I have been a couple of times before, and it is such a magical place! Where are you planning on taking a trip to?	That's awesome. I'm not a Disney person. I'm more of of a Star Wars guy."
"I slipped and fell in the restroom last week. The floors desperately needed cleaned.	Oh that's horrible! Are you alright? Did anyone help you up or anything like that?"
"The only thing to get injured was my pride. It was quite the gross experience.	oh man that's disgusting, what a gross experience."
"The other day Comcast customer service kept me waiting for 20 minutes just to speak with someone. What a disgrace!	That sounds like they really messed up. I have been with Comcast for 6 months now and they have been doing a great job."
"They're awful. If they'd just employ enough cs people to handle the volume you could just about bear it!	Oh man! I hate waiting on the phone."
"Mind you, their product is useless too. Ok, rant over!	Queue jumping is something which irks me no end. I was at the deli counter of my local store recently and some guy came up and started ordering. The employee served him, too.	I am so fed with the state of society today. People are so lazy."
"Yes. And I'm disabled and it's hard to stand for a long time while some idiot gets his lunch. I hope it was horrible!	I completely get why you feel that way about queue jumppping, but I think people are often oblivious to the fact that they're doing it to an already overloaded person in a stressful situation."
"Perhaps salmonella poisoning? One can only hope, lol!	I am very glad we headed the warnings and evacuated prior to Hurricane Harvey.	That's so right! I remember that. We were all in the same boat"
"Yes it was a scary time. We stocked up on food and bottled water and moved our RV about an hour and a half inland. Luckily the storn went to the north of us.	Yeah I saw that. I hope the storm goes away quickly.  It's so sad that so much damage went to."
"Our Rv is our home, we are full-time Rvers! Thank you so much! Have you ever been through an evactuation? Did you feel prepared?	This past Mother's Day my husband gave me some wonderful unexpected gifts! He even got me a gorgeous diamond ring.	That's nice. What did you get him for Mother's day?"
"I was! It was so thoughtful and sweet, and I was very touched by it.	That's awesome! I've gotten my partner a lot, especially my husband."
"My parents are going to a tea room for their anniversary.	I love that place. What are they doing on their 4th annivarsry?"
"No that is where they decided to go but the thing is I called the place and they can't accommodate my special diet I am on.  I am so sad b/c that means I can't go with the.	I would have called to see what they have for you.  I hope they can accommodate you."

"Thank you so much! I surely will.	My dad has early onset dementia	That's terrible.  My dad is 75 and is in early stage dementia.  I wish I had a son like you."
"Yes, I try my hardest to be caring and patient with him b/c I know he doesn't mean to be harsh or hard to deal with at times.	That must have be tough for you.  I hope he is happy and healthy and happy to go to sleep every night knowing he is loved.  I would try to make him happy as much as you can.  I know how hard that must have be for you."
"At work today, all my coworkers sang me happy birthday. It was so nice of them!	That's so sweet!"
"It was so thoughtful of them. I didn't even mention it was my birthday.	it was, it really was."
"I don't know. But they sure wen't above and beyond!	I took a huge test today and man it made me so nervous. I really hope I did well on it.	Oh, what test did they ask? Did you study hard for it?"
"I did, I studied every day for week! I almost wore myself out studying.	It's good that you took the test!"
"I really hope so, I am so nervous while I wait for my results.	I am so proud of my son	That's awesome! What are you all doing together?"
"He got the highest score on a test	That's great! What test was it for?"
"My husband usually gets a big bonus around this time of the year. We are eagerly waiting, hoping, and waiting for it!	Oh that is great! Is it coming soon?"
"It is! It's not a guarantee though, so it's just a waiting game, and not easy.	Yeah, but if it happens, man will he be so proud of himself. He's always talking about it and bragging it out to his coworkers."
"I am so angry that my brother didnt come to my party	That's okay. Did he leave on his own?"
"I am not sure. I just don't know why he didn't show	That's unfortunate, maybe he'll be more interested next time he comes over"
"I am confident that I will have a great day tomorrow	oh really? why is that?"
"That is so true. Getting to know you also makes it seem like a great day already leading to tomorrow.	Yeah, it's the little things like that make me realize it, right before bed."
"I have trusting issues because my fiance left  me	I am sorry to hear that."
"I know but it's so hard because no one wants to be with me	That's really unfortunate that your partner left. Have you considered therapy to work on your trusting nature and the trust of your relationship with your partner?"
"Flying typically doesn't bother me too much, because I love travel. However I was a bit concerned on a flight once right after a travel advisory had been issued.	I know, right?"
"Well i did have a few of those. It went fine. I was still nervous even after we landed in a foreign country. I just watched my surroundings. Everything went great.	That's good to know, especially since there are so many travel advisories in place now."
"I am so lonely right now because no one wants to be with me	That is terrible, what do you do to cope?"
"Yeah, but no luck	I'm sure it's not your friends who are the ones who are avoiding."
"when i was younger I was really getting into graphic design and really wanted a new Apple computer. I knew my parents couldnt afford it, but they somehow made it happen and surprised me on Christmas..	That's so nice of them.  What a wonderful parent they were."
"yea my parents are pretty great. Pretty maddening at times, but I wouldn't trade them.	That's pretty awesome. I have never been good at graphic design myself. What kind did your mom get you one of?"
"I hope to be there one day and see it from that side.	i felt really good when i won a poker tournament last week	That sounds like fun! What was the tournament for?  Was it a big one?"
"yes it was, it took a long time to do but at the end it was worth it	That's awesome! What type was it? Was it online or offline?"
"Spiders is one of my gratest fear they make me so scared	That is one of the worst things I can think of too. I hate spiders."
"i have tried to overcome my fear but i just cant they make my skin temble	I know right? they look so harmless but they're not. They're so creepy."
"i am impressed that video games grow so much every year	I'm not really a video gamer. I just play a few games. What about you? Do video games interest you at least? I don't know why I even play them, but my friend told me about this game called Overwatch and I'm curious. Do they interest you at all?"
"that is a great game the growth on video games has been amazing this past few years	I am an old-schooler gamer myself. I am so jealous of all those youngblood gamers out here. I used to play all the oldies and they old-schoolies. I can play a good ol' fashioned NESiD game on my iPhone."
"We went out to dinner for our first anniversary and they got our order all wrong.	I hate when restaurants get our orders wrong too. Did they offer you a refund?"
"Thank you. The restaurant came highly rated by a lot of people so I guess my expectations were high. I tried not to let it bother me.	I know! I felt the same. It's just hard to believe they messed it so up so badly for a great restaurant like that."
"My wife flew home to see family. It is very quite at home now.	I love flying! What was the trip for you?  How is it going home now?"
"I know, that would of been nice! Instead I was all alone for the last few weeks.	that is sad.  What happened?  Was everything good?"
"Me too, a home doesn't feel like a home without a woman.	i am really impressed everytime i see my nephew on how fast he is growing	I'm glad he is doing well. What sport?  What age?"
"yeah but i dont see him very often maybe that is why i always get shocked when i see him	That's so cool.  What age did he turn?"
"When I got the phone call that my mom had cancer I was so upset.	That sucks. Did she get the treatment?"
"It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.	That is bad, I hope she gets better"
"one of the best days of my life was when i graduated from high school	I am sure that moment was great!"
"i know right time goes really fast and you dont even noticed, for me it was 13 years ago	That sounds nice. I graduated a little earlier. It does go by fast."
"The other night I was driving home in the rain and slid into the guard rail. It is going to cost so much to get my car fixed!	Oh wow. Did the insurance company send someone over to fix the damage?"
"I know, I will have to be more careful next time. I shouldn't eat ice-cream while driving,	That's terrible!"
"It will still move, but I can't steer very well with the front tires missing.	There is a tornado coming. But I have the pantry full and am ready this time.	I am so ready for the tornado.  I am so ready for it."
"You never know how long the power might be out for!	That sounds very scary. Are the neighbors safe too?"
"It could take a while for any sort of rescue to come!	I had a pretty large loan, with a bit of a high interest rate, and a high monthly payment. My mother decided to pay it off for me, out of the blue!	Oh, nice mom, what made her decide to help out?  I've heard some good moms will do that just out of the goodness of the heart, and not for any other reason."
"Yes, I couldn't believe it. She's so sweet and giving, but I sure didn't expect her to do that!	Oh, that's nice of your mom, she's probably worried that she's going to get in trouble if you don't."
"My husband is the most faithful man I know	That's very kind of you to be so supportive of him."
"I have so many health problems and he is always there for many no matter what being loving and caring	That's very sweet of you.  I'm glad to hear.  What kind health problems?"
"I left the front door unlocked and the mailman robbed me. I couldn't believe I would do that.	Oh, I'm sorry! Was anything stolen?"
"Only my pride! I wasn't at home when he robbed me. He took a lot of valuables.	That's awful."
"I hope so! A federal worker like that should have more integrity!	I have always been afraid of snakes i dont know what to do to control my fear for them	That is so weird. Do you know of someone else with the fear? I do. I have a cousin with the same fear."
"yes, i one time i was taking a hike and 3 meters to my left was a rattle snake i jumped like a rabbit and ran back to my friends	That's a scary feeling. I hate when that happens."
"I was annoyed when my wife left me	I'm sure that happens to many couples.  What happened?"
"Yeah its been a rough 2 weeks for me	That's terrible.  Why did you leave your wife for another woman?"
"I was afraid when I went into the movies alone	That was creepy. What did happen?"
"Because I have always been with someone, so going in alone just frightened me	I bet! How did you end? Did you enjoy it though?"
"I've been married almost 23 years. My husband travel so much, but we both have trust in each other to be true and loyal.	That's really cool. I've been married for 30 years myself."
"for his job. So, it can be hard, but we trust each other.	That's a good point."
"I am hopeful that my friend will be able to make it to my party	That's so sweet of you. Are they able?  What party is this?"
"It is to me because he is my best friend	That's really sweet of you.  I'm sure he would love to be there.  What is your party about, exactly?"
"I have been exercising and taking care of myself more lately.	That sounds like you are taking care of yourself. I have never been one for a gym, but my wife and I have gotten a treadmill and exercise together."
"I think many do, but man does it feel good.	That sounds great!  What exercise is it you are doing?"
"I am joyful that I am with my wife	That's awesome! What kind is it?"
"We have been together for 10 years	That's great news for you! I'm happy for you guys as well"
"I felt pretty luck the other day! I won $100 on a scratch off ticket! I never win!	That's not bad. Did the scratch off win in a lottery or something else like that."
"Not usually, I never win. so, it was very unexpected.	That's great news! What kind was it of course but I'm sure that was exciting for you"
"My sister was given $1,000 by my grandma as a graduation present. She did not give me a penny.	That's very kind of grandma. What did she give her?"
"Perhaps, I just don't understand why I was left out. Seems unfair.	Yeah thats a bugging feeling. I think its just because of a lack of communication or something like that. I'm not a big believer of my sister being so mean."
"We went on our vacation about a week ago to the beach and it rained several days while we were there. We wanted to go to the beach every day!	I know, I was really bumming out about it. I had to wait so I could go. I'm hoping the rain will go away soon. It's been so long since I've been to the beach. I hope the sand is not all messed up yet!"
"Yes, and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront! But, we still had a good time, just wished we could have had less rain!	I agree, it was still fun."
"I was given the opportunity to work at a new job that I was hoping to get! I never thought it would be possible!	That's great! What job? Did they hire someone else?"
"Thank you! I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity.	That's great! What is the new job that is? I'm curious."
"I fell down in a mud puddle today while walking to lunch. I was covered in mud for the rest of the work day.	Oh, oh, oh! I hope noone saw that."
"No kidding! It was hard to keep a good attitude for the rest of the day.	Oh, wow, that is hilarious! Did anyone laugh or something like that?  That would make my stomach do flips!"
"My husband works nights a lot right now.	That can be tough. Are you okay?"
"It really is, i hate being alone at night.	I understand that. It can be hard."
"A few, but he still has to sleep all day, makes doing things hard.	I'm anxious (if excited!) about an upcoming move -- we've lived overseas before, but this is such a different state and climate, I'm not sure what to expect!	It can be scary. Do you live in a big house or a condo?"
"Alaska! We've got some transition time, but I've been doing deep research on Anchorage -- and the more I see, the more I like!	That's awesome! I'm sure it'll work great out!"
"I hate that people hit on others they know are married.	I agree.  Why do you want to hit someone on a date?"
"Right? Happens to my husband all the time and it's just frustrating.	I understand your perspective.  It's just sad to hear.  I don't hit anyone either because of that reason.  I think people hit others out of fear.  They're trying to find a friend in a lonely life.  But they usually end up making the wrong kind and end up hurting their own lives."
"No, since it's his associates at work!!	i cannot wait for the next star wars movie to come out	I love that movie! What is it about this time around?"
"he is, i really like the new ones but always will like the old ones better	I am excited for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.  It is going to be a huge one."
"i hate when i fart in public it is so embarrasing	I do it too!"
"i can hold them but some of them are just accidental and it is the worst, depends on what i eat haha	I can understand that. But sometimes we have no choice, right?"
"My husband recently got me a great gift. He got me a beautiful 14 kt diamond ring! I had no idea he was.	That sounds awesome! I am jealous of you! What did it cost him to make it so special for you?"
"Yes, it was so sweet and unexpected. We've been married almost 23 years so I guess I deserve it lol	Wow, I love your enthusiasm for life's gifts."
"i hate that people dont care and they just throw their trash on the street	I understand. People have become so lazy."
"if im walking i pick up as much as i can	i feel the same way about trash and littering"
"i am extremely afraid of going near hiights	That's normal. What heights? Is that the kind of fear you have?"
"Yeah last year i went to disneyland and got on the elevator game and i almost cried hahaha	That is hilarious! I bet you were so nervous."
"The last job interview I went on also went well, but it took a long time to hear back from them.	That can happen. It was me who interviewed. What job were you interviewing for?"
"Oh, I did eventually, it just took like a month.  I ended up getting the job!	That's nice. I'm glad to hear. What position was it?"
"i cant wait for my disneyland vacation next summer	That's going to sound like a blast. Where did you want to go?  California or the Bahamas. I've always loved the Bahamas."
"i think me and my family is going there for 1 week it is going to be wonderfull	That's so cool!  What do they do there at Disneyland?"
"i am getting my new car next week and cant wait for it.	Oh, cool! Congratulations! How much is it?"
"it is a 2017 bmw, i traded in my old car to get an awesome deal	What color is it?"
"My in-laws are helping us pay for school clothes for our kids this year.	Oh, wow! That must be a wonderful thing for the kids to have"
"Yeah, it helps take some of the burden off of us. I will have to check out Goodwill and see if I can find anything.	It does."
"Wow, those prices are great. I'll be going by there for sure. Yeah, the best part about them helping, is that they do it, not expecting anything in return. They just all of us and want to help.	I agree with that philosophy.  It is great that people can be so selfless and help others.  It helps to have people around us."
"Yes, they are great.	I was in a college class once with an older woman.  She took a paper idea I had talked about and presented it as her own, stealing all the work I had done.	Oh wow. That must've been frustrating. How'd she react to you pointing that out to her?"
"I did.  There wasn't much she could do, but at least I could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work.	That's awful. Did she get caught up in anything?"
"i really hate when people make me wait for no reason	I feel you. Sometimes people have no reason for it and it can make us very irritable."
"my girlfriend allways makes me wait, it makes me really anxious ahhahah	That's so rude. Did you tell her?"
"One of my best friends is moving far away and i dont know when i will be able to see him again	That's really hard. What are you going to do?  Do you have another friend to hang with?"
"yeah i can call him and email him, it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again	Oh that sucks. I had to move my family to another country a few years back and i miss my family. I miss the people. I hope they will come to visit you."
"I think having goals is important. My mother in law has managed to lose weight and walked daily.	I've never tried, do you walk a lot? I walk every day."
"Very similar ones, but I like focusing on others success	Yeah goals are good but dont forget about your own goals!  What goals do you want to achieve?"
"It really does, hope any you have works out!	i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it	That's really interesting. What do people often mistreating? I know some people donkey kick dogs."
"i know right, it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me	That's really true. I think we're all on the same side of things when we think of animals. I think most people do."
"the day i gratuaded from college is my favorite day	I am sure. How did you feel about graduating?"
"the fact that it took so much work and time	That sounds like it was worth it. What was it for again?"
"i cant wait for my new tv that i ordered online and will recive this weekend	I love online shopping.  How much is it?"
"yeah it is twice the size as the tv that i have at the moment	That's cool. What brand?"
"I have an older friend who I try to help out.  She lost her husband a couple years ago.	Oh wow. How tragic. I hope she's doing all right."
"We go out to lunch regularly.  She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.	That sounds nice. What kind things?"
"Thanks.  Yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now.	We need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues, no matter your views.	I agree.  It's been a tough road for us in the US, and I think we've all got a lot to be proud.  We are a unique country."
"Exactly, let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!	I agree with you, but I think we need a strong voice for those of us with differing views. We need a strong voice to stand for our views. I agree though. We need to come together."
"I spent my first Christmas away from home in a computer lab, working by myself.	That's cool! Where was the lab?"
"Yes, it wasn't very fun.  But I had to do it because my project for work was due the next day.	That is so cool that it was a project for work."
"I miss my dog Kat	That's sad. What kind is it."
"Yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year.  She was a great dog	I had to look at some pictures of my dog, she was such an important part of our lives"
"Thanks.  I do miss coming home to her.  My cat is just not the same.	It's great to see my husband doing so well.	I hope he keeps up his good work.  I am always happy to hear that."
"He's become the top manager in his division in just two years.	That's good to hear. It's a lot to ask of a manager. I'm happy to hear he's doing well. What division is he working?  Is it finance or business?  Is he working in an office or out of the house."
"Hello, I am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets ... it is unacceptable	that's a terrible."
"I feel that pain ... as if I had been hit	Oh that must be so. What happened?"
"it's something since I was born ... I'm like that	That reminds me of the time I went to LA for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark.	That's cool, did you meet people?"
"Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also.	That must have been scary! What happened next was good though that they helped you."
"I really miss my puppy, we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always.	I am sorry to hear this happened. I hope you can get your puppy."
"Yes, she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.	that's so kind of you!"
"my son is teething and he is so cranky! I gave him tylenol and got some teething toys. I don	Oh my gosh, how old is he? Is he in pain or anything like that? I hope he gets over this soon"
"it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! Doesn't sleep good, doesn't want to eat. poor little boy	That stinks, I know he was that way with his last tooth"
"i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed. i didn't it's gonna be that hard. I think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college	I know, it can be.  But it will be easier."
"I hope so, i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face	oh thats a bummer"
"I have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around Italy.	I bet that sounds like a really fun vacation! Where is Italy?"
"I wish I were with them.  I love Italy	that is cool! where are they?"
"Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.	I agree.  I love Italy.  My family has been to there a few times.  I have not been but I am planning a trip there.  I am not sure I will go."
"That is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures	My friend bought me lunch today	That sounds nice. What kind of lunch did you get?"
"I had a nice burger and fries	Oh wow! That is a great treat."
"Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch	I hate when people pull in front of you, especially when it's clear behidn you.	Oh yeah. I get that feeling sometimes too. I hate when drivers do it, and people do the opposite. I get in my lane."
"Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.	What an annoyance. I have a similar experience at the intersection."
"yes, sadly I easily can.	I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy	That must be so scary. What makes it worse? Is it really dark outside?  Do you have to go outside at night?"
"That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on	i know that feeling. what keeps you calm in such dark and scary places?"
"I like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs. They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.	I love animals. Do you have any dogs at home that need walking or play time with?"
"They do. They get to smell the grass, they play they get their exercise, they get to have fun, they get to be a dog!	Oh wow! That is really cool to do!"
"Last night at like midnight the power cut out completely on my street	I hate when the power goes out. Was it just your neighborhood or the whole area?"
"We luckily had candles around! I was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power	That would be scary, especially if it was just for a few minutes."
"A while back my cat knocked over and broke my mothers urn.	That sounds very sad. I bet that was very upsetting for her."
"I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it	I have had that problem, it's a bummer"
"I made a bowl of cereal for breakfast and when i started eating i realized milk was spoiled!! I started gagging. it was so gross!	That's terrible. What did you do?"
"don't you hate that? gosh, i didn't eat anything the whole day because i don't have an appetite anymore	That sucks. I'm sure that milk must of gone bad."
"I was so calm and happy the other night just listening to rain hitting the kitchen windows	I love rain!"
"It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too!	I know. I was on the phone the other day and my phone just rang and rang and ringing ringringing ringing ringringringing ringringringingring ring!"
"i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere	That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear about that. What happened exactly happened?"
"not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up	That's terrible.  Did you talk to your employer about possibly getting a loan or something?"
"Though the odds are against you, I understand why people gamble. I remember a particular time I was playing video poker at a local dive bar.	That's a bad time to be playing video games. I don't gamble, but I do gamble sometimes. I usually gamble in the sports betting pool. It's a lot of fun, especially on Sundays after a big week of work."
"Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!	That was awesome. I love that place you go to. I bet I would go there and lose my money.  I can't believe you did that!"
"I honestly think New Orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the US. You never know what you are going to find around the corner.	Yeah, New Orleans is so unique! It has such an incredible music scene."
"Mardi Gras is great, but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town, and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole, and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!	Yeah, New Orleans has that laid-back vibe that makes it so fun."
"I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?	You have to be very careful with that, you want to make a mistake like that one and only and not the other way."
"You can say that again. One time, I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.	Oh, man. I know that feeling. I hate when people don't keep their promises."
"1	That's a pretty unusual way to start the day! What happened? Did you get a ticket?"
"sorry that was sent by an mistake	i know. i made one too. sorry about that"
"I don't think I am a judgmental person, but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day, and I can still smell it.	Oh, that's quite interesting. I would probably stay there with my girlfriend."
"Trust me, this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off, they had running clean water, but no toilet indoors!	That's not good, I hope everything works fine now"
"I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.	Oh that sounds nerve wreckring. Did you practice it?"
"I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.	Yeah that's good that."
"I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at, the possibility looks good!	Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?	ye,its so hard when you know you know better than they dont"
"That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!	Yeah, sometimes that happens with friends. It's like, they just aren't interested anymore, or they just got tired and moved on with their life. It's frustrating because sometimes it's the last person in the room!"
"Not too long ago, my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it!	That was so cool. I've always been impressed by those who are financially independent early."
"Yes, I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought, I am blessed.	That's awesome! It's always good to be surprised!"
"I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible	It was. I broke my own finger a week or two back and was stuck in the same place for a while."
"I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me!	That must have been painful!"
"So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!	Oh that sounds good! How old are they?"
"I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.	Yeah, that happens, I did once and had to rush."
"And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!	That is frustrating.  I am a big fan, but not enough people to go to the store!  It is like trying to get a cat!"
"I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!	I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong	That happens sometimes. Did something specific cause it?"
"The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to	I know right right there"
"I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!	Oh that sounds amazing! What school were they shopping at?"
"YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!	That is awesome that you fought so hard for everyone."
"I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!	I bet that you're right though."
"Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!	I love shopping online, but sometimes I feel bad ordering stuff that might go to waste"
"The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider	oh that's no fun at all!"
"I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that!	That's so cool! I bet that was so scary!"
"It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this ""play"" I went to recently was a little too much.	that sucks, what was it about?"
"Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat ""mystery candy"" from a box while blindfolded!	I think you mean eating chocolate mints from a box. That's what I did at the play I went.  I don't think I could've been blindfolded while eating."
"Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!	Yeah, it's hard. I hope you guys get that big bonus!"
"It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!	It's hard. I wish him well!"
"When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.	That's really generous of your friend."
"He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!	that is pretty cool"
"Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.	That's a pretty embarrassing memory, but I'm sure it's one of your favorite memories.  What party was it?"
"I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!	I can understand why."
"I don't know how you are with Calc, but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.	Yeah, I can get a lot of nervous."
"Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!	That's really cool! I hope you do too well!"
"My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night	That's really frustrating. What happened? Did she just not sleep?"
"She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her!	I bet she had you laughing! What a sweet cat!"
"I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27, I would have thought you were crazy.	That would have been an interesting story."
"I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer, but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra, and was accepted to a state university two years ago!	Oh wow, you are really smart then."
"i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college	That's so sad! Did you apply again?"
"yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha	That's good news though. What college was you accepted in?"
"My boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend...	oh that's horrible.  why would he do that?"
"Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her.	It is annoying when people choose their friends over others they care for."
"i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years	It has definitely changed the way people play video games. I remember when I was a teenager playing Mario on the Super Mario Bros, I was really just playing the game and not really paying attention to the story."
"gaming has blown up this past couple of years	I know what you're talking about."
"I love roller coasters, but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter.	That is terrible. Are you from the south? I live up north and I love roller coasters!"
"Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around, all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.	I love rollercoaster rides and I know just where to find them."
"I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.	It's exciting, but be prepared, it's going to be hard"
"I'm an Engineering major, electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?	That is awesome news! What field do you work?"
"i really am thankful for everything that i have and had	Oh yeah! I feel the same way about my life."
"it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little	That must be so special!"
"he gave it to me beafore he went to the army, and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional	My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!	That's pretty cool. What kind is the name of his bowling ball? I don't recall the names of the different bowling ball weights. I love bowling!"
"Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?	I do, but I'm a bowser fan so I have a bit of a bias. I've been bowling since I was a teenager and I still have my favorite bowling ball set. I'm a bit old and my joints get clogged up when I'm trying out a new ball, but I'm still a bowser! I've never been good enough at bowling to make it into high school, so I'm not sure if I'll make the team."
"I keep hearing strange noises in my house. My husband is out of town and I'm all alone. There has been reports of break ins on my street.	I hope it's nothing bad. Have you called police? I would hate to hear about something."
"No I don't, I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!	That sucks. Are you thinking of moving out of the house?"
"So I suck hard at bowling, but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.	What happened?"
"Yeah, my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.	I've never heard that before, but I would love it if you could tell me more about it.  How did it feel to be pro bowling when it's just you and a few balls in your hands?"
"I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend, for various reasons, but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!	That can be tough, but it's good that you feel like you're telling your true self.  How long ago was this?"
"Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.	Yeah, you could've left it out too, she might not have known how you really feel, she might not be aware. But you know what, sometimes when someone makes such advances, you feel guilty, because then you think they might have some kind of issue. But sometimes if someone is making advances like that, and if the relationship is going to end or if there's something going on, maybe sometimes they're trying to get close to something that's going on, and sometimes if you"
"I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.	That sucks! What place is it in? Was it fun to stay close to them?"
"No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.	I am glad for you to have that kind family that you can always come back to. You deserve to be safe and sound with people that care"
"So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.	That is normal.  You will get back to school routine after graduation"
"I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.	That's great, you're smart enough to handle that."
"So college is starting up soon and I feel more ready than ever to do well this year!	that's the best thing ever.  college is so excit."
"Thanks, I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.	Yeah, I procrastinate a lot.  Do you like to procrastuate?"
"So I just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room. I feel very at ease.	I bet! What did you have?"
"Surprisingly enough, a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!	Yeah bowling alley pizza?  That's a weird thing.  I love pizza but I'm picky and don't go out of town without getting a slice.  I'm going there tomorrow to get a slice and maybe another slice of pizza."
"my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart. i can't wait till these molars cut thru	I hope he starts to calm down soon."
"I do but he doesn't like them. he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad	that is horrible to see, how old are your boys?"
"I think I will be very busy Monday night playing my new game.	That's exciting! Are you playing it with friends or solo? I love playing games, what is the game you are playing?"
"World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.	that's awesome"
"I come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing. It's very frustrating.	That is frustrating, what do they argue about the worst of?"
"Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.	That's awful! Are they arguing a lot in front of the kids?"
"I think storms are wonderful, except when the power goes out.	I agree.  I love the storm.  The thunderstorms.  The lightning."
"It was extra loud and my husband was at work, bit scary.	oh my, that must have been scary for you"
"O it sure seemed like it did, dogs were scared too.	College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!	That sounds great!"
"It probably will be, as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!	That's good."
"I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.	Oh no! What kind is it?"
"It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.	I can imagine! I love going back and looking back on my own life experiences as well. I hope it brought you some nostalgia and happiness!"
"So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.	That's cool. I have never tried to play any sports, but my wife and I played some golf last year. She's a really talented golfer. I think we should play some together."
"For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!	It really stings! Did he practice a lot?"
"I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.	I have had nerves about starting my new job too. How about it?"
"it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.	that sucks.  what job is it."
"So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.	That is a bad customer."
"For sure, that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose, can't expect to be perfect!	I know.  I just hate messing with the wrong forms.  I'll just go back to using the old fashioned way, paper.  I know it's a hassle, but it's better than the wrong stuff."
"So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.	I love road trips! What a fun trip! Did you have any issues on it?"
"No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself, would do again!	That's cool! I've been there once. What a great spot for hiking and sightseeing"
"So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!	oh that is so sweet of him!  What did it be?  Was it a Honda Civic or a Mustang?"
"I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!	Yeah that's cool, I wish I had a car like that."
"So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.	Yeah, I was too once, and then bought one."
"Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.	I hope you don't end up breaking the bank on it."
"PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!	That's a crazy story. What a jerk."
"It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.	That sounds crazy. I don't like gas can thieves either."
"So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!	I'm sorry to hear that! Did you try calling the company to see if they would fix the car or not? I'm sure they have your best interest in mind!"
"Oh yes, very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now, I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.	I hope it starts up tomorrow!"
"I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.	I agree."
"I know! Like, mentally, I don't care, but my body just responds by making my legs shake, my heart pound, and speaking too quickly.	I hate presentations too"
"I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times, it was awful.	That's gross! Did you have to wash your shoes afterwards?"
"Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.	That's disgusting. I would hate to do the job myself."
"So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.	oh thats so bad"
"Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.	I can imagine. Did you talk to them about it afterwards?"
"I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester.	Oh, how much do textbooks usually cost in college?"
"Yes, everything's taken care of, thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!	Oh wow! That is so cool! Did you have to buy them or get a loan to pay for them?"
"i was really glad i finished my service for the military	I love that you get money for your service"
"it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country	I am glad you did your service for the country."
"i did not expect my car to be soo good for the price i paid	It's always nice when you get what you pay for."
"yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well	That's really cool! Did you find it at an good deal?"
"i don't like to see my parents smoke it makes me really sad	I feel your sadness."
"yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now	Oh yeah, that makes it a habit."
"i hate when ash from my cigarette drops in my work pants	I know right?  It is like it's mocking you.  Do you have any pants that are stain resistant?"
"yeah, i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off, it is really embarrasing	That's awful. Do you wash them frequently?"
"When katrina hit texas my family lost like half of their belongings	I am so sorry. That was so devastating."
"Well when it hit we left but now we are ok and we recovered well	Oh wow, that's really scary.  Did you lose anything?"
"i cant stand people that dont flush the toilet	I'm one of them. How does that make people unhappy? Do they not know the importance of water?"
"Oh, so where do you go to do your personal buisness	I have never thought about that."
"I guess i will be the next team leader	I can't wait for this weekend!"
"Yes. I was expecting that very much.	That sounds great! Congratulations!"
"My kids and I went to Six Flags and they wanted me to ride the roller coaster but I had so many reservations about getting on it.	Oh wow. Why would you want me not ride the thing?"
"The high speeds. It had been so long since i had been on one. I finally did get on and we had a blast!	It's good to get some exercise and be active every day. I'm glad you made time to go."
"When I turned 40 last year, my kids planned a birthday party for me that I had no idea about.	I was surprised too. What did you do? Did you have a party?"
"It really was and just what I need as I wasn't really happy about turning that corner into my 40's.	That is so sweet of them. It's not like you would have known about it."
"A few weeks ago we were at a wedding. Everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my 3 year old niece started to choke on a carrot. So scary!	oh that is so scary"
"Yes, someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.	That is so scary. I was sure something terrible was going on.  I am so worried I will never see her again."
"So an online payment distributor company won't instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct. Feels bad man.	That does seem like they are a bit sketchy, but what is wrong with them if they won't do anything?"
"Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.	That sucks, but they might have issues verifying your bank account. It's a security issue."
"Today is my off day and I wanted to sleep in, yet here I am awake early.	That's so cool! Are you sleeping right?"
"It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.	That is so frustrating when that is the one time you wanted to sleep"
"I was dog sitting at my dad's house last week and I heard strange noises in his house.	That's scary! Was it a dog or something? Did you call the police or anything?"
"I don't know, it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.	That's creepy. Did it happen at all again?"
"Last semester, I had to give a class presentation. My stomach was full of butterflies from the nerves.	That's terrible! Did you do okay on the test?"
"All things considered, pretty well. I definitely had some anxiety about it though. Presentations are my least favorite thing in the world.	It is okay to feel nervous when giving presentations. It shows that you are concerned about presenting well."
"My aunt recently passed away after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.	That's so tragic. I'm sorry for your loss."
"Thanks. It's been especially hard because she was almost like a mother to me.	That's terrible.  I hope she is at peace."
"So I asked out a girl in my class and she said yes. Was a big morale boost.	That's good to have people believe you can get a date!"
"Thanks! We are getting coffee this weekend. Hopefully something comes of it!	that's awesome news!"
"I always carry a multi-tool and a small 4-1 screwdriver on me. I feel like I can fix almost anything with that.	That is awesome you always have the right tool for anything. I am always carrying a small first aid kit and a small flashlight."
"I'd like to think so. I just like to be ready for anything.	That sounds like you would be a handyman/ handy-woman. What kind multi tool does it have on it"
"I'm starting a new position at my job soon.	That's exciting! What position is it?"
"I'll be managing consumer relations at a law firm. I'm really looking forward to it!	That's awesome!  What kind of law do they handle?"
"My car is on it's last legs. I think I see a new car in my future very soon.	that sucks. how old was it?"
"I would love to get an X-Terra! I'm a big fan of the SUV platform.	that's nice.  I've always liked my old ford truck.  I had one of the new fusions trucks and I think they did them cars justice!"
"After dropping out of college 6 years ago, I decided to go back this year.	I went back myself. It's a lot easier than it used to be."
"I have high hopes for myself, as I have all A's so far. I hope I can keep up the momentum!	That's a lot of hard work. I'm glad you're taking the initiative. What school are you in now?"
"I just had a delicious breakfast and now I'm casually relaxing in my room. Life is good!	That's great. What did you eat for your break?"
"Pancakes and sausage! How can you go wrong?	That's awesome! What kind pancakes are they making for?"
"So I have been saving money for about a month now and should have enough for any kind of emergency that may happen. Feels good man.	i feel good about saving money"
"Thanks so much! It definitely relieves some stress knowing that I have a safety cushion. Hoping I don't have any emergencies though!	I feel you on the safety net."
"Having a baby 3 months ago really changed my view on life for the better.	That's great! How many kids do you hope?"
"I was a heavy drinker, and looking back now, I know I was in a downward spiral, I just couldn't tell at the time. Now I'm pursuing my education and have become much more healthy and responsible.	Yeah, having a baby changed a lot of people's perspective of life."
"My husband and I are going a  cruise with a couple that we have been friends with for a long time,	That is so cool! What cruise is going on?"
"We kind of all came up with it together. They booked it and we just pay them a certain amount of money each week, until our part is paid for.	That is so cool!  How much did they book for?"
"I hope you can too. If its ok, I would like to pray for you, just to maybe help you find someone special.	I am so proud of my sister	I don't know why, is it a big sister or small sister?"
"She bought me a car	Oh that's a pretty cool thing to do"
"We are basically best friends. It is my birthday and she worked really hard to get a car for me	That's so sweet! What kind was it?  Did she get you one too?"
"I am sad that my parents didn't attend my birthday	That's not fair! What happened? Did they have a problem?"
"No, they just are not wanting to come to it	That is sad.  Why not?  Is everything fine with them?  Did they not like the idea of coming?  Do you really need a lot of attention?  It is just one day.  Maybe they just need to spend the day with you instead."
"Last week at the end of the week I got home from work and was pretty tired.  I ended up just sitting on the couch with my wife and dogs watching tv.  It was nice.	Oh wow that's nice that you had time to relax with your family. I'm so glad to hear."
"Quite a lot, actually.  It was a nice way to spend the evening.	That is nice, I am glad you had the chance to do so. I hope you both enjoyed it. Did you have fun watching tv with dogs?"
"I was going to a wedding outside of my city, and had arranged to have my dogs watched while I was gone, but the person backed out really soon before I had to leave.	That's a bums up. Did you end up going?"
"Something like that, they were vague.  It was through a company so I couldn't really get much out of them.  Luckily a friend stepped up and watched them for me.	That is terrible.  I would hate that too.  It is always hard to find people who care.  I hope you can find them again next time.  I hate being disappointed by friends and family as much.  I hope you have fun and enjoy yourself at the party.  It will be even better next time."
"I was tired last night and my wife was out of town, so I went to bed early.  I ended up lying with my dogs in bed for a while watching TV before falling asleep.	I bet they loved that.  Did you guys watch TV?"
"A wire haired dacshund and a shephard mix thing	That's pretty funny. I've got dogs too. They are fun to watch."
"My wife has been out of the country for school for a month and a half.  She gets back in a couple weeks, and it's getting tougher to wait.	It will get better soon!"
"I do, every night.  It's still hard going from having someone around every day to never, but I'll get through.	That sucks.  I hope your wait doesn it out."
"My dad was cleaning out his attic when he found a box of my old stuff from childhood	Wow thats so interesting, where is the attic located of your house?"
"I did! He found my favorite childhood book of mine and I just sat there thinking about all the memories	That must've be very sentimental.  What did he find?"
"My wife is out of the country for school, and the other day she was having a really bad day.  I couldn't really do anything to help, and it made me feel bad.	That is sad, did she say anything to make it worse?"
"Thanks, that's actually really helpful.  It's been tough being apart for so long, we haven't been apart more than a couple days since we started dating.	That's really kind of her. I hope she had good luck."
"I almost got into a fight the other day at a store.	That's so scary. What happened exactly happened?  Did you get into it over anything specific, or over nothing at all"
"A guy budged in front of some other people, I confronted him about it, and we got into an extremely heated exchange.	That is crazy. I would have reacted in the same situation. I'm not sure why some people get more tolerance from it than I do. I would not let anyone get in my way. I would have said I don't know why you are doing this, but I will not let you get in front of my friends. I was so scared."
"No, the guy eventually backed off and left, albeit not before he flipped me off a few times and called me numerous names.	For a while my husband was really sick with the flu	That is terrible. Did he recover quickly enough to get back on track with us?"
"He is but I just felt so much love for him because there wasn't anything he could do	That sucks. Did he get back on his feet?"
"When people make me wait, i get really anxious	That can be annoying, what makes you get anxious about it"
"Not really, i just look at the clock and wait for the time to come and when they dont arrive in time i start getting anxious	Yeah, that happens a lot!  Do you ever call out the person that doesnnt respond to see when they are going to get you a text?"
"I love dogs very much they are always great companions	That's so true! I love my little puppy!"
"I got a puppy not to long ago and love him with all my heart	that's so true dogs have no concept about humans suffering"
"My cat broke her leg not too long ago and had to have surgery one it	That's terrible.  What kind surgery?"
"I was lucky cause I know my vet personally so I only paid 175 usd I was so scared for her	That sounds scary. I bet."
"there was a shooting in a gas station near me i was really devastated	That's really sad. Did the people who were there safe themselves?"
"im not sure but there was 2 victims i was devastated	I am so sorry to hear. That sounds so scary. Are you safe now?"
"I was sad when my dog died	That is sad.  What happened to your dog?  Why did it die."
"I had him for 10 years. It's just so hard because he was my whole world	That's so sad. I can imagine how hard that was for you"
"I am so lonely because I am all by myself	That's okay. You can join a gym or a book store or a library."
"I appreciate that. It's just tough because I go daily without talking to anyone. It's nice to talk to someone	That is nice.  I hope you find some friends soon."
"i was really jelous when i say my  neighboor had a new 2018 Bmw convertible	That must've looked awesome!"
"yeah it is i wish i could have a car like that	That's too bad! I've always been jealous when I had a new car and now I've got one too! What made you jealous of your neighbor?"
"I am sad that my friends dont visit me	I am sad too."
"I don't have a car and they live far away	I feel you, I live far away from my family so I feel that,"
"I am disgusted that my food didn't come out the way I wanted it	That's okay! What did you want it to be?"
"It was burnt and not appealing	That sucks. Did you try again?"
"when i was young i hit a car on the parking lot and did not say anything'	I hit my daughter with a car on the parking lot and did not say a thing."
"i did not see any marks on the other car and was running late	I know that experience. It was my son's birthday party and I was late. He was upset because I didn't tell his momma"
"My sister is so caring, she took care of me when I was sick	That's so cool!  What were you sick with?"
"That is so true. I am so very thankful	That's so nice of your."
"I heard this god awful howling the other night at like 2am right outside my window	That sounds like it might have come from a stray dog. Did you call the cops?"
"It was! I was so scared to be honest with you! The worst part is that I don't own a dog either	I hate how dogs howl.  They should not be allowed!"
"I was surprised when my mom bought me a car	That must have made her very proud. What did she buy for it?"
"Its a ford mustang	oh, nice, nice mom"
"I am very ashamed in my family	I don't think that's what happened. Why would you be ashamed?"
"Because they never invite me to go places, and they never call me	oh man, what happened? did they not call? did they not invite?"
"I am disgusted because of my friends pulling pranks on me	Oh that's not good. What kind pranks?"
"I dont know. They have been my friends for so long but these pranks are just making me mad	That's terrible. Did they make fun of your clothes or something like that?"
"I was afraid when I got out of the movie theater	I'm glad you were okay! Did you see a movie recently that scared you like the one did you see?"
"I was watching a horror film and then I had to walk home alone in the dark	I'm afraid of that kind too! I usually go out at least a hour or so to be sure."
"I am very faithful that my family will make it home in time	That's great! How far is it from your home to your destination."
"They are in Cuba	That must have made you feel a bit sad"
"I am terrified that my wife is going to leave me	That would be terrible, what do you think happened? Did she leave?"
"Because she is talking to other men behind my back	That is a bad thing!  What's she doing?"
"I am sad that I won't get to see the movie I want to see	I don't get why that is sad?"
"I wanted to see the First Purge	I'm sure there are plenty of other movies you could watch instead!"
"Because I didn't have a ride to the movies	We just got back from the beach two weeks ago. It was such a lovely vacation. We loved relaxing on the beach and just taking it easy.	That's awesome! Did you guys go to the Outer Banks or somewhere else near home base of yours?"
"It was very nice. There was a day or two of rain, but mostly perfect weather!	It's always nice when the weather is good.  I hope you had fun!"
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December.	That's really exciting. Where and for how much?"
"To the Caribbean Islands. We are going with another couple that we have been friends with for a very long time.	That sounds like fun, I'm going on a honeymoon in Italy in December.  We'll have the place to ourselves."
"Thanks, me too.	The other night I was just craving candy. I ate up all that we had!	That is pretty common. I had candy and ate the whole thing in about 2 minutes."
"Sometimes you just have to! It felt so great then but I hated it the next morning!	I know right! I love candy too but sometimes I just need to control my cravings and not let it get out. I was a little bit disappointed with myself for letting my craving win. I guess I just needed a little discipline to stop eating it."
"My husbands cancer free now!	I am sorry to hear.  Is your wife's health back to normal now?"
"Congrats! We are hoping right now that nothing comes back but It's so happy	I am sorry to here about that. That must have beent so tough on you."
"I'm so frustrated with my husband. He dismantled the bathroom to do repairs and still hasn't completed them six months later!	oh no that stunk"
"He promised he would complete it within a month and since it's been so long, I called a contractor today!	That sucks. Have you called the plumber he hired?"
"I've got a job interview set up for next week and I'm really nervous!	It will go okay?"
"I hope so! I bought a couple books on preparing for interviews and I've done a couple mock interviews with a friend.	Oh no, that must be nerve wracking."
"My parents always argue and it pisses me off!	I understand how that can affect you. What do they usually argue about?"
"I have but they rarely listen. They act like children and it can get frustrating. What can you do?	It is frustrating. I would just like them to get it through their heads. They should just get over their childish behavior and move forward."
"Sometimes life just gives you lemons. At an old job of mine, I had what will probably remain the worst performance review of my life.	You had a bad experience?"
"I'm not sure it was really about my performance at all. I was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there, and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved, and I would be answering phones.	That sounds awful. What happened?"
"That's must be a relief for you.  I am assuming you have children?	Yeah, I do. I was a little worried when my son was born but now that I am an older mom, I feel like I'm in my prime. I'm 50 now and I've been a single mother for about 5 years now, so I'm in my prime in my mind!"
"So I guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  Do you attend school?	I do, I have a 2nd son."
"Do you have something you are looking forward to?	My father passed away about 2 1/2 years ago. It was totally unexpected and really was very traumatic and hurtful to me. He was still quite young and my family and I had no idea he had a life threatening health issue.	I'm sorry for losing your dad."
"I was pretty close to my father and always lived close by. But, you always wish you had more time. But, the last words I said to him was that I loved him, and I'm grateful for that.	That is very sad. I hope you find peace."
"Once when I was younger I went to a friends 16th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen	Oh, what happened? Did something scary or weird occur?"
"we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but I didn't see it.  It was a very clean door.  LOL.  Later on that night I won a door prize.  which was pretty funny]	Oh man I was laughing thinking it would be a normal glass door.  That sounds like a pretty crazy experience.  I hope the prize money helps out."
"My daughter caught me in a bad mood the other day and was being a bit argumentative. I lost my temper, yelled and really hurt her feelings. I felt bad that it happened.	That is awful."
"Yes, I was already not in a good mood, and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button. But, I knew I shouldn't have done it as soon as I saw the look in her eyes, I felt very bad.	I agree, it's always a good thing to apologize to the kids in the house when it happens."
"You never know what someone else is going through, and looks can be deceiving. Like this old man that seemed like any other drunk.	That is true. People are not what they appear."
"It was hard to tell honestly, but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic. He had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home, so I hailed him a cab and paid the driver $20.	That's nice! Did you get him a good cab?"
"We hadn't been to the beach and years and really wanting to go back for vacation. We were able to a few weeks ago and it was awesome. I was thrilled!	that was awesome"
"It's was great. The weather was perfect most of the time, and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much. We were really hyped to go!	that was awesome to hear!  I hope you all can go again soon"
"The last time I went to the fair, I tripped over a big cord. This led to me having one of those running falls, that seem to last forever! I wanted to disappear at that moment!	Oh my gosh, how scary that must of felt. I have never fallen at a carnival before, I hope it wasnt too bad."
"Oh no, there were tons of people that noticed lol. I can laugh now, but not at that moment.	It's always good that people are there.  They are always there to help."
"I lost a puppy recently and I'm still broken up about it.	It's normal to be upset. It can be hard. Did you lose it or it was adopted out of you care of?"
"it's never going to be ok, but it will be a little less painful in time.	that is very sad, I lost my cat once and it was a real blow."
"I'm sorry youve been there too.,	It's not fun when a 4 year old does something he shouldnt.	That is very frustrating."
"Took a small toy, put it in his pocket. took it back to the store and made him return it.	That sounds pretty annoying. I bet you had a tantrum about returning it though."
"Yea, he seems to get it now.	As a mom I sometimes sneak a sweet treat when I make it out alone.	That's so sweet! What kind do you like best?  My favorite is a chocolate cake."
"Still feel bad when I got an ice cream the other day	I am sure everyone loves ice cream! Did it help make you happy?"
"I've had a rough week! The house has been a mess from my dogs and toddler. My husband hasn't been helping out much, its fustrating!	That's awful, are the dogs okay or have they gotten away from you?"
"I'm not sure! He has been busy with work but also has been going out with friends a lot :(	That's awful. Is it a dog or toddler issue or something?"
"My niece made me proud today, graduated from her nursing school.	That's so cool! I'm a nursing student and I'm pretty proud that my niece is done! Congratulations!"
"YEa, she's over come a lot for it.	oh that's amazing, congratulations to your niece! Nursing must have a lot to do with her personality! What kind did she major in, was she going to be a nurse?"
"Since it was my birthday today, when I came home there was a big pink cake and flowers waiting for me :)	i would be so happy"
"My husband! I did not see it coming at all, thought we were going to wait till the weekend to celebrate.	That's so sweet! I wish you guys were going out for dinner!"
"We had to clean out our storage building because of roof damage. I found an old box of pictures!	I would love that. Did you enjoy looking through them?"
"My family and all kinds of old memories, birthdays, festivals, swimming, and other stuff	Oh, wow! That must have brought tears of joy to our faces! Did you have them on a computer or in a book?"
"It's so hot and our AC just broke. We had to open the windows to be able to sleep!	Oh I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you call the repair service?"
"The icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you	I can understand why that would be annoying."
"I'm so excited! My family and I are moving to a new state at the end of this year!	I bet! What state? I love new places! What new places are you moving to? I love Texas. I live there!"
"That is nice. Having a better paying job is always good.	Oh, I know. It's going to be nice. I am so ready to leave all of my stress behind and move to a better state of mind!"
"I've got back in to running this week, I missed it! It's a great stress reliever!	it's so good for you"
"I love to run, did Track and Field in High School! Right now I'm only running 3 miles till I build my stamina back up! What do you do for excersise?	I run 3 miles every Sunday.  I'm 29 years old and I run to keep up the stress of working."
"You won't believe the day I've had! I got to sleep in this morning, I haven't done that in months!	That's great. What made you be able to sleep in?"
"Yes, my husband even cooked dinner for me today, and helped clean the house! He has been very helpful today.	That sounds like a great husband you got there"
"This has been a great week! Well actually a great year for my family.	That's always great to have good news! What's your family doing to celebrate?"
"Thank you, my husband got two great job offers!	that sounds good, good for him"
"My daughter is growing up so fast!	That is good.  How are you doing?"
"She is 4 and in Pre-school! She is doing so well learning how to share and also knows her colors!	That's awesome. How old was your daughter when she started pre-school?"
"I live in Central Texas, it rained and lightening stuck a house here and caused it to burn down!	I have no idea what Central TX is. Is it near where Austin is in?"
"Yes, I hope the family is okay! No word yet if anyone got hurt.	I live in the same area.  I hope the family is alright.  I'm so sorry!"
"my baby is sleeping, my house is clean... it's just so nice and peaceful right now	That's very sweet of you."
"i just hope tonight won't be that night when my baby wakes up every 30 minutes	That's the worst part, right after you think you're safe and relaxed, your life is turned around and then suddenly, BAM. Your life is disrupted. I hope your day goes better!"
"I feel like a failure, Im suppose to be on a diet but ate too much today!	I do that sometimes too. Maybe try cutting back on some of those foods."
"Thanks, I keep telling myself to stick with it but its hard!	I know, I hate myself when that happens to me too lol"
"I'm thinking about quitting my day job!	I know how you feel! What's going on?"
"My boss has been unreasonable and a pain. He dosen't understand how much time I put into the company!	That's terrible. Is he willing to work for a lower salary or a different position at the company?"
"Tuesday I got to take my kids to the beach for the first time.	Oh, what a fun day! I bet they were excited. What were they doing?"
"We had a blast! I could barely contain myself on the trip there!	That's awesome.  I've never gone.  How was it?"
"My new dog is doing so great, she was potty trained in a week!	That's amazing! Congrats on the puppy!"
"She is a Jack Russell, she loves to cuddle in my lap.	That sounds amazing. I have a dog that is 12 months. I'm trying my dog training to get her potty trained. I don't know if I did a bad thing by getting her. I love her to death! I just don't want her to be a poop on my carpet. I'm not sure I did a bad thing. I don't get to do it right away though. She's been peeing on the rug for a month now. I am not a"
"i moved to a new house recently and miss my old one	That's always tough. Did you move in a hurry?"
"10 years, i hope i get to feel the same way i did in my old house	That's really cool. What house was it at?"
"i feel like i am the best player on my soccer team	I love it!"
"yeah i do i am always the one that steps up in the game	That is awesome! What's your position on your soccer team?  Are you a forward or midfielder?"
"I've been having anxiety attacks lately. Everything is great and suddenly i start thinking about something bad happening and i have a full blown anxiety attack over something that didn't even happen	I'm sorry."
"no, it just started happening. I would say it started a couple of months ago. i will see a doctor in 2 weeks	Oh, that's terrible."
"We recently went on vacation and it made me feel reminiscent. It made me think of the last vacation I was able to spend with my father before he unexpectedly passed away.	That's sad. I'm sorry for his passing. I hope he is in a better place."
"Thank you. I don't think it matters how old you are when a parent passes away, it's very painful. The vacation did bring back great memories with him though.	That's very kind of you to share. I think people often don't think about how old their parents were before passing away, and they often just think about their parents being older when that happened. It's a good point that you don't want to minimize their age, but it's also a good point."
"my friend can literally eat junk food all day long and stay skinny! She doesn't even work out. and here i am, eating healthy, working out and still loking fat	That's great that you are motivated to do the same."
"that's true too! But i just wish i looked like her	I think you need to focus on eating healthier, it sounds like she's a superfood junk food kind!"
"It was my birthday and My friend sent me a birthday card with a gift card in a mail... i never got it, somebody stole it! and we actually have a cluster mailbox so only i can open it. it means that usps worker stole it	That sucks.  You should get the mailman to keep a closer eye on it."
"i did, the lady told me they can't do anything about it because it didn't have a tracking number.	that is terrible, did you report them to the postmaster?"
"My cat was playing last nigh and brought it to me.	I love my cat"
"Well, it wasn't one of his toys like I thought. It was a dead mouse	oh that sucks"
"my son just used a potty for the first time! he is only 16 months. i'm so proud of him	Oh wow! That's awesome. How old is he now?"
"I know! they  grow up so fast! I feel like i just gave a birth to him and look at him now	that's amazing"
"Sometimes things don't work out like you planned. It can be a real let down though.	That can be. I've been in that situation."
"I got two tickets for a friend and I for a concert. The day of the show, it poured and no one got a refund.	I know the feeling. Sometimes it's hard not having a refund, especially when it comes to concert prices."
"My family went on a road trip this week and had to stop at a gas station for the bathroom.	That was my brother's first trip.  He stopped there a few days ago.  I was so worried he was going to get in an accident."
"Well the bathroom seemed cleaned but the roaches told me otherwise.	Oh wow. What a gross thing to say about them?"
"It sounds crazy to say, but even though I was hit by a car on my bicycle, it could have been much worse.	That is crazy. What happened after?"
"I'm quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws). I am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!	Yeah, that's crazy how fast a time accidents happen."
"It might be, but considering I'm 29 with an artificial hip as well, I've gotten used to being half metal.	Last semester was probably the largest challenge of my life. I go to school for electrical engineering, and I took 6 courses.	That's crazy. I can imagine that you were stressed out about those. I have had to work on that a couple of times."
"Oh my gosh then you know! I have to say though, it all came out in the wash - 4 As and 2 Bs!	I understand. It is difficult, I am sure."
"Waiting for something to come in the mail can send me in to a tizzy. It's even worse when it's parts I need to finish a computer repair job.	What kind of computer part is needed?"
"I did get it done in the end. It was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came.	That's good that you got it done in time."
"Have you ever lost control of your bowels as an adult?	That has happened to me a lot of the times I go to restaurants. It happens because of dehydration and eating too much or not drinking enough"
"Phew! I'm glad I am not the only one. Although for me, it happened in the middle of dinner at a small Vietnamese restaurant, and an employee walked in on me cleaning my pants in the sink!	That's crazy! I bet it was embarrassing"
"I went to a heavy metal music festival in Las Vegas a few years ago! I had fun, but to be honest it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster.	That's awesome! What kind was it?"
"I think it's because everybody can relate when it comes to live music. My girlfriend broke up with me the second day, but we had to stay in the same room.	Oh no, I'm sorry.  I've heard of people staying with eachother at those festivals.  That's very brave.  How did you end up?"
"You know how sometimes things don't go as planned, but it feels like they turn out better in the end?	I've been in that place before. I know, I know."
"You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event, but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend.	that sounds like a bumpy ride, but sounds fun too, I've watched that movie a few times!"
"My father was having abdominal pain, so he went to the hospital and they discovered a tumor.	That's terrible. Did they say anything to you?"
"It was cancerous, but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well. A few days later he passed away suddenly, with no exact cause of death.	That's terrible. I'm sorry.  Is he in heaven?"
"I love it when the new star wars movies come out, seeing all those kids (and adults) dress up for the theater really takes me back!	Yeah I know right?!"
"I don't anymore, but when I was a kid, a friend and I dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of Episode I.	I can understand that, but I'm not sure if I can handle it anymore, haha."
"On our second date, my girlfriend and I stopped in a dive bar on our way back from the beach.	That's so typical, how was your date?"
"Like a hole in the wall. Cheap drinks, sometimes a little dirty, but altogether relaxed - the opposite of snoody. They had a pool table and I showed her some tricks.	That's pretty sweet. I'm sure it helped to break the ice. Did you hit the hole in one game?"
"Yeah, I should have just said that. Honestly though, my favorite places to drink.	That's so cool! What did you do to learn tricks on the tableta?  What's your favorite place?"
"My father passed away a few years ago, but I still have my grandfather's watch that he gave to me.	That sounds very sad. What a terrible loss. I hope time helps you get over the pain of that."
"I honestly hope to. Every time I look at it I remember the good times we had together.	That's really sweet. I bet it's really sentimental."
"Hanging out with old flames can be tricky when you are in a committed exclusive relationship.	That is true, but sometimes you have to take risks if you want someone. I mean, if you are not in it, why even bother having them back in your thoughts right now.  But sometimes you have to go back for them, even if you don't want to. It just depends on you and your relationship with the person you want back with you."
"Actually, an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink. She made a pass at me, but I told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend.	Oh, wow.  You're in a relationship."
"going near hights really makes me scared	I don't know. I am a scaredy cat."
"just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights	Oh, you are a brave person."
"During carnival season, there is a big rave at an undisclosed location in the middle of the night.	That's cool! What are you doing at the rave?"
"They are a lot of fun! I must admit though, I was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down.	That's great! Did anything bad happen during the rave?"
"Well, there were only two officers and a couple hundred of us. By the time we were all walking away from the warehouse, I was actually laughing.	my girl friend broke up with me about a month ago	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? Did she have to end up dating someone she met online? Or was there something else going on that made her decide?"
"we where just not getting along, and did not h ave enough time to see each other	Oh no. That sucks. I hope everything works out for her though."
"yes we are	I was always terrified of haunted houses when I was little.	Oh, that's weird! What kind haunted house was it in?"
"Glad I'm not the only one! My friend has a birthday in October and she wanted us to go to one as a group. I'm still not sure if I'll go,	Oh man, that's a scary thing! Are you scared of ghosts or haunted houses in general, or is this specifically a ghostly issue you're afraid of?  Do you think you'd go back out to go to another haunted house if you did? I'd go for sure!"
"My sister snores really hard every night it is getting really anoying	That's no fun."
"well it is not really her fault it just makes me angry hahah	That's anoying.  What do she do?  Does it make noise that can't be stopped?"
"My friend and I spotted a mini-gold course when we were coming back from the next state over.	that's really cool!"
"I know! We played a round and they let us play a second round for free!	That's great. I love mini golf."
"I feel excited about our upcoming baby shower	It is!"
"I'm having a baby boy!	That is exciting.  I have a niece who is due in two days and I'm getting a headcount for my party."
"i am really exited for my vacation next summer	Oh wow.  What are your vacation plans?"
"california, i really hope i get to go to universal studios	I'm going to Universal Studios Hollywood this year."
"when she left for 3 weeks i was alone	I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a vacation?"
"nothing at all. I was kinda depressed	Oh, did you have anyone over?"
"My Calculus final was no joke! I started studying hard two weeks before the test.	oh no, that must of been scary"
"Trust me it all paid off. When I went in to take the test, I was absolutely solid on the material.	That's awesome. What kind math do they cover in the test? I am curious."
"Felt sad when she left for 3 weeks	That's too bad she left for that long time. I know how that feels"
"To see her family. It sucked though because my car had broken down.	I am sure, that was tough."
"I am happy with where we are now living	That is always a relief."
"A very nice complex with 3 pools!	that is awesome. how many people are you and 3 pools is quite a lot."
"I interviewed for a new job and the interview went really well.	That's great! What kind was it about the new job? Was it related or was you looking to move?"
"The interviewer made all the comments you'd expect from a good interview and seemed to respond well to my answers.	it's good you got it, I'm sure you're thrilled"
"Some people are just naturals. The first time I played pool with a friend of mine, she had to beat the guy running the table.	that is pretty impressive"
"I shot so-so, but my friend ended up winning the table and beating 5 guys in a row.	That's pretty cool. I like the way you guys can be friends at the end of the night but be like, ""You can't beat that"" when they're at the bar the rest night."
"I didn't receive a scholarship in college that I really wanted despite being qualified for it.	That's unfortunate. Was there another scholarship you could apply?"
"Yes, I'll still attend but the extra help would've been nice.	That's frustrating, but you can't be disappointed with what you don't get"
"I know things will work out in God's perfect timing	I agree.  I have been waiting 30 days for something, but so far nothing."
"Yes I am. For everything we want for the baby to be gifted to us lol	That's true"
"My sister graduated from college after a long road of persistence and determination.	That's a big accomplishment. I'm proud."
"Yes, she is. My family and I are very happy with her accomplishments.	Wow, congratulations. That's awesome. What field will she be working in?"
"I like being alone, but not feeling bad when no one is around to talk to	That makes sense. I like my alone time too, it allows my mind time."
"It's true I do need my alone time	Oh, that's interesting. I think people who like to be alone more often than people who like to be in groups do so for reasons like that, and maybe also because they're not afraid of hurting someone's feelings by talking. I mean I like it too sometimes, but I don't want people talking to my face or something, or even looking me up in the eye."
"Dog ate grass and then threw up	I bet that dog was sooo stoked about eating grass. Did you have a dog too?"
"Well she was ok. Shouldn't have been so silly	Oh wow, what breed is she?"
"I am so happy to be having a boy	Oh wow! Congrats! What kind is your boy's age in months and what's the sex of the boy."
"Thanks. Yes it is. I already got a crib and baby bath.	That sounds great!  I am a little jealous.  I am an only baby and I have no baby gear.  I wish I could get a crib!"
"When I was younger, I worked really hard to save up money for a car, but needed a bit more. But on my birthday, my parents paid the rest for me.	That is really kind of them.  I appreciate people doing that."
"I agree. I really wanted to do it myself, but it's something I'll never forget.	Yeah, sometimes you just need someone to help you out."
"I recently went on my first international trip by myself.	That's really adventurous. Did you enjoy yourself?"
"To visit my family for about 3 weeks, I got married a few years ago and my husband and I live pretty far from them now.	I hope you had a wonderful trip!  What country was it?"
"Yes, just very nerve racking dealing with the international flights and passport checks and security checks. Definitely an experience.	I was very proud of her for flying all by herself	That's very impressive. Did you fly with her?"
"Especially with 2 full suitcases	That must've been so exciting! What did she fly?"
"I don't generally trust people.	That is okay. People can be untrustible."
"Upbringing. Dad use to say never trust anyone before I left for school every morning	That's weird, why did you leave? Did you go to school?"
"You just can't trust people any more. My mechanic told me it was going to be $1000 to fix my Jeep.	That sounds like a pretty high price. Are you sure it's worth that?  I don't know what your Jeep is worth, but $2000?  That's a lot!  Did you not tell him about that before he said it?"
"Turns out, nothing much at all. A guy down the street got it running for $100.	that sucks, I once had someone do my car for $1000 and it was a clunker"
"I am so happy that we're having a baby boy	I have one daughter."
"Yes it is. I am over the moon	That's great news! Congratulations! How many weeks now until you meet the baby?"
"I've just successfully completed my first international flight/trip by myself.	Oh wow! That's pretty cool! What made you do that? Did you have any friends who were going?"
"Yes, I got to see my family so it was great! I had to be very organized. The flights and layovers were kind of intense.	I have done it twice. I was so nervous on the flight but once it was on the ground everything went smoothly."
"I was so sad to find out what she had done. Found it on her facebook message history..	That's awful. I'm sorry."
"She met up with her ex to return his t-shirt..	Yeah, that's terrible. How old is she now? Did you guys break up recently too?"
"I am currently expecting my first baby, it's a boy!	That's exciting! Are you having any complications during the delivery process?"
"October, right around the corner!	That's exciting! Congratulations! What type baby is it?"
"I recently went tubing on a river with my girlfriend and her friends from college.	oh man thats so sweet. what happened next after that?"
"I had a blast! It's supposedly a four hour float but we were out there for eight!	That is a lot to do in 4 hours. What was it like then?"
"My girlfriend's dog was a 17 year old Chihuahua who emerged from a bathroom at a party in 1999.	That sounds like a sad story.  Did she pass?"
"He just sort of showed up and no one knew where he came from. He passed away recently after running away from our friends farm and being struck by a car.	That's so sad. Did he have a good life?"
"I can't believe my girlfriend was still interested in me after she saw the slum I was living in.	That's not right. What was she doing?"
"Something like that. My room was in shambles and the house was falling apart! I was mortified when she asked to come inside.	Oh wow, you must be very happy that you're together then. That's not very healthy to do."
"Once after a night on the town, I came home and my room had been ransacked.	Oh that is quite a shock! Did someone break in?"
"The thing is, my alcoholic room mate was the culprit. He had even thrown some of my belongings in the bathtub!	Oh no. That must've been frustrating."
"I am expecting my first child. It is going to be a boy! We are preparing the nursery and getting everything in order for his arrival!	That sounds exciting! Congratulations!"
"Yes, it is!	that's so exciting"
"A few months back, one of my girlfriend's close friends died from a heroin overdose.	That is horrible news.  I am so sorry.  I am so heartless."
"I only met him a few times, but he touched a lot of people's lives.	I'm so sorry. That is terrible. I have lost so many friends to drugs and addiction."
"An extremely timid girl in my physics class invited the class to see her band play at a bar downtown.	That sounds fun!"
"I actually went last Friday night. Turns out she is an incredible guitarist - a real shredder!	That's cool!  I've never been into bands.  I bet it was cool."
"I am pretty sure everyone is scared of being trapped in an elevator, and I can confirm it's quite a shock.	That must have scared the wits outta you!"
"Yes just a couple weeks ago. The elevator screeched to a halt and the lights went out, and I have to confess I screamed.	That's not good, I don't have much in the way to do but sit."
"I thank God every day for the many blessings. Especially our new home	That must be nice.  What kind of house is it?"
"5 months ago now. It's really nice here, there are 3 swimming pools	Oh wow! Congratulations on your home sweethears!"
"Right after I had my baby, my husband worked second shift, so he didn't get home until around 2am.	That's nice.  Did everything work out okay for you?"
"Yeah, but it wasn't really a problem, until one night around 11pm. I was changing her diaper. The changing table was in front of a window, and I could hear people running up and down the porch in front of the window and they were banging on the house.	Yeah, it was scary. I think the window might have been open, and a bird flew out and started banging. Then it flew back up and down and up again and I was screaming and trying to close the thing. I think the window was open for a minute or two and I think the whole thing might have been a bird trying to get back to the window and get back to its nest."
"I'm not sure. Doors and windows were locked, but I was so relieved when my husband got home.	I'm a youth leader, and just the other day a teen from the group was asked to speak at a local church.	Oh no. What happened?"
"He was nervous, he has to prepare an original message. He did really good, and he really showed and understanding of the bible.	that's great, how long have they been studying the bible for?"
"Thank you.	I get so mad when I have to repeat myself	That happens to the worst of us!"
"I know. But it makes me stressed out	i hate that about me"
"Hello ... today I am happy, we go with my children to the movies and then to eat pizza	That's so much fun! What is your favorite type of food to get at a movie theater?"
"The incredible ... they love ... it's going to be fun	That's a fun way to spend time together."
"Thank you very much and you too..	Graduating from college was a load off my shoulders.	That must have felt good. You must be proud of yourself."
"Thanks, it was a long journey.	That sounds great! Congratulations!"
"I was turned down for a job I really thought I'd be a good fit at.	I hate rejection."
"Someone else interviewed who had much more experience than I did.	That's terrible. Did you try again?"
"I went to a sketchy part of town once. Just being there put me on edge.	That's terrible! What was wrong?"
"It was for work so I had to do it, but I typically avoid those places as well	Oh man, did you find out who did it? Or did you just have a bad experience? I've never had one either"
"We went to a friend's house the other day for dinner. I was helping her cook. I was following the directions of a recipe and accidentally cracked her baking dish.	That's terrible! Did you crack it on purpose?"
"Yes, I did, but she wouldn't even hear of it. She told me it was fine.	Oh, that was a tough situation. Did you two end up fixing things?"
"I am looking forward to moving into a easy place to take care of.	I know how that feels"
"No, not moving soon, only wanting to and looking around to see what is affordable.	That sounds great, where you go?"
"So I had an emergency come up for my family and I had enough money to cover it. I feel great for preparing!	That's really cool. How much did you have saved?"
"Definitely! And they are paying me back, so it isn't like I'm losing money either.	Yeah that's good to hear. It's good to be able handle emergencies like this. I hope you get more money in return!"
"I drank a lot of alcohol at my friend's BBQ party, and I ended up puking and passing out. Not my finest moment.	oh man, that is terrible, what did you do after?"
"Hahahaha! Well, I guess we can make light of even our worst moments.	That happens to a lot of people, but at the end, it can be good to laugh."
"My eldest son just graduated High School I was so proud.	That's really cool. Congratulations!"
"It's kind of a surreal feeling tho, hard to accept that he is grown.  Now college is about to start.	I can relate to that. College is a big transition for anyone, but especially for the parents of high school kids."
"The time just flys by doesn't it?  It hard to imagine that they dont need you so much anymore.	So a customer just came into my work and started yelling at me for something that wasn't my fault. I hate when people do that!	That's frustrating. I hope you were able to resolve it."
"No, I didn't yell back haha. I would get fired.	It sounds like someone else did yell back though. I hate when people do that! It makes me feel so angry! I wouldn probably have gotten fired too. That sounds like someone is trying to get a rise outta you. I would definitely go and get a manager!"
"Retail, yep.	It makes me angry when people never notice me	That's a little strange. What happens when people don't notice you?"
"Everything. I don't have friends so it's nice to get noticed	That's great.  I wish you had more people to hang with.  You should try to meet new friends through work, hobbies or classes you could take to get to meet more people."
"I get excited when I go swimming	That's fun! What do you like most about it?"
"The fact of relaxing in a large pool of water. It just grabs my attention	Oh that's nice. What pool do you go to most often at that."
"My wife wasn't feeling so well, so I took care of her and made her some soup <3	That sounds nice.  What kind of illness is she in?"
"She is much better now! I love her so much, so I try to take good care of her.	Yeah, that's nice."
"I am so grateful to my family	Oh yeah, that must make life so great! How long will they last?"
"They help me with whatever I need and they are always their for me.	That's so true. Family is so precious."
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a party	That's really sweet of them! What year was that party for you?"
"It really was. I am pretty thankful for them	That sounds nice. What kind of party?"
"A big wind storm blew through town and uprooted one of the trees in my yard.	Yeah that was scary. Did you lose anything else in your yard?"
"No, but that was my fear. I kept waiting to hear the sound of a branch or tree hitting my roof, or breaking glass.	I'm glad it was just a tree. I would have been so upset."
"I took my dog to an agility competition and she ended up winning first place!	That sounds awesome! What breed is she? I'm so jealous!"
"Thanks so much! It did, but she's so hard-working and I couldn't have done it without her.	That's so cool! How big of dog is she then?"
"I was sad when my parents left me	That is very sad. What happened? Did they divorce?"
"I stay with my older sister now	That's tough. Did they leave for a new job?"
"My brother got a really high-paying job and now spends all his time flaunting his money.	That is unfortunate."
"Not very well! I mostly just stew and complain about it and wish I had his money and lifestyle.	I feel you bro. He needs to get a grip and not get too caught off by a surprise."
"I was disgusted when my food had a hair in it	That would have made you sick?  What kind food was it?"
"Yeah I got a refund. They were very sorry about it and I forgave them	I hate when that happens.  What kind was the hair in?"
"I was anxious when I went to the theme park	That's okay! What was wrong? Was it the park?"
"The roller coasters	I know right. I went there once when I was little and I was terrified of anything that moved."
"I was furious when my friend made fun of me in front of random strangers.	Oh, I bet that was uncomfortable."
"I am not sure. He told me he was sorry afterwards but I didn't listen to him	That's awful, did they not know you were watching your back? I hope they're watching yours now.  Maybe try to be more considerious next time?  It's not easy being around people like that, I would say."
"I feel so lonely because I have no friends	I feel you.  I used to be part of the school.  Now everyone moved away to a new school."
"I haven't. Im too shy and I am scared of what people will say	That's okay, you can always try to make friends, but you might be lonely. Maybe you should look online and join online communities or something. I'm sure you'll make friends!"
"I was jealous when my girlfriend was talking to other guys	That can be very hurtful"
"I do not. I have trust issues	Oh, that is understandable."
"I was terrified when I watched that horror film in the theaters	oh yeah that one was scary."
"I did but it was really a challenge for me.	oh wow that was scary! did you see what movie it was about?"
"I was sad when my dad died	Oh no. I'm so so sorry. I'm really going to miss you."
"It happened 3 weeks ago	I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you can find some comfort in the memories you made with your father. I lost my father at the same time and still miss talking about him and his life."
"I was sad when my wife left me	What happened?  Was she cheating?"
"I just dont know why she would marry me then.	I was in the same situation.  She left me after 3 months of us being married.  We were married in 3 months.  I think she had a miscarriage.  I thought we would work through it and she came to her senses.  I thought I would get a divorce and move on with my life.  But I guess I was just wrong."
"My family and I went to the beach on Tues and spent the whole day there.	Oh that's a nice thing to do! I haven't been to one of these in a while, but I've been thinking about it lately."
"One small thunderstorm but other than that great! I'm amazed I didn't really get burnt!	That is a lot of time you spent. I wish you had gotten burnt."
"When someone talks down to me, it makes me sad	I know that. It makes me sad too. What happened to them?"
"I am just too shy to say anything. I dont know how	I think everyone feels like this, even though you don't want to admit it. I think you just want to fit in and be accepted. I wish you would just speak up for once. It can make you more accepted by everyone."
"I am super joyful when my family comes together to eat dinner	That's always so special for me."
"Usually once a week. Its a great feeling	That sounds like a great way to bond as a group."
"I was surprised when my parents threw me a big party	That's awesome! Did you enjoy it"
"It was. I had a great time	I bet! That sounds like a lot of work for a party."
"I am so annoyed that people are so mean to other people	I am sorry."
"That is so true! I dont know where this world is heading.	that is so true"
"I get so jealous when my parents don't pay me any attention.	That is understandable. I get it.  It's hard when your parents don't care about what you're going on about"
"I haven't because I don't know how to start that conversation.	I feel you bro, I have parents who never pay me any attention, and they always seem to be on the phone or on their phone"
"I was furious when my dog ate the wires to my Television	That's not the worst part. What were the wires for anyway?"
"Yeah but it will take a few days because I have to wait for my paycheck	That is awful. I hate when dogs do that. What happened?"
"So what happens in the middle of the night? I got woken, again, by my upstairs neighbor thumping around. Does she have to be so rude?!	Oh my goodness. Are you a little annoyed at your downstairs roommate?"
"No, they don't. Well, this time I've had enough. I've told management I want into another apartment and explained exactly why!	That's awesome you stood up for it! I wish you would do it"
"Not really, but the alternative is to go slowly mad. These blessed individuals stomp around day and night, screeching into their cellphones - they're horrible.	I am a very trusting person. It gets me in trouble sometimes.	oh no i am the same way too lol what are some things that you trust more?"
"People take advantage of me	I am sorry. I hope you can find a way out of that situation. It's hard to be trusting with people who are mean or just generally mean-spirited. It makes it harder to find trust in people who don't have it to offer.  I know how you feel."
"I'm only 6 months away from having my AA in Healthcare Administration.	That's a big accomplishment to reach."
"I really am, I can't wait to start my new career!	That's great! I am sure you will do well."
"Going to the dentist always has me on edge. I hate it!	That's the worst. I don't like it when you have to go back in there every 6-12 months."
"I know...it's a necessary evil. But it hurts so much!	Oh, yeah. I don't like going either, but sometimes you just have to."
"One of my very dear friends got his dream job recently. He was so diligent in finding information and contacts. I so respect what he's achieved.	that's awesome! good job"
"Well, it takes perseverance and a bit of luck, but you can do it!	I am so inspired right about now. I have a dream too and I will work very hard for that. I am going to college in the next  two months and I am going to apply!"
"Lol, you and me both. You could always marry a Kardashian!	You think they would even notice you? lol"
"Or someone not quite so objectionable :) Seriously though, I'm so happy for K with his new job.	We started watching a Red Sox game near the end and they were losing. Next thing you know, they were ahead four runs.	That's awesome! What a game!"
"Yes, usually I think so too. But this was really fun to watch and we were so happy because it did not look good at first.	That's great! What was so special?"
"My car that I hate is going to die soon and I'll be able to get a new one. Score!	That sounds great! What kind is it?"
"I'm thinking something reliable. Maybe a toyota or mazda.	That sounds good!  I'm not too good with cars.  I don't want to spend too much either.  I've been thinking of a Honda.  Is it reliable?"
"Yesterday my husband opened a window and a HUGE black bug flew in!! I almost died!!	That is crazy! Did you try opening a window to get rid of him?"
"heck no, i told my husband to deal with it. i ran in my bedroom and locked the door	That's gross. I hate when that happens. I'm glad you ran into your bedroom and locked it. I hope the bug didn't bite you too."
"Well, don't you know, one of my neighbors who works for AA was in San Francisco recently and saw some Scottish cheese (I'm Scottish). So she bought some and brought it to me. How nice of her to do that!	that sounds nice, how did you like the cheese?"
"This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.	That is nice of your neighbor."
"Ooh, I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?	That sounds deliciously unique!"
"I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me. I'm in NC, where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!	I have tried Cabots before, but it's not my favorite."
"my brother would've turned 34 today. he died 2 years ago and It still hurts so much	That's too bad. I'm sorry about the loss of your brother. I know how much you miss them."
"yes we were. He moved to the different country but we spoke pretty often	I'm so so sorry, I know how much he meant to you."
"I had planned to go to the beach with friends, but it looks like it's going to rain.	It does sound a bit rainy.  Do you think you're going to go anyway or are just going to stay home and stay dry inside the house."
"Nah, it said there's be thunder and lightning, so looks like we're stuck inside :(	That sucks.  Why are they going anyway in the first place."
"I spent last weekend with most of my family, they live out of state and i don't see them often.	Oh, that's nice. What did you do over the weekend?"
"I did, Yes. Work has been hectic lately so i was really looking forward to unwinding with them.	That is nice. I wish you a relaxing weekend too. I bet it felt good to be with them"
"We ate good food, drank wine and went swimming.	That sounds like fun. Did you have fun?"
"It was, kind of hot but not enough to complain about.	That is awesome. What kind food did you eat?"
"I hate how our country is so divided right now	I agree.  We need to work together."
"True. I hope we can become less divided in the future and solve things	I agree with you on that, it really seems like the country is becoming very polarized"
"My father passed away about 2 years ago. It was so very difficult for me and very unexpected. We didn't know he had a life-threatening illness and weren't prepared in any way for his sudden departure from us.	I'm sorry for the loss.  I have family too.  I wish I had more time to spend with mine."
"Yes, my family and I are close and we were there for each other. But, my sister had passed away around 6 years before, by committed suicide. The last few years have been very difficult.	I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry you lost both parents. I hope you can get back to normal life."
"I feel like a terrible sibling right now.	That can be really frustrating"
"My sister, who lives out of state and i don't see often, was recently in town visiting our dad. I didn't visit with them.	Oh man.  Why didn't you visit them?"
"I am going to a concert very soon.	Oh man! What kind concert is that going to be of?"
"Imagine Dragon and Grace Vanderwhall, do you know them?	That's really cool. What kind of music do they make."
"Yes she was.	Our new property management person is remarkably efficient. She emailed me details of a conversation we had yesterday. The others promise the earth and don't deliver!	That's great.  How long have they been in charge of property management for?"
"It is. I've been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it.	That's good that she's being efficient."
"Absolutely! I move September 1st. No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!	School for my kids started again this past Thursday.	I am so excited for summer!"
"It was good. I am dealing with a mixture of both emotions about them being back in school. I was happy I had all the supplies, clothes, shoes, and other odds and ends in time.	I feel the same way about my kids. They go to school every day."
"I had planned a beach trip about a month before we actually went.	Oh no! What happened?"
"We went to Virginia Beach earlier this week. I was so giddy up that whole month I could barely contain myself.	That's so awesome! Did you guys have fun?"
"My husband, 2 kids and my mother. My kids had never been to the beach.	That's great! Where is Virginia Beach?"
"I bought a ticket last week for the lottery, when it was over 100 million dollars.	That's awesome! Did you win the lottery?"
"I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn, but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.	Oh, that's sad. I don't even get why people do it though. I mean, I know a lot of friends of mine have done well off lottery winnings, and they're always happy to help them out financially."
"True, but it would be fun spending that money.	My husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! This was unexpected and great news	That's wonderful news! Congratulations! How much will it pay you both?  *big smile *  I am a huge football fan.  How much will you be paid in total bonuses per month for you?"
"It sure does. It came as a shock, but a pleasant one.	oh thats nice, how much will he be making in that month?"
"I just went today to visit my son in his new house.	Oh that must have made a great trip. I'm sure he was excited to see you!"
"It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it.	That's really cool! I've never bought anything that expensive, so I'm glad you had the opportunity!"
"So tonight we are suppose to go eat out as a family but I cant get a single one of my family members to agree on a place.  So frustrating!	I feel your pain! Maybe try ordering takeout from home? That usually works well."
"That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.	I have that same feeling, I'm going to go out and eat by myself tonight and then I can be mad.  I'm going to the Olive Garden and order the chicken parmesi. I haven't had it in ages."
"Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.	I love PB & Jelly."
"I guess that way the wallet wins every once and awhile too!  lol	I'm so happy that it is Friday!	That will be soon. I am happy that the week is almost over."
"Somewhat, I work 4 10 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. Yesterday was my off day. What about you?	Oh man, you must be a little tired of the off days!"
"feels disappointed because my friend fights with me	I'm sure it's just a normal part of friendship."
"no i can't because i love him a lot	That's nice of your to love your friend so much.  What do they fight about?  Is it a personal issue or a misunderstanding.  I have some friends like that, but mine is a family issue.  Maybe you should just keep a level head on and try to understand where they're coming from.  I think it might be the stress they're feeling under.  I don't know, I hope it's not a serious family issue though.  I have a family"
"I have Lupus and it is getting worse.  I asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet I found that is suppose to help me with it.	That can help. What diet have you found helpful for Lupus?"
"yes, but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun	I hope it helps you!"
"Some time ago, there was a terrible tornado that came through my city. It destroyed many homes, a school and some people died. I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it, or harm my familY!	i hope it never happens to you and to everyone else in your city"
"No, they are so awful! They can destroy so much.	I know right! It was like the whole world was against us. I was so scared. I was not sure how my family was going. But my mom and dad kept me safe and calm."
"My husband took me to get a new wedding band recently	I bet that made him very proud"
"I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.	That sounds nice."
"I love the holidays. Driving around looking at decoration is my favorite.	I love that holiday season."
"Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.	yea thats my favorite also."
"I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her	That's so great! What do you guys usually do together?"
"I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.	I have a sister inlaw too. She's a bit of an oddball, but I think I can handle it"
"A few weeks ago, we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But, it rained several days, so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted, which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.	That sucks."
"Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So, a long time since we first went.	That sucks."
"My husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting	I hope you're not too happy, promotions are so stressful"
"I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.	That's awesome.  I wish I could work hard like that.  I hope he enjoys his new job."
"We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man, so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.	That must have been hard for you."
"We didn't have much choice, as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat, so if we didn't, we'd come back to not having pets. But, I wouldn't just let anybody, that's for sure!	That is very responsible of them. They really care for animals. It's good they made sure pets were not left alone for long periods of time without checking on them. I think people don't always care about the welfare of animals as well."
"My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell	That's very brave of her."
"I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things	Yeah that happened to you too."
"One night when my children and I came home, I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!	That's creepy! What did you see? Was there anything in there with you guys"
"It was so scary! Luckily, it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up, but it first appeared to be an intruder!	That must've been frightening!"
"Last weekend, my family and I enjoyed a nice meal together, and then watched a movie. It was a relaxing time at home, just enjoying each other's company.	That's nice. What movie did they show?"
"Yes, it was drama free and a relaxing time.	That is nice!"
"My dog, riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure	Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear. I lost my my lab, Luna, and I know how much she meant to you. I'm so sad for you. I know how you're feeling right about now"
"It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps	that must of been so sad to go through that"
"I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me. She was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support, and that's why I didn't tell her. But, I still felt so bad about it.	That is very unkind"
"Well, she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job, plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.	I think it would! You should tell him! He should be honest about it and offer to help her. I'm sorry she didn't take it. Maybe you should talk about how you would handle it in the future. I hope she will forgive you. She probably will, but it will take a little time to figure things out.  I would just try to make sure she feels like you are there to help. She probably feels like you are not a good fit for her grand child"
"I am trying a new diet to treat my Lupus.	I've had Lupus for a few years now and it can be tough."
"I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take	I hope it works. I've heard it's hard. You have my support."
"There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments, so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating, since it causes others more work.	it sucks when people don't follow instructions, it can cause problems with safety"
"Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over, but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!	Yeah! It's like she has no sense of logic or reason."
"My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning, and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.	I have had cats die on my floor. I can't have another cat."
"Yes, she was only about 9, and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!	I am sorry.  That is terrible. I hope she is not too long."
"I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.	I bet you were so excited! What numbers did you choose?"
"Not normally, so I was quite surprised.	That's good. Did you buy it all out?"
"$1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.	that's good to be able to catch up"
"Thank you, that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out.	I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day.	It was really scary. What did you do?"
"Someone backed into my new car.	That's so rude. I would have cut them off and called the police."
"Yes, they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it.	Many years ago, we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her, but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!	That's horrible! Did she end up hurting herself or anyone else?"
"Well, she was attractive and at the time, I thought he was thinking that too. But, I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, since she was falling down. But, it was hard to see it at that time lol	Yeah, it is hard seeing how we can change our behavior, and help others, but at least we can try. It is good to try."
"I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.	oh, what happened? Was something wrong with it?"
"Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night.	That's pretty gross. Did you call the police?"
"Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.	That is ridiculous!  I would love a mailbox like that.  Did the mail go missing?"
"That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.	That sounds like it could work."
"My aunt came to visit today, we went out for mexican food!	That sounds like a great time! Did you have fun?"
"Yes, kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours, she is on a road trip!	Oh, that's too sad!  I hope she was able to have some time with her family."
"I have a big exam for college coming up, I have been studying day and night.	That is awesome. You must feel very nervous."
"It is for my molecular biology class, I feel pretty good that I am going to Ace it.	That sounds awesome! I love science class!"
"I went and saw a hockey game today, It was really exciting.	That's really cool! What did you think of it?"
"No, I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool.	I used to play ice hockey too!"
"I was on a run today, and saw a loose dog but couldn't catch it before it ran off!	It's always sad when animals run off.  Did the dog come home safe though."
"Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!	That is a little concerning, I'm sure. I live up here too so I know what you mean. I hope the dog turned out alright though"
"I got some bad news today, my dad passed away.	I'm so sorry. I'm really sad to have heard that. I'm glad that you're not feeling too overwhelmed by it. I know how hard that is to do"
"Thank you, I am a mess. It is still hasn't hit me that he passed away.	That is bad, I hope you can get through that."
"Its so quiet in my house, my husband is out of town for work.	That's nice. Do you guys like quiet time together?"
"True, I'm trying but keep hearing creepy noises. Guess I need to turn the TV up louder haha	What do the noises sound?  Is there anything you think is up?"
"I got some great news today! My husband got a better paying job offer!	I am happy for you.  What is that job offer for?"
"Not sure yet, but itll help us life more comforatbly! We move to his hometown in November when he gets out of Army!	You should be happy about his new job!"
"My daughter is in highschool but took a college course this summer and got an A!	That's so cool!  I have never taken a college course.  I think I will."
"That is very good. You should be proud of her.	I ate way too many sweets today!	I'm sure you did. What kind of sweets?"
"Thanks! Being on a diet is hard, espically with family in town!	Yeah, but I think you should have eaten them."
"I was running today and felt like this car was following me..	Oh that is so annoying"
"Yes it was, I think I need to start carrying pepper spray or something	hsits called "" pepper spray""?  thats not going in the bag though?"
"Im watching the show The Bold Type, my favourtie characters dad died :(	yeep i know that show. its a good show.  why did he die?"
"Yes, it's a great girly drama! Reminds me of Sex in the City but Modern.	I have seen it before, and I can tell you will enjoy it!"
"It's been a great night! I'm just relaxing with a cold drink and my favourite show!	That's always the way. Relaxing and happy at home!"
"Yes defenitly, It dosen't get better then this! My daughter has been fast asleep since 8pm.	that's good, kids need their sleep too"
"My family is moving from Texas to Arkansas in a few months, Im worried for the change.	That's crazy! How do you like Arkansas so far though?"
"My husband is getting out of the Army and moving back to his hometown where he has a few job offers! Big changes coming..	Yeah, that's great that he has some job opportunities! I'm sure it's hard for you, but you'll get to see new places too!"
"I recently moved into a new home.	That is so exciting! Where are they from originally?"
"Yes, there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with.	That must be a fun neighborhood."
"We had been saving for 4 years to buy a bigger house. We had outgrown our other home.	I had a doctors appointment today.	I had an appointment a few months back.  How was everything?"
"I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back.	oh no thats so annoying"
"I agree! Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever.	I had just moved in to my new apartment, and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door.	Oh that sounds terrible. Did he pass out?"
"At first I tried to resist, but I ended up adopting him!	That sounds so sweet. Did he grow?"
"I received a wrong number call last night at 2 in the morning.	Oh that sucks. Was it scary?"
"Yes! It was so aggravating. They would not believe me when I kept telling them it was the wrong number.	that's the worst part"
"She did twice before she finally believe me that there was no Bret there.	I recently found out that I am having baby number 4.	That's great! Congratulations on having 3 and now another one!"
"Wow! That is great. We were thrilled because we didn't know if we were going to have anymore and nature just decided for us.	That is great. I am happy for that."
"Yes they are. They make life worth living.	Halloween is quite a big holiday where I live. People get really in to their costumes!	That does seem like a fun time of year. What costumes did people wear?"
"It's peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining. Last year I went as a plague doctor, and everyone agreed it was terrifying!	I'm more interested in Halloween costumes myself, but it seems people like it."
"Last year we lost our home of 20 years to a house fire.	That is terrible. I am so sorry. That is terrible."
"Yes, thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened.	It's good you were safe though"
"No, we just bought another house closer to town. It was sad losing everything that we had.	When me and my friend got lost in the desert, I thought we were done for.	That is not good. Were they okay?"
"Only a couple of hours. We flagged down an old Chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out.	That's nice. I've never been camping with friends before."
"I went tonight to meet my daughters teacher.	I hope she likes you. What's she like?"
"Yes, I think she will be a great teacher. She showed us her plan for the year and I think it was great.	That sounds great! I bet your daughters loved it too! How old are they?"
"Thanks so much. I completely agree.	I just finished watching the Saw movie.	ye thats so bad. how many saws are there?"
"I hated it! I didn't want to watch it but my husband did. The gore is just too much!	I know right? The gore in that one is just awful. I hate watching movies that have that much."
"Yep! I feel kind of sick to my stomach now from watching it.	I recently went down memory lane was looked at all my high school yearbooks.	Did you look at them while alone or did you go through them while looking at your friends?"
"Well.... maybe not as awesome. lol But I do try to keep in shape. It was good seeing all my old friends.	That can be nice to reminisce about old times"
"I do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch.	I have friends from my old school. I miss those days."
"That's a good idea!	I bet that was hard"
"I had this guy flag me down today after leaving the store.	That's very kind of you to do that! How'd you get that guy to stop and flag you down?"
"I was scared at first and then he hollered and pointed to the top of my car and I had left my purse on it. Boy, did my face get red.	oh wow thats soildy"
"My daughter just bought her first car on her own.	Oh, really! Congratulations! That must have felt great!"
"It's a 2008 Mustang. She worked the last two summers to buy it.	That's awesome! I wish you all the best for the rest of her life."
"She is super excited to start school now and show it off.	I'm leaving tomorrow to go on vacation!	I hate to leave home!"
"We are going to Daytona and Orlando for 10 days.	that's going to sound like a lot. are you going to Daytona Beach or Daytona USA parkway trail?"
"I sure hope so! We've been planning this trip for a year.	That is fun. Where are Daytona and orlando?"
"My husband and I have a fun weekend trip planned soon. We are going to go to the casino for the weekend, just the two of us. We are really looking forward to it.	That is fun. What type of casino is that?"
"Yes, it's been awhile since we had just some time for us. Plus, we love Blackjack!	I love blackjack too, I wish you both the best of luck! I am not a big casino game, but I love the atmosphere."
"I have a very good friend and her live-in boyfriend of 5 years hit on me! I'm married, and he didn't care. He sickens me!	That's a lot of crap. What do you want him to stop hitting you with."
"Yes, I was really surprised and I find it terrible behavior.	That's a bit of a problem. Did you tell them no thanks?"
"We went on a vacation a few weeks ago, and it really made me think back to our last vacation. It was with my father, the last one before he passed away.	Oh, I love vacations. Where was it?"
"I did, but of course, wished I had more time. He passed away unexpectedly, so I was going over that vacation in my mind too. I miss him.	I'm sorry.  You guys have some great vacations."
"I was pleasantly shocked the other day when I won on a lottery ticket! I hardly ever win and I won $200!	oh wow! That must have been such an excitement!"
"I just tucked it back for a rainy day. But, I may splurge with it this weekend, since it was unexpected.	I'm happy you did well on that one ticket!"
"My husband sure did surprise me with his handiness and hard work around the house last week. He was able to accomplish so much work in a few days!	That's very kind of him.  What kind of work?"
"Ok	I was the first person to receive a pretigious award at my college after years of the award being on offer.	That's awesome, congratulations on that achievement.  How long have it been since it's been given?"
"At the department office back at the school.	That's awesome! Congratulations to yourself on receiving such an honor"
"One of my coworkers really ticked me off one day. She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!	Yeah, that would be so rude."
"Yes, she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her, and it was her work! I let her know it too.	That must have been frustrating.  Did she apologize for doing that to you?"
"One year my cousin wasn't going to get her young son anything for Christmas. It broke my heart so my husband and I bought his Santa gifts that year.	Oh that must have been a hard time for your family. I bet it was tough to see"
"The little guy deserved a Christmas and we really loved him.	That is really nice. What kind was Santa getting?"
"When I went to the fair last year, I tripped on a large cord they had going across the walkway. It was a long, running fall! I wanted to hide!	That is crazy! Did anyone see what you tripped on?"
"Scuffed knees, but mainly my pride. I was also in front an attractive guy I knew so it was even worse.	It happens to the best of people.  You just have better timing.  I tripped on a wire once.  I ended up falling into a dumpster!"
"My husband and I are at a point in our lives, we are able to save, afford all that we need and save for retirement. I'm so appreciate we can, as I know many aren't able to do that.	I wish I was in a relationship where I didn't have to worry so much!"
"Yes, we have been working hard, as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times. But, it's worth having some financial freedom!	That's great news about you. I wish I had that kind of situation."
"One day at work while I was pregnant, I fell! Luckily, the baby and I weren't hurt, but I wanted to waddle away so fast!	That sounds like it. What kind were hurt?"
"Yes, it really was quite so!	That sounds terrifying! Did anyone help me?"
"There are times I feel a bit alone and down. My husband has to travel out of town for work quite often.	That is sad, but you have to keep going. You'll always have each other."
"Well, yes, of course. But, that isn't quite the same, is it.	I am sorry, but it is just life sometimes."
"My children recently started school again and it made me feel a bit apprehensive. They are growing up so quick, and I know it won't be long before they sadly move out of the house :(	I feel you. It is hard to watch them grow."
"For sure! But, it flies by before you know it. I get my nerves on edge when I think about them all moved out of the house.	I can understand that. But, they are your babies now and you need to get through it so they can move in the right time when they are older."
"Despite working until a few hours before, I scored highly on the ACT the first time I took it back in high school years ago.	That's cool! What kind did you take it with?"
"Thanks. I thought I'd do poorly because I was tired.	That's awesome! What was the subject you scored well in on?"
"Not that long ago, my husband planned a secret trip for us! I didn't have a clue he was doing it and was pleasantly shocked. It was so much fun!	That sounds like a lot of work.  I hope you enjoyed yourself."
"We just took a weekend trip to Tunica, MS. We stayed at a really nice casino hotel and just played some Blackjack, enjoyed good food and each other's company!	That is great! What casino did you stay in at Tunique?"
"I lied to my mother one day about where I was going. It made me feel pretty bad and have a bad conscience.	That's bad, but you can always try again. It's not the end."
"She didn't want me going with that friend, but I wanted to go, so I lied to her. I was much younger then.	That was a bad idea. You should be honest with your mom. She will forgive you."
"I won a free trip to Florida. It's not the best vacation, but I'll take it for free.	I'm sure it was worth it, you're a smart shopper!"
"I've been to Florida many times before so it wears on you.	i love Florida."
"I won a lottery for a small amount of money.	That sounds pretty exciting!  How do they work?"
"No, I wish. It was only a few hundred dollars.	That's a good luck, did you spend the money well or was it saved up?"
"A good friend of mine moved away recently and we lost contact. I really wish we would still speak.	I know. I miss talking.  I hope we still be friends.  I think I can do better if we stay friends even without seeing."
"That's a good idea. Maybe I'll try that soon.	That's nice. I'm sure you will be able."
"Someone was speeding on the road and I got into an accident with them. My car was totalled because of their carelessness.	That sucks.  I would have loved to have been there for the person.  I hope they are alright!  I hope they learn from their actions!  That is the most frustrating thing about people driving like that."
"Yes, but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn't an enjoyable situation.	Oh my, that is terrible. I'm sorry."
"I let a friend watch my dog for a week while I was out of town. I would've been devastated if anything happened to him.	Oh wow. That must have been scary. How did he do?"
"I hope so. I've only had my dog for a short time and this is my first time away from him.	That's good! You can't let friends watch your dogs, I think."
"I have been feeling great about life recently. My relationships have been going very well	Oh really? That's a good sign. I'm happy for that. What happened?"
"I am not, but I have a person I am very fond of. Are you?	That sounds like things going good for you then"
"I got a surprise gift in the mail yesterday.	That is so exciting! Did you open it up and find something amazing inside?"
"A gorgeous vase. It's so pretty. I have no idea who sent it.	That sounds so beautiful! Who sent it to you? I love getting new and unique things."
"Yes, I love flowers. I can't wait to fill it up.	My sister broke my vase. I was pretty enraged!	Oh that's too bad. Did you yell?"
"I scolded her but then told her it was okay, but it's not the biggest deal!	That was not the biggest deal? Why not?"
"I'm am upset today because my daughter who lives really far away called and said her baby was admitted to the hospital.	I hope that wasnt your child being admitted to the hospital!"
"He was premature so he's been having some breathing issues. I hate not being there.	I hope everything turns out well for your daughter!"
"I'm so taken by the talents of contestants on the show Face Off -- have you ever seen it?	I haven't seen it yet, but I think I'll have to check it out.  I'm always curious about shows that I've never heard of before."
"Their abilities to both imagine and create their characters is incredible!	I have, I've watched it multiple times. It's so cool to see people so talented at making things and bringing them to life like you described it"
"A lot people know Toys-R-Us has completely shut down not long ago.	I agree. I am sad."
"Yeah, a lot of my friends and I got to thinking of all our memories there. Really makes you think back.	What happened to it? Was it a store closing or something?"
"I feel so bad, I forgot my sisters birthday...	That's the worst! What happened? Did you forget it by chance or did she tell you about the day she was born?"
"Yes I plan on it, its just been stressful time at home with a toddler, it slipped my mind	That happens, I guess.  Maybe you can plan something for the next week?"
"I love my husband so much I could never cheat on him.	I love my wife! She's the best"
"Yea, I wouldnt want to hurt him, i cant understand anyone who does.	I am the same way. I wouldn't dream about cheating with anyone. I love the people I'm with too much. I am a cheapskate and a liar but only if they catch on.  I would rather hurt someone else and save myself."
"It can be really tough when your husband and teenagers have electronics.	Oh man, how did it go?"
"I do for family time but sometimes I can sit in a full room and still feel no one is there	I can relate to this. Sometimes when my kids have games they are so engrossed that they forget about me."
"Tomorrow is my husbands Birthday!	I know that one is coming up."
"Yes, we are going out for a nice dinner. We haven't been on a date in months!	I wish him luck.  I hope you have a good time."
"I love the holidays, that make think back to being a kid.	I love Christmas too. I always go home for Christmas dinner. What is your family's tradition like?"
"Yea, that would really be great. Or maybe we'd get bored.	Yeah, that's what holidays bring. Memories of being so young and care free."
"There is a big storm going on in my town right now!	Oh I am so scared. What is the weather looking for in the town where you are in the town?"
"I don't, it makes me nervous with the strong winds and rain!	oh no, that sucks, hope it passes quickly and not last night or tomorrow morning"
"My favorite game has an expansion on Monday, I can't wait.	Oh I love that game!  What game?  What expansion pack?  What's in it?"
"World of Warcraft, It's been my favorite for years.	I'm not a big fan. Is that one of the most popular ones?"
"I just got a promotion at my job!	oh wow congratulations, that sounds good,"
"I work in Human Resources for a big company, I wasn't expecting the promotion! Feel Blessed :)	That's great news! Congratulations!"
"I really like every shelf in my house to be arranged just so.	That is a very specific thing.  What type shelves?"
"I do, everything is in it's place. It thoroughly bothers me when someone puts random stuff on them, like cups or papers.	It's a little thing, but it's just annoying to me. I wish people were more mindful."
"I just found out my husband is cheating on me..	That's terrible. How long have they cheating been going?"
"A few months, I'm not sure what my next move is. Staying in a hotel for a few days to think.	That sucks.  I hope you are able to work things out."
"My daughter is finally fully potty trained!	I'm glad to hear that. What kind was she potty training?"
"Yes, I am very happy as well! No more buying diapers haha	that's a great day"
"So, my new puppy is adorable though maybe not as amazing yet as yours.	that's the idea."
"She's so cute and fun, i love her already.	That's great! What breed?"
"I started doing more research on salaries for the degree I'll have in 6 months.	That sounds interesting! Do you know what degree you're going for yet?"
"It seems to be about 60,000 per year just out of college. I am eager to see if the statistics are correct.	That is good that you are doing research."
"I know it's silly, but my friend got something I wanted in a game the other day, bit sad.	oh man, i feel bad now."
"I guess, little things at times right?	That happened with me a while back. I feel bad. I was thinking about what I could get for him and realized, no I don't need to get him.  I was thinking he had a gift in mind. I just donated. It was a gift card to a coffee shop and I know how much coffee he drinks. I figured it was better than nothing!"
"I watched The Lion King today with my daughter, reminded me of my childhood.	I love that movie too. It reminds of my childhood as well."
"Yes! I'm excited for that as well. I watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!	Oh wow! That was your first time watching? I loved The Lion King movie, I've watched it at the park"
"5	I have never been a fan. I find it so boring. I wish people had more interesting things to talk about."
"Opps. Ok, i mean that I was sad the other day because a friend is moving.	I know what you mean. Sometimes friends move away."
"not to far, but it's still sad to see her go.	Oh yeah, I know how you feel.  I was feeling the same.  I wish she the best though.  I know how you feel about her.  It is hard to let go.  I hope you can find happiness.  I know it is hard."
"I have been having a rough week!	I know the struggles. How is going right?"
"Yes but I am afraid I might loose my job..	That's terrible. How did it start?"
"I hate how our country is right now.	That can be frustrating.  How is that going?"
"People just can't seem to get along, makes me sad.	I agree.  It is hard to see."
"I spent all weekend alone, wish my family lived closer.	Oh no! That must have felt lonely! How did you keep yourself entertained?  Did you have friends over to play?"
"My family is over 2,000 miles away in Alaska, its tough!	That's a long way away. I live right on my doorstep so I'm used it"
"My husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache	That's so gross! Did he see what happened?"
"Not yet, but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.	oh no thats no good"
"Ah, it's been rough. My dog passed away two nights ago.	Oh no. I'm so sorry. My dog passed last month. I know it's hard but I thought about the same."
"Thank you, she was 12 years old so I knew it was coming but still shook up about it.	Yeah that is tough. I lost a pet of my own two years ago."
"I hate when it storms so bad the power goes out	That can be annoying, I live near the mountains so it's a lot worse there."
"I agree.	I do too! I hate it too."
"I found a hundred dollar bill when cleaning my closet!	That is an awesome find!  I love when that kind of luck strikes out of the blue.  Did the person come by and thank you in particular for finding the bill?"
"No! I'm not sure where it came from! and I live alone :O	That's awesome.  I have never seen a dollar before I was 5. I had never found one either.  I bet you're happy."
"There was a huge spider on my wall, it ran away before I could kill it..	That's gross. I would have killed it if it was on my wall"
"Me too, I think it was a wolf spider. I hope I can sleep tonight	I think it's probably a wolf spider, but they do have a pretty long lifespan so I think it's possible that it ran out before I could get to kill it"
"I'm so nervous, have a final exam on Tuesday!	That's nerve wringing me! What subject?"
"Yes, I have been studying a lot but still worried. I need to get a good grade!	that's awesome"
"I have to give a speech on Thursday.	Oh, I'm sure it's not too scary."
"Yes. But mentally I am never ready to give a speech if im being honest.	I am sure you'll do well."
"It's on local politics. Not a fun subject either!	I sold some stuff I didnt need last week.	That is a bummer. Did you sell it for something in good price or something?"
"Yea, enought to have great weekened anyway.	I bet you had a great weekend anyway!"
"I think that my husband and me have so much faith in each other.	That sounds nice, I don't really understand faith, I just have trust that things happen. I have a lot of faith in my husband too."
"I know, I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.	I agree, but I think that's just not possible for a couple of long-term relationships like ours. I mean, I'm happy with him."
"Ten years ago now, a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate. I didn't know if there would be anything to come back to.	That's crazy! Did you guys have any damage?"
"Pretty messed up, but the house was still standing.	Oh that sounds scary.  Did you guys have any insurance?"
"was travelling 14 hours internationally. First flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative	That's terrible. Did you get to where you were going?"
"British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting, they could not	That sucks. I once had a similar experience with a airline and they were rude too.  Did they try to offer a refund or anything like?"
"I've felt excited when I found out I had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course, taught by someone who I knew could help me in ways that I would I not be able to through self-study alone.	I love writing, what kind of work do you plan on writing?"
"Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special!	I can imagine how that would be a surprise. I am glad for the bond and the learning experience though."
"I think it was :)	I like going fishing, it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I do, I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?	that's awesome! what kind of fish you catch?"
"I dropped all my food in the cafeteria the other day. Everybody was staring at me.	I would feel like yelling"
"No, it was at work.	That's a bummer.  I dropped my lunch the other time.  People always staring at me."
"I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it!	That's great that someone showed up to your rescue!"
"Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!	That's great news about being grateful, but you did have to deal with feeling a little embarrassed."
"I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!	That sounds like fun! What teams will be playing in the Superbowl this year?"
"Auburn Tigers	That sounds exciting. I'm a huge fan myself!"
"I did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday.	oh thats no fun. did it happen recently or recently this past weekend"
"I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.	That's a pretty gross thing to have done at the grocery store."
"I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.	That was nice of him."
"Oh yeah, definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!	That's great news! Congrats!"
"I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!	That's so generous of him. I would do that for him if I was in a situation like that.  Did he get the DJ equipment he was trying to? He should be rewarded with some kind words. I was in a rush the other night I was in London and missed my flight, I ended up walking all the way from Heath to the airport I ended up at a small shop in London. It was  a long way from home, and a lot more trouble walking all the"
"It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.	I'm glad you were okay!"
"I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.	That's a little rude of them. Did they not have enough to worry about?"
"Yes, I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!	Oh my goodness, that's terrible.  I hope you feel better.  I hope you got to go to the hospital if you were hurt."
"My transmission in my car went out the other day, maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.	That would be terrible. Are you driving a car that you own?"
"Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too, so my money is tied up.	Oh, okay, well, maybe just save up a little bit longer then.  I hope your transmission works again soon!"
"I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.	That's awful. Did the person return?"
"No, I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.	I'm sorry, but what happened to your car? Was it broken in any way?"
"Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!	That's so cool. Did you see anything interesting?"
"I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary	That's awesome! I'm happy to have scouts that taught you about camping and trekking too."
"Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech, and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!	That is awesome! I love live concerts! What was your name?"
"I'm sorry if I was unclear, I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).	that is awesome that they were able to do it without any equipment!"
"So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!	that sounds like a good skill to learn"
"Yes, very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.	Oh, that's awesome! What kind is that traditional style bowling? I have never learned to bowl that. I would have loved that game!"
"So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!	oh wow, that's a bumpy road for you and me to walk on"
"We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess	I hate when that. Did you clean up the mess?"
"I am starting a new phase in my life. Completed all debt and off to a new start	That must be exciting! I bet you are excited to be debt-free. What phase are you starting?"
"yes very. but I know that it will be good.	that's good news, you must be happy about that. how old are u?"
"Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress	I'm sure you will do well!"
"I try to be. it can be difficult on some days, but I think I have a good attitude towards most things	Yeah, it can be tough to deal with failure.  It takes guts to admit it though, so it's hard to thank myself.  But you've got the guts to keep moving!"
"I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.	I bet. What are you going for in school?"
"Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.	That is good!"
"My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck	That must be nice for you, but also very expensive to live. What town is this?"
"Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!	That must be frustrating for you, you wish it was your luck as well"
"So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.	Yeah that sounds kinda funny."
"No, but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.	Oh my gosh that's so weird that happened."
"My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.	I hate being mad, but at least it's for his first car."
"No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!	that sucks!"
"I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!	That's awesome! How long have you been with it?"
"I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.	It's great to hear that. I have been looking at buying one of my friends cars."
"I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.	that was a nice trip back"
"It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado, 2pac, etc.	I love listening to throw back music, it always takes me right to where I was in my youth"
"My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.	oh wow. thats so sad."
"They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.	Well that's awful!  I hope they get some good news by tomorrow!  I hope you and your grandson are okay!  I am sorry for your loss!"
"I am so excited - after a year of misery due to my loud, inconsiderate upstairs neighbors I'm finally moving into a new apartment!	That's good news! What apartment are you moving into? I've had that apartment problem myself for a long time."
"I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!	That sounds wonderful!"
"Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)	I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!	oh that would be so unkind of me"
"It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.	that's the worst"
"We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone, especially my brother and sister.	Yeah, family reunions are so nice."
"It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.	It's great that they have a chance to catch up."
"I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.	That's great! Congrats!"
"Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it, but consistency does seem to pay off.	That's awesome, you should be super proud of yourself!"
"I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.	I do the same. I feel like the more exercise you do the healthier your mind will become."
"I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though, I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future	that's good to see you working on your health.  how much weight you lifting?"
"My brother got a custom-made bowling ball, and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.	That's really cool. Did he buy it himself or get it from someone else?"
"He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.	I bet you are a proud sibling"
"Ok, so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!	Oh my, did anything good come of that decision?"
"Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)	Oh my, that's awful, but good for you that you took care of yourself and didn't have anyone bothering you while they were being rude and disturbing!"
"Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.	That's terrible, but it's been going on for over a year, so it's not like it's something new that you can't fix.  Maybe you can try talking it over with them and see if they're willing to talk about why they're not talking anymore?"
"Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.	That would be pretty awesome if classical could shut people up"
"I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.	Oh wow! I hope everything turned out okay."
"No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.	That sounds scary. Did you find out what the noise was?"
"I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!	That's so exciting! What country are they in?"
"I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him	That's cool! I hope you have a blast!"
"I can't help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time.	I love that time of year too! What do people do?"
"I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.	You're welcome, I'm sure it's okay."
"The last time I went into a job interview, I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.	That's awesome! How long have been you looking to work there?"
"Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.	Yeah, sometimes you need to go back out and try again."
"Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!	That's so scary! Did you run inside?  Did it attack?"
"I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!	I can imagine! I hope everything turned out alright in the end."
"It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my ""attacker"" off with!	I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself	oh wow that is good! what kind sweets do you eat?"
"I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese	I stress too much on my work. I think you should try it. It might work out."
"My co-worker just bought a brand new car.	That's pretty cool. Did you buy a new car?"
"I know, me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.	That's awesome. I've been driving for over 20 years.  I don't even know what my mileage is anymore, but my car has 150,000 miles on the odometer."
"i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i'm so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are	that's kinda scary. I don't like Craigslist."
"I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone	That sucks.  What are your phones worth?"
"I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!	Oh man! That sounds like a great move!"
"Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!	That's awesome that your new apartment will be quieter!"
"They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.	Someone stole my identity.	Oh wow! That is very unfortunate. Did you ever realize who it was until too late?"
"I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.	Oh that's terrible. Have you contacted your bank or credit union yet?"
"i have food on my table, a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful	That's amazing. I'm so thankful too. I feel like I can do a lot more when I'm not living on ramen. I've got my life. I've got my health, I'm not worried. I don't know anyone who is struggling with poverty, homelessness, or addiction."
"yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted	I agree with you there, people are lucky to take the things for which they should, and to take them for granted, which makes them think they are entitled to them. I think that people should appreciate the things they have and be thankful for. I am glad you appreciate your things, it makes me appreciate them more."
"so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets	I love making things, it's such a great way to express yourself.  What did the blankets make you think of?"
"thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies	That sounds great. I love making things for friends and babies. It's such thoughtful gifts!"
"I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!	that sounds like a fun trip!"
"Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.	I'm so jealous that you got to be together again after that long separation."
"Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!	When I spend time with my family, it reminds me how lucky I really am.	That sounds so important."
"Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.	I agree with you.  My family has been very good to me.  I am very lucky to have them.  I think everyone needs to remember the value that family and friends bring us in our lives"
"My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much	That's so sweet! How old is your dog?"
"She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?	I do have a dog, I have 2 cats too. I have been thinking of another golden retrieever. Maybe I will. They are so cute.  I have never had a dog."
"School starts a week from tomorrow and I am getting fairly nervous for it!	That's exciting! What school? Are you nervous about your performance?"
"Oh yes, I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?	I know the feeling. You can't wait to go back to school. I am going back to work full time this year.  It's been a few months."
"I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it	That is a good point.  I think we can all be judgmental to some extent, but not in a bad way, just to be aware of our own actions and to try not hurt others."
"yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad	It is normal to judge others. Everyone is unique and special. I judge people based on what they have to say and do, not based on how they make people think about them or themselves"
"I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.	Oh wow! That's awesome! What subject are you studying?"
"I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.	That's good news! What part time job? I hope you get to relax a lot."
"My brother just turned 16 and he's about to get his first car! I'm so excited for him.	That's a pretty big milestone.  What kind is he thinking of getting?"
"Probably some kind of SUV, maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!	That's awesome. I have an older car that I'm pretty proud of."
"I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!	That sounds exciting! What kind are you looking for?"
"I want an SUV, like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!	It's nice to be able save for the things you really really really really need"
"Recently my husband and I were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off	That's not very nice."
"I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary	That must have scared you to death!  What did they do?"
"My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.	That's great! What is it for them to celebrate?"
"She will be 30. It makes me feel so old, but also how fun it was when they were little.	I feel you, but I am happy. My youngest is 28 now and is all done. I wish her the best birthday ever though."
"I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I	That sounds like you had some tough days lately?"
"Sorry, I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!	That's good. What kind workout are you doing?"
"I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.	That's great! What was it like to go for grocery shopping?"
"Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!	aliens"
"They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.	It's really interesting how you describe things. You sound like a science teacher. What are you studying?"
"What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!	It's really interesting to learn about all of these things, it makes food taste different."
"I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!	That sounds scary! Was he yelling? I hope he wasn't trying to kid you! I hate when that kind of situation happens!"
"Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!	Oh no! What did you do? Did you get upset with him?"
"My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.	That is awesome! Did you ask him where did you go?"
"Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.	That was gross.  You should get stitches.  You should get stitches right away!"
"When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.	I agree, he was a true original thinker and a very unique individual. I am so sorry he did not get the closure he deserved."
"It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!	I know that he was a bit of a narcissist, but I still think he was a bit of a pain sometimes. I hope more people can see the importance in taking his pain seriously and work on their own mental health."
"Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.	That is so sad that there are not more resources to support this country's mental health."
"There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.	I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away	That's sad, what state or city are they in your grandparents' area?"
"Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!	That sounds great! I have never met my grandmother, so it's nice you got that chance!"
"I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!	That is so cool!"
"Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!	You are kidding right.  I am so jealous.  What was your name?"
"I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.	I'm not sure what kind teacher kids have in 1st and they have in 2nd.  What is the difference?"
"That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.	it makes sense, I guess"
"That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.	When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.	I thought that was so good of a friend."
"It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!	That's a good idea. I never really had to think that about myself."
"I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.	i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please	That's so cool.  What did he learn?"
"he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian	That's a pretty impressive achievement!  How old is he?"
"A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.	Oh, that is terrible. How did you cope with all the noise?"
"Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.	Oh my goodness, how did it go away for you for the week you mentioned?  Was it too loud or did they just go to sleep early? I hope you didn't have any issues."
"No, moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband, but we split up.	I found a cat in my attic yesterday!	What!?! That sounds creepy! What happened?"
"My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!	That sounds scary. Did they get away?"
"My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.	That's so nice! I'm glad to hear that she's found someone new to love her."
"Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!	that sounds amazing! What community is she involved with?"
"She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!	I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!	That sounds like a great service! What kind of TV shows does Hulu Live offer?"
"I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!	You should check it out! I have been meaning to get it for a long time but I've been waiting for my cable bill to go down first."
"My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident, I'm so upset.	That must've been really scary. Did the animal survive or did it die from the accident?"
"Yes, we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.	That's terrible. I hope it wasn't someone. I hope the cat is okay."
"I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.	Oh no! That is horrible. I am sorry to hear that."
"Yes, I heard about it. Such a sad story.	I hope everyone is safe and sound.  I hope everyone is okay.  I am so scared of fire and death and destruction."
"My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..	That sounds like a lot of fun!"
"I did! It was a very nice gesture.	That was awesome! I'm so glad they remembered you. I forgot about you too."
"We are waiting on military orders right now, I'm so hoping they come through next week.	That sounds exciting! What are you waiting on?"
"Yes, we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.	That's great, where do you live?"
"I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.	I know right, it really is a big deal."
"Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.	It is really hard to understand that some humans do not understand the animals. I know a dog owner who was very mean to the dog and the dog ended up biting a little puppy that had been left on the owner."
"For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.	I love Christmas, it's my favorite time. What's your favorite time?"
"It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!	I can relate to that. I still think about my childhood and feel a little nostalgic for it."
"It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in!	Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.	I donot have anyone who eats out every week."
"Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries.	I don't spend much but when I do eat out, I like it so much! I think they should just eat at home all the time. That way you'll be saving money and eating healthier."
"We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.	That's good news! What city or country? I've always liked moving."
"Texas, there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change.	that's great news. what are you moving for?  are you moving to the south or north of the big lake. i'm from texas and moved a few years back. i've been enjoying the heat but it does get a lot of rain. it's not as dry though."
"Awesome, my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.	I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.	Oh wow. Did it come in?"
"So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.	that's good news!  I live in hurricane prone countries too.  I'm so glad your safe."
"My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her, one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!	That sounds like a fun reunion! What did they have to say about you?"
"Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!	That's really nice. It's great that family is important to keep in life"
"Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.	My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards	Oh that's terrible! What kind was it?"
"She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess	That sucks, but at least she is small and they should know what to expect"
"Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us	That must be very sad. I hope you were able to be supportive of her."
"Yes, it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult, so it was really hard when she passed.	That must have been so sad.  How did she pass?"
"We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.	That's so cool. I have a big family reunion this year and we're all going on the road in a 1978 van with a full kitchen, fridge, and 2 bathrooms!"
"I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.	I am glad to hear!"
"I've been so busy packing, packing and more packing.	I know how you feel"
"Yes, don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.	That's terrible. Are you moving to a new place?"
"I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.	that sounds great, I've been married 30 years and still feel like a kid! I'm glad to be with someone like that. What made it easy?"
"I do feel very lucky, especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.	That's awesome. I'm 25 years old and married for about 20 years and have been divorced twice already. I don't have any children. I just moved back home to my parents and I feel very comfortable. I have never been divorced before either."
"I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.	That's cool! Which station? I'm sure they were playing your local music."
"Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back	that's awesome! I don't listen music either but I have heard of all of them."
"I took a test for college the other day, it was basically our midterm.	Oh, did you pass it?"
"I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.	Yeah, the wait is killing you too right now, but at the end of the day, you studied and did your best you could."
"Discrete mathematics	I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago. I know a guy who was playing in it. Guess what? He won! Fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!	It is good you are a fan. I like golf, especially Scottish golf."
"He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to, lol!	I bet he was thrilled to win!  I would be."
"You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!	I love watching sports too!"
"Thank you - he'd appreciate it. It makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved.	I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.	I do that every time I teach a group."
"There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.	that's great that you are interested in teaching people how to do that."
"There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!	Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life	That is so annoying!"
"Exactly!  I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is ""Always be prepared""	I like routine too."
"You know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? That happened to me recently - the owners rented it out the night before I was to see it :(	I have done this before and have had the owners beat me out of luck."
"Yes, but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!	That's terrible, but I would hope you could find something else. I hope you found another place that fit the bill"
"I'm sure I will so long as I have good neighbors. I'm over the first place now, but it wasn't pleasant to be pipped at the post!	my horse died last week i was devastated when i found out	I'm sorry. That's really tough. Did you find out what happened to him?"
"yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad	Oh, that must have hurt.  I am so sorry.  I am sure it was a hard day for you.  I have never heard of cancer in horses.  I am glad the vet told it to your doctor.  I hope they do the best they can for him."
"i am always outside my house beafore my friend gets here	I bet, that's why I would leave early."
"i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives	Oh no! What are you worried about? Is it the house catching a bug or something else?"
"i was really happy the day i finished my doctorate	That's a big accomplishment. Congratulations! What was it in?"
"yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end	That's awesome! What did you do after finishing your doctorate?  Are you happy with your career?"

"My wife is coming back into the country after being away for 2 months.  I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P	That's awesome!  How are they?  Did everything go smoothly?  Did they miss you?"
"Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad, but it's nice to come home to a clean house.	That's so true, I've been away for 2 months myself and I'm doing some cleaning myself before I come back home"
"i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public	It happens to the best of people, but it does not make it any worse. You should just go to a hairdresser to fix it up."
"yeah it is the worst, i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing	That's terrible, did it work for you?"
"I had a bad experience out to eat the other day.  I don't do it too often, so it was a bummer.	That is terrible. Did you get your food back?"
"The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.	Yeah, I've been to that one restaurant before and had the same issues. It's a bit of the same old thing."
"I was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn't watching where I was going and knocked over an entire display.	oh no! That's terrible!"
"It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it. My face was bright red.	oh, i hate grocery shopping.  it's like they always seem to have stuff out.  what happened to you?"

"Definitely :)  It's been a long and lonely summer :)	That's terrible. Did you guys plan ahead of time? Did she have a plan for when she comes back?"
"I recently moved from California to North Carolina and suddenly realized I knew absolutely nobody. It was a horrible feeling.	Oh that's terrible! Have you moved to the city where you live or just a new town?"
"My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway, a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly, huh?!	That's funny! You must have felt lonely at first. Did it get easier as you settled in and made friends with people?"
"The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.	I'm so glad you were able to stay with your friend, and that's all you can really ask, I know mine had to leave for a short time."
"The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?	I live in San Francisco, I've always loved the city."
"A while ago I drove from Florida to Northern California. It's a long trip, but I knew I could do it just fine.	I've done the California coast highway from San Yesternberg to the coast of the Oregon. It's a long way."
"It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East, so kind of knew what I was doing.	That sounds like fun! Did it rain a few times along?"
"Oh no - I'm not a race car driver, lol. And anyway, it's kind of fun seeing different parts of the country, so rushing would (to me) be a waste.	My wife was really sick the other day, she was stuck in bed for most of the day.	I'm so sorry to hear that."
"Not completely sure, maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now, though her appetite took a bit to come back.	I hope she recovers."
"summer was so boring for me, im really happy school is starting again	I know right? It is the only time of year where you have a lot to do, like plan your day and night in"
"not really, i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did	I am the opposite. I hate school. It's boring, long, and hard work. I'd love to stay home."
"My mom is having weight loss surgery next week, I'm nervous.	That must have made you nervous about it?"
"She is having gastric bypass surgery, I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!	That must be nerve wracking for you too"
"there is nothing i hate more than losing in something	That's the worst. What kind?"
"not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me	I hate losing more than I hate winning.  How do you stay positive?"
"It has been a wonderful Monday!	It's been a good week for me."
"I found out a got a pay raise at my job, we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in November!	That's a great way to look forward to Christmas time. I love to look forward for it too!"
"I read in the news about a family who lost all six of their animals in a house fire :(	That is terrible.  I hope they were okay.  I love animals."
"I know, it made me upset! My two dogs are my babies couldn't imagine loosing them.	Oh, I know, I would have lost them all. I hope they get them!"
"my dog is over at the vet for 4 days and makes the house feel so alone'	That's terrible! What a dog! Did you get him?"
"yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back	That's a long wait. Did you ask the vet if you could bring your dog home?"
"My wife went out of the country for a couple months at the beginning of the summer, dropping her off at the airport was really tough.	oh thats really tough."
"Not for more than a few days.  It's been a rough couple months, but it's almost over!	I'm glad it is over for you.  How are things now?"
"When my wife and I had to move for her to go to school, we had a lot of trouble finding a place to live until my parents were nice enough to cosign on a loan.	That sounds very tough.  What school was your kids in?"
"We are.  They've helped a lot during my life, but this might have been the biggest one.	Oh wow! That's quite generous of your family."
"i cant wait to visit my family back home they are so far away i dont get to see them a lo	I feel you! I miss my family so much."
"in a couple of weeks i am really happy to see them it has been 5 years	I do not get to visit either."
"i cant get near spiders, even if i see them in pictures they freak me out	Oh yeah. I don't know why people can't handle a little spider."
"not really i was just born afraid of them hahah	Yeah, they're creepy. I hate when you see pictures of them."
"A few years ago, before we got married, my wife planned a party for me for my birthday completely without me knowing.	That's sweet. What did you do?"
"It really was!  I walked into my apartment to like 15 more people than I expected.	that is cool. What happened?"
"i hate when my little brother throws food on the table just to annoy m e	That's a little brother for you!  Did he throw food on your mother as well?"
"he is like 11 but he does it when my parents are not home it is really anoying	That's kind of him. He likes to throw stuff on the floor. He's a little troublemaker"
"I was stopped at a traffic light when a woman in a truck scraped slowly along the side of my car.	That was so mean. Did she hit your car?"
"Yeah, we both stopped and pulled over.  I think she was high or something, she was really off.	That is crazy.  I would have stopped and talked to her.  She would probably apologize.  I hope she is okay."
"i found a little ball of hair when i was eating at a fancy restaurant	That sounds gross. What did you do?"
"yeah i did, they gave us a refund and we did not come back to that place again	Oh wow that's pretty disgusting. Did you tell anyone about it?"
"I had made plans for dinner and had set everything out and I found out my husband ate all the bread!	That's a bummer."
"It wasn't even garlic bread! It was generic bread to dip in soup!	That stinks of betrayal."
"i feels surprised	What happened? Did something surprise you?"
"my boy friend gives me a birthday gift surprisingly	I feel surprised my boyfriend give you a birthday gift surprisingly.  How sweet. Did he know you needed one?"
"My neighbor used to have an old beagle - a lovely pooch. He died of cancer just before Thanksgiving. I looked for him for weeks - I miss him.	It's sad when we lose our pets.  I have a dog and she is so sweet."
"Yeah. I used to see him when I was out on my porch and he'd come out for a sniff around or a tinkle. He was so sweet and gentle.	That's really sad. I'm sorry. I hope they had a nice rest. Did he have any good days? Did he have any good walks? I used to have a dog too. He was really sweet and gentle too."
"They sure are. I actually prefer them to some humans I know! Do you have a dog at the moment?	That is true!  I have a few.  But they are so nice and calm."
"That's wonderful, that you were able to take her in. Good for you! More people should act like that.	I actually prefer them too. I have a dog named Luna and she's really good at taking care of her own things."
"I'm not a very good cook but sometimes my husband scares me with it!	I know right! I'm always a bit hesitant about cooking for myself."
"He was putting chocolate right into the chilli the other night!	I bet that was gross. Did you guys end it there?"
"My son came home today and was working on his homework.	That must have made it a really good day. Did he do it by himself?"

"I've been training hard for a marathon next week, and I am beating my record time!	Oh nice! Congratulations!"
"For a few months now, but I've been training pretty hard just these past few months.	oh wow, congrula on that"
"I'm very socially awkward and tomorrow i'm going to have a playdate with some local moms and i'm so anxious	I used to playdates my kid and now play with my wife's kid. It gets better. I playdate my friend kids and then playdate my wife's."
"that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice.	That is so kind of your friends."
"I recently went to ruby falls, an underground cavern with a waterfall.	oh that was cool"
"Not that particular one, no. I had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down 23 stories.	That was a scary ride though.  How did you feel when it finally stopped?  Did you feel like you were safe?"
"Overall it was a good time, but i was nervous being that far underground, i need to learn to relax and enjoy things.	I had some hesitations when I was at the gym today, thought I wouldn't be able to handle the weights	Yeah, it's normal to have some self doubt when trying something for the first time, especially if you're not as strong as you think you should be"
"I decided to focus on the music that was blasting, just tried switching up what I play in the gym, it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle	that's cool. did you feel okay afterwards?"
"Have you ever been in a car crash before?	oh yes, i was in one last week"
"I got T-boned once, I'll never forget spinning around in that car, hearing the tires squalling. It was really scary.	Yeah I have. I was in high school and we were on the way to the prom.  I'm not sure what happened, but the car was hit by a van. It was a huge crash. We all were pretty lucky. I was fine, but I heard the engine was blown out of the van and the car was completely wrecked."
"My wife has been really sad here recently, I've had to hold her while she cries herself to sleep at night.	Oh. Sorry to hear that. What did she cry over?  Is she okay?"
"Shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer. We've been to 4 funerals, and the most recent one was really hard on her.	Oh my. How are she and your family doing now? Are you guys able to talk to her about what's going on?"
"My bank, which I've had a savings account with for over 10 years has been deducting $15/month from me for ""inactivity"". How about that?	That's horrible. I would call the police. They should have your number and send the police to your bank to shut off their activity."
"Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.	That's awful! You should call them up and express your feelings.  They probably won you nothing but a nice apology phone call.  I hope they understand that.  How about you just get back on track? You've been here for 10 years, you can get back on track!"
"Yes. They said that they'd been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money. What rubbish. It just amazes me!	Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.	I have heard of it happening before. It's really sad."
"Yes, my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.	I'm so sorry to hear. I hope he is at peace."
"Have you ever had a new puppy?	That is the most exciting thing I've ever heard."
"Yeah, he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside, but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!	That's a good dog though. I bet it keeps his bladder from going to the bathroom in the middle of the night."
"I store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid. I was storing my last piece in there	that sounds good"
"Last night I wasn't in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone!	That's terrible! Did you have chocolate?  I have been known for being the chocolate thief. I love chocolate. What kind did you store it with to keep it solid?"
"I ran into my neighbor's mailbox with my car but didn't stop and leave a note.	That would've been nice of him. Did you tell them about the mailbox?"
"I agree, I felt so bad about it. When I saw him replacing it, I went out and confessed.	That sounds like such bad manners. What were they going for it for?"
"i'm so stressed. we are struggling financially and i don't even know how are we going to pay rent this month	its normal. you can talk to your employer and ask if you can work from home."
"thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it's expensive	That's a lot to deal, what are your options?"
"My mom made a pretty awesome scrapbook and gave it to me for christmas several years ago. I recently dug it out and went through it.	That's so cool! What kind is it?"
"Photos from my whole life growing up, with sections about my relationships with each sibling. pretty awesome.	That's nice. I've made scrapbook for my kids. I'm hoping they like them."
"I once was taking a big trip I had been looking forward to and the day before we leave for an international flight a high level travel advisory was issued for the area we were going.	I am so upset. What a horrible time."

"Yeah. Glad we didnt bail.	That sounds great. What did happen?"
"No. Best I can remember it didnt even rain.	I hate it when plans fall through. I really wanted to spend my time on the water this last weekend.	Oh no. That can make me so grumpy"
"I was going to Florida to go on a multi-day canoeing and camping trip. At the last minute, the two people I was going with backed out, and I simply couldn't afford to go alone.	I'm sorry to hear! That's frustrating when plans fall apart like this"
"My grandpa always said he was a rockstar back in his day, but I never believed him.	I bet he was! What kind rockstar was?"
"I don't know if he was famous, but the other day, he got on stage, bit the head off of a bat, then belted the words to Crazy Train. It was unbelievable!	Oh that is cool! I can see him being the rockstar of rock!"
"I used to do flooring work, we had to deal with some pretty strange situations sometimes.	I can imagine, what kind was that?  Were you doing it yourself or was it for hire?"
"well, one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him. was revolting.	That sounds pretty gross. I hate to think someone had to deal that."
"It really bothers me that my son sticks his dirty socks in the toy box	I can understand. It can make me feel like I am a dirty person too!"
"I guess so haha but no matter what I try to keep him from doing it, it still happens	I can understand it is hard to keep clean."
"I recently had my hip-length hair cut for the first time in years.	That's cool! How do you feel now?"
"It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut, but it looks much thicker and healthier now.	I've been wanting to cut it myself. What kind is it?"
"I went around work all day today with a hole in my pants, right on my bottom.	That's a bumpy day. Did you fix the hole?"
"Yep! No one told me. :( I have no idea how many people noticed or saw it.	That's awful! Did anyone laugh or tease you about it?"
"I paid $1000 for one of those mystery boxes on eBay. It said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items.	It was really fun to buy it, I'm a little bummed that it wasn't what I got. I would have been the envy of my friends.  I got the Lego Star Wars Death Star Death Star.  That's what it said on it.  It said ""Lego Death Stars"".  I think that was a joke, so I just got the Lego Star War Death Stars.  It says it on the packaging.  It said ""Lego Star Wars Death Stars"
"I would've happily taken that! Instead, it was filled with literal garbage, like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.	You are so right."
"I had my final exam for Chemistry today!	It can't get any bigger than this exam! I bet you studied hard for that!"
"I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.	I bet you did! You must be so proud!"
"It can be rough when I have a problem and need to vent to someone	You mean like when you have a problem?"
"You are sweet because part of the problem is when I realize there really is no one to talk to. Thank you	I feel you, I used to talk to my friends family, but I am going to talk to my parents"
"I've been training a new girl at work this week!	It sounds like you are doing well with her."

"I was just at the casino, spent almost 100 dollars on a single machine. I didn't will anything.	That is crazy.  What kind machine did it play out to?"
"Haha, yeah I got a little sauced. The worst part though was as soon as I got up, someone sat down and  rolled triple 7s.	Oh, that is hilarious. I would be laughing at that if I were in that position. I would also be very upset that I had not won any money."
"I used to get supremely scared when I wanted to go up stairs when the lights were off	I'm sure it was quite scary."
"Yeah, so I would book it up the stairs as fast as possible	Yeah, that was my worst fear"
"I just got matched up with someone online. It will be my first date in a while.	That is exciting! Where are they meeting at?"
"Yeah, I'm really hoping to make a good impression. Other wise that would feel pretty bad.	Oh man, that's scary. What are the chances?"
"Tomorrow is the big day, I have to deliver my proposal to the client.	I bet that's exciting! What kind of proposal is it?"

"I love him, too, a lot. But I don't know why he just stands in the hallway and meows nonstop, even when he's been fed.	That sounds like my cat, too...she wakes me every morning too. I think I'm going crazy."
"Ashe. He's cute :)	I'm finally almost done with my associate's degree! I technically started wayyyy back in 2011, but I just got serious in 2016.	That's great. What are you studying?"

"When I was a teenager, I called in to the restaurant and told them I had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away. Wouldn't you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!	Oh no! That sounds horrible! I've always loved the old days and I can imagine you would be upset. I've had those kinds of hoolies happen in my workplace, and sometimes in my home too. It's hard to see. But at the end of the day we have to deal it."
"Sometimes I enjoy being alone, but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home.	That is nice. I like going to a hotel room sometimes, just alone, to get some time for myself."
"This was a while back, but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally, he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.	I know the feeling!  How did that make you?"
"I have a beautiful girl friend. But I met someone else.	That can happen."
"I'm trying to figure out how to kick her out of my place.	That can be tough. Did you think about what to tell your girl friend first, or just go talk to the girl friend first?"

"I can't even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days.	That's not a bad idea! What's it about again?"

"Yeah it is. I thought I was about to die lol	That is crazy! What did happen next?"
"My cashier gave me extra change back and I didn't say anything.	Oh, really! What kind change was it?"
"Because I had also stolen some candy and wanted to get out as soon as possible.	that sucks.  Did you tell them that?"
"A man came to my door with a gun, asking for money.	I am shocked! What was he going to use it for?"
"I did not know him. He took some items from the house as I didn't have any money on me	That's horrible, how did he take items?"
"I like finding little resources or tips that change old habits I've been coping with in what seems like ""1 easy step""	That sounds good. What habits are you working with?"
"Exactly, I started taping my mouth closed at night, finally woke up before noon, mission accomplished	Yeah, that was a good one. What habit have you changed?  I changed my eating habits."

"Yeah, it	Yeah, it"
"I use band aid tape cuz it's okay on the skin	Sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time. Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.	That sounds like fun.  What kind of things do you do when you're at the park?"
"It was, but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived, there was a festival with games, performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!	Oh man that is awesome. Did you guys go to the festival to get some food?"
"I was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud, and I had a hard time focusing	oh, I understand."

"I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!	That's a pretty harsh way to look at people."
"That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card, and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!	Yeah, they should be more responsible with the tellers and not letting the teller do that stuff!"
"I went to a bar I used to go to in college, and I was surprised to see an arcade machine I built with a dear friend of mine!	Oh that's a good memory! Did you and she play games?  I've seen those before."
"Yes, playing the machine we built together reminded me of all the good times we used to have.	That's cool! What kind of games do they have at that place now?"

"I can't believe I am telling you this, but I actually camped out to buy tickets for the new star wars movie.	that's a long shot"

"My girlfriend and I were going to a big parade with some friends. As we were leaving, she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.	That's awful! Was she okay?"
"Unfortunately, it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead, I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.	That sucks.  I hope she recovers well."
"My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking, but ultimately underwhelming thing	oh wow, how old was she? I love cats"

"I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift	That's great! What weight were we lifting for the exercise of the week challenge?"
"No not really, just seeing how much energy I could summon from within	That's great you had fun, it's good to test your limits sometimes"
"There's too many things to think about	That sounds stressful! What are some things to think about that are bothering you?"

"I named her Layla.	That sounds like a fun time. What breed?"
"I recently went to a Steely Dan concert with my lady.	That's really cool! What kind concert are you referring to."
"Yeah, it was awesome reminiscing about those times when we used to get in trouble back in the day... times were so much simpler then.	That's awesome! I hope they played some of their old stuff!"
"I just got a new puppy, names fido.	oh no. how is he going?"
"It is a german shepherd. It takes a lot of work caring for it, definitely needs a lot of attention	that sounds interesting"
"On my way to work, a goose stole the toupee I needed to impress the new secretary, Christy.	Oh, wow. What happened? Did she notice it?"
"No! I am so furious with that goose, that I could wring his neck! I can't get any ladiez with this chrome dome of mine.	It was probably a goose."
"I was doing the dishes and a huge roach crawled out from underneath the dishwasher.	Oh no!  I've never seen a roach crawl out of the dishwasher before, that's quite an unusual thing to do.  What did it look and sound like?"
"I almost fell over trying to crush it, i forgot I wasn't wearing shoes and stepped on in with my bare feet.	I hope you crushed that roach!"
"I was walking down the street at night, I felt like I was surrounded by something unseen.	That would freak you out! Did something happen?"
"Every time I turned around to try and catch something there was nothng there. Just the feeling of something watching me....	That is terrifying! What was happening?"
"I had a job interview that I didn't really feel prepared for.	Oh, what happened? Did you feel nervous?"
"I did not get it unfortunately.	That's tough. What happened? Wasn't it for the reason you thought?"
"One time, I smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car.	That's gross. What happened? Was it your air conditioning?"
"Well, when I went to lift the engine cover, I noticed a dead, rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.	That is disgusting. I bet you were upset. Did you report it to the authorities?"
"I went to the store, just trying to get some milk and bread, and I got rear ended by a driver.	that's terrible. Did you get hurt?"
"Yeah, it was more of a shock than anything, was not expecting someone to hit you when you are just crossing the street.	That is unfortunate, I've had that happen to me before. I hope the driver gets the help of insurance and a tow. Hopefully no damage to your vehicle. Hopefully no damage to the vehicle of the other. I hate when this happens to other drivers."
"I have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech.	I love your enthusiasm for speechwriting. What's it for you to write a speech for?"
"I can only dream. No it's more on par with Lord of the RIng's final battle.	That was pretty intense. What are you working on with your speech about?  Is it for a job, or something else?  I am curious about it."
"Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.	That would be so unfair of them.  How did you find the experience of itting them out at the store"
"Yeah, I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.	That's nice of the store to do so! I hope you get there soon!"
"I thought I bombed my math test but I got a 103 on it.	That's awesome! You must have studied hard!"
"I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.	Yeah, sometimes we don't even remember the steps."
"I just found a photo book of me and my family growing up.	That must have brought a tear in your eye!"
"It was pretty nostalgic , how young we all looked growing up.	That always brings up memories."
"I finally got to see a baseball game live this last week.	That's pretty cool. What did you see?"
"It was the Rockies, no home-run though, it was pretty high up there I felt like I could see the world.	that's awesome! what stadium was it?"
"When my buddy asked me to help him clean out his grandmother's house who had recently passed, I was not prepared for what we found.	That's terrible. What happened?"
"You hit it right on the money. She was not only a hoarder but a cat lady, and the mix of paper, bugs and cat feces was an affront to the senses.	That is disgusting. I hope they found something good. I hate cleaning. It is always dirt and grunge. I am glad you were there to see it."
"I let my dad borrow my car and he got in a minor accident.	Oh no! Did he hurt himself?"
"Yeah he is fine and my car was not damaged. My insurance premium is probably going to go up though.	That sucks.  I hope it was just a minor accident.  I hate when people don't take care to their responsibility to their vehicle.  I hope your premiums are going to go up.  I don't like to have to pay more for insurance just in case of a minor accident."
"He said he would cover the extra costs so I'm not too upset	When I bought my new car, I couldn't believe how smooth the ride was.	I love driving! What car do you buy? I have one that I just purchased."
"It's a Chevrolet Camaro.	oh, nice car"
"I studied for 7 months to take the GRE exam, it was stressful.	I study for exams too, but I haven't studied in so long that I had forgotten a few important concepts."
"I did, and I was accepted to my number 1 program, which meant that I was going to be paid to learn!	That must have felt great!"
"I have a feeling the really hard work might just be beginning, but I feel exceptionally lucky.	I studied all night for my final exams. I needed to pass them to graduate from college.	That's awesome! Congrats!"
"I did. I was able to sneak in a few hours here and there.	oh man i have been stuck studying all night for finals too many years in school and have a lot of stress and anxiety about passing"
"I left my wallet in a movie theater, and didn't notice till I was half way home!	oh no! What happened next? Did they find your wallet?"
"I was able to get back in and find it, it was pretty well hidden in between the seats. No harm no foul.	I'm sorry that you had to go to the movies to get your money back. I hope you were able to do that without issue though. I'm sorry too that my words caused you to feel that you were in trouble."
"Some people are just so generous. Really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there.	They should just leave and never come back."
"That's incredible if true, but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast!	I totally understand why.  It makes you think that there's still some goodness out there in the world, you know what? There probably are people like that!  I just hope that people keep showing up."
"I was so proud of my daughter over the weekend.	I am so proud for all of you. How did she do? What happened?"
"She performed her first solo dance in competition, but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.	That must have made her very confident.  I've never danced before but I've been taking a class and it sounds like fun."
"It was, very much so, I will cherish it forever.	I'm grateful for the work hours, but bummed that I can't get time off.	Oh yeah, that's the thing I always get to work."
"Well, I've worked without a break for the last 3 years, I just want to get away abit.	It can be hard to find time off, especially when you have a family.  Do you ever consider asking your employer if you could work remotely?"
"Right! I'd like to go lay on a beach, or even just the next town over at this point.	I have been extremely diligent in my studies so far, and am participating in two clubs this upcoming year. The future is looking bright!	That sounds great. What clubs are you in?  Is this college your third time here.  How long will college last?"
"I am an electrical engineering student, and I am interested in quite a few things at this point. I think after this year, I will be able to get a paid internship next summer!	That's great! What two clubs are they?"
"I am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump.	That's the worst. I've never had to haul it."
"The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents, so the dump has a line every day.	That's terrible. Is it going anywhere?"
"We have, and we called a city meeting. I'm just beyond words,it has to be corrected.	's all too common these days. |||| NEW CONVERSATION ||| I recently went to a dinner where we were served something unconventional to say the least.	oh no, i hate when food is a conversation starter. did you find the experience okay though?"
"I should have known better, as these friends are on the ""crunchier side"". They had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!	That does sound disgusting. I can't believe they would serve something with bugs."
"I lost my appetite completely! I will be sure to get takeout before hand if we ever go to another one of their dinners.	my mom is supposed to call me regarding her test results.	That sounds scary. Is it a medical test?"
"She had stage 3 cancer, but she was clear last screening a year ago.	I am so sorry to hear!  That sounds terrifying.  I hope she makes a full recovery.  I've been battling lymphed bone myself for a few years now and am still in remission thanks to treatment and support from my wife and daughter and their son-in law and their two kids.  It really helps."
"Thank you, I have a good feeling about it.	I went to a wedding recently, and something happened that put a damper on it. I felt bad for my buddy, but at least he knows he can trust me.	That's bad. Did something happen to him?  I hope everything worked itself out."
"Yeah, his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up, and let him know what had happened.	Yeah, that's awful."
"I am highly upset that I'm the only one concerned with earning money for our bills	That sucks, I hope someone takes you up on your concerns. Have you been talking about this to anyone else in the house?"
"Not much. It's all on me. It sucks	That's a heavy statement. Are there other family members that help out?"
"I love playing old school video games. The music is amazing	That is a fun way to pass time. I love playing old school games like Super Mario 2.  I used it on the Super Famicom and it is still my favorite game."
"For me it's happy emotions	Yeah, I love them. There's nothing like playing a Mario Kart game for the N64.  I used the game on the original Nintendo console."
"The micro brewery explosion in America has been awesome for my girlfriend and I, as we love craft beer. Until recently, our town didn't have one though.	Yeah, it's a great sign for our future!"
"We actually don't brew our own, and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!	That sounds great! What kind of brews are you hoping for?  Is it a craft beer newbie, or a brew expert looking to try some of the more exotic stuff?"
"I hate it when other guys look at my girl	I can understand why. Is it a problem with them or her?"
"She's for my eyes only. At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!	that sucks! i bet you'd kill him"
"Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read ""Kitchen Confidential"", or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year.	It's really hard to work in the industry when so much is taken. It's hard when everyone seems to be getting older and less passionate. I hope people continue reading his books though. It is good for the soul!"
"He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food, and we all still look up to him.	I was sad when I heard the news, but I think it brought attention to the work people like Anthony Bourhill work. He was a very talented chef and had a passion to help people."
"My husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing.	That's really cool! I'm sure it was a surprise you didn't know about! What did you think when you got the news that your friends had planned?"
"Yes, it was a lot of fun and it caught me off guard. It meant a lot that they did it for me.	That was cool! I'm glad they thought of it for me, but also a little sad because they didn't let me know beforehand."
"I gave twin fawns in our yard some fresh peaches and they loved them.	It sounds like you are taking care of a new pet!"
"I enjoy helping the wildlife in our area. It is alway a good feeling to give a helping hand.	I love helping out the wildlife."
"In a week my wife will finally be back from being out of the country for 2 months!	That's really long time apart, hope you're excited"
"She was taking a language course in Germany for her graduate studies.	I hope you have fun in Germany!"
"I'm moving into another apartment and just told my neighbor I was leaving. He said he was sorry I'm going!	That's so rude! Did you tell your wife?"
"About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.	That's nice. I hope he's happy about it."
"Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!	Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday, so I had to work overtime, but I didn't even get paid for it!	That's terrible. Did you get paid for overtime hours worked?"
"I'm technically salaried, so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating.	oh that is a terrible boss, what did he do?"
"I went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it	That would be gross. What did you do?"
"Sadly, no.  There's no actual proof of who it was, but we've seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place.  He did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once, so I'll take that as a victory.	That must've been a bit of a stressful situation for you"
"My husband went to a job fair and got a lot of job offers!	That sounds exciting! I'm glad you guys got good offers!"
"He is currently Active Duty Army, but is wanting to go into transportation/logistics.	That sounds great! What kind of job offers did you hear about his potential employers giving out of all the people?"
"It's been a great day so far! The sun is out and I'm on my second cup of coffee!	That sounds great! What made today great for you?  Did you do anything exciting or fun?"
"Yes I am, about to make some soup for lunch. This day has been just what I needed!	That sounds delicious and delicious. I hope you enjoy it."
"When I applied for the job I have now it took them like a month to get back to me with a final answer.  It was pretty stressful.	It's okay.  It happens.  It was my first time applying.  It takes a little longer.  It's not like I'm applying to anything"
"Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end, but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.	That can be stressful, but it sounds like it worked in the end."
"A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.	That's really a nice thing to do."
"I know - I wish I could do that. They've been to France, Italy, Croatia and Chile so far - I'm sitting in NC!	That sounds amazing!"
"I would just like to be able to drive to Raleigh without hurting! I fell and broke my hip a while back and can't walk properly.	I can imagine that would hurt a lot!"
"One more operation and I should be good. In the meantime, I have to live vicariously through Joe and Helen :)	My wife has been out of the country for 2 months, she gets back in a week.  I can't wait!	That's so cool! I wish my wife did that."
"I really did.  It'll be great to have her back :)	I hope so too.  I hope she had fun.  I'm a single parent now so I'm happy when I have the time to myself"
"When I interviewed for the job I have now, they didn't give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview.	That's terrible. What job was it? Maybe you should get it back! I mean, it's just one interview. You're not going to let that job slip away, are you?"
"It worked out ok, but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.	That's really frustrating. It makes you want to scream!  What job were you looking for?"
"My wife has been out of the country for the last 2 months for school.	It is nice to be alone sometimes.  How long was the trip?"
"I do.  She's getting back soon, but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.	That's terrible.  How are the dogs doing?"
"When I interviewed for my current job, I felt like it went well but all I could do was wait.	That's good, you did good! What job was it?"
"A lab technician at a university.	Oh wow! That is cool! How long will it last for you to work?"
"My parents brought my brother a brand new iPhone. He always gets the newest stuff and I get stuck with nothing.	That sucks. I got the old iPhone once too and now everyone in school is one step older than me.  It's like I am 5. I wish my dad got me one."
"I have no idea. He's the ""golden child."" It's super unfair.	Oh wow, that sounds frustrating.  I hope you're happy."
"My wife has been out of the country for two months, which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can't help the other.	That's tough, do you guys live in different countries or cities far from each other?"
"She gets back in a week, so it's almost over.	That's terrible, what is she doing?"
"my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! I hate insects. they are so nasty	That's no fun. What kind of wasp?"
"heck yes i did! I locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work	Oh that was bad! Did you get it out of the house?"
"i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season	i have never been a fan of them"
"yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them	It's like mosquitoes but they're even worse in some ways."
"Both me and my girlfriend are super scared of spiders, but she made me kill a huge one yesterday.	Oh, what was that monster spider like? Was it a giant tarantula?"
"Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!	I was so terrified that I was going to scream all day long"
"I'm going skydiving for the first time with some friends!	That's a pretty crazy thing to be nervous about!"
"A little bit, but I love doing extreme stuff like this.	That's awesome. What is sky diving?"
"The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night!	I know that's awful. Did you get it back?"
"It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs!	That's disgusting.  What kind bugs did you see?  I usually don't notice any bugs in my yard, except sometimes I will see a few of them flying in through the window.  Do you think you should have put the bug spray out?"
"On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.	its good you have someone to talk about your problems."
"Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.	I hate when doctors are wrong and then correct you."
"You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still, I fret about it. I should just get on with it!	I'm about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack	That sounds like a lot to handle! How did you feel when you were packing? Was it stressful? Did she do it too fast for your comfort?"
"she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her	That's great! What are they doing while you are away?  Are they in school or working?"
"Cell phones are great, but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable.	ye i got a bad cell phone, and sometimes it's so loud i can hear the wind blowing through it, and sometimes the wind blows right through it, making the sound of the cell phone sound super loud and annoying!"
"Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline, and it was not an appropriate topic!	Oh my goodness. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that was what was going to happen on Youtube."
"Of course they did, some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where. I was humiliated,lol.	My dog died today :(	I'm so sorry. That's really tough."
"Yes, she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.	That sucks. I'm so sorry. I know she was dying soon so I know it. My dog passed too a little over a year ago."
"my daughter went on vacation with her friends and the house feels so lonely	That's sad. What did she do there?"
"they went to the beach for 1 week	That's so cool. What did they do there?"
"I'm moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can't wait! No more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!	That's exciting! What neighborhood are you moving into in the new city in the new city?"
"Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?	That's annoying. What are your plans now that you move?  Where will you go?"
"Eww. Yes, it is loud. Who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? That's nuts!	My wife has been out of the country for two months, and is coming back in a week!	I love it.  What is she up for when you get her back?"
"It sure is.  It's just been me and the dogs all summer, I've gotten super bored :P	Yeah, it is nice to see your family when they come back."
"I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!	That does make sense. I am applying for a job right now."
"I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom. I am so grossed out by all the bugs here!	That's disgusting. I don't think I could even apply right now after seeing it. Did you try to wash your hands?"
"Spiders could bite me, which could really hurt!	i feel that with my training lately im going to win my next week soccer game	Oh yeah? Do tell. I love watching those professional sports games on ESPN."
"for this specific game for about 3 months	That's great! What position?"
"After my wife and I moved I went through a while of unemployment.  It was really tough not being able to support us.	Oh wow, what did you end up doing?"
"It's gotten better now, but it could still get even better.  Just got to keep on moving.	That sucks.  I hope things get better for you and your wife."
"i am really happy for next year i have a trip planned to go to india	I love India! What kind of trip is it?  Are you traveling for a vacation or working and traveling at work?  Is there a lot to see?"
"yeah i have been planning this trip for over 2 years	I love India. What are you planning to do there?"
"I had the most wonderful week recently. My neighbors weren't here and I could do whatever I wanted without them stomping on my head!	that's so true, having neighbors can make you so grumpy sometimes!"
"It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.	I bet! That must've been fun! Did anything crazy happen to the neighbors?"
"That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!	I know the pain of a week off work."
"Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.	that blessed time! how did you find them?"
"I went to work with my pants inside out, and I didn't notice until my secretary pointed it out.	Did you have to change your pants?"
"It was very embarrassing! At least I didn't go the whole day like that.	Oh wow, that must've been embarrassing!"
"The airport was completely empty the other day.	I know right?  It's always a bit of an underwhelming experience.  But at the same, it is nice that it's less crowded."
"Home, but I thought LA would be crowded even at 4am, it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy.	That's weird. I've never been empty at that time of day."
"Made getting my connection super easy, and trust me I was in a hurry to get there. Odd how being alone can make you paranoid.	i cant wait to see my dog back home it has been 2 years since i see him	It has. What a wonderful reunion! Did you guys live together for long time or did you just see eachother for a minute or two?"
"college, but i will be seeing him very soon i think	I'm glad you can't wait to see him too!"
"So my youngest went to his first day of kindergarten today.  So proud of him.  Silly I know.	That's awesome! What's he going into kindergarten for the year."
"I hope so should be home really soon.  Can't wait to hear all about it.  IT goes by to fast!	I feel you.  I have two kids and they go to daycare every day.  They are always talking about their friends and what they're doing.  I wish they could go to kindergarten!"
"I know my oldest just graduated,  It was like it was over in an instant!	A few months ago we were planning our wedding and I couldn't wait until the actual day finally arrived.	that sounds like fun.  how did everything work out?"
"It was even better then expected. It was very small, but so happy how it turned out.	that's awesome! Congrats on the marriage! What made you decide on a small wedding?"
"i hate when my neighboors dog poops on my yard and she does nothing, i dont care if he poops if she picks it up	It's not like he's a pet owner, he probably has no yard to keep it away."
"hahaha i mean he does not do it often but it is not a bad idea	I know, I hate having my neighbors dog poop all on their lawn and mine on their yard and mine is in mine."
"After studying and preaching for a few years, my husband was ordained to be a minister.	that's good. what's he do now?"
"Yes it is and he is so devoted to God and living for Him. I was so happy for him.	That's wonderful. I hope you guys enjoy it together."
"Thank you.	This morning, my dog knocked down a while box of cereal and it spilled everywhere.	Oh, that is quite a mess!"
"Yes, and to make it worse, when I tried to clean it, she tried to eat, so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.	I am so sorry about that!"
"No, she only ate a little bit. I cleaned it up pretty quickly.	There was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it	That sounds interesting. What did it serve?"
"I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive, small, and bland!	that is awful to have to experience."
"In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.	I used to work in a church. I was always being asked what day of the week was."
"If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.	I agree with you on this one, but I think it's okay if they had a disagreement over something small like religion or politics."
"I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol. I'm all for earnest discussion, but not at work!	My husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber. He was able to carry so much at once!	That's so sweet!  How did he do that?  Was it hard labor or did he have any help?"
"He is! I was so shocked but super attracted to him too!	That is so awesome of him. I bet you two can work on anything."
"i was really sad when my dog died last year	I'm sorry. That's a terrible loss. How old was it?"
"yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about	it sucks, but it makes you realize how short life really is"
"A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer, but he got a job and had to cancel.	That's too bad!  Did you get to hang out?"
"Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.	That sucks. I hope he finds the job he wants soon."
"I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.	My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday, we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe, have fun, and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call, we found out that she had a heart attack and died.	That's a sad story. I am sorry for that."
"Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.	That's really sad. Did you get to know her before she passed away?"
"Thank you.	My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her.	I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you find her?"
"I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad	That sucks. Did anyone find out what happened to them?"
"I love to play golf, but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again.	yea, but i bet you miss it"
"It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!	You should really just stop playing altogether if your hip is injured."
"Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.	Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!	That is! It's like a rush of adrenaline."
"I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.	That's pretty scary. But it sounds like a fun experience."
"I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.	I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!	oh man, that's awesome! how did it work out?"
"I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies.	that is awesome! what brand is it?"
"I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies.	I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face!	Oh no! That's so gross"
"I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled!	Oh my goodness. I would have screamed even if it was my kid."
"I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything	That must be nerve racking."
"a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job, they pay really good money	I feel you brotha"
"I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.	oh wow thats nice"
"I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.	I hope they all are doing well too!"
"I actually sent her a message through facebook.	That must have felt so good to talk to her! I hope you guys stay close."
"I guess that's a good word for it.	I came home from work today and my wife had a new puppy waiting for me.	Oh wow. How cute is that! How do puppies behave at home?"
"Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day.	That's so cool! I have a new pup coming home tomorrow!"
"It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back.	I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled.	I know how that feels."
"I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.	I understand how frustrating that can be."
"I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.	I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!	That is terrible!  What happened after that?"
"It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.	That was pretty greedy. Did they taste okay?  I love them. I could never resist them!"
"It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!	my son is sick, he got this hand foot and mouth desease, nothing serious but he has a fever	That sucks. Does he have any other symptoms?"
"i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow	Oh wow I've heard of it before, but I've never had a child with it before. I hope it doesn't last long either."
"i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions	That is cool. I bet you guys were a lot fun to watch. I bet you were a lot fun to watch"
"honestly, no, it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again	I'm sorry to be the one telling you this, but you're an adult now. If you want to go dance again you should go to the club that has a dance team or find someone to dance with you"
"I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.	That is awesome! What is Ryder?  Is Ryder Ryder Cup a nickname?"
"I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!	The Ryder cup is going on this weekend in Spain."
"I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.	Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.	Yeah, that's why you want kids who can keep secrets"
"Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.	I love my family. I bet they love theirs too"
"Yes, they did.	I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!	That's weird! Did you call the local coroner?"
"I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden!	That must have been very disturbing.  I would never find it out!"
"I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!	I know what you mean.  It's like people think that they can do anything they want with animals and that they are above the laws that protect animals from cruelty and neglect."
"They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!	that's horrible"
"More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.	Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I.	oh no! What did it sound like? Was anything broken outside of that noise"
"It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in.	It's scary! I hope it won't happen again."
"It would be, I worry for the safety of my family.	My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.	That's so kind.  What kind was it?"
"They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.	that makes sense, thanks"
"Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.	My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first	Oh that is so creepy!"
"He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too!	oh wow that's really cool"
"Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.	It does look so spooky."
"Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?	I agree, it's like a ghost flying around the neighborhood.  I think I would be too freaked if I had one of my own."
"i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes	That can get annoying sometimes."
"like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat	Oh no! That's a lot. Did she just not realize?"
"It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.	Oh no! That must be so hard! What kind was it?"
"Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.	That's terrible. Did the vet find anything wrong?"
"A border collie, he was a great doggie.	My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.	I am sure it wasn't a problem."
"She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.	That's scary. I've heard the xray is like a test for kids."
"I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.	That's disgusting.  Did you call the police?"
"I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.	I hope the truck is not a commercial one, if it was, that would explain a lot!"
"I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.	That sounds like you were prepared for the weather!"
"I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.	That must have been stressful. I'm glad that you had it."
"I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!	I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.	I hope you get through your work quickly. What are the requirements for your major?"
"Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.	That's awesome! You're doing so well!"
"Criminal and social justice.	I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.	Oh, I am sorry. Was it scary?"
"I think it was just the thought of being so high up.	That was pretty intimidating. I don't think I'll ride it this year either. It's always so scary!"
"I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.	It is snowboarding in the mountains, right"
"Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.	oh well, well that's your problem then.  You should have thought of something.  It's not every day that your friends go to a different location for the day.  You are lucky that they are in a place where they have stuff for the whole weekend to make up for it, so don't be too hard on them.  Maybe just do some work from home?"
"In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.	Yeah, I've had to take my dog to the vet, and he was just so happy to see me, but then I had to give him away and take my dog home with me..."
"Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.	Yeah, that's why I'm so attached to my little dogies Luna. I know how much they can bring you joy."
"Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.	A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.	Oh wow! What is it like on cruise?"
"Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!	The cruise was worth it. I hope it's worth it for you!"
"When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped.	That's terrible. Did she go?"
"She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade	That must have made us worried a lot. I hope it turned out well."
"I finally had a day of, but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.	That is terrible. I am so cold."
"I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.	That is terrible. I hope the weather clears soon. I'm always cold!"
"I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious	That movie was so scary! I hate going to haunted house. I always run away."
"Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.	Oh my god that is scary"
"I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes	That sounds like you're trying to get the best price."
"a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is	I know right. It's so expensive, but I don't know if I'm going to save any money by not buying it now.  I think I'll wait until I have more money saved before I start."
"I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!	That's okay. You had one cake by yourself?"
"Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house.	I would never eat a whole cake by myself, I'd invite myself."
"The other night I had a panic attack out the blue	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you were alright. What happened to you?"
"Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about.	It can be stressful, I'm sorry you had one.  I've had a panic attack or two."
"I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.	that is terrible!  what happened?!"
"We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.	That's terrible.  Did you find out where he is?"
"We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there.	I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.	It can be very frustrating when someone ghostes, I'm sorry you felt like that happened"
"That's just it. We didn't really ""break up"" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.	That sucks. I'm glad you are okay though."
"Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.	I know right. It was a small coffee but it really made me think about the people who do pay for things like my mom."
"I will, you never know when someone else is in need!	I know, I was in the middle of a fight last week and a nice lady stopped me and offered to help."
"It is, I have been so blessed in my life!	My husband started college this week!	That's cool. What's college?"
"Yes, he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!	That's good! I'm glad to hear. How many years are he away from home for?"
"I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.	I know how that goes"
"No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.	I bet.  What restaurant is that?"
"So gross, that is certain.	I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air	oh that's a funny story. What happened?"
"I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards	oh that's funny, did you clean it off?"
"Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.	Oh yeah? What was scary about?"
"I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.	Yeah, that's why we need to be careful with that."
"I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.	My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!	That's a problem. Maybe ask them if you can have them to keep watch?"
"People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying!	Yeah, it gets annoying every day too. They should be quieter."
"I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.	oh that is a lot of calories"
"I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.	That's not bad. Did you eat a lot?"
"When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!	That's awesome! Congratulations! How long have you been working? What kind was it?  Did you buy a house or a car?"
"Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.	That's great news! You should have saved up for a long time before now!"
"Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!	That's exciting! How long are you teaching? What subjects do the kids typically study in school?"
"I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous.	That's awesome!  How do you know this job is right for them though?"
"It really is, you are molding their future!	I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce	That's terrible. I'm sorry. Did your dog get adopted out of a local shelter?"
"No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.	That sucks. I hope you can forgive him in time. It will take time."
"Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.	That's frustrating, how long have you been getting it?"
"They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	It can be frustrating, I wish companies would just do autopay for you!"
"It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.	My sister got a promotion at work last week!	Oh that's nice. How long until she takes her on the job interview list?"
"She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)	That's awesome! I wish I could get a promotion at my current school!"
"My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.	Wow, I bet that was exciting."
"Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.	That's awesome. It's good that she was open to feedback and willing to share it with others. I'm glad for you."
"My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!	That must have be scary for you too."
"I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.	I can understand. It must be scary to not be with your kids. I hope everything works out well for your son."
"Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?	I totally understand what you mean. I'm glad you're okay with it. I just wish I could have been there with you. I hope you do well for him though."
"Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!	That's so true. It is hard, though to let someone go that fast."
"I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.	that sucks, what year was it?"
"It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.	I love Nintendo 64 games, I have all the games. I bet it was so exciting to play. What did you play first with it"
"I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.	That is terrible! What is it?"
"I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.	I'm sorry.  That's tough.  What major is this?"
"Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.	I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made!	I love dinner. What kind of dinner? Did he make something new or use a recipe you had given?"
"Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.	Oh, nice. I bet she loves that. I love that my partner plays video games with her when the kids go to school."
"Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!	I have never thought about that. I will definitely have coffee for sure!"
"Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.	Oh my god, that is horrible. I love my coffee filters, I have them right on the fridge at home too, but no coffee without them."
"4	What happened?"
"Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.	It sounds so cute!"
"My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.	I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday	I am sure it was hard to let go of the job, but you made some good money. Did the job change or anything?  I hope you found something new"
"Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic	That is good to not have to work, but what about a job that you like? What do you want?"
"I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am	Oh wow, that must have made a great impression."
"Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life!	That's awesome! What do you love most in life?"
"I had such a bad cold last week, I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.	That's disgusting. Did you take care yourself while being so sick?"
"No, thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still, I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.	I am sorry to hear about that, but maybe you should try drinking some ginger to get rid of the stuff you are throwing up!"
"No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	That's the worst. Did you guys fight about it?"
"I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.	I'm sorry she ate it."
"She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.	ks, good luck"
"Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!	I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.	I am sure everything works out okay."
"I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.	I understand how worried you must feel.  You should try having the baby.  You might be a good parent.  It's hard to be worried all the time, but if you're worried enough to go see your therapist about it, then you might be ready to take the next steps.  It's a big responsibility but also really the best time to start learning.  I'm glad you're going to try to do this baby thing right by you're doing.  Maybe you"
"I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome	That's really funny. Did you stop walking to admire it?"
"I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing	That's so funny! Did you hit the cat hard?"
"I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!	Oh, well I hope for you you do well!"
"That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.	Yeah, that sounds tough."
"I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.	I feel you man! I would be so upset."
"Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?	I understand how hard it is to be in a relationship and how hard moving out of it is. It's hard to move on, but it's even harder to let past feelings get stuck. I hope it's not you, and you've moved on and are happier."
"Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.	It would be so much safer"
"I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!	What call did they respond to?"
"I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.	I'm sure.  You should get out of the way."
"Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.	I agree.  I would have yelled at him."
"2	I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!	Oh that's a scary thing. Did you get hurt?"
"Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.	I hope it's gone for now"
"I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.	I love drawing too. I'm not sure why but I just love it."
"Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.	I have never met anyone who is more talented. I have a sister and brother too and we all love them but we have to learn from each other sometimes. I have no idea about drawing. Maybe I should."
"I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise.	that is really nice"
"I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.	I'm glad to know you have someone like that."
"I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.	It is bad news. I am so sorry. I am thinking of some things you can do to cope with it. I am sure you are going to be okay though."
"It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.	I'm so sorry. What are the chances, exactly, of you beating it?"
"Thank you so much for being supportive. :)	I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.	Oh that sounds scary! Did you go out to check it?"
"Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.	I am sorry."
"Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.	I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.	Oh, that's terrible! Did he make it through the surgery okay?"
"Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.	that's good to hear!  Is it going well?"
"Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.	I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...	That's a terrible diagnosis.  What are your options?"
"I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.	I don't know. I'm a 50-year-old guy, so the risk is there, but it's just...it's a long way to go before you're positive."
"Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly	that sounds like so many fun times. What was some game you are thinking of playing now?"
"Super smash bros is a classic, never gets old, but yeah you're right	Oh, yes! I played those games all night long."
"I had a job interview recently	I had too! What happened?"
"Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.	That's unfortunate, but you can improve with practice."
"Speaking of co-workers, one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes, and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.	That's cool. What kind is it?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.	Yeah, that's why you need to work really well in your career and be prepared to do what you have to to get ahead."
"I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me	That's a bit disappointing, I wish you could go with them!"
"Jurassic World. It was okay.	oh, i see. that was nice of them to do that for you. are you a fan of movies or not really a big deal for you?"
"I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.	I would have asked you for the last one! Did it taste bad to him?"
"Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge.	That's a bit gross, but at least he didn't steal my phone."
"I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones	That was really a bad move. I don't understand why they would ban him. He was right on the issue of vaccines."
"I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms	That is so wrong, I agree with Alex on this. He is right on the issue"
"I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom, but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain	Oh that must have been so embarrassing! How old were you when you did this for real life?"
"Yeah, nobody said anything	That's funny! Did you find anyone to tell you?"
"My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!	That sucks. How long have you two been together for."
"Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!	That sucks. What do you do? You might want to consider a divorce. It's not worth staying if you know you're going through with something.  Or maybe you should try to figure out what's going on and see if you can't work on that relationship."
"Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.	I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.	I bet. What country did they end up in?"
"I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.	ali gosh that was so nice to see you helped your uncle out of trouble"
"Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.	That's great! He's a smart one too, I bet he's going to get good things."
"No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(	That's great! I hope it continues! I hope he will keep up his good work."
"He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.	So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?	oh thats so cool, did you train your dog?"
"I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.	I love it when you tell a story like this and you can't stop. I'm listening. What's happening next in this story?"
"I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.	Yeah, that was the first competition I ever won. I was a little nervous but I'm a confident competitor."
"Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!	That is cool. I hope you continue to win championships"
"Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.	I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though	I love my girlfriends! They are the only people who can make my day brighter."
"Yes, I feel much better now.	I bet you felt terrible while being in pain."
"I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.	Oh, I bet that was fun."
"Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!	I love going to nudist colonies! They really do a lot for society."
"I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.	My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.	That's not good! Did you punish her?"
"I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.	oh wow thats a bummer!"
"Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.	that is cool, what did he do to do that?"
"Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.	What is that? Is he going to use it to make ice or what? I'm curious now"
"I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.	that's awful."
"My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions, probably a bad idea.	That's terrible. What can be done to prevent this kind of situation?"
"My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.	I'm sorry about that.  That sounds really sad.  I hope your roommates is okay."
"Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected.	That's terrible!  I hope the house gets back to normal soon."
"I broke up with my boyfriend last week, and nothing is the same without him.	its hard when we have something going well"
"Yeah, I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.	I'm sorry.  I've been there, it's hard.  I hope you can find someone that you can live happily with."
"I just made the most delicious pie	That is a really nice treat to look forward to.  What kind of pie is it, I am a pie lover"
"It was apple pit,  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.	That is a very good pie. What was your name?"
"I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.	That is so cool! What brand is that yeezy's for haircuts?"
"I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's	That's true, but you have got to try and keep a positive attitude."
"I just went camping and build the warmest fire.	I'm so jealous. I love camping."
"Yeah, I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.	That's awesome! What kind campsite is that?"
"I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.	Oh, I bet. Did you have any flashlight?"
"I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.	Oh wow! That's terrifying"
"I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai	Oh yea? What's the concern?"
"These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic	That is true. They are known to have some strict laws and customs. I don't know if I would feel very comfortable traveling to Dubai if I didn't know the country."
"I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.	It is a crime, right?"
"Of course, I'm not worried no one would steal from me.	I'm so paranoid. I would have gone and looked all over for it. I'm going back to pick up my phone."
"I can't help feel stressed about money	I feel you, I'm feeling the same way. How much money are we talking here?  I hope you find the right way to deal.  I'm feeling bad that I'm not a better money person.  How much is it?"
"Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700	That's a bummer."
"I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family	Oh no! That's awful! What happened? Why you feel alone?"
"lol I played xbox games	I love xbox games, what type of game did you play?"
"I usually don't feel the greatest because of health problems.	I'm so sorry to hear this. What health problems are they?"
"Blood pressure and crohns disease, as well as, a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well, woke up happy and energized	I hope everything stays well."
"You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions, and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.	I love that kinda thinking!"
"Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.	I can't believe that. You bought it at a school auction? That seems so silly"
"Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?	I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.	That's normal, do you think you are a better fit?"
"I'm hoping for the best, but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!	That is exciting! How old you? What field you applying for? What kind of work is it in your field of choice of interest?"
"This is going to sound really pathetic, but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!	That is so exciting!"
"Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.	That does make my dust bunnys look funny, lol."
"Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.	My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.	That must have been a tough adjustment for her parents."
"She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha	That's really cool. What kind was it?"
"I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.	ye, are u going alone or with someone?"
"Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!	That's horrible. I hate living next door to a noisy family with kids."
"Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.	Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.	That must've been a real challenge. I've heard it was fun though"
"It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do.	that's great! I wish i could travel full time. where did yall live?"
"Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.	Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?	I do. It's hard to believe that life goes by so fast."
"It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean, I love my life right now, but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.	I do. Sometimes I wish I could go back to high school or be a kid again. I don't know. It's good to know others too, though. It's good that you don't wish for everyone else to have those things."
"I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.	I bet you did.  How often do people look back on their youth?"
"As much as I can, but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.	That's the thing. Some memories are good, but others are just painful."
"Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently, one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me, without my saying anything!	That sounds like he was very kind of himself."
"It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.	Wow, that's nice of someone. What complex do you live in?"
"The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!	My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh, i miss her so much	I'm sorry to be rude, I know you miss her, but you have to take care and not to fall in love with her. I'm sorry!"
"yes but she lives in a different country, different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer	I used to play nintendos too"
"For me, one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.	I can understand that."
"Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?	Yeah, I'm more into sci-fi, and romance.  I like to think I'm a good person, so I'm always looking for something to make the world a little bit a a better place.  I love your book choice too!"
"There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.	My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!	Did he move away?"
"In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place, and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!	Yeah that was a rough one, how could something like that go down?"
"Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day, but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.	That sounds like the north of scottish isles"
"Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.	Oh man, I've heard that phrase from friends. It's so cliched, though."
"i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need	I love dogs. How big is he? I have a little Chihuahuas named Rocky and Bella"
"he is a french puddle and i love him very much	That's so sweet! What's he lookin like?"
"One time as a surprise for my birthday, my college friends ""kidnapped me""	That sounds like a fun surprise. What happened? Did they take you to the beach?"
"Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).	That's so funny!  I'm glad you got to experience it.  How did you feel blindfold?  Did they not hurt?"
"Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.	i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street, i get really angry and sad at the same time	I know how you do, it is sad to see people in need."
"yes i go to my local charity every weekend	oh man thats a lot. I dont even see people like them every day. What charity do you go there?"
"I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.	I've never won that. What kind was the prize?"
"I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much.	It's great that you're taking the time to enjoy the thrill."
"I'll try not to. I'll probably just save it :)	That sounds pretty cool! What game was it in?"
"I was really lonely and depressed at one point, and I had a dinner date with a potato I put googly eyes on.	That was pretty weird. What kind was that?"
"Much better, thanks :)  Yeah, I was really just doing anything to feel a connection.	That was a funny idea!"
"I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!	That must be soooo frustrating. Did you have to wash the shoes out of her hair?"
"I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him	Oh, that's cute! Did you chase the cat away?"
"I was confident that I was going to win that prize	That's great! What was it? Was it an important award?"
"It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok	That sucks. Did you enter again next time?  I've entered 6 times now and only one has won. I hope next time it's your year to win!"
"We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap	That's so expensive! What kind is it"
"It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was	That is so great to have such a wide variety to try different saucys!  What did they have?  Was it a sausage or not sausage?  What type?"
"it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is she in good?"
"yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital	That can be tough.  I hope she is okay."
"I'm going to my home country next tuesday and i'm so excited i can't sleep!! It's been 4 years since i've seen my parents	That's exciting! Where are you staying?"
"Kazakhstan. I miss it and i miss my parents and friends so much	That must have been tough.  What are you doing when you go back?"
"not bruno but borat lol such a stupid movie. I honestly can't stand that actor and his toilet humor	I am super proud of my parents for graduating college	That's very nice of them! How old were they when they finished college?"
"Yeah, they are truly an inspiration that anyone can go to college no matter the age	That's so cool, I love seeing people go through that process"
"I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods	That's always fun, what are you doing camping?  Do you like the woods?"
"aren't you afraid of the wild animals that will be roaming the area?	I came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag, gotten a sandwich I had forgotten I brought home from lunch, and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it.	Oh wow, how clumsy of him to be. I would have been quite mad if I had my dog do that to."
"He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.	oh my, thats nasty"
"I am impressed in my sisters camping skills. They are very good	yea she made us have a great time on the trip"
"We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents	that sounds like they are very responsible and resourceful"
"I am confident that I will win the gaming tournament in Chicago	Oh really? What kind game is it for?"
"Shooting game	That is a fun tournament."
"When I go up with my skydiving students I feel proud when they do well	That is such an exhilaring feeling, right when taking that first step!"
"I have been instructing for 12 years but skydiving for 25	That sounds like a fun time!  Did they all do well?"
"You shoudl definitely try it!	Well, recently at physical therapy I walked the length of the treatment room with the help of a cane. I'm feeling quite good about that!	That sounds like you did well! What kind physical therapy treatment were you doing?"
"Considering I've been using a walker for the past two years, yes it is. Thanks!	That sounds like a challenge you took head-on and you did great!"
"Every day I practice - I'll be back on the golf course in no time, lol.	I am so upset that a public road in front of my house closed because of a limestone mine.	oh man, that is a boulder road, isn't it?"
"It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.	That's really frustrating, did you contact the government?"
"I just have to wait for the city to fix the collapsed road and reopen the road again.	I am hopeful that I will win my ebay bid	That's really exciting! What are the items you are bidding on?"
"I am bidding on a rare comic book	That sounds awesome! Are you a collector of rare comics?"
"I was walking home one time and a really big dog came charging out from a house at me barking really loudly.	That is really cool. What did you do about it?"
"Thankfully not really, it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it, but it was really frightening until it was retrieved.	That must have been really frightening"
"it is incredible to see how technology has advanced these past days	It's true, I mean I can't believe I used to play with a brick phone and it's now a smartphone! It's a whole different animal!"
"well the phones are basically a 1990's computer	That sounds like my 2003 phone, lol."
"I ate an entire cake last night	That was quite an appetite you have there! Did you have to go to the bathroom?"
"It was! I just couldn't stop! It was so good that I just had to keep eating	Oh wow. I can understand why you would want the whole cake then."
"I am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it	That is very kind of of yours."
"Ehh, its not the best but it's not bad either\	That sounds like you're a good family member."
"I was afraid when I saw that horror film in the theater	its a horror film, its not scary at all"
"It was the First Purge	That's a scary movie! Did it really scare you?"
"Wandering around my little area of the world I am quite pleased with the variety of stores and restaurants here. I didn't expect it.	That sounds like you are in a great city."
"Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well, I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.	Yeah thats cool. I wish I had that. I live in the middle of a small area."
"I find it hard to believe, myself! This is the rural south, yet there are fine dining restaurants, the aforementioned store, really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff.	i hate when i do dishes and touch food that was on the plate1! so gross. makes me wanna throw up	Oh yeah, that can be gross too."
"because the food is all soggy and mushy. i don't know, such a yucky feeling	I hate when I get food poisoning. It makes my stomach turn."
"i really hate when my kids leave their dirty clothes on the floor	That's a common problem, but it's not fun to deal with it"
"yeah they even have a bin specially for that	It can be annoying! Maybe you can tell them to put the clothes in the bin?"
"i hate people that cut lane in traffic without signaling it	I agree.  It's frustrating and makes you mad."
"yeah it really makes me mad to see that people dont care about these types of things	That's no ones problem. People are just following their own path and dont care. Its the same in traffic."
"I found a rabbit that had been shot by someone in my yard	That must have been so scary! Did it bite?"
"Thank goodness it was dead, poor thing is not suffering, but some people can be so cruel.	That's a terrible feeling.  I've had to clean up a raccoons trash can a lot of times, but this rabbit was a whole different ball game.  I was really scared that I was going to have another animal come out and get into the yard.  But thanks to my quick action, there was no animal in my yard.  That's a good feeling.  But sometimes you have no choice and have to clean up a dead animal, which can be a whole"
"We had been holding off trying a new restaurant in town.	That is so frustrating. What restaurant is it at this point?"
"It's a little pricey and I'm worried I won't like the food and waste all that money. It has good reviews though	That's a good idea to read some reviews! What's it? A restaurant or something?"
"Our local organic store now stocks Indian food made by a local Indian lady - heaven, heaven, heaven!	oh man that's so awesome, what kind of Indian food is she making?"
"About once a week. Her husband works in the store, so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!	That sounds like you have a good thing going on!"
"Well, my uncle's Indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook, and she taught me. But I'm disabled right now so can't cook much. This is such a find!	I have been working on  my jump shot all month.	It is great to hear that you are working on your jump shot"
"I hope so I have a big horse tournament against my buddies I want to win the 100 bucks prize.	That is awesome! I bet you're going hard! What are you working with to practice your jump shot?"
"One of my neighbors (next building and two floors up) plays talk radio every morning Very Loudly.	Yeah. I love talking radio, it helps me get my day going."
"Not until about 8am, but it's so loud I can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed. Idiot man!	Ahh, talk radio can be quite...loud."
"Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!	I know right. People can get so annoyed with the littlest things. It's like they're expecting everyone to have everything and everything is against them."
"I've called management twice about it and both times he quietened down - for about two days. Then up it goes again!	I understand your feeling, it is so annoying when people are rude to the people you try and help.  I've called management a lot over the past 2 years and nothin. I've also called the company about things that aren't really their fault. I've also called a friend a bad person and they didn't call the company to get ahold of me."
"Nothing in life is certain, the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.	You're right.  I just lost my job, my wife left and now I'm having to pay for all of my expenses.  I just feel like life has been taken out from under my control.  I'm just trying not to let that happen."
"I have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas.	That's pretty cool. I love Britneys."
"The show is in three months, I hope she sings he late 90s hits.	That is awesome! I love Britney Spears too. I saw the video for ""I Will Never Love You"" on YouTube and was so sad! I didn't want it to end! I felt bad watching her cry.  I wish I could go to the show. I love Britney too!"
"Our Property Management team just emailed me to say I've got the apartment I wanted!	oh wow. what are you renting the place for?"
"It really was - I can't wait to move in! It's a smaller apartment, but quieter (I hope!).	That sounds great!  What city are you moving in to?"
"You'll get there. It really is nice to have your own space. Do you live at home?	I don't, I live with my husband in the city. I do love my husband, but it's not for me. I live in a small city. It's good to have your own, but I don't have the same stress."
"Good for you! Start saving your money now - believe me, you'll need it!	I was on the patio and a giant roach crawled out from underneath.	I hate roach bugs!  What did you have to do to catch it?"
"It was almost as bug as a golf ball I felt like throwing up.	Oh, that is a scary situation.  Did you call the exterminator?"
"I have quite a long drive ahead of me next month. It's about 1/12 hours, but I've don it before so I'll be fine.	That's great! Are you going somewhere exciting?  I'm going on a road trip with friends next week."
"I put music on and open the window. Otherwise I'll disappear into my own little world, and that's not a good thing to do when you're driving!	Awwww that sucks. I wish you the best."
"It really helps to pass the time, not to mention it can calm you down. And the drive's quite easy and very pretty, which help.	I was so amped yesterday. I got to pick up my now computer for the store!	That's cool. Did you have to go through a long line to get it?"
"It was just a new model HP that I bought but I'm so excited!	That sounds awesome! I wish you the best! What computer does it come in?"
"I get my groceries delivered to my home and am so grateful for the service.	I love the delivery service too!"
"It helps me a lot as I'm disabled and it can be quite difficult. Anyway, I hate grocery shopping!	that's great, how do they deliver?"
"Ugh. And don't even get me started on ""mini-shoppers"" racing round the aisles screeching! Much better to have someone else buy for me!	I just watched the notebook, pretty depressing movie.	Oh, yeah. I was just thinking about that too, actually just a few days after the release."
"It's a romantic love story. Doesn't end so well for the main character.	I watched it, too. I know it's a sad movie."
"my little boy learned how to  count to ten eeven know he is super young	I love kids learning stuff like that! They are the future!"
"yeah i was so proud of him as well i thought i would have to wait months till he got to that point	That's a pretty impressive achievement. What's he learning in terms of learning how to count? I think I learned that myself when I was around that young. It seems you're ahead on the counting game. Are you his teachers or parents or both?"
"I just went to the park today.	I went there today."
"I was going to hang out, but I ended up tripping and smashing my toe up into a rock.	That's so frustrating! Did you get any pictures taken of you?"
"my little brother dumped a glass of water on me this morning to wake me up	Oh, oh wow! What happened? Did he spill it on you?"
"yeah i was furious we are in some sort of a prank war	I hate being woke to water."
"Last night there was a really strange animal screaming outside my window in the middle of the night	I hope it wasn a stray. Did you see any paw prints?"
"Turned out to be a skunk! It sounded so strange!	That is hilarious! I bet!"
"When I was in college I travelled all over Europe one semester.	That's a pretty amazing experience. Did you travel solo or with a group of people?"
"I love all over Italy, but I also loved Germany and France and Spain.	That is cool!"
"Yes it was truly an amazing time meeting people from so many different cultures	We went on vacation and the kids stayed home. I couldn't believe it when I walked in the door and the house was totally clean.	That must've been fun! What vacation did you go on?"
"Wonders never cease to amaze me. First time for everything I guess, lol	That's always exciting. I hope you had a great time. I can never go to the store and come back and forget what I bought. I always forget. That must have been fun. Did you have fun at all while the kids did things and played?"
"I totally thought the same thing. Too funny (but you might be right)	Oh yep, that's exactly what I thought too lol! It's funny how you never realize it's the opposite of the same until years go by!"
"I went ziplining the other day	I love ziplines! Where was it?"
"I found it using the Internet.  It was a lot of hiking but they had a lot of long lines.	Yeah ziplineing is pretty fun but also kinda scary"
"Yes I did - I had a great time and met some fun people.	I smashed my finger in the door last night	Oh, that sounds scary! Did you call the ambulance?"
"I iced it up but I was so mad because it was my fault for slamming the door	That's terrible! Did anyone help you out?  I know someone once told me they smashed a finger on a glass door."
"We might have to put our dog down soon.	It's sad when that happens. I lost mine a few years back."
"Yes, she's getting older and she's just getting to that point she can't move around good.	I hope she lives a few more years. She's such a sweetie and I know she's not going to let anything get her. I hope she's okay. I just miss having her around. I wish I could give her a big big big hug."
"i am really lucky that my cancer got cured many years ago	I've been lucky too.  I've had it since I was a child.  It's really hard to deal."
"i did it with chemo and it took a lot of time and effort	I am really lucky as well.  I have been through the cancer and chemo too.  It's not easy."
"I am so ready to move.	I move too. Where are you moving? I moved to a new city a month or two ago"
"California. I'm ready for my kids to try out some new schools and be happier :)	Yeah that's great.  I've moved a couple of kids to new school districts in the past few months, and it can't have been easy for them to get along with their new teachers and get good grades."
"i cannot stand seeing people throw trash on the streets	yeah thats my point, its our trash thats is the problem,"
"i know right i feel like doing that every time but i dont want to get arrested hahaha let karma get them,	It really sucks when they throw trash. I hate seeing it too."
"I am by myself most of the time in a isolated area. I only have animals as my friends.,5|5|4_5|5|5,	That sounds scary. Do you have any pets?"
"Sometimes it makes me sad, but than I think how happy my animal friends makes me feel.	That's great. How long do you spend alone?"
"I bought 100 packs of magic cards and didn't get a single good card.	That's terrible. I hate losing money too. What were you going to do?"
"Collectible cards. My friend bought only a few packs and got incredible cards.	I know that sounds like magic, but honestly it is a game I play to try and make money online"
"I feel really bad that we have to board our dog when we go on vacation next week.	That is terrible!  You should stay home with your dog!"
"We are going to a place at the beach that doesn't allow pets with some friends. Our vet also has a kennel there to board dogs so I guess that's what we'll do. She'll be so sad though.	That stinks. You should just get a dog."
"I actually recently applied for a few jobs myself, Crossing my fingers for something better than my current one.	I do that sometimes. What kind is it?"
"Current job doesn't pay enough, I'm waiting for the stars to align and something better to come along.	I wish you the best of the luck. I have applied myself"
"I just bought some tickets to win the price at the state fair.	I love the fair! What are the prizes?"
"I know its not likely but I really want to win the new mustang	Oh, you want a Mustang. That is a nice thing to want.  I have never had the opportunity to own one."
"I am so scared to live in my neighborhood. There is people that come around shooting their guns.	Oh. That's not very safe, right?"
"I have been thinking about moving but I have lived here for over 30 years. The area has changed so much.	That is scary, I hope you can find a better neighborhood to move to."
"My fear is that I wont find a safer place. Not much money to find a good neighborhood to move into.	I went out to the country to gaze at some stars.	Oh, I know that sounds cool! What did you see?"
"I was overwhelmed by the enormity of the universe.	That is pretty cool!"
"My kids birthday was last weekend, my whole family showed up! they didn't even tell me they were coming	That sounds like a lot of work. I'm glad they made it."
"Yea, i do. hah. They live a few states away, which is why it was so unexpected. don't see them often.	Oh my goodness. I can imagine you were nervous about having them over so far, not sure how to handle it."
"Bought two pairs of shoes recently.	I bought two pairs of shoes recently too, I'm so bored."
"Yeezy's, the worst part is the second pair of shoes were both right footed.	That must have been frustrating to see that they were right footed"
"I read the instructions to set up my fit bit 100 times.	It's so simple, isn't that weird?"
"I need it to work perfectly I need to get ready for a marathon and I need it to track my progress.	That's awesome.  How far do you think you can go in it?"
"I have a big speech to give.	I love being able to express my thoughts. What are your thoughts for that speech?"
"Well I don't really know many of the people I will be in front of, so hopefully I don't stutter or something.	I hope you do not!"
"I left my purse at in the seat in starbucks.	I would have checked it. Did they find it?"
"I was in a safe neighborhood so i wasn't worried.	That would've been so frustrating!"
"I was able to say the entire alphabet backwards.	I love that! What a unique achievement!"
"no time, I have a great memory, It was on a dare I nailed it perfectly.	That's awesome! What kind of dare was that for?"
"I have been looking at pictures of crazy car crashes.	That's crazy. Are you looking for anything? Or are you just looking back. I can't stand car accidents."
"Seriously now I can't drive anywhere. I can't even leave the house for fear of car crashes.	That sucks, I hope you can get some car training classes soon."
"I was at the mall yesterday. I sat down for a few minutes and when I looked away someone stole my shopping bags.	Did anyone see what happened?"
"No. I didn't notice right away. How could someone do that. Im so so mad!	I know that is frustrating, but sometimes these kinds of things happen."
"I was in a hospital and a guy game in with some really bad burns.	I've been there! That's terrifying! Did they get any treatment for it?"
"No idea, but I had never seen something like that in person. It looked painful.	I would have wanted him dead, he was nasty!"
"I saw a guy deadlift 700lbs at the gym the other day. I was in awe.	Oh my that's impressive.  I've never lifted weights myself, so I wouldn't be dead lift  even a pound or two.  What gym is he at, and what's his size and weight like?"
"Yeah it is, it seemed like he had every plate in the gym on the bar. I've never seen someone lift that much in person before.	I love deadlifts myself. I have a lot of deadlifts in the gym."
"I got to go to a cat cafe when no one else was around!	Oh wow! That sounds like so fun. Did you get to pet all the cats there as well as the cats that are in your home?"
"It was! I was the only one around so all the cats came to spend time with me	That's so sweet! Did you get to hold any cats?"
"I walked out to my car theo ther day and felt something hit my face.	That's scary! I hope nothing happened."
"A GIANT SPIDER! It was terrible and I was so startled!	That's a spider! Did you run inside?"
"When I can home, my cat was laying on the pile of laundry that I had pulled out of the dryer before work. Now it's covered in hair.	That's a bit of a stink. Did you clean it?"
"Well it's pretty inconvenient, that's for sure. Nothing I can really do about it now. Just got to keep the door closed I guess.	That's annoying, but you could have just tossed it out and cleaned up."
"Today when I went into my roommate's office to fix the internet, I noticed the collar of his old cat that passed away. I miss her.	I'm sorry about that. I know how you can miss your pets."
"Yeah, she wasn't my favorite cat, but I still miss her. Cancer sucks.	I know, I miss her as well, but I'm glad to hear she passed peacefully"
"Sometimes an old song runs through my head and I remember the times where I used to listen to songs so many times that I memorized the words	that always happens to you"
"Like old kind of emo songs, full of angst and whatnot	I know that. I remember listening ""Love Song"" by My Little Pony when I was little"
"The other night when I was taking my dog out to go to the bathroom really late. I heard some rustling in the bushes and panicked.	That's terrible! Did you see who was making it sound?"
"Oh she was ready to fight whatever it was, but she was on a leash thankfully. No, I'm just really easily started, all that anxiety over an armadillo. Im so ashamed lol.	Yeah armados can look like a dog, but they are much bigger and more aggressive!"
"I found an injured bird in my yard today, it was only a baby to!	I bet that bird was really sick. I would be too sad if that was my yard."
"Yes, I had to call my local wildlife rescue center to come get it. I hope its okay, they said they think it has a broken wing.	I love birds too!  I hope it's okay.  I hope you don't get it back.  They can be a pain."
"I have a friend coming over soon and I keep checking out the window to see if theyre here yet.	That's nice. Are you guys having fun hanging out together?"
"I am making dinner for the both of us. I have a roast in the oven. It smells so good I can't wait until it is ready.	That's great to hear your having a good food."
"My boss finally noticed my hard work and gave me a pay raise!	That's amazing! Congratulations. What kind pay raise?"
"No not at all! I'm excited because now I can plan a family vacation for this winter.	I bet! That's a good thing!"
"I have a deadline at work coming up.	oh thats bad. what do you do to meet that deadline?"
"It is top-secret. But every time I try and get serious work done, my co-workers won't leave me alone.	Oh, you need to be careful."
"My roommate has been gone all week. I don't have anything to do without him here.	I hate when you leave without a plan!"
"It's just not the same doing something by myself. I don't have anyone to go do stuff with.	I am sorry."
"We just adopted a dog from the shelter last week and I think she is sick with parvo.	Oh no. That's terrible."
"It's a deadly dog illness, basically a virus that often leads to death. We think she caught it at the shelter.	You're going through this?"
"Yes, they have to do a fecal sample and test it. We take her in tomorrow to see.	Oh no!  Is she okay?"
"Thank you!	We are planning on going on a cruise in December!	That's always fun. I've never done one."
"No, I went on one in highschool but first one with my husband and daughter. It's has been so fun planning it together!	Oh, that is awesome! What are you and the kids going on the cruise?"
"I came home today and my roommate was cooking dinner, all i had to do was fix my plate. It was so nice.	That sounds like a good time."
"I sure did, and the food was delicious. I'll have to surprise him with dinner next time.	oh yeah thats a good thing."
"What kind of pizza place is it?	We are suppose to be having a bad storm this weekend.	That sucks! Is there any chance that you guys have any idea how bad this storm is going be like 50 feet per minute wind and 30 miles an hour winds?"
"Yes, makes you wonder if its global warming. I have been stocking up on food and supplies. Ready for the worst.	That would be bad. Do you have any plans in place?"
"My husband just got called back into work, was not expecting that!	That's terrible. Did he say why he got called back? Was it something unexpected or did you ask?"
"Someone stole some gear, so they called everyone back to investiage. We had just sat down to eat dinner to!	That is very sad news. I can't imagine losing gear that important. I'm so happy for him that he got called back in."
"He is in the military so technically he can be called in 24/7 and is payed on salary!	I just prepared an amazing plate of mac and cheese.	That's a classic comfort food dish! What kind cheese did you use?"
"It is so good if you add the right amount of pepper.	Oh man! That sounds delicious. How long did you cook it for?"
"I just bought a brand new necklace and shirt.	That sounds so good! What brand is it?"
"Not sure I just though it looked cool. Hopefully it gets me noticed.	Yeah you need to put up a show!"
"My dog keeps having accidents in the house! I'm getting fustrated.	That's the worst thing that could happen to me."
"Thank you, I will. I think she is doing it to mark her territory, it started when we brought a new dog home.	Yeah that's a good reason to do it."
"When I was promoted to Team Leader at work, I really felt like all my hard work had paid off, to some extent, and I gave myself a little pat on the back.	That's awesome! Congratulations!"
"Yes, and it can be difficult at times to move up at places, especially when there are many other long timers there!	I love promotions at work, especially when you get to be in a position where you are in charge and help set the direction."
"I can't wait to go to the water park this weekend.	That's so much fun!"
"Yes, my kids love it so they are going to be so happy when we get there.	That's so great! What kind is it?"
"I'm just laying in bed with a scented candle burning in my room and my cat on my lap, things couldn't be any better.	Yeah, that is what life is. A good candle, and a good cat, and you're happy?"
"Yeah my kitty is just purring away, we're having a good time watching youtube.	Yeah my cat is just sleeping on my pillow."
"My mom sent my daughter a toy I played with when I was a child!	Oh wow! What toy was it?"
"Yes, it was neat to see her play with it. It'll make some great photos, since I have one of me playing with it at her age.	That's really cool. It's nice that she has a mom like that."
"Six months ago my boyfriend proposed to me and we are getting married next month. I can't wait	That's great!  Congratulations on your wedding day!"
"On a honeymoon, lol? Not right away. He is totally the man of my dreams. I'm so lucky	I can imagine how happy he is. I am also happy."
"My husband might loose his job, I'm not sure what we will do if he does.	That's terrible. How often do you see his work colleagues?"
"The company is downsizing and cutting a lot of departments. His hasn't been cut yet but there are rumors!	Oh, wow.  I hope so.  I hope so too.  I hope so because I really hope he gets the news he gets."
"I found out my childhood cat passed away	I am sorry, how sad are things like that. I have lost my own pets a lot over the years, but that's just the way of life."
"I do too, it was so sad.	That must have hurt.  I had a cat that passed away last year.  It was heartbreaking."
"My daughter is such a talented and creative young artist. When she was nominated to be 'Most Artistic' at school, I felt very secure she would win, because she really is amazing!	Yeah! She's a 3rd gronder kid, she has a very unique way of painting."
"She did! I know I'm the parent so can be biased, but it's really so impressive how well she draws, paints, shades....	That's so nice of your daughter! I wish her the best of luck!"
"I was very ready for my first car crash	That's terrible! Did you have your license revoked for that?"
"I had all the paperwork set and ready, I had a blanket cause it was in the winter.	That's really scary! Did you end up buying the car?"
"Last night a fly got into the bedroom and wouldn't stop trying to land on my face	That's so annoying.  What kind was it? I love to kill a fly.  I always have a bug spray bottle on my nightstand.  Is it the one kind fly?"
"It was terrible! Right as I was about to fall asleep the dang thing would land on my nose!	That's the worst. Did you throw it away or try something to stop the fly?"
"I left my dog alone in the house when I went to get the mail. While I was gone she got in the cat box and ate the cat poop, super gross.	That's so gross! Did you find out who did that to your dog?"
"There was nothing to clean.... she definitely swallowed it. I stuck her outside cause I can't even think about dealing with her licking anything right now. Gives me the hebbie jibbes thinking about it.	That must've been disgusting.  Did you clean up the cat poop?"
"I have been practicing my speech for days now.	That's awesome! Did you get nervous about it?"
"I have the perfect delivery and all the talking points drilled down. I will be impressive	I hope so! What subject is you speaking on about?"
"My cat puked up a hairball this morning and I had to clean it up.	Oh no! That's disgusting. I'm sure it was worth it to see your cat's face. How old was it when it did this?"
"She pukes up hairballs every now and then I have some salmon flavored jelly i can feed her, but it happens so infrequently I forget to.	That stinks! Did you have to take her to a vet to get it out of you fur and anything like? I hope it's okay."
"When I left the bathroom in high school once I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe.	That's quite an image. Did anyone ever notice?"
"Yeah it sure was, you know how mean teenagers can be. It's like they have no empathy or think about what if it was them.	I know right, I felt like I was going crazy."
"I got a new type of pizza I wanted to try	Oh? Was it good? Did you eat all night long to get it all?"
"A normal pepperoni but it was terrible!	Oh no, that sucks. I hope it was just the pizza place and not the food you like in general."
"When I was in Costa Rica I was having a lot of trouble with the address of my AirBnB, I was so lost.	That's too funny. I have never had an AirBnB before."
"It was because my Spanish was a bit lacking, it also didn't help that people kept giving me bad directions. I eventually stumbled on it but for a while I was worried I would never make it there.	Oh, that's too bad. What did you do eventually?"
"I was caught off guard when the gun fired for a race I was in	What kind race? Was it at a track?"
"Yeah, I forgot to take my sweat pants off, that's when I realized running isn't for me	emy hope you had fun otherwise running isn't for you"
"I slept with a new girl last week	I bet that was a lot more uncomfortable! Did you guys fight?"
"Not really	That's okay. How did she feel?"
"Not really. We were very high. We were drunk. But now I feel bad for my partner	I was eating dinner with my husband last night and I was so happy	That's so sweet of your husband."
"I whole heatedly agree! It was just so freeing and peaceful	Oh wow that is nice to have. I bet that it was very relaxing for you"
"Someone came to my door with a gun the other day.	What! That's scary! Was it a surprise?"
"I called the police after he robbed me.	That's crazy. I can understand how scared you'd be."
"No, thankfully, I'm fine but scared.	I left my food on the coffee table and my dog ate it.	That's disgusting. Did your dog like to eat it?"
"No, she is fine. I had to find something else to eat though.	Oh wow, that sounds like a disaster. How did she react to the food?"
"I was trying to study for a test one night and my brother was listening to loud music	oh, i know, that's why people call it a noise disturbance"
"I would have totally flipped the circuit breaker if I knew how, but I just asked him to turn it down	I hate it when my brothers music plays too loud!"
"My dog tried to eat her poo	I am sure that was a surprise."
"It probably will.	That sounds like it.  What did you do?"
"I borrowed a book from the library the other day but I left it outside	I hope someone found it! I have lost my keys and I had left my book on the porch!"
"Yes it did, unfortunately	Oh no. Did you see it get lost or damaged in some way?"
"I got something nice the other day, chocolates from my husband	That is a nice gift, how did he get it for you?  Was it his birthday or just for no particular reason.  I would have loved some of it too!"
"It was, and he does that type of thing a lot.	That sounds like he is a nice husband."
"I have problems with the city and their constant tax increase on my property.	Oh, that's not good at all... How long before you get a new city?"
"Maybe A move out of my state would be the answer and a blessing to the high taxes.	That's horrible that's taxes are so out the roof in some places."
"I always do the same, it's not had when they are perfect.	It is."
"My girlfriend, How about you? do you have a partner?	I do too, I have been married 32 years.  We are perfect"
"Wow. Looks like you are doing a good job.	I close on my new house Monday, I didn't think I was going to be able to purchase it but I believed in my mortgage adviser	That's awesome! Congratulations!"
"Surprisingly it's been a painless process. I'm very thankful.	That's good to hear.  I have to do that with my house too.  I'm excited to see where the mortgage rates are right now though I don't know the last rate was."
"I gave my friend some money that she said she would pay back but she hasn't yet.	That can be annoying"
"I really thought  I could count on her, but now I haven't even heard a word from her. Lesson learned I guess.	That's a shame. Hopefully she comes back soon."
"I actually did this, i'm terrible.	That's a bit scary. What happened? Did something bad?"
"I stole my mother's card details to pay for a subscription.	Oh, wow.  Why would you do that?"
"We are going to Six Flags this weekend and my kids want me to ride the roller coaster with them.	I am so jealous! What is that?"
"I'm really hesitant to get on. It's been a long time since I've ridden one and I don't think I'm going to like it at all	It's hard when you love your children, but sometimes you just don't want to ride it with you"
"When i lost my dog of 12 years i was devastated...	It's very hard to lose our pets.  I lost mine about a year ago.  How was it?"
"It is a horrible experience and i hope that i never have to go through it again, how did yours die?	i lost him in a accident 1993... It was a traumatic experience.. He was hit by another car. He didn't survive.. It was a very dark day in our lives.. He was such an amazing dog.."
"I think that in the past i have spent time caring about things that aren't important.	I think we're all just too busy being stressed about things we don't have"
"Money mostly. I just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life.	That's not uncommon. People often spend more money than they realize and then have to worry about paying it all back. I try not think that about myself, but I have to deal with the fact that I'm a grown adult."
"I love thinking back to when I was growing up and the neighborhood we lived in. So many great memories.	That is really cool. What kind?"
"It really is. All the neighbors were so close, we even spent holidays together. It was like a really huge family all living together.	It's funny how those memories come back."
"Do you watch any YouTube at all?	What is it about?"
"What type of content do you like watching?	It's pretty much everything. I have a lot of music channels. I also watch a lot of educational videos and tutorials on YouTube. I also have a lot of gaming channels on my channel."
"The other night I wanted cake when I woke up in the middle of the night	I bet! Was it chocolate? I love chocolate!"
"The worst part was that there was a cake to be eaten! SO I DID! Lmao	Oh my! That was funny. I bet it tasted good too."
"My husband was teaching me how to make a steak. The flame was so warm!	I bet that was hot!"
"It was but I was so sad that I was so scared	That was scary! What happened? Did it burn you?"
"I looked at my childhood photos the other day. I remember alled the fun I used to ahve	That's really cool! What kind are those photos of?"
"I do to. It was much easier then for me	That's really interesting, what was easier for you?"
"I have to rely on my prayers and my belief in a high power to get me through not having a job and no money.	That sucks. What kind of work do you do?"
"I remind myself all the time that it will work out and all will be good again.	I am sure it works out, you must have faith."
"I was very sad when I found out that my neighbors houses were going to be demolished because the city ordered it..	That would be terrible!"
"Nope. They bought them out at city valued tax prices and they have 60 days to find another place to live.	That's good to hear.  What are they going to do then?"
"I feel off my bike the other day. it hurt.	I hope you're feeling okay! Did you break it?"
"A few scraps to my elbows but nothing major, i was just embarrassed.	I hope you are okay now"
"Hey, Any interest in video games?	I do love playing games.  I'm always up for a good one.  I'm not sure about any particular games though.  Do you play any?"
"great, I'm anticipating the release of Fallout:76 how about you?	You sound like a hardcore fan.  I'm more of an Halo and Starcraft fan.  I like the idea though."
"Isn't it annoying when your friends earn more money then you but you work just as hard.	You should just be more grateful for the money.  You're not the one working twice hard to earn it!  I am just being jealous and being jealous.  Why should I be jealous?  I am just happy for the money!  I am just jealous.  I wish I could work just twice as hard as my friends.  I wish I was just more successful."
"Very true. I suppose i just get a bit jealous sometimes.	I know, I know. But I just have so much in common with my friends. I'm not jealous at all."
"I exams went really well this year, How has your year gone?	that sounds great, what did you take"
"Thanks, I am feeling a lot more confident in myself. Remember the year can only get better.	It sounds like everything has worked well. What are some of your plans?"
"Had a good day today, i think i was prepared for everything. how has your day been?	That's good. What made your good day?"
"Well i had a meeting with my boss who gave me a promotion today so i'm over the moon!.	That sounds good. I wish you well."
"I got attacked by a swarm of bees a few months back. Needless to say it hurt.	I am sorry to hear that! What did happen?"
"It was, they we're absolutely furious with me for some reason.	oh wow, that sounds scary. What did you do to protect yourself?"
"Do you remember the old video games you used to play?	I do remember. My older kids would always bring out their old consoles and play."
"The nostalgic moments when you play them again is brilliant. You should try it.	I agree, my brother has an old NES. I have not played it in a while but have just started again."
"Life seems to be going perfect right now, how about you?	That's so rare. I've never been that happy."
"Well that's even better news! i'm feeling hopeful for the both of us.	That's great! I'm good too! I've got a few friends who are going on a vacation to Europe, and I'm really excited for that."
"A girl i went on two dates with wanted a copy of my house key, yikes!	Oh wow, that was awkward. What happened?"
"I don't know, she said she needed a place to hang out between jobs. Stupid me actually gave it to her.	That's pretty gross. I can't blame her for asking for it, but I should be worried I'm not sure I can afford to lose my house."
"hah, thanks. So far so good.	My girlfriend forgot to order the Chinese food yesterday...	That sucks. What a mess. Did you order food?"
"Was annoyed and disappointed so i ended up having a sandwich instead. bad times.	That's a bummer. Did you guys talk it over the phone?"
"My dog puked all over the carpet a few weeks back.	That is pretty gross! Did your dog do it again?"
"Was absolutely disgusting but luckily it did come out easy.	That's not good! Did you have a pet?"
"The other night I found my cat laying dead in the side of the road	that sucks"
"It's tough. I was crying so hard that I had to call my husband to come pick us up	that is so sad. I hope your cat was just really tired."
"My family dragged me along to visit an underground cave recently, I was pretty nervous.	That's really brave of them. What was your first time?"
"It was nice, after i got over the fear from being 23 stories underground.	Yeah, that was scary.  What was the worst part?"
"Hah, no i wasn't thinking of being trapped. It just seemed like more effort to breath for some reason.	Had a job interview the other day.	That's always nerve wreckingly exciting! Did anything unexpected happen?"
"I think it went alright, i was incredibly anxious about it.	That's good that you were nervous. It's always better than to be anxious than anxious and miss the interview"
"Ate my flatmates last chocolate bar earlier.	Yeah thats no fun to have someone steal your food.  How are they taking your food?"
"Nope, i do feel a bit guilty about it but they should have hid it better.	Yeah i know how that goes."
"I went bungie jumping with some friends but I was reluctant to jump.	That's okay! It was a lot of work and it's a lot to be nervous about, so I'm glad you did end to do it!"
"Yes, I don't like heights at all. I did eventually muster the courage to jump, however.	That must have scared you, did you get scared?  Did you do the jump again?"
"I always try to tell my kids they need to be kind and understanding to others, no matter what.	That is a very good point.  I would have told them to just ignore them if they were being a pain."
"They try but it's hard when there are so many bullies at school. I wish other parents would try to do the same.	that is such true.  I have been a teacher at a high school for a few months now and I see bulling and bullying behavior from kids.  They try to push kids that are different.  They need a teacher to be like a parent.  I always try to teach them that kindness goes a long way to solve problems in life.  But sometimes they just do it out of fear or to get attention.  I hope more parents would take the time to do the same"
"Do you know how much work goes into video games?	I do know that there's a lot of work that goes into creating them. It's not just graphics, you know? It's a whole lot of story, music, sound effects. It's a whole lot more than you'd think!"
"I was really impressed as some games it can take over 10 years.	That's a lot. I don't play video games anymore. I'm happy playing with friends or on my own computer games."

"6	I lent my brother 200 dollars so he could buy cryptokitties.	I bet that was fun to watch"

"Everyone wanted to go skydiving for my birthday.	I can see why.  That's such a cool thing."
"I'm pretty sure that my greatest fear is my chute not releasing and plunging through the sky into the ground. Oh well you only live once.	I am sure you felt great about it though. I have had sky diving and I can see how exciting that must be. I'm not sure I would do that again though, but I do know that it's not for everyone and everyone has different experiences."

"Oh for sure. I'm always a sucker for nostalgia.	I agree, I like going back and reminiscing about the past. I hope we go back there again soon!"

One night during college I got a phone call in the middle of the night that one of my best friends had been killed in a car wreck.	oh my god, that is terrible.  What happened?"
"Absolutely. It was really the first time I had lost someone close to me, family or friend.	Oh my goodness, that is so sad. I'm so sorry you went through that."
"My birthday was a few days ago, I can't believe my wife had the wait staff sing to me.	That's so cool. Did you like the song?"
"Hah, its good entertainment, but i don't exactly enjoy being in the spotlight. Thanks!	That sounds awesome! I have had that happen too. I just hope you didn't have too embarrassing of yourself."

"Yesterday my car ran out of oil and broke down. I could not believe I would let such a thing happen!	that's awful"
"The engine is totally shot, its not designed to run without any. So now I have to go shopping for a new car.	I'm sorry to you, but, no, you didn't. You just need a new set of oil, and you can get that."
"The new car is more expensive than a new engine. But I can't justify such a costly repair on my car.	I'm sorry to say, but you might be better off just selling it to someone else. It might make you a little richer in the long run."
"It does drops a lot after a repair like that. I might as well invest that money into something new.	I was in a big party city and the street was crowded with people. As I was walking my foot got tangled up on something and I went face first into a huge flower bed.	Oh my goodness!  Was it painful?"
"It hurt my pride more than it hurt my face.	that's awful! did it hurt you?"

"Literally anytime I order something online and I get the tracking I immediately start checking it. I am so impatient waiting on stuff to come.	I can imagine!  Sometimes I order things too quickly, but other people I order take forever.  I wish I had more time to wait!"
"Yes. Every single time. I know better. But I just cant help myself but to check over and over	Yeah, that happens to the best of people too lol"
"That is true.	My dog died of old age last year and I miss her	I'm sorry. That must have been tough."

"I have a friend with loaded parents. She doesn't work but has anything she wants anytime she wants.	I am not jealous of loaded parents, they must be nice people. I don't want any part of that."
"Mine aren't poor but they aren't loaded. They struggle. Same for me. I work my butt of for what I have.	That is tough. I hope you and your friend can understand each other a little bit. That would make a lot of difference"
"Same. I do wish I had a little bit more money to do a few more things though.	I feel you, I work hard to provide for my family and sometimes I feel like I can do more with what they have than I can do for what I have"

"She was 12.  It was old age but it was so hard because I had had her for years.	That's so hard. I have a dog too. She is 10 years old and she passed away a month ago. I miss having a dog. They make life feel short."

"I have an amazing husband who is always there for me no matter what	that sounds great. What is he like?  Is he kind?"
"He was my sisters, husbands roomate in college and he came down for their wedding and we met there.  I can't imagine my life without him	That sounds so nice! I'm glad to hear."
"One time I went to my friends 16th birthday party.  When I was walking in her house I ran smack into their glass door.  It was so clean that I didn't see it.	That's crazy! Did you guys laugh about it afterwards though? I always do the opposite of what I'm told to, and I'm pretty sure your friend did the opposite of what I told."
"LOL..just my pride.  I was mortified and the funny part is that later on I won the door prize	I would never go to someone home without knowing if it's locked or not."

"What types of situations? And yeah it could have been worse but I'm glad I'm out of it.	That's terrible.  How did it end?"
"Skydiving taught me how to let go and stop trying to fix everything	I know that feeling. It was so scary at first, but then you started to feel at peace with it."
"Yeah the hardest part for me was just realizing that I wouldn't be in control, but it was very natural in the end	That was my experience as a skydiving instructor.  I was scared, but once I realized how it all worked, I was in charge."
"It's like something you have to figure out with your heart, kind of like how caterpillars have to stop trying to do a bunch of work so they can become butterflies	I ended up watching all the Robin William movies I could think of last weekend.	I love his work! I am a huge actor myself. I loved watching his work too."
"I don't know if there is one of my favorites, but it sure was a lot of good memories.	That's pretty cool. Which were your favorites of his movies?"
"I was in a rush this morning and didn't realize I had put on two different colored sox.	That would have looked like you put two reds on.  Did you get home okay?"

"This one time my pants fell down in public, but I was really tired so I didn't realize	Yeah, I had that happen. What did you do next?"

"I decided not to take the job in the end, I guess I just wanted to know I could get it	That can happen to anyone."

"I have been working on at the track to get my sprint times faster1	That's really cool! What kind track are that for?"
"No, just me, but my 100 yard dash is so so slow, I can't even get lower than 6 seconds.	That's great you've been working on it!"
"I think I'm just really bad, maybe I will always be slow.	Yeah, it's not like I'd expect from a 50-year-old dude. But I guess that's the point right? Age?"
"Drinking a gallon of milk everyday makes me feel like an absolute madman in the gym who's gonna take over the world	That would be a lot!"
"That's not the point, gotta do it RAW	That's so weird, what is it about the gallon milk? I love it myself"
"I had this juicy pump at the gym from doing some benching and it felt too easy	That must have felt easy. Did anything happen afterwards?  Did you get in trouble for it?  Did you get in trouble?"
"My pecs were poppin	I've never done that exercise before, what muscle do it target?"
"I was hurrying around the house and wasn't paying attention fully, I ending up hitting my toe on my dogs toys.	I am sure that was just an unfortunate accident!"

"I got mad because I was too full to finish my plate at the buffet	I know how that feels."
"Chinese, but no I decided not to, don't think would allow it	its funny how sometimes we can't control what happens to our bodies and sometimes we have no control at all!"
"I spent 20 dollars on a piece of cheese cake.	I love the taste! How is your taste buds right now?"
"I thought it would blow my mind but it was dry and really disappointing. Talk about a let down.	That's a waste of good money, though."
"I have been working on my bench press for 6 months, I know I can get to bench 400 pounds.	That sounds amazing.  What's bench press about?  I haven't had the chance to work out much myself.  I've been a bit out of the gym."
"Steak and Maximum effort. I also drink lots of water, I'm on the next level like Arnold.	I am glad you have been working on your fitness goals."
"Paranormal activity is the sCaRiEsT movie of horror movies	You hate scary movies!"

"It's tough to talk to my parents, but I try to talk about things we don't disagree on	Yeah, family is tough. What are they like?  Do you like them or not so well?"
"Anything political or religious really, or relationships	I understand, I have had issues talking to my parents about certain issues."
"I had my dog for 13 years before she passed away last year from cancer. It was devastating!	Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear that. My dog passed away last summer. I know how much you care for your dog, and I'm sure you'll always cherish the memories of your time with your furry best friend."
"Probably not for a while. She was a great companion, but I don't think my heart is ready to bring in a new dog quite yet.	that sounds really tough. I hope you get to bring another dog soon."
"I was horribly wronged by someone I thought I could trust. The feeling was devastating, and I've always struggled with forgiveness.	That's terrible, what happened?  How long have they been there?  How bad are they?"
"They were dishonest and physically cruel. We have gone our separate ways, but I truly hope they can learn to treat others better.	That sucks.  Did you ever forgive them?"
"Last month I came home from work and noticed my cat wasn't feeling well, so I rushed her to the vet. I had to put her down.	That's so sad. I'm sorry."
"I know, I just really miss her. Poor cancer kitty. I loved her so much.	That sucks! I'm sorry for losing my pet, but I know she was doing the best she was. I have lost 3 so it doesn't matter.  I hope she was doing something fun and having fun in her last few days."
"MY roommate got a new cat last week, and we finally let them meet today. I was so nervous and worried about it.	That must have been scary. Did it go well?"
"It went okay. My cat bopped him a little and growled a lot but no real swipes. So better than expected I guess.	That must've been scary. I hope your cat was fine too. How did they meet his roommate cat first of all."
"When I was pregnant with my first born, it was considered a high risk pregnancy. It made me very worried and anxious throughout.	its good that its over now. how did it turn out?"
"I had to have emergency surgery in the end, but being able to hold my healthy baby was the greatest blessing I could have asked for.	That is amazing you are so lucky"
"I'm so happy summer classes are officially over and I'll be able to relax for a week!	It can't be long until fall classes then.  I am so happy summer is finally coming to an end."
"I'm not even sure what to do with all this time! I guess I should relax or have some leisure time, but everything in me says to try and be productive even on break. It's that school mentality.	That's great you get the summer off."
"My sister came to visit from out of state. It was the first time we've seen her in nearly a decade!	That sounds great. Where is she from out of state of?"
"Yes she lives on the other side of the country. We had a nice dinner, but my boyfriend is a loud chewer and a sloppy eater. It was quite embarrassing!	I am sorry to hear.  I can imagine it would be embarrassing.  Did they like eachother?  Did he make an effort to be quiet?  Did he eat a little?"
"I just bought a new dress and I can't wait to wear it this weekend.	It's always so much fun!"
"I'm going to wear it to a party. Everyone will have their eyes on me!	I hope everyone has their eyes in you."
"A few months ago I could barely walk up a flight of stairs without having to catch my breath, but I bit the bullet and have been training.	that makes sense"
"Wonderful! It's definitely hard work, but I continue on, even on the days I don't want to. Today I discovered I can now comfortably run an uphill mile and I feel very confident!	That's great! You're an inspiration to me! Keep it up!"
"My boss told me about a potential job opportunity and I've been waiting to hear if it's going to happen	It is good that you are prepared."
"A little bit. I am mostly excited about it though	That is good! What kind is it?"
"I was very prepared for my final exam. It was so easy.	That's good. Did you pass?"
"If I'm being honest, I made an answer key from the quizzes we took this semester. As they say, work smart, not hard.	That's great! I'm glad you prepared well. I'm sure you got an easy time in it.  What subject is your exam in?"
"My cousin was swinging recklessly on my hammock and ended up breaking it!	I bet that hurt! Did you guys break anything?"
"I was very upset, especially considering how long it took me to get it set up. I loved laying in my peaceful hammock to read.	That sucks! Did you get to buy it back?"
"I received a phone call the other day from a friend I hadn't heard from in ages.	Oh no. What did they want? I hate to call and talk."
"We reminisced about old times. It was very nice, indeed. It was nice hearing from him, especially during some rough times!	I've been missing my friends too, and I'm glad they called."
"I have a weekend of nothing but relaxation planned for this weekend.	That's cool. What are you doing for relaxation?"
"I have some leftover roast in the fridge so I don't even have to leave the house. I'm going to watch a lot of netflix and MAYBE do a little laundry.	I love when people talk like that."
"I keep having these dreams that I am out in public and somehow my clothes disappear. It's awful.	That's the worst. What do people normally do then? Do people freak out?"
"I hate those dreams, I feel anything but free. They're really uncomfortable and make me nothing but a ball of negative emotions like anxiety as I spend the majority of the dream trying to find clothes and get away from people.	That is awful."
"One of my friends recently bought a house. I really wish I could afford a house.	I know the struggles we face in life.  I am sure that one day you will be a successful homeowner."
"I'm starting to feel like I will never be able to afford a house. They're just so expensive. And the market has been going up here about 5% a year for the past 10 years.	I know right, I wish I had a friend like you, I am so jealous."
"I ended up staying at home for the holidays	I did that last year. It's so nice, but it's hard to let go of family."
"No all my family lives out of state. I didn't feel like traveling, but I just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark.	that sounds so nice of you."
"I bumped into a friend from middle school. We chatted for a while	That is awesome! What happened?"
"Before 9th grade. I moved away that summer. Seeing her brought back a lot of good memories	Oh yeah? What year was that?"
"I had a doctors appointment at 9 am and they kept me waiting for almost 2 hours.	Oh, that's so frustrating. I would have been so grumpy about that."
"It was terrible I ended being late for work because of their horrible service.	I understand how you can get so upset.  I had waited for my doctor for over an hour last time and was so upset when I got there that I ended up going home early to take care of things at home and get ready."
"The past few months have been terribly rough, but I think I can say that they have made me stronger.	oh no i'm sorry to hear that"
"Thank you. I hope that I can move forward and at least learn from these hardships.	It's not always nice, but it's not like you have anything better to do, right."
"I really hate when people can't hold themselves accountable for their own actions and decisions.	I agree. I think people should always take responsibility for their own lives and decisions."
"Absolutely. Yet, these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you, even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.	I can't agree with that. People should always be responsible with the consequences. If you do wrong, you do it yourself. If you do wrong and can't handle the guilt, it's better to just move on. It doesn't have anything to do with your worth as a person. It's about your integrity. You need integrity. I don't know why I even said this, because I don't know how you do things. But I know I would do the same. You"
"I received a very odd message today. It came from a person who I blocked online, but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group.	I hope it didnnt say ""hey"" or ""i saw your post"" or any of those.  Was it mean-spirting?"
"They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish, and it makes me very anxious.	That's terrible. How long ago was this?"
"I'm going rock climbing with some friends!	Oh that's really cool!  I love climbing!"
"I have done some climbing indoors for practice, but never done a big climb out doors, so who know how it will go.	Yeah, that sounds cool.  I've never been rock climbing, but my friends have been for years and it's always a blast with friends"
"I keep having these really weird nightmares at night.	That is terrible! What kind? Are you having them because of your sleep?"
"I'm usually in a big city that I'm familiar with, and roam around in the dream until I get stalked, jumped, and sometimes very hurt.	That is awful."
"Today I was quite impressed with my endurance during my work out. A few months ago, I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath.	That's great! What kind workout do you like?"
"I sure have, but it's such hard work. I make sure to work out, even on the days that I don't want to. It's definitely taken a lot of will power.	That's good to have the discipline and motivation to stay committed to it though. You must believe in your own hard work!"
"I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.	That's great! What did your baby name be?"
"It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty, but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.	That's great you had that experience."
"I just learned my first trick in ice skating, a triple spin twirl kick front flip.	That's pretty cool! I love ice skating too."
"I never thought I would have the balance to perform such a feat. I think I can no qualify for the Olympics.	I am happy for you. You have worked hard."
"I just started college again, and while I'm doing great in school, it has lead me to feel very lonely with a lack of social life.	it's normal."
"That sound like a good idea if they weren't online classes. Next semester I have a few on campus courses, so I'm hoping I'll be able to make at least one new friend.	Yeah, online classes can make it hard."
"This upcoming semester will be my first time taking 5 classes at once. I'm pretty worried that I may have taken on too much.	that's cool, i took 5 classes at once and passed. are they in different classes of each subject? or the same subject"
"I'm not sure. The more I think about it, the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby, so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.	Yeah, it's a lot to juggle right now. I hope you'll be okay with it"
"I adore my girlfriend. I am getting very serious about not leaving her side.	That sounds awesome.  What kind of girlfriend is that?"
"Thank you. Do you have a romantic interest?	I have no romantic feelings for other people. I have a girlfriend of my choice that I love for life"
"Summer in the South calls for many unwanted visitors of the insect type!	I am from Canada, but I live near Florida, and it gets pretty bad there in August."
"Mosquitoes, and those dreadful flying ants. They're everywhere!	That's right! They're a real nuisance. I've had to take out bug sprays every few days."
"Lately I've felt proud of my success as a newly single mother. It gets lonely sometimes, but I can honestly say I've been doing everything I can and more.	Yeah, single mom life is tough sometimes, but at the same time it's a chance to grow up my kids and teach them the importance of taking care of others.  I'm proud of myself"
"Thank you! I definitely have a drive to feel strong for them. I hope some day they can realize my efforts.	Yeah, you guys need to work on your self esteem."
"I have a plethora of amazing friends. One of mine recently drove me from Georgia to South Florida	ohhh! That is nice of them to do."
"It is an 8 hour drive! Florida is a very long state	It sounds like a long drive! I love going on road trips with friends."
"I recently totaled my car. There were no injuries but I feel absolutely terrible	I am sorry.  Did you have insurance?"
"It was very wet and I took a turn at too high of a speed.	I'm sorry. Were you driving?  Did you hit another vehicle?"
"My mom and I haven't always had the best relationship. Recently I've had to tell myself to let her in more. It's been challenging.	I'm sure. Sometimes mothers just want what's best for their kids. I've heard that."
"Thank you. I know that, even though it's challenging, I need to be patient in order to improve our relationship.	That's very kind of you to say. It really is. I hope that it works out for us."
"I have had the toughest time getting my pet rat to get along with others. She's always been very aggressive!	That can be frustrating! What's your strategy? Is she getting bullied by another rat? Or is she just being too fey to get along with others rats around her age and age?"
"She's never bitten anyone, thankfully, but she gets crazy with other rats. To my surprise though, I've recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!	That sounds so cute! What kind is it, I think it's a rat?"
"This past month, I was able to visit Six Flags!	I am a big fan of Six Flags! What is your favorite ride?"
"It was amazing. The last time I was at an amusement park had to have been over a decade ago!	I haven't been there since I moved. I haven't been to an amusement park in a while! I'm jealous!"
"The other day I noticed my pet has a growth on her lower belly. I fear it may be a tumor.	That's awful! What is it?"
"She's a rat, so her body is very frail. I'm sad that she likely will not make it. She's been with me through thick and thin.	Yeah that's terrible.  I hope she makes a full recovery and stays healthy."
"I let the girl of my dreams slip away. Now I am alone.	I am so heartbroken right about you.  What happened?"
"I hope so. I think that time heals all wounds.	What happened?"
"I recently went to the pool and lost my suit. My trunks were in the water without me!	That's a bummer. Was it ruined? I hate when that happens to my suit."
"I was not, unfortunately. People saw everything!	That stinks. Did you try to get a replacement suit?"
"I let a romantic interest slip through my fingers. She's now with somebody that I despise	That's terrible! What happened?"
"I think so. I have plenty of time and life goes	That sucks.  I hope you're able to move on."
"I feel great right now. I have a new album coming out and it feels liberating to be done!	That's awesome! Congratulations on the album!"
"I am very excited. It is almost an hour and a half long	Oh wow! What kind album is it about?"
"I can't wait to travel. I am going to Madagascar soon!	Oh wow! That's a great destination! Where are you going?"
"I have! I actually grew up in Saudi Arabia	That's really cool! I have a cousin who's going to be a tour guide for a while."
"The world is savage. I believe that the right individuals can take us to a better place in the future	That sounds scary.  I don't like guns.  I think everyone has a dark side.  I hope everyone tries hard to do the good."
"I think so too. There are some kind and great people in the world	I agree with you."
"I went walking in the woods one night. It was pretty scary out there	That's so scary! What was there that scared you?"
"No, everything was fine, but it was a chilling experience	That sounds creepy. Did anything happen?  Was there any signs?"
"I caught my dog trying to eat my nephew's dirty diaper that my brother left on the couch	That's a little gross. Did you scold him?"
"It was really gross. I had to keep my dog from licking my face for a long time after that.	I bet that dog thought that you loved him.  I'm sure that dog will never do that to you again."
"I recently remembered a sweet memory of my aunt who recently passed away.	It's a sad thing that happens to us. It's great that you remembered her."
"She would give hundreds of dollars of school supplies to kids in need each year.	That must've been very sad for you.  Did she have any special talents?"
"She did! I fill stockings around the holidays and go around on Christmas giving them out to people who have to work. :)	Oh, wow. That's amazing. I bet the people really appreciated the effort. I don't do much holiday cheer. I'm not sure I can afford to."
"My daughter and her family are coming this Thanksgiving. I'm already preparing for their visit.	It is the holidays, right around the time of year.  It's going to be a fun trip!"
"Not too much, just really exciting. I'm planning everything even though it's months away, even the menu.	Yeah, that's great!  What are they coming from?"
"My mother in law was recently placed in hospice and is not expected to live much longer.	I'm sorry to hear that."
"She's 87, so she has lived a long life, but she has Alzheimers, and it's really sad to watch her lose her mind.	Wow, that's really tough. I'm sure she's a wonderful person, though, and I'm sorry for having to deal with it."
"That's a great way of looking at it. I should try to keep a positive attitude towards it.	I hope she's okay and happy."
"I was driving home from out of town really late one night and was exhausted	That's so annoying. Did you drive on? I don't think that's a thing these day."
"I did get home safe but it was scary because the roads were two lane and lots of 18-wheelers were heading in the opposite direction. I kept thinking I would swerve into their lane and collide into them	That's a good thing that was driving on the right lane."
"I've been trying to be extra supportive towards my husband.	That sounds very kind of you. I bet he appreciates you for that!"
"Yes - so true. His mom is dying, and he is working long hours on top of it. I feel really bad for him.	I bet he will appreciate you when he's not busy"
"My friend who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit. She married a very wealthy man and I was a bit envious	That's interesting. I don't think I've ever met a friend who married someone who's that wealthy, so I would have expected you to be a little jealous."
"She drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world. I wish that were me some days.	I agree, I feel like I am stuck."
"I was at a get together recently and a friend's husband was flirting with me.	I hate when that happens"
"I didn't know what to say to her, and was afraid she wouldn't believe me and it would cause her to be angry at me. It's a bad situation.	That is bad. What happened after?"
"When I was in second grade, I wet my pants in the middle of class.	Oh that's terrible. Was anyone able to help you?"
"I know! I was super afraid of my teacher, and was scared to ask her to go to the bathroom.	I had that same experience. I was so afraid I would be ridiculously in front of the class"
"She was really mean and always yelling! I didn't want her to yell at me. I'm much older and wiser now!	I want to trick my butler into thinking he won the lottery. I've taped the local new's winning lottery numbers and I'm going to buy a ticket with the same numbers and give it to my butler	That's so cool! What's the prize if you get lucky enough?"
"I'm not sure he likes being the target of pranks, but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin	I love how people love to play games like that.  It's like they enjoy the feeling of being the target of a joke."
"My friend just took her kids to Disneyland and I feel a little bad about it.	That's great! Did you go?"
"I'd been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years. I'm happy for her- just wish it could have been me.	I understand that. Sometimes people are busy doing their own thing and forget about others who want to do things with their own kids"
"I won a trip to Washington D.C. a few years ago	I love Washington D. What do you do in D.C?"
"I had a blast. I met people from all over the country, visited many historical sites, and learned a lot about how government works	I wish you could of been here, it's a great city. What was the best thing about winning?"
"I'm looking forward to my best friend's surprise birthday party next week!	I do love surprises."
"I'm really happy about it- she's a great friend and she's turning 40, so it's a big one!	Yeah! I wish I had some friends like that."
"About 20 friends, surprising her at her favorite bar after work.	My 25th high school reunion is coming up and I'm excited.	That's really cool.  How many friends do you have?"
"Honestly? There was this girl who really treated me poorly - I can't wait for her to see how successful I have been!	That sucks. What happened?"
"A hurricane hit my city. The first night I thought the wind was going to tear the roof off the house	Oh no!  That's terrible!  Did the people in your city do okay in that situation?"
"It was my third. Luckily we didn't lose power for more than a few hours	That's crazy. I hope everyone in the affected area is safe."
"It damaged the roof and the fence. We lost power for six days during the first hurricane I experienced	I am sure that must have been scary!  Did you all lose water?"
"I am loyal to my principles, that is why I do not eat meat, because I love life	i too, its very hard to go back"
"If I already have 10 years of vegetarian	That is very true, it is good you are committed to your beliefs, it shows a lot"
"I healthy physically and spiritually	My daughter recently broke curfew by three hours!	That's not bad. What time was she out? Did she get a warning?"
"I was super angry, yes! I ended up grounding her for three weeks- one week for each hour she was late.	that sucks.  Did you have her home alone?"
"I have a certification exam coming up and I think I'll do well.	That's great! What kind certification is it?"
"I think so- I've studied quite a bit with my husband and others.	Yeah that's awesome. I bet you will do very good."
"Education- teaching license certification	Hello ... I confess that when I see my daughter's eyes, my heart suffers.	That sucks.  What's wrong?"
"They are sick	That's nice, what is she sick?"
"Relax, they are things that happen	My new manager gave me a pay-rise!	that would be a good surprise.  What position is your manager?"
"I feel very grateful that he has been so generous.	That's great!  What are you doing now?"
"My partner left me the other day.	I'm sorry. What happened? Did you fight about something specific?"
"That's fine, its not your problem. i just feel very lonely right now.	I understand how you feel. I feel the same way when my partner left. I hope things work themselves out."
"I just moved to a new city and I don't know anyone	I hate moving cities, but it's a great time to start over."
"Yeah, it's hard though. I hate to go out by myself. It's hard for me to meet new people	That is normal to move to a new city, it takes time.  You might want to go to the park, meet people walking by, and then go out.  It will get better with time"
"I took my final exams a few weeks ago and I was sure I had done well, but I failed.	That is terrible. Why? What happened?"
"I don't know what happened. I studied and passed everything else. Now I have to retake the class and I'm upset	That's terrible. What class were you taking? Did anyone tell you why?"
"My sister kept playing a few seconds of a song over and over again on her laptop last night. Now it's stuck in my head.	Yeah, that happens a lot!"
"It drives me bonkers when she does that	I hate when someone does that."
"I saw these 4-color Bic pens in the store the other day. I remember when I was young and getting one was like Christmas morning!	That's awesome. I bet you are very happy."
"Yes! My mom used to always get me one each year before school started. Those were the coolest pens in the world!	I agree they are great pens now, they have improved a whole lot over time"
"I'm optimistic that my house is going to sell soon.	That would certainly be great."
"Only a week- and 17 people have seen it already, so I'm feeling good about it selling quickly!	That sounds good! Are there any more buyers coming next weekend?"
"My best friend was going to travel from Wisconsin to see my this summer, but she ended up not being able to come.	I'm sorry! Did you end up seeing her then?"
"Nothing- I still haven't seen her. I felt pretty let down - but hopefully I can make the trip to see her soon.	That sucks.  I hope everything works out for her."
"My sister threw up the other day and made a huge mess.	It was a mess"
"Fortunately no- she cleaned it up. But she had just had spaghetti and it was floating in it. It was so gross!	Yeah that happens sometimes, especially if it was a long pasta and she was eating it while she was still in it."
"I was livid when I went to work the other day and saw my car was broken in to	Oh my. What happened?"
"I heard it was happening in other areas but didn't expect it here because we live in a nice neighborhood. So frustrating	That must've been scary! Did you find any money or anything?"
"Every year when the kids go back to school, it brings back so many memories of when my kids were going to school.	It really does make you feel so young again! I'm so ready to be back in high school right now.  I love the summer break."
"I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly	I know exactly what you are talking about. I have two kids and I feel like I've only really started to understand what school life has to be like when my kids are 20 and I'm 40."
"So everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints, and I ate the whole thing for breakfast.	I bet that sounds really good!"
"LOL, I swear it was like I sat down and they were gone!  Probably gave myself diabetes. So not going to be able to eat the rest of the day!	That's funny. I bet you felt guilty afterwards."
"Sigh, I have no self control, definatley need a veggie or two today now! Probably should knix those form the pantry	My father passed away in November, it's made me feel empty ever since.	That's awful. I'm sorry to hear about your loss."
"I didn't think it would hit me hard. I felt like I was prepared.	That's sad. Did he leave anything to you to remember him?"
"I surprised my girlfriend with Chik-Fil-A breakfast this morning when she got off work.	that sounds nice"
"She works nights, and had no idea I was coming. I knew she had a bad night so I wanted to do something nice for her.	that's sweet of you"
"I recently was laid off from my job. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm trying to stay positive that I will soon.	I have been through it too.  It's tough, but you have nothing to be ashamed about for that."
"I keep looking and applying, but still here I sit. I know it will happen when the right one comes along though	I know right, it can be hard to let that happen though"
"I lost the book that my friend let me borrow. I feel so embarrassed.	That happens. Did you borrow it recently?  I lost mine last year.  I had to replace it."
"I'm trying to find a new one, but this one was rare and hard to find.	That's not good at all! Do you feel like you can borrow from another?"
"My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.	That is pretty cool that they didn't do that.  Did they have to work out of some reason or was just forgot?"
"I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.	That can be frustrating when that doesn't work out the way you hoped.  I've been married long enough to learn to not expect anything from my siblings or my parents, so I try to be more understanding."
"The older I get, the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling I have. It is nice to just enjoy being alive.	That sounds wonderful. I used to be that way too."
"Those examples are definitely the simple pleasures of life. It makes me want to go outside and listen to the birds and smell the flowers.	That's awesome, keep enjoying life and all the simple pleasures"
"I went swimming the other day and when I jump into the water and came back up, my bathing suit top was pulled over my breast and I was wandering why everyone was staring at me.	Oh my."
"Yes I did realize fairly fast why everyone was staring. I looked down and seen my breast exposed.	That's disgusting, did you try anything?"
"I think my cat likes my new girlfriend more than he likes me now.	Oh wow! What kind cat is he?"
"Yea he loves to sit on my lap while i work, but prefers her side of the bed now when he sleeps.	Yeah cats love to be on their owners' lap."
"My grandfather passed away not too long ago, i received a bunch of items he left for me.	I bet that must have brought back memories."
"Some interesting antiques, grandfather clocks, and a lot of items related to his work for the house of representatives. Interesting stuff	I bet that was a fun day. Did you get to keep any?"
"I had to let my dad borrow my car the other day. His truck is in the shop.	That was very kind of your part."
"Yeah it has. And, he took good care of my car, as always.	That's really kind of you. I appreciate that. My car is really old and it was so needed!"
"I ca not believe what happened the other night at my friends house, I'll never show my face again.	Oh, what happened? Did your friends do anything weird or creepy to scare or fright you away from them?"
"Sure, I fell asleep on the chair and had a dream, in my dream I went to the restroom, so yeah, I peed right there in their chair.	I hope you had a good dream."
"Yes, it was not fun, but good to know I am not the only one.	I enjoy helping the wildlife in my area where I live. I give them a helping hand. I give them water, birdseed, my left over food. The animals love watermelon and cantaloupe.	That sounds nice! What kind animals do you have there?"
"I just have the small non dangerous type of wildlife that I like to help Birds, rabbits, squirrels and such. No big bad bears!	That sounds wonderful! I love helping the animals too, especially the ones that are in need of food."
"We got a new puppy! We took him in from our father in law.	That's so sweet! What's his breed and name?"
"Its a long hair chihuahua and a short hair chihuahua. He has the most adorable under bite!	Wow! That's a really cute breed. I have two chihuahuawhose puppies I've had. My first one was a little girl and my first male one is a big ol boy named Max. He's 10 years young and he's 25 pounds!"
"I found out my wife was having an affair, the worst part is i knew the guy and welcomed him in my home and was kind to him.	That's terrible."
"I'm learning to live my live without her, it's tough. Some honesty would have made the way it ended much better. Thanks for the kind words.	That was quite a tough situation.  I hope everything works out for you."
"I went on a soda fast for two days so that I could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking. I am addicted to soda so it was hard. I made it though and I was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days.	That's great. I bet he was very proud."
"Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.	Yeah that sounds terrible"
"No, they suck!!	I recently had an argument with a friend. Even though I talked ot her about it and let her know how I felt, my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband. She thought I was being two faced, which lead to a long discussion. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.	Yeah that's terrible.  Did you guys have to talk about it afterwards?"
"Yeah, I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter, even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..	Yeah, I just feel bad that I set a bad example for her."
"That's good advice. Thanks!	I found huge box full of my old cd's recently, found a ton of old pc games i used to play, reminded me of a simpler time!	Yeah, that's the best part about growing older - looking back. It's nice to have that perspective."
"I did, i played a few sessions of age of empires and i plan to play some command and conquer red alert tonight before bed, still great games.	I know what you are thinking...I hate being told I played an old computer! But I just found those old games and I am happy to go back to my childhood gaming days."
"I got turned down for a job I really wanted.	That's terrible. Did you ask why they didn't choose you for the job?"
"Thanks.  But yes, I was really dejected.  I thought I'd interviewed well and had a good enough resume.	That's terrible. Did you ask for feedback on why they rejected you?  That is the only way to get to know why. I hope they told something that makes you realize why they rejected you."
"When my wife left me, i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest, I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic	I am sorry for leaving."
"Well, Like the saying goes, get busy living or get busy dying. I'm not sure if i'll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!	I understand how people feel. It's hard when things go through your head like this. I'm glad you have been able to start a positive journey now. That's a good start. You're on the path to happiness and that's all you really need. I'm sure you'll be happy. I just wish people like you more often.  It's hard to say, but I just wish they'd stop being so selfish and self-centered."
"I bought a 20 foot boat. I believe it will be able to handle the large lake that I will be taking it on.	That's really exciting. I've never been one for boats. What kind is it?"
"It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions.	ali, what's that boat for?"
"It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy.	It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions. It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy.<|eot_id|>"
"We should have a lot of fun this summer with it! Makes up for all the hard work saving up for it.	That is great news about it being your first time!"
"I like like loaning money to friends. It can ruin friendships and sometimes doesn't get paid back.	I do too, I just make it up as soon."
"Yeah, I meant don't like, sorry. I recently lent some to my friend with no expectation of getting it back because of her hard situation. I actually got it back.	that makes you a good friend. i hope your relationship stays strong"
"Last summer, my dog went missing. We looked for him everywhere and called all of our neighbors. No one had seen him.	That sucks!  I lost my dog last year and found out it's a dog show. I found the most beautiful dog!"
"After a week of looking for him and checking the shelters, a neighbor found his body under her house. He had gotten under there and couldn't find a way out. I was so heart broken and so were my daughters.	I'm sorry to say that, that is terrible. What happened to the dog?"
"I try to skateboard with my kids everyday. They love it, and it makes me feel young again.	That's awesome! I skateboard with my son and daughter all the time!"
"It can be scary some times, but its worth it.	That's awesome!"
"My daughters 6th birthday was recently, unfortunately her mothers side of the family didn't show up, even though they all rsvp'd	That's unfortunate, what happened? Did they just forget to show up or were they having financial troubles and couldn't make it happen"
"Hah yea, she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her. They grow up fast.	That is so sad, I hope they come to visit you soon"
"The other week, a friend of mine told me there was an opening where he worked and to get him a resume. I took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else.	That sucks. I hope you can get a job soon."
"It would have been nice. Less pay, but I would have had to work less. Oh well, guess I'll try harder next time.	Oh well, I'm sure you will try harder next time. I'm sure you are very capable and you'll do well"
"The other day I was running late. So, I jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house.	Oh wow, I hope no accidents happened! What did you wear to get out the door?"
"I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains. I apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes.	I can imagine you would have felt embarrassed about that. Did it ruin it?"
"I have MS, and sometimes I have bowl problems.	I never knew that existed.  Is it common?"
"No, I've tried science remedies. I like those kinds better.	oh wow thats interesting"
"My son got a remote control car for his birthday. Its really cool.	It's cool to have a remote control, I've always wanted one. What kind car is it? I've seen them. They're really cool."
"No, his grandpa did. But, after he went to bed, I went outside and played with it for a while.	I'm glad he's older enough to appreciate it! What car does he like?"
"Someone broke into my car the other day, but they didnt steal anything.	I have had that problem before. It's so annoying."
"I know! I feel both violated and kind of sad because I have nothing in my car worth stealing.	That sucks.  What happened to your keys?"
"There was an elderly lady at my church who was blind and could not hear well so you had to talk really loud for her to hear you. She was very faithful about coming to church so our preacher picked her up and took her home for every service. When she needed help, we took turns helping her.	It sounds like she was in a lot of need. I'm glad they were able to provide her with some support."
"When I saw that she needed help, I always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker. I liked helping her. She recently passed away and I miss her.	That's really kind of you. Did she have any kids?"
"Yes, she loved everyone she met. She would say she couldn't remember everyone's names, but she loved them anyway.	I took my son to kindergarten the other day. He loves it so far!	It must have made you happy to see him.  I had him at that for the first 3.4 years."
"You bet! He made a girlfriend on the bus by talking about Zelda.	oh wow that's awesome."
"Lately, my family and I have been very blessed. We are all happy and healthy. All of our major bills have already been paid for the month, and we have been going to a three week long revival at a local church.	That's really nice, what kind church is it?"
"We have just been trusting in the Lord.	That sounds like you are very happy!  How did you and the rest of the family feel when it first happened?"
"Thank you.	I was looking at some old pictures of my kids' first day of school from 4 years ago.	That's really cool. What did they look like back in the day?"
"It just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes.  My youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in 7th grade.	Oh, wow, that's nice, you guys must be very lucky to be in the same school. How are you managing the different ages and the grades?"
"And tons of pics!  I try to take pictures of everything.	I couldn't believe Aretha Franklin passed away last week.	I know right. She was so talented. I hope her legacy lives. I was sad."
"Sometimes you think people will be around forever, their aura is just so...legendary.	What a legend. I am so going to listen to her album ""Respect"" on repeat."
"I just finished eating dinner.  We had red beans and rice and with sausage.  I'm as full as a tick!	Oh that sounds pretty delicious. I love it when you eat and then you eat again."
"I had to soak them for 3 hours.  I think that's what makes that meal so satisfying - the wait!	That's true. The waiting part is a lot of fun."
"I do the same thing!	Found out some bad news today about my kids custody case.	That's terrible. What happened?"
"Yeah, it really is. Due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father.	That's terrible.  Did the father of the kids lose custody?"
"I think I aced my supervisor exam!	That's awesome. What kind exam is it for?"
"I should know something by tomorrow morning.  Hopefully they tell me right away.	That's great. What was your supervisor exam about?"
"I have all my kids' things ready for the first day of school tomorrow!	Oh that's so exciting! What grade are you sending them off for?  Do you have twins?"
"I think I am.  I tried to do as much in advance as I could.	Oh wow. That is so nice of you. I don't know if I am ready for school tomorrow. I don't like school that early.  I like to wait."
"My daughter is in 8th grade and just started school a little over a week ago. She is already being bullied.	Oh no! That's so sad."
"Yes, and will again because it didn't help. I try to cheer her up with hugs, goofy moments, and whatever else I can think of.	Yeah that's awful. I'm sorry. I wish she wouldn be bullied. I wish it was harder for kids that get bullied. I have a daughter who bullied me when she was in high school."
"I had a chance to cheat on my wife once,	oh, what happened?"
"I did not. I left there quickly. It was not something I would ever want to do.	That must be hard."
"My dog got very sick and lay in bed for a couple weeks.  I was so concerned.	I bet. What did happen to him?"
"She did get better eventually.  During that time I tried to tend to her as much as I could.	I am sorry your dog got sick. I hope she is better now."
"My roommate recently got a kitten, and he went out of town so I am watching over the little bugger.	That sounds like fun. What kind is it?"
"I love cats, I have one of my own. I haven't been around a kitten in forever so it's a real treat. I also don't have to sleep with the little brat at night either so it's especially great.	That's nice! I have a cat, Luna, who likes to sleep on the couch."
"I had a solo competition last week for cello. I was well prepared and knew my music well. I felt great walking into that room.	That's great! Did you win?"
"I have been playing the cello for 5 years.	That must have been so awesome! How long have you been playing cello for?"
"I slipped and feel at work the other day. Several people saw it. I wanted to just crawl in a hole and hide afterwards.	That's awful! Did anyone help?"
"Just my pride	That is terrible!"
"My ex and I broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork, like 70 plus hours a week.	I hate it when people work too hard to get where they want to go but can't afford it. I hope he finds something better."
"He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.	That sucks.  Did he ever apologize or apologize afterwards and try to make it work?"
"My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it, we've been getting along great since we broke up.	That's good! You should give them space and see if things work out between them. I would not want to rush back into an old relationship."
"The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much. He decided he didn't want to leave after all and wants to keep working 70+ hour weeks every week.	I hope he gets over working himself and starts to move on from his bad habits. I think he's got some work on himself to do."
"I came home today and the food I had put in the crock pot was ruined. The outlet must have died and the food sat in there all day not cooking.	That sucks, did it happen by the time you came home?"
"Yeah it was pretty terrible. I had to throw out a TON of food, and to add insult to injure I had to go eat out tonight.	That sucks, hope it was worth the hassle."
"I let my friend babysit my kid last week.	I'm sure it went very well. What kid are they? Mine's been sick lately and I had to work long hours."
"Awesome. I usually have a hard time letting anyone watch my child but he had a great time with her.	Yeah, sometimes parents don't let kids babysat because they don't want their parents around. But they seem fine."
"5	That's really sweet. I've had that problem before too. Sometimes I have a hard time trusting people."
"I was out walking by the lake over the weekend and there shore was just covered in dead rotting fish.	Oh no! I would have been so grossed out! What a disgusting sight!"
"I don't know, that's what I would like to know! The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped, and they died. I imagine it was pollution.	That sounds awful. I hope the water quality is improving soon."
"I have a really big game coming up this weekend. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league.	That must be scary. I hope you have faith in your abilities."
"I just don't want to embarrass myself or my team. I'm so scared i'm going to make a fool of myself.	I hope you play great and you will be able to overcome that fear"
"Several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches.	I am so glad that happened.  That would have been a very scary situation!"
"I had to get 2 stitches in one of the holes and 1 stitch and all the other holes. He was a big dog, a little over 50 pounds.	Yeah, I can imagine you were in the hospital.  Did you end up okay?"
"Last year I made a bet with my friend and he lost, so he had to buy me a Nintendo Switch. I was so great.	That was so nice of him!"
"I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet, but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.	I would love a Nintendo switch"
"I am visiting my friend this week.	I'm sure it was a lot of fun. What kind of fun?"
"Yes, I mean I promised her I would  and some things came up but I know I gotta stick to my word and make this happen.	That's so sweet of you. What are you planning?"
"Oh I know I can't. She had lots of plans for us.	One time when I was little and playing hide and go seek, my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us. After a while I realized that we were going to be in trouble, and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way.	Yeah that must have felt so scared and embarrassed. What did they say to you?"
"Yeah I guess they were, they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin, even though I was 7 and it was his idea.	Oh boy, did he have fun? Did he get to go home early and get to make up with you? Did he ever do anything bad?"
"So we are moving and I'm having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me. Thinking I should keep it.	That's very thoughtful of your grandmother. What kind is it of?"
"Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.	I think it would be nice to have it but I understand why it would be hard to let go."
"One of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of 25.	I love that.  That's a pretty good deal.  I wish I had been able to do that."
"Yeah I know, I'm really amazed and proud of him. To be honest as proud as I am I can't help but to be a little jealous too lol.	I love how life works. You should really try to do it."
"I stayed at a friends house for the weekend a while back, and when I got home my bedroom was destroyed	That sucks. Did anyone take any pictures of the mess?"
"My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it	That's awful."
"Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me, because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.	that's kinda sad, did you get back together with her?"
"I hope so, I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I just wish I had someone here with me right now.	That's terrible. Did you guys talk recently or was it just a thing where you missed each other?"
"My husband and I celebrated 9 years Saturday. It was such a good day of quality family time.	That's so great! I'm sure you're happy to see you both are still together!"
"Yes I love a good day of relaxation and family time :)	I love that! My wife and I are celebrating our 5 years.  We just started getting married."
"Yes, dinner :)	I went to the zoo last month, I haven't been since I was a kid. I went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos, however I couldn't help but feel bad for the animals the whole time.	I bet the animals were happy for that."
"The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it.	That's terrible. I feel for you."
"I won an essay contest and I get to go to Washington DC for free!	that sounds awesome"
"I wrote about social security reform. Kinda boring stuff lol but it'll be fun to visit all the sites in DC	its a boring place lol."
"We are moving. I'm so pumped for new adventures.	That's so exciting! What are your new adventures?"
"Yes, a new state. I am just imagining all the fun things and new things we can do.	That sounds fun! What's the state of?"
"When I was in middle school there was this boy that sat in front of me in 8th, he was always trying to get me to kiss him before class started.	That's kind of creepy."
"No, the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.	Yeah, I would just get up and walk away from him."
"I've been out of a job for a while but someone I know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field	That's very good news! What field? I'm a teacher and writer. I love it!"
"Statistics. I am going to help a real estate company build models to predict house values	I would be very excited for that opportunity!"
"So a friend and I entered a drawing at the mall and she won. I wish I could say it doesn't sting a bit that she won.	That's okay. You didn't win. I didn't win either time!"
"A weekend trip to Gatlinburg. I would of loved that.	I've entered those myself a few times. I wish you luck."
"She is but she's taking her husband :)	I saw  man swallow a sword	That is a scary thing to see."
"Yes I was. I thought it was pretty intense to watch	Oh wow! Was it scary or did you like watching?"
"I've been packing, packing, packing and cleaning.	That's great! What are you packing for the trip?"
"Moving, not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.	Oh wow! You moving to a new place? Where?"
"Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.	It sounds like you were shopping at a store. Did you take a picture to post?"
"Huge dent, I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.	That's really awful! Did the police or the store call the police to report the hit and the hit?"
"I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy.	That was fun. How did you do?"
"Oh man, I sure was. And she was so excited to get out of that box.	Oh wow! That's funny! How old was she then?"
"My brother isn't very good with money but i just lent him some	I know that feeling all too well.  What did he do?"
"Yeah I don't do that often, but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time	That's very kind of you to do that.  I do the opposite with friends and family all the time.  I think everyone deserves it sometimes."
"I just can't believe some people. I watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today.	I don't think that homeless person deserved to get yelled at. I think the person who did should get some discipline for their behavior."
"I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.	That's awful. I hope she gets a job soon so people like that don't bother them anymore."
"So we are waiting on some news to move. I feel like it will be this week that we find out.	I feel your pain.  I am in the same boat."
"Not sure yet, waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.	I hate waiting as much!"
"So I interviewed for my dream job last week and I didn't get it.	Oh no. I'm sorry. What kind is it?"
"I really hope so. I was really wanting that job.	That's tough. Maybe you should look for another opportunity."
"So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.	that would be a grossly grossed-up moment"
"Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.	I hate the feeling of that smell and I would be sick."
"I am so ready to find out where we are moving to.	Oh that sounds exciting! What kind of move is this? Are they taking us across country?"
"I don't know where I want to go, just want to know where they are sending us :)	I love moving places!  Where you moving to sounds like it's going to be an exciting adventure!  Where are they sending us to?"
"A book I borrowed from the library got rained on and now it's destroyed	I have been there. It happened to me."
"Yeah. I feel pretty bad about it.	that's terrible. Did you lose anything?"
"I found my dog's old toy. It brought back memories of when I first got her	Oh, really old toy?"
"I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog was she?	That is sad.  I would like to have found her old toy.  I had almost lost her too.  She had gotten loose and i was so sad.  It took us almost two years to find it.  I was so sorry.  I loved that dog."
"After months of job searching, I finally got a good offer	That's great! Congrats on perseverance"
"I got a job in statistics	That's great! Congratulations!"
"I have a final exam that I've been studying for for days.	Oh that's exciting! What subject is it in?"
"I think I will do really well. I feel prepared for it.	That's good. I always study hard for finals too."
"I stupidly lent my car to a friend.	Oh, I bet that was frustrating! Did your car work again after that was done with it?"
"He got drunk and took it for a joyride. It didn't end well.	Oh no! That is terrible! What happened next"
"Even though I could've gotten more money at another job, I've stayed with my current employer. It is a good place to work.	oh well, good luck then."
"I work in public relations. I create campaigns for companies.	oh, public relations sounds interesting"
"I recently did a very successful one for a medical company.	that sounds cool, how did it work out for them?"
"I just had a job interview that went really well. I'm expecting a call pretty soon.	I am so nervous."
"It's a statistical analyst job.	oh, great luck"
"I recently moved to a new city. I left behind some good friends.	Oh. Well that's pretty tough to leave behind good people. Did you move for work?  I moved from school to work, and I moved from a small city to a bigger city."
"That's very true. It'll just take some time.	That's true, but it's hard to let them down sometimes. It'll just take some time. I hope you do okay in your new city."
"Last week I was at the grocery store picking up body wash. There were so many to chose from, but I couldn't help but buy my trusted brand that has served me well for so many years.	That's nice of them to make a product like body wash!"
"Yes, why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well.	I have been using that same brand body wash since the day I was born!"
"I have to show some brand loyalty!	I have so much to do today, but it's raining. I'm OK with just staying at home and doing nothing.	That's understandable, you don't want the weather to ruin your day."
"It sucks. Maybe it'll be dry this weekend.	It's always rainy in the city I'm in. I wish you better luck!"
"My dog I had for five years just passed away. He was hit by a car last night.	I'm so sorry. I was expecting him today as well."
"It is just so sad to have my loyal companion taken away like that.	Oh my, I'm so sorry to hear. I have had my own dog pass away, and I miss them so much."
"His name was Han Solo, I am a huge Star Wars fan. My wife thought it was a dorky name, but I loved it.	I'm ready for hurricane season. I have my kit ready and everything.	Oh, hurricane season?"
"South Alabama, near the Gulf.	That must be so scary, especially in Florida."
"I have been sick the last week and my wife has made my chicken broth soup every day!	That's very sweet of your wife.  Did she make it from scratch, though or did she buy a bagged mix of chicken?"
"She is such a blessing to me and spoils me so much.	oh that's great"
"Yeah, I try to treat her the best I can, can't lose someone that amazing.	When I go out to a restaurant, I order gluten free food items.  I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not, my food could be ""gluten free"" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.	I'm so sorry you're going to go through that again.  I used to think I wasn't going to react that way."
"If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!	It is scary, I know."
"Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.	We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!	That's weird. Did you taste anything unusual in the cokes?"
"I was concerned they were the wrong drink order, we lined them up and talked to the server and together figured out the syrup bag must be going empty!	That's so cool! What did you end up ordering?"
"While cleaning out our closets, I always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be.  Last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make ""jean purses"" out of someday.  My kid is 14 this week!!!	That must have been fun making those things!"
"It definitely triggers some emotions!  Then I'm torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging.	I know right, I'm the same way. I don't want to get rid of any of them items, even if they're not used."
"My wife made me pancakes for breakfast. I have a full belly and feel rather happy now.	oh wow. what kind pancakes were they?"
"One of my favorite breakfast foods. She also made some thick sliced bacon. She treats me so well.	That sounds like a great morning"
"For sure, no other woman I would rather have.	I hope you get together soon"
"How can I complain when she gets up early to make me such a great meal!	I can't complain about anything.  I am a huge fan."
"I told my brother that I was planning to propose to my best friend, but I hope he keeps it a secret!	That's so cool! Did you two guys or boys?"
"He lets things slip once in a while, but this is a pretty big secret so I have confidence in him.	I am so excited for this, i bet."
"I have a friend who is struggling right now in her business.  I'm trying hard to be there to support and cheer her on.	That's very good of you. I would do anything for someone.  I have a friend that has a business and she has had it for many years, but recently she had to close. She has been working on a new business, but it's taking a lot of her."
"RIght? Even if I can't directly affect her business, I can help keep her spirits up to weather the storm!	I can totally relate to this.  I have been there too many times.  I hope she gets through this and comes out the stronger wiser and more confident!  I hope she gets a good job and makes good decisions.  I know she has what she's got to do to do that."
"I saw my neighbor bought the car I have always wanted. I wish I was in a a better financial position to buy one.	That's pretty cool. Are you thinking about asking them if you could borrow it for a year to see if you could afford one?"
"Subaru Brat, best car ever made. Its like a car and a t ruck all in one.	I can imagine. I've always wanted a Subaru but never thought I had the money. I have always wanted to get a Honda but never thought it was worth it"
"I know, it would look perfect in front of my double wide mobile home! There is a used one on the corner for $350. But that will take me months to save up.	It's like, a car, and you need a truck.  I would have to get a car, and then I would have a truck, I would never have a car and truck."
"Yeah, or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big.	Oh wow that is so cool, what kind of gas station is that at, that sounds so easy"
"I am in the process of potty training my daughter, but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper. The other day, we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service.	That's not fun at church? That's a little too close to the front of the pew for comfort! I'd have to get her diaper changed quickly to avoid a big commotion! I would have just let her go sit down for the service and get her diaper changed at the end.  That would have been the best part of church!"
"It was not one of our best moments. Luckily, she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.	I know right. She's only 8 months old so diaper rash is just around the corner. I am trying my best to not be too upset about the diaper rash. She's just learning to sit in the potty seat now. She's a smart girl."
"I ordered a new toy for my son online for his birthday.	I bet it's very exciting for you. How does that work?"
"No, not yet. But, I can't wait to! He's going to have so much fun with it.	That sounds fun! What kind toy is it?"
"My husband and I are going on our very first cruise in December. i can't wait!!!	that's so exciting! i love cruoses"
"I hope so too. I have wanted to go on a cruise for so long. I'm happy were are able to go this year.	I hope so too too. Are they going with you or with a different group? I'm excited to see you too!  I have been on a cruise before and it was amazing."
"We are going with a few friends, so they booked it and we got a discount because they are returning customers.	My dad called me one day crying out for help. I had to drive over to his house.	I hate when that happens."
"He had fallen and bruised his ribs. I had to take him to the hospital.	that's terrible.  What happened?"
"Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities, I have been in a rut lately. Last week, during revival, for the first few nights, everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit, but I couldn't for whatever reason, and it made me feel bad.	I feel for that. I was there once and just couldnt. I was trying to get it out of my system"
"Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.	I love when you feel like praising and worshiping and then just being yourself again."
"Thank you. He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.	Sometimes I wake up at night and eat junk food.	That is a common thing that I do.  I usually eat at the mall after work."
"Yeah but I feel bad afterwards. I like to make peanut butter and nutella sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies.	I'm the same way. I like to eat healthy but sometimes I do not."
"We had a birthday party for my son the other day!	oh, what kind of party?"
"He's 6. It was so much fun to watch him open his presents.	Oh boy, that's great! What did his presents look at first"
"I was the captain of the volley ball team in middle school and high school, so I signed my daughters up to play. since they had an interest in it too. When we got the practice on the first day, the coach said that it was her first year coaching and she asked me if I would help a little.	That's cool! I bet you had to be very patient."
"I was very excite to help. I miss playing very much, so being able to play with my daughters and show of my skills a little was great.	That's awesome. I'm glad to hear that you and the kids can do things together again."
"A couple years ago, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with MS.	That's terrible.  How is it treating?"
"Yeah, I was blind in my right eye, and my left arm was numb.	That must've been scary"
"My friend has been sick a lot recently and I am worried about her.	I have been sick a few days, and it's a virus. I feel for you, friend! I am praying for you!"
"Yes.  She has been vomiting and having diarhea a lot	That must be terrible for her. Hopefully she will get better soon."
"Yes.  It has just happened on and off for months.	I am sitting here chilling out with my cat on my lap.	Ohh that's so sweet! What cat do u have?"
"Yes.  My cat is relaxing and always sleeping	That sounds nice.  Do your cat's have personalities?"
"I had a job interview last week	Oh wow! How did that go out for you?"
"I am not sure yet.  I was very nervous	That's okay, you'll know for next time."
"Next week I think	I spent a weekend at a lake house all by myself.	I love lake house."
"It was fantastic.  I found it so restful and peaceful just to get away from it all for a while.	Oh, what a trip that sounds like! Where was it in particular that you went?"
"I had a get together recently, One of my friends brought someone who couldn't hold their liquor.	ohh, ohh, oh! that was so gross."
"Heh, well they projectile vomited all over my carpet, it was gross.	That is awful. I would have been so upset."
"Me and my daughter went to the skate park the other day.	That's always fun. What did she do?"
"Yeah we did. She can ride up and down the ramps much better than I expected her to.	Oh wow that's awesome. I bet you're so proud. What age did she start skating at?"
"I've been out of work, and my dads been helping me financially.	That must have helped you a lot, how long you work there?"
"No, I am filing for disability. Theres no way I can ever repay him	That's great that your dads willing to help you out in that way"
"I had to meet my new physical therapist this week.	I am sure was a bit of an intimidating experience."
"They seem ok. I just hate having to meet new doctors.	Oh I know right. I had to meet my new physical therapist this week too, and I was a little worried."
"This is the first time ever that both of my kids have been in school.	That must have been fun to hear. What school are they in?"
"Yeah, it's just too quiet lol.	That's awesome! What are they doing in school?"
"Recently my family had a trip that was very disorganized. Basically drove a long way to hang see my family for a handful of hours.	It was so disorganized. They really need to organize their trip"
"Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.	I feel bad. Did you find the experience helpful in the end?"
"That is true, I guess there is that to be thankful for.	I had to wait in line at the store the other day for 15 minutes!	That's the worst part, just standing around waiting."
"Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.	That's the worst part. You're the only person in the store!"
"I had to go to my brother in laws funeral last week.	That's so sad. What happened? Did he pass?"
"I'm ok. It just hit me hard seeing all those sad people.	Oh man, I'm so sorry. I can only imagine how hard it must be to go through that kind of thing. I hope you can find some comfort."
"I have some friends who are traveling all over Europe this summer	That's a really cool trip. I've always wanted to visit some European countries."
"I am!  I would love to go myself.	I love Europe. Where you think you would go first."
"My and some old friends from college recently got together. It's always great to see those guys again.	That is so cool! Did they do much together?"
"Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.	Oh man. What happened to you all these days ago."
"No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.	That is nice that you have a group that stays together. I'm glad that my group of friends stays close as well"
"My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.	I love when she does that."
"I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.	I know, I know. It really gets under your skin. I just wish that would go to her. I know I know, I'm being selfish, but I think she should have to tell the kids about the lie. I mean, kids don't understand the context of what they're talking about. I just know I would have told the kids. They're always getting on my case about how much they spend."
"Oh, I've tried...	This weekend I saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color.	That's terrible."
"No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.	Yeah, people need guidance. I hope they learn from it."
"No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.	Oh, man. I feel you, girl. I don't know what's wrong with her. I'm not even sure I care anymore than to get in trouble. She's always been good to me, I'm happy to pay it off."
"I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently, but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.	Yeah, it's tough when stuff like this happens, and you don't get to see your family."
"We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.	that sucks that is a bittersnap moment"
"The last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes, shoes, and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school. There first day was yesterday and it went well.	That's good to hear that school went well."
"I'm home with my toddler, so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.	That's great to hear your shopping paid for you being home!"
"Recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back.	I bet, did they call back to ask how long it took?"
"Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.	I'm glad everything worked out well for you!"
"My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.	That's really not cool.  Did you tell them to calm down?"
"It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.	It is unfortunate. It's like they're just trying to show him they're the most important person. It's like they're trying to take advantage of him right now that they can't even get along with each other themselves. It's really sad. I hope they can work things out. They'll never know what could happen to them. They're too caught in that kind of childishness right now to even think of doing anything else other than arguing and fighting."
"Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.	Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends.	That is great. What a fun activity."
"The memories are awesome and I miss playing.But I wouldn't trade the life I live now to go back,	What's volleyball?"
"I am going fishing at my favorite spot tomorrow. I know I am going to catch something!	I love to go fishing too! What kind are you going for, lures or something more traditional like bait?  I used to like to go to the lake near where I grew up and catch all sorts of fish."
"Blue catfish, they get so huge. I have a secret recipe for stink bait that works well!	That's awesome! What's the recipe for?"
"Oh I will, fried catfish is so amazing. Especially beer battered!	I am going to play dominos tonight	That's a fun activity. What time do they play?"
"Well with some locals at the local brewpub	Oh that's a fun game! I love to eat while I'm drinking.  What time is your game going?"
"Yes I think I will do well even though I just learned last week how to play!	my family came to visit recently, i always get so nervous about people visiting.	I bet.  How did you handle it?"
"I have to make sure the house is clean and that everything is in order before they arrive, nerve wracking!	That is good you take so care of the house."
"I have a birthday coming up. I really hop I get the gift I am asking for.	That's awesome! What gift are you hoping for?"
"Thank you, I am hoping for a new camera. It is about time to upgrade.	What a great goal! What kind of camera are looking forward to?"
"Thanks, I really enjoy getting out and photographing nature.	My dog go into the trash can and drug it all over the house. I am so mad right now!	Oh, that's a nasty thing. What did you do? Did you scold your dog?"
"I know, it is going to take me all evening to clean up!	That's terrible, I hope he doesn't chew on anything else"
"He is usually good, but this time his naughtiness got to him.	I am going camping this weekend. I got my tent, sleeping bag and tons of food. I think I have everything I need!	Yeah camping sounds like fun. What kind? I love it."
"Oh I will, I am ready for whatever the elements throw at me!	Oh cool, that's awesome. I bet you are excited."
"It will be a blast, I just love roughing it in the outdoors!	The other night i heard a sound like someone was breaking in my house, i was pretty scared.	That's creepy! Did anything break?"
"No, it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating.	That is pretty scary. I don't even have the power!"
"It has been raining a lot lately, I am really trusting the seal on our doors to keep the water out.	How long do they last?"
"I know, it really starts too pool up by our house. It is getting kind of scary!	That's scary, I hope the storm clears out quickly. Is it going to affect your power grid?"
"Yeah, really don't want to deal with a flooded home! Would not be good for my family.	I bought a cake from the store and it ended up tasting terrible.	oh no, did the store make it themselves?"
"No, I ended up just suffering through it and eating it.	I guess that's the price you pay for buying a cake from the grocery store."
"Yeah, I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me.	I was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently, I bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better.	that makes sense, you want to feel good about the way you come in front of the interview"
"Yea, it made me feel better about myself and my chances, or maybe i just like spending money	I totally get that, it makes you feel good about the situation."
"I love chocolate cookies because my grams would always make them for me.	That's nice! Did you ever eat them when she passed?"
"Nothing beats cookies made by grandma. Except for the oatmeal ones. Too healthy haha.	What do your grams bake? I love baking."
"Only if it has raisins to sweeten them up!	I found an old picture of when my oldest daughter started kindergarten 11 years ago.	That is so cool! Did she like it? Did she like going back to that school?"
"It is!  In it, she's just standing with a huge smile on her face and a Hello Kitty backpack.	That's a cute story. Did she like kindergarten?"
"I've been teaching my young daughter to play video games with me, she's such a quick learner.	That's really nice of you. She's going through that age where she thinks it's cool to play video games."
"Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them, It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence.	That's really cool. I've always been a bit of an avid video game player."
"It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.	I love that dip! What happened?"
"I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!	That's awful.  I hope you were happy before it happened though."
"Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!	I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.	That must have been exciting news! Congratulations on getting what you deserve"
"It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!	that sounds awesome!"
"I try to.  But I'm glad all the effort is being recognized!	I put in to get a promotion at work, and I should know something either way by tomorrow.	That's good. What did you do?"
"On the one hand, I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.	I hope it goes well."
"I work for a medical supply company.	Yeah, sometimes you gotta just let things happen and see what happens"
"Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.	"
"I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!	That is so disturbing. I am shocked that it happened. I would have never even known. I would hate if that was my dog."
"Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.	When the England national team made the semi-finals of the World Cup	I don't know much about sports, do England have a national team? I don't know much about the sports world.  I don't know much sports. I don know very little about sports"
"So good, genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!	I have faith that my country's national football team will do the same."
"But yeah - school started for the kids today and it was weird how quiet it was once the bus pulled away.	Oh, yeah. It takes a while to wake them up, you know?"
"It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.	Yeah, school started for my kids today and I am feeling the withdrawal symptoms."
"Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!	I'm sorry to ask, are you going to take them to grandma and great aunt mabel?"
"I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years, after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!	youuou think that was gross! i dont even have to clean under desks lol"
"Yes indeed, there was even a frog under there! So bizarre!	That's gross! Did you call in an expert to clean it out?"
"They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	What animal?"
"Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.	I know. It is heartbreaking to hear about. I hope they are safe now."
"Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.	that is so right for rescue shelters to help animals. I hope that those animals find good homes. I am glad there is help."
"And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!	i agree that they did not do their job and left us to deal with it"
"My son's soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well.	It's so cool!"
"I am, too!  I'm glad he's doing something he loves.  At this point, I'm just waiting on the text to see which team he made it onto.	That is great to see. Hopefully, it will work for your kids."
"I'm so glad the kids went back to school today!	That is always such an excited day for parents."
"Yes!  I can go back to having ice cream for breakfast!  I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the, ""Mom, you always watch this!"" comment!	I love ice cream too.  Do they make ice cream sandwiches now?"
"How old are they?	It seems like that would take away my favorite part of the morning!"
"Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL	My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.	Oh man. What are they going on?"
"On the one hand, I hope so but on the other hand, I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD	I think you mean boring."
"I went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose, a bit white husky, he was aggressive.	That's crazy! Was you able to catch him?"
"He was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me, the neighbor finally came out and called him home. was intense.	Oh that must've been intense. I hope you were safe."
"The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.	I'm so sorry. That's so heartbreaking."
"She was under my house, crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.	"
"And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad, but I take comfort in those things.	My 6 year old tried to play a video game but couldn't understand how the controller worked. A few days later she was playing no problem!	That sounds like a great story.  What video did she play?"
"Yea, i was pretty proud of her, especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid.	That's really cool. Kids are always learning new stuff."
"I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.	That's awful! How will you pay now?"
"I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!	That stinks. You should talk to the band director about it. Maybe they can help out."
"I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.	I have had to go that route myself.  It was hard"
"Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.	That's great to have a mom who looks after things for you like that."
"When my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy	I know what that feels like"
"hah, i hear ya. I just got so used to all the commotion i suppose.	I'm sure! I used a lot of noise makers myself when my wife and kids came. It was hard. I think we all need some quiet time sometimes. I hope your quiet time is good. I need some too!"
"When we were kids, my sister and i once stole a blank check from our mom to order a pizza, we got caught.	That sounds like a fun memory. What did our parents say about that incident?"
"My mom noticed the charge and found a the missing check from her checkbook, i'll never forget the look of dissapointment on her face!	That's funny, we would do it to get attention from our parents."
"Oh yea. grounded for a long time.	I just saw a movie I had been looking forward to and it was terrible	Oh man, what was it? Was it a new movie or a re-release of a classic? I hate when that happens."
"It was the new Jurassic World	That movie was terrible. I loved it though, and it's one I'll be re-wantching."
"My coworker forgot to turn in the paperwork to switch our on call weeks. He ended up costing me $250! I'm so mad!!!	That sucks. Did you talk with your coworkers about what happened. Maybe they didnnt know how to do the job right?"
"He's such a worm. I can't stand it.	That's awful. Did you confront him about it?"
"Working from home can be difficult when people won't leave me alone to get work done.	That can get frustrating at times but sometimes you just have to accept that people like to social. You can't get work done at the same time as social."
"I love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video, gonna pull my hair out.	I understand. Sometimes they just need a break from you and a chance to do their own thing."
"I have a big date coming up and I can't get these butterfly feelings to go away.	That's great! Are you feeling pretty nervous about it?  I have been nervous about my first big date for years."
"Yeah, I really think she might be the one. I hope I don't screw it up.	That's great news! I hope you have a fantastic date and you both have a great time."
"Thank you, I am looking forward to taking her to a nice place to eat!	I bit into an apple and found a worm. It was so gross.	Oh wow. That's a worm?"
"Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple.	That sounds unpleasant"
"That is true, I should be thankful for that.	I was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs.	I would be so scared"
"They really startled me, the female did not seem happy to see me.	i was scared too, but i did not want to harm her. i was able to run."
"Yeah, thankfully I was able to get away. It took a while for me to catch my breath.	I got a new dog recently, he is the best. I am so thankful for him!	I have a new dog!  She's a pug.  She is so sweet.  She's so cute!"
"He is a male australian shepherd. His name is charlie, he is super cute!	That's great! I bet he's super smart and athletic. Australian Shepherds are my favorite. What's he doing right now? Is he chasing squirrels or playing with his food bowl.  Do you play with him or do anything with him?"
"Will do! He is super cuddly and loves to follow me around!	There was one piece of pie left in the fridge. Instead of sharing it, I ate it. I kind of feel bad.	That's not good, why did you eat it?"
"It might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone. I look super guilty right now.	I would too feel bad about. I have never eaten pie before but now I want to try it."
"I could, I might have to buy her some of her favorite chocolate.	I was at the park today and almost stepped on a rattle snake. I almost jumped out of my skin.	I hate it so much when that happen."
"Me too, that would of wrecked my day. It was so close! It haunts my thoughts even now.	I bet! Did it move away?"
"It might take me a little while to get over my fear and go back to the park.	That would be bad. I hope that you are okay!"
"For sure, wouldn't want to relive that experience	I just got a bonus from my job. That money came at the perfect time!	That's great! Congratulations! That must have been exciting!"
"It was a really nice bonus too, they were impressed with the quality of work I have done this year.	oh wow. that's awesome, congrats! how does your job work out to you?"
"Now I will have to work even harder and try to earn a larger one next year.	I was going to go to the movies with a bunch of friends. But they all bailed on me and now I have to go alone.	That's a bums up.  What are you going to do?"
"I hope so, but I am really missing them right now. I didn't want to go alone.	I am sure you will have a good time, you will meet new friends soon enough"
"It is hard to find reliable friends. No one seems to show up anymore.	I was out photographing butterflies and took the most incredible photo. I am really happy with how it turned out!	I'm sure you are! What was the butterfly doing in that amazing photo?"
"The butterfly was yellow. It was a tiger swallowtail. One of my favorites!	That's awesome! What camera do you have?"
"I saw my dog try to eat a dirty diaper one time	Oh that was so gross. What did you do? Did your do it?"
"Yeah, it's nasty. I wouldn't let her lick my face for a while after that.	Yeah, it was pretty gross. I didn't let her lick my face. I had her lick my ears first."
"I was trying to take a nap, but my cat kept on trying to play with my head.	That is so annoying. Did you yell?"
"I usually love mine, but not when it is keeping me from sleeping	That's so annoying. Did you yell?"
"I just had a job interview and I'm waiting to hear if I got the job.	I have been there! It's scary."
"Me too. I'm feeling pretty nervous about it	Oh yeah? Why did they reject you?"
"I was on a plane ride and we went through some pretty severe turbulence	oh thats no good"
"Yes it was. I was so afraid we'd crash	What happened to the plane?  Did it get hit by an ICBM?  I was on that plane too and I'm terrified of flying again!"
"My cousin and I tricked my butler into thinking he won millions in the lottery. I feel so bad.	That sounds like a very stressful time! Did you end up winning?"
"Only a few minutes.	That is terrible. I hope he is okay. Did he think he won?"
"Someone came to my door with a gun, asking for money	oh that would be so bad, I can't believe that would have to have happened."
"I didn't have any. He came into the house and stole some stuff	That's terrible."
"Our cat had to many health problems, so we had to put him down.	Oh no. That's so terrible. I'm so so so sorry. I'm sorry he didn. I hope he was happy."
"I had him for 17 years, he lived a full and happy life, but I was not ready for him to go.	that's really hard to do. I lost two dogs and cats. They were so cute, and I was so sad."
"But they make your life so much enjoyable while they are around!	I went to do karaoke with a guy i'm dating and I discovered he's a really talented singer	Oh, wow! What did you think of? Did you have fun?"
"He's kind of shy about it. He had to get really drunk to perform karaoke	That sounds fun! I hope you enjoyed it. I love karoke"
"I had to do a research project and present it to my professors to graduate. Thankfully I passed!	that's good! i'm happy for you"
"I worked many long hours. It was stressful but I'm happy to have done well	That's good news! Congratulations on your success! I bet you got an A+."
"My sister has been playing a song I dislike over and over and over	That's so annoying, why do people keep playing that song over?"
"She does it more because she likes it than to bug me. It's going to be stuck in my head for weeks	That sucks, do you talk to her about it or try to ignore it?"
"okay.	I know that feeling when you're trying to remember a password to your account"
"That is great! What will you be doing there?	That's great!  I am going to a concert tonight.  How about where you going?"
"I accidentally slapped someone in the face while I was playing basketball.	That's not cool!"
"No, I think she was just a little shocked by it. I felt so bad.	Oh wow, that sounds awful!"
"I let my friend borrow my car. He's an international student and only has a permit.	That must have been scary! Did he return it?"
"I was in the car with him. He just wanted to practice driving and he didn't have his own car.	That's terrible.  I hope he didn't hurt yourself."
"I am at a cross road. I am trying to decide my major in college.	oh wow that's exciting, which one are you thinking about?"
"I was thinking about graphic design. Or, I was going to do something practical like Nursing.	that is awesome that you are interested in graphic design."
"I guess you are right. I really like sketching and painting. I can use my creativity side.	I've been trying to save money so that I can help my husband with the Christmas shopping this year.	That sounds smart. What's Christmas shopping this time of the year?"
"Well at first I was a little discouraged because I wasn't making that much. Things have picked up recently though, and I feel I will be able to help him a good bit so I'm feeling better about it.	that's good to hear. you're really taking care of yourself this time of year. you deserve some time off."
"I had planned to take my daughter shopping a few weeks ago. We were all really excited, but the plans fell through.	That sucks! What happened? Did you cancel?"
"Yes. We were able to go about a week later, but the closer it got to school starting back I started to stress. Everything is good now though.	Yeah that's good. I'm glad everything is good now."
"I check in with my partner to see if we are okay. I ask him if there is anything that we can work on to make the relationship better.	That's really sweet of him to do."
"I don't want to have problems. This is why I check in with him.	That is very wise of you."
"When I go out with friends I really have to be tight with my money. Times are really hard for me financially?	Oh man, I bet it's tough right now. I hope things start up to look up for you."
"I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much. I sometimes like to leave a tip if possible.	I completely agree with that. Money is a blessing that we all get to have one time or the other in life."
"I find it appalling how my husband's family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away.	I'm sorry to hear about that. What kind are his family acting like?"
"Yes, it is. They are all being really selfish and childish. My husband is staying out of it, but I can tell that he is getting fed up with it.	That's horrible, how long ago did it pass away?"
"I have to run several errands for my father-in-law today and he wants them done before my mother-in-law get into town, which is at some unspecified time today.	that sounds annoying. are they close to the time?"
"Yeah, I'm ready to get everything done so I can relax. I can't start on the errands until I drop the kids at school though.	I bet that's gonna be a lot!  Hopefully everything gets along okay."
"I really do miss my mother. She has been dead for about 15 years now.	It's hard when we have to grow up and move away, even if we love our family."
"It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.	That's nice. I hope she is at rest."
"Yes, it is. I know that time heals.	That makes sense. I think about it too. I wish you could tell her how much I care for her. I would tell you anything."
"My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings. So, I would have to let go and let them fly.	Oh.  That is true.  I had 7 and then had to let go.  My first was 6 years old and I had to let him go to another country to be with his mother."
"I have 23, 20, 17 and 14. They are doing stuff that I question but I don't want them to not tell me stuff.	That's sad. You can give advice and support to them as long as you don't let go of your children completely."
"When I was in labor with my third child, they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital. The nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor. In the 2 minutes it took for him to get to my room, my heart dropped and I started to panic. He told me that the baby's heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency C-section right then.	That's terrible! Did they?"
"Yes, everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.	That's scary, I hope the baby is healthy now"
"Yes, they do. I ope your boy is all good now.	I finally beat level 150 on the crucible today in my favorite game Grim Dawn.	I love that game. What is it about it? Is it a puzzle game?"
"PC all the way. I've been grinding devotion points all week.	That sounds like fun. What made you start playing it?"
"I just found a hello kitty pot in my daughters room filled with water and old flowers.	I would have thrown it in the washing. It was so cute."
"It's not cute, and she's nine. By old flowers I mean, it's a green, stagnant slush with mold growing on top.	That's disgusting."
"When I enter the bus, I fainted. I think that I got overheated.	That is pretty rare. Did you call for help?"
"Yes I did. It was so hot outside and I did not have much to drink.	That is terrible!  Did you have anything in you besides water?"
"I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends	I hate being embarrassed.  How embarrassed were your friends?"
"I fell down, and apparently said some embarrassing things.	Oh no, I'm sure it happened to you. It's always embarrassing when that happens."
"My daughter is graduating from college. I cannot wait until she finish.	I am so proud! Congrats! That's so exciting!"
"Yes, I will. She has been under a lot of stress.	That's great! Congrats! What college did she attend at college."
"Two years ago I got diagnosed with MS.	That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that."
"Its a disease that attacks the nervous system. It was really scary to find out I had it. I just went blind in my right eye one day. Two days and several test later I found out I had MS.	That's awful! Did you start treatment?"
"I found out that my daughter is moving out. My youngest one told me so.	That's great! What age? Are you going crazy yet or is it just me moving out of my house? I moved out when I was a teenager and now I'm moving in with my daughter."
"I feel really sad because I felt she should have told me.	I know! It makes you think you're going to miss her even more!"
"I let my sister borrow my car. She is a new driver.	That must have been scary! Did she get lost?"
"Well, nothing. I'm sure that she will be a responsible driver.	That sounds pretty scary. I would have been worried. I have been there myself."
"I think that I will do good on my test.	That's good news!  What are the tests about?"
"It is tonight. I studied really hard.	That's good. I studied hard too."
"I heard a song that I hadn't heard in awhile. It reminded me of my high school days	ohh yeah, what song was it?"
"Yes, it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when I was young.	it does! what a great time to be young"
"My dad dies when I was 33 years old.	I'm so so sorry to hear that."
"Thank you. I was crushed, and it left me with questions about my own mortality.	That sucks.  Did he leave you a will?"
"My mother fell and injured herself. I wanted help and comfort her in any way possible.	I am sorry to hear that.  Are you taking her to the doctor?"
"Yes, but bhe bruised her wrist, and had a concussion. I wish that I was there for her when it happened.	That sounds awful. Did she end up in the hospital to be stabilized?"
"I had a nice meal and my favorite beverage after work	I love food and drink"
"It was a skirt steak with avocados. I was very satisfied.	I like skirt steaks."
"When I started a new job. I was nervous about proving myself all over again.	That can be scary. Did everything turn out well?"
"I did, but I find it hard to trust people. Especially at work.	Oh, that can happen for anyone.  I hope you found what you needed."
"I am trying to quit drinking soda and I have prayed to God and asked Him to help me. The problem is I am addicted to soda and Its very hard to quit. When I do manage to skip a day, the lack of caffeine causes horrible headaches.	That sucks. Do you think if you quit drinking soda you can get used to the taste of it and stop craving after a few days?"
"It just makes me feel bad, that no matter how many times I try, I still give in to the temptation.	I have heard that headaches can happen even when you quit, but I understand."
"Yeah, I think that's what I will have to do. Thanks for the advice.	I went on a job interview. I'm anxiously waiting to hear if I got the job.	It should come back soon."
"I still need wait another week.	I've had that happen before too."
"A drafter.	I just went to clean my kids sink a few minutes ago. I found a bunch of toys in the catch and I am mad.	That's gross. Did you find any poop?"
"Yeah, all the toys are out. But, they got some explaining to do after school.	That sounds like a lot of toys.  I had to tell them about how many toys they had gotten.  I explained that we don't buy that many.  I also told that they got too old for some of those toys."
"I couldn't sleep last night. I ended up staying up till 2am and eating a large amount of Shepard's pie.	That was quite unhealthy of me.  I love eating but I know I should not eat that much.  I hope you sleep better."
"Combination of stress and new meds I think. Maybe I can get back to my old scheduled soon.	That's crazy! I hope you get better sleep tomorrow."
"I saw my crush talking to another guy.	That's kind of rude, right?"
"I was a little upset, but it wasn't my business. I let it go.	That is understandable, everyone has their crushes and you just have to move on."
"When I went to the store the other day, I seen a guy all tweaked out on drugs.	That must've been terrifying. Did you tell the authorities?"
"No, but he seemed a little unpredictable, so I used the other door.	Oh wow, you must be pretty smart and safe to go shopping without a buddy. I hope you're right safe and no one bothers you."
"Holding each of my children for the first time was amazing.	I have never held my kids."
"Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.	That is very exciting! I am a mother and I feel the way you do when my kids are with their grandparents"
"I forgot about my grandmother's birthday a couple years back. I felt so bad about it!	Oh that, is it coming up soon?"
"Absolutely! I called her the next day and made sure to visit her. :)	Oh that sounds kind! I forgot about my own grandmas birthday a couple years back too. I called her and made her proud of course."
"She did. :) It ended up being a good visit anyway!	I was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day, and I found all my old paintball gear.	Oh no. Did you use it recently?"
"No, just me. But, I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.	That's awesome! What kind paintball are they playing?"
"I went skydiving last summer with my partner. It was so scary!	I would never do that. I'm scared of heights. How did you feel about that when it was done with your partner by your side?  Did you feel the rush of adrenaline at all?"
"Absolutely! I've always been scared of heights, but I'm so glad I made myself.	That's awesome! What was it like up up?"
"When I was a kid, I had a dog at my grandpa's. He gave it away because it wouldn't hunt.	oh wow i had no dogs, how old was it"
"I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.	That's too bad. It's not too hard though. You can adopt another."
"I tripped and fell in front of some people.	I hate when people do this, it makes me so mad!"
"No, only my pride was injured.	Oh no.  What happened?"
"I recently dug up a necklace my grandmother gave me when I was young for a birthday. I hadn't seen it in years.	That's really sweet. What did she give it to?"
"Yeah, she passed more than five years ago and I had forgotten all about it. It brought back so many memories though!	I love when that happens. You can never know too many things, but it brings back so many memories."
"I just won an award for best yard in the neighborhood!	I've won many for my yard."
"I did, mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off.	oh that's good! I've never won an award for my yard before. That's awesome you're the first! I'm so impressed. How did they decide who to give the award to? Was there a contest or a competition for the best?"
"It is, it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards.	I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends, it should be so much fun!	That's awesome! What time? Are they going early morning or late?"
"We often throw around a frisbee for a little bit, but we never get too intense with any sports.	It's good for us to get up off the ground, right?"
"Me too, there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!	that is awesome"
"I snuck some candy out of my daughter's snack stash. I feel bad because I had been trying to diet.	That's okay, kids are kids."
"Otherwise it's been pretty good- I've managed to lose 12 pounds! Just wish I could let the sugar cravings go.	That's awesome! I bet your daughter loves that. I hope you have fun together about that."
"My childhood friend gave me a watch for by birthday a few years ago, I lost it in a move recently. I'm pretty upset by it.	That's a sad thing. Have you found another watch?"
"I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!	That's awful.  It's never good when people give gifts to friends who haven the tendency to lose them."
"I let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day.	That's pretty brave of her!"
"She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.	Oh that was a scary thing. I let her walk across a street by herself once. I didn't have to. She's 3 years old."
"It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.	Yeah, it's a terrible accident.  She should be okay.  I hope she never has another."
"It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.	I am so angry about that! I hope you can get your car back soon."
"I was feeling really down for a few weeks and my sister knew. She drove hours to come see me and make me feel better!	That sounds nice. Did she stay with you for a few nights?"
"Yeah it was really sweet of her and made me feel so much better!	That sounds like she really cared for you."
"I was recently on a long international flight and we hit some really bad turbulence.	I am sure that was terrifying!"
"I didn't, but I was really nervous for a little while. My wife didn't handle it quite as well.	I hate it! I always get nervous too. I hope the worst! Did you feel it too badly?"
"For sure. And it was a great trip.	I screwed up plans for a date night with my wife. We ended up having to cancel and she was really mad about it.	That's terrible.  Was there something wrong that happened that day that prevented you from going on?"
"We did and I made sure to not screw that one up!	That is bad. Why did you screw it up."
"Me too. Who knows what would have happened to me if I did it twice.	I was able to go back home to my parents for a few weeks recently. It was wonderful to relax in my childhood home.	That's really cool! Where was home?"
"They loved having me around again! Our ten year old dog wouldn't leave my side.	that's really sweet of them to have you around."
"I've been thinking about buying some new, softer skateboard wheels.	Oh boy! What kind of skateboard is it for and are they for a street, transition or freestyle?"
"No, they make rough pavement feel smoother. I think I'll just keep the ones I have for now though. Just have to deal with having a rough ride.	That's a good idea, I've got some rough pavement on the way to the skate park so I don't have a rough ride either.  It will be a lot easier for me too!"
"I took my dog I've had for years over to meet one of my husband's sisters the other night.	Yeah that was a bit awkward. She was so nice, but she didn the like me."
"It did not go well at all! She pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home.	I think you should not take her to meet that person."
"Yeah, I think it might've been too much on her at once. I was pretty embarrassed.	I had to take my daughter to the doctor the other day. She was very sick.	Oh that stinks. Did you find out why she is sickly now"
"It was just the flu. I got her some medicine, brought her home, and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.	oh, wow. that's nice of you. how long has she been ill for now though?"
"So my sister is getting married in a few weeks.	I am sorry to hear that.  Is it a friend of your?"
"Absolutely! The whole family is flying out, we can barely contain ourselves.	Yeah, I heard that too! I have family too!"
"So my friend adopted a new kitten very recently.	Oh that must have been a great gift. How old is it now"
"Oh, she is absolutely adorable! I'm so envious, I haven't been able to adopt one yet.	What a sweet story. I've been trying for years to adopt a cat, my family has one. I'm starting to think I'll be the first cat parent to go to jail for animal welfare."
"Bought a new car a few months back. Couple nights ago we had a big storm roll through. I thought for sure it was going to hail all over my new car.	oh thats no good at all."
"Nice! We have a garage, but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.	What kind of car is it?"
"I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker. He is a programming wizard. He easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods I had never even heard of.	that sounds cool!  I love programming too"
"That is true. I usually can keep up, but this guy is on another level.	that sounds amazing"
"I had a meeting with my bosses the other day to discuss finally getting a promotion.	That's pretty cool. Did you feel nervous about that?"
"I've been working there for a couple years now. I'm feeling pretty good about my chances! Haven't heard back yet.	Oh, congratulations on the promotion, I'm happy for you!"
"I feel so good about knowing I am going to win the race on Sunday. The race is for my favorite charity. When I win the race I get to give my winnings to my charity of choice.	that sounds awesome, what is the charity for?"
"Yes, it is my local animal shelter. They will be there to cheer me on!	that's nice of you to think that about that shelter."
"My wife has had a trip in mind ever since I've known her. She recently had a big birthday so I surprised her with the trip. We went and she loved it. It made me happy to see her so happy.	That sounds like fun! Did you guys go on a cruise?  I'm not really a cruise type, but I'm sure you guys had a blast!"
"It was just a trip to the west coast. There was a handful of things she's always wanted to see/do. So we did all of them.	Yeah that's cool. What was the best trip experience for you?"
"Not yet. We try to take one big trip a year if possible. We just got back from that one, so we will start plotting out next year a little later I would imagine.	I live in Florida. When I go home once a year it is a grand occasion.	That's so cool!"
"I grew up in Alabama. It is not far from Florida but still I get so thrill when I can go back to see family and friends.	That's so cool! Where did you grow up in Alabama?"
"My sons first day of school was the other day.	oh wow that is awesome"
"Very first. I was so nervous till he got off the bus.	That is cool. How old are you?"
"I have a test coming up that I've been studying for weeks for.	It is hard to study for tests."
"It's a Japanese language test for college. I feel pretty good about it though, been going over and over it every night.	That's great. I hope you do well."
"I had phone interview for a job. It went very well	I'm happy for you! How old are you?  What kind of job was it?"
"Thank you. I wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand.	Oh man I hate phone interviews, but glad it went well"
"I saw an old movie. It reminded me of my younger days.	It sounds fun. What movie was that of?"
"Yes. It's almost like a time machine. Fond memories.	That's really interesting."
"I lost my job because my company didn't pay rent at our location.	That's terrible! What are you going do now?"
"Not very well. It makes me so angry. So I go work out to relieve the stress.	I hope you get it together"
"Recently my wife left me home alone with the dog all weekend while she was gone on a girls trip.	I am sorry to hear that.  How long were they left?"
"I missed her while she was gone. We have a mixed breed rescue pup.	I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you had fun on your girls' weekend."
"Our computer system at work is goofing up a lot, but the development team just keeps saying there's nothing wrong.	It might have been a glitch.  I'm not sure why they won't just reinstall the OS!"
"Sometimes. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things I need to do.	I can't help it when it's slow and slow down.  It's slow enough that I don't want to do it anyway"
"Me too!	Every time my kids go to grandma's they get to eat all kinds of candies, and get new toys.	That's really cool. I have never been to grandma's house."
"Yeah they do! Some times I wish I got to go visit grandma's like they do lol.	That's cool, I wish I had more time to spend with grandma's too"
"I was really happy when my nephew was born, Sadly i was informed he had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.	Oh no! That is terrible. I hope you are taking care and not letting the illness affect you negatively. Is there anyone you are taking care of?"
"He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy, but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.	That is terrible, I've heard of that disease before.  I didn't realize it could be genetic.  Hopefully some research will find a way to prevent it."
"I bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price. They didn't.	I know the feeling!"
"Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.	That's okay. You did what you did because of your research and research says that. I don't put in money to lose. I put it in stocks to make money to spend on things I like.  I just lost some money, but it was a small amount of my overall investment and I don't do it for the money, but I do it because I am smart.  I will put it back and I will be back."
"I came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor. He hasnt done that in ages.	i bet you were very disappointed. did you get him back out there?"
"Thanks. I dont think so. He has seemed fine otherwise. I've watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine. He is a mutt from a local shelter.	That must have been gross.  I'm glad he didn't do it on you.  Did you get him a diaper or something?"
"Yeah. I love that goofy animal.  Hope he's ok	I work for a software company. I have been trying to learn a new language for some stuff. I knocked out my first task like a champ.	That's great! What language is it in your case. I'm learning Spanish right now."
"Well I have the opportunity, but rarely have the time to really devote to it.	That's awesome. I wish you the best of success in your new venture. I'm sure you'll do well."
"Yeah i get that. I work for a startup so things change pretty rapidly around here.	I landed an ollie on my skateboard for the first time in 14 years yesterday.	That must've been fun!"
"Yeah it took a lot of practice.	oh man, i love skateboarding! I used to do it all the time, but now I am so lazy and not sure I want it back lol. I'm not sure I'll even want it again. I'm just going to stick with walking! I love walking, I can get anywhere I want!"
"Next week I am off work and going to the beach.	That sounds like a great time to me!"
"No I am going with my wife and her family. But we all get along great so it should be fun.	That sounds fun!  What beach do you all go to?"
"Amen. It is much needed. Ready for some sun and a drink with an umbrella.	That is good, good luck!"
"Not too long ago, I took a trip on a plane. The airline lost my whole suitcase!	That is so frustrating. Did you get your suitcase back?"
"The whole vacation! I was so upset! I didn't have anything to wear for the duration.	That's terrible."
"We usually don't do anything big for birthdays but my wife got me an apple watch this year.	That's awesome. I've been thinking I need an Apple Watch myself, but haven't gotten around to getting it yet"
"Yeah i really did not see it coming at all.	That sounds cool. I bet that it will make it easier to keep track of things."
"My boss and I went to lunch and had a personal conversation about some life issues.	I love talking about life with my boss"
"We just went to a local taco place. It was a good conversation.	Yeah, sometimes it just happens in these kinds types of conversations."
"It was more about just some personal life stuff. Not too much really.	I came back from a trip recently, got called in the boss's office and was given a decent sized raise.	That sounds good! Congratulations on getting a raise! What trip did you go?"
"Absolutely. I certainly won't say no to that.	That sounds good! What country did you go to?"
"Budget is kind of tight lately and I am really afraid my wife's aging car is about to bite the dust.	I hate being in a tight spot.  Do you have a plan in place for finding another car?"
"I may have to if that happens. We are making it now, but if the car goes it will be pretty tough.	That is awful, I hope that it goes for less than the price."
"It is ok. We are probably too proud to take help anyway. We will make it.	I understand that.  I am trying to save money for my future and I am okay to take help.  It is okay.  We are not in a bad financial situation at all."
"So I recently went through some old boxes and found some of my childhood dolls. It brought back a lot of memories!	oh, nice.  what kind of doll's did you find?"
"Absolutely! I remember having so much fun with them dressing them up. My sister and I would play for hours.	Yeah, those are pretty cool toys for kids to play around with"
"So, i may be in the market for a new laptop or a repair at least, thanks to a little mishap.	I have had those before, I have a MacBook Pro."
"My daughter tripped on the cord and it smashed on the ground, not sure if it can be saved. I was pretty angry.	That must be frustrating. I hope your laptop can be saved."
"I woke up the other morning, got ready and drove all the way to work. Just to find out it was a holiday and we had the day off.	That's nice. Did you have a fun day out?"
"I know, but the extra day of work was nice. Especially since I wasn't expecting it.	That's so weird."
"It was wonderful. I ended up being twice as productive since I got up early.	That sounds nice. Did you do anything special to celebrate?"
"My new job is starting tomorrow. I'm feeling nervous, but really optimistic about it.	That's great! What kind is the job in terms of what you'll do every day?  Is there something you like to do there?"
"It's a job they opened up for graphic design! I'm super excited to get started and learn more from them.	That's awesome. What are your plans for tomorrow?"
"Going to my son's first pee-wee football game tomorrow!	That's fun. I have two sons. I'm a big sports fan!"
"He thinks he does.  All I can think of is a bunch of Tiny Titans in helmets running around like chicks in a barnyard.  *chuckle*	That is a good time to be a kid"
"I put in a job application for a new job. I am fairly certain that my credentials are enough to get me the job.	that's great to hear! good for you!"
"I was, I go in next Tuesday. I am pretty excited for them to give me the job.	that's good to have faith in your skills, good for you."
"Me too, we shall see. Now the waiting begins!	I got a call about job with a good company that is in my line of work.	I hope you got it! What is the job about?"
"No, but I have the necessary experience, and I'm optimistic that it will work out.	Oh yeah that's great! What do they offer?"
"I went to the petstore with my dog and he had an accident in front of everyone. He had the saddest look on his face.	Oh I'm so sorry! What a terrible thing for a pet store. Did anyone help clean up?"
"He did, the clerk walked over, told him it was ok and gave him a treat.	That is nice of the pet store owner. I would be a little scared if I saw my dog in such a sad state."
"I had a video job interview. That was a new experience.	oh that was bad, what happened next?"
"I'm not sure. It was a little awkward and stressful.	That can be. What do you think happened in your mind when this happened to you?"
"Sure, that's ok. And thank you.	yeah that's a good way of put it.  I guess it was stressful."
"I've been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and the pain is horrible. The problem is that the medicine that my doctor wants me to take has side effects worse that the pain.	That's terrible, but I'm glad you're trying to get your doctor's advice on what's safe for you to do. I have arthritis and I have to be careful to not overexercice, and my doctor has told me to stop taking my meds if my doctor says I can."
"Maybe, I haven't been back because I can't afford to go right now. I've just been dealing with the pain.	I hope things change for you!"
"It suck.Hopefully we can both get coverage soon.	My son got picked to be on the soccer team that he was on last year!	That's so great! I'm so proud!"
"He is!  Especially since last year's team won the Opening Day Tournament and then won the Regular Season title!	that's great news!"
"Yeah!  We had a group of really talented kids, and some very good [and patient] coahes!	The other day, my three year old didn't know I was paying attention to her while she was playing with the dog. I overheard her trying to teach the dog how to count to ten.	Yeah that's pretty cool.  I bet she was a pretty good teacher."
"Yes, I thought that was pretty good for a three year old. When I asked her about it she said they were playing school. Haha.	Oh wow. That must've been very embarrassing.  I have heard that 3yrs olds can be a bit of a mystery box."
"I'm very proud of her.	Oh that is a good kid. She is a very intelligent one too"
"I babysat and worked odd jobs all summer when i was younger to save up and buy a sega dreamcast.	I'm a Sega Dreamcast fan"
"Yep, i've never looked forward to something so much in my life. I still have the dreamcast as well.	That's pretty cool. I have never seen a console before. Did you play any games?"
"I'm gonna need your support here, because I'm going through something a little bit rough, okay?	Yeah, I know, what happened?"
"I'm 29 years old and I woke up to find that I'd wet the bed last night. I'm...not even sure how. I didn't drink a whole lot before bed or anything.	Oh, wow, you're a little young, huh?"
"Should I see a therapist or anything? Is this indicative of some deep-seated problem that I'm not aware of?	That's terrible, you should definitely talk to a therapist.  Maybe there's something going wrong that you're not aware of."
"My Uncle Jebodiah is always looking out for me. He recently told me that he had a special concoction that if I drank it, it would cure my herpes.	I've never heard of such a concoct. Was he joking about that one too?"
"Listen, my Uncle Jeb wouldn't do me dirty like that. You may call it """"""snake oil"""""" but I call it the miracle cure this world needs. After all, it worked.	You should thank him for that miracle!"
"My cat was kept overnight at the vets recently. I was so worried!	That is a scary thought. What happened? Was it a cat bite?"
"She's fine now! They found out it was something minor after x-rays. I was so relieved.	That sounds scary. What kind of minor issue did it have?"
"My car broke down on a busy highway the other day. There were so many cars zooming past me, it was scary!	That's horrible! Did you call for help?"
"My brother had to pick me up. He had to pull up behind me on the curb. It felt dangerous!	That must've been scary. I hate being stranded on the side road. It's like they say, the closer to home the closer you get to the highway, the less likely you are to be in an emergency. But you never really think of it until something like this happens. I always thought it would be on the side of the road."
"Look, can we just be honest with each other for a second? Having ebola shouldn't mean that I have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions.	I am so mad about this. I am not going to miss a single day of work!"
"I saw one, and he said if I gave him $25,000 he would clear me for flight, but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.	You're right, but if I don't get the money to clear my flight clearance, I'm going into jail!"
"I am obsessive about being ready for anything	I bet. Why?"
"I don't know.  I just see stuff in the grocery store and think I like that food and buy it because it is on sale.  Even if I already have it!	That sounds like a lot to deal."
"My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer.	I've heard those are nasty.  How did she recover?"
"She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.	My girlfriend's leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer. She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.<|eot_id|>"
"It was swallowed whole, unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't have it, and neither will I.	I forgot about plans that I had made with my mother over the weekend.	Oh, that's terrible! How did you feel?"
"I called her right up and we rescheduled! I felt so bad though.	Oh, that is so sweet. You made it right back."
"I was talking to a British friend of mine and trying to explain why our president feels compelled to tweet	I know that feeling. I had to explain that to a group of college students. I think I could have explained it to my 2-year-old."
"They think someone needs to take his phone away	Oh man, I can't even. I would just tell them, ""Hey, he's a politician, he's going to tweet."""
"I was looking through the attic and found a box of childhood toys. They brought back so many memories!	oh, wow! what were those toys? i love to look through boxes of old toys"
"It was nice to find them all and think back to those simpler times	That's great! Did you remember where the box came from?"
"The last trip I took to Chicago was by plane.	That's a long flight, but worth seeing the sights!"
"I had! I love chicago.  The flight is nice and short too, though I wasn't feeling well.	that was a long flight, but you were feeling unwell. i'm sorry.  What happened?  Was it bad food or something?"
"I think my electrolytes were off, I actually fainted on the plane and they made a whole to-do about it.	My university is posting live stream of students moving in and I was reminiscing about when I studied abroad in college	That sounds like fun! Where were they moving from?"
"I studied in Venice Italy and travelled all over Europe	That is cool! I have a degree and went to study abroad in Germany."
"I won a storage shed auction last Monday and found my grandmother's old glass eye in a steamer trunk inside of the shed. Really reminded me of her and how much I miss her.	oh wow. that sounds amazing! did you win it?"
"Rita May. She used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon. Those were such good times.	Yeah, and I'm glad you won!"
"I'm pretty excited for the upcoming Halloween season.	That is awesome! What kind are your plans?"
"Well In September, Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events, after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.	That's awesome! I have friends coming over next year and we're going to be so excited to go!  I'm so jealous!"
"I was loyal to the same company for 10 years.	That is really impressive. What was the company?  What kind was it?"
"Nice. I wasn't rewarded though. They laid me off.	it sucks"
"I told a lie to my mother.	That can be very hurtful. I'm sorry you had that to do. How did you handle it?"
"I was about school. And I eventually confessed.	That happened to you as a kid?"
"I got a job after a long period of unemployment.	That's great! What did you do to prepare?"
"Yes. I was very happy to be gainfully employed.	that's good to have. unemployment can be tough."
"I was in a car accident. Both cars were totaled.	Oh no. Did you have insurance?"
"They were running from the police. It was nerve rattling.	That's horrible! What happened?"
"So my family surprised me this year with a party for my birthday.	It sounds nice. What did they do?"
"They got me the new shoes I've been wanting. I was so elated and had such a good time!	That's so sweet of them! Did they plan a fun activity for you to celebrate your birthday as well?  I hope they had fun time with you!"
"I had a job interview. The guy really knew his stuff.	That sounds awesome. What did he do?"
"Yes, really smart and easy to talk to.	That must have been exciting!"
"I don't know yet.	Our power went off the other night. We were without it until morning!	It is so annoying when that happens!  Did anyone call to see what happened to the breaker box?"
"Someone crashed into the power line I think. It was so quiet and felt pretty spooky.	That's terrible! Did you see anyone?"
"I bought a raffle ticket for a charity where I have a 1/500 chance of winning a car	That is awesome! I bet you were super excited! What was the prize?"
"Yes.  They were $100 but they only sell 500 tickets.  And the money raised goes to breast cancer research	That's great. I don't win much."
"jumpfortherose.com	Someone helped me move.	I did that today."
"Yes, and I paid them with beer. I was thankful because I had a toe injury.	Yeah that was nice of you."
"I bought a powerball ticket last week but did not win	That is unfortunate. I did not win either time I bought one either."
"I would have bought a new car and a house perhaps.  But I lost :-(	Oh well, I'm sure it was just a bad luck. I have never won anything in my life either."
"Yes.  Maybe next time I will win!	I spent Saturday night playing Lord of the Rings Online.	I am not really into online games. What kind is that one?"
"It is good, but I sometimes wonder if I'm trading real life for a fantasy world.	I'm a Lord of the Rings Online player. It's a good time of day for a lot of my friends and I to hang out online."
"I am so mad that our politicians won't do something to stop Russian hacking	I know right, it's like they just let it go on for so long! I am so sick and tired of how corrupt our politics is!  I think they are more concerned with lining up with their rich friends than with helping America!"
"Yes.  The Republicans just don't seem to care about our country any more and I am so mad that Putin owns Trump	Oh, that is a good reason to be mad, and the worst politicians in the world! I hope you will vote them all out next election"
"My goldfish died.	It happens to everyone. I lost a goldfish last year."
"For 4 years. I'm bummed.	That's too long. Did you get a replacement one?"
"Not yet.	I had an unprofessional job interview.	ohh thats no fun"
"The receptionist ignored me, and my interviewer was not prepared.	That's awful. Did you get the interview?"
"My computer crashed while I was working on a project.	That's terrible. Did you lose any data on it?"
"I did. I hadn't saved, and I forgot to set up autosave. It was very frustrating.	That's terrible. Did you save anything important before?"
"My favorite team blew a big lead in the playoffs. It was like drinking sour milk.	I know right! I'm not sure what they did."
"I hate when teams choke. It makes me sick.	Yeah, that can be frustrating."
"I woke up this morning and my eye is itchy and my right eyelid is drooping	I hope it wasnât an infection! Do you have an eye doctor?"
"yeah I am going to see what it seems like tomorrow - not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what	That sucks, maybe you should go to see a doctor"
"Yeah I will if it does not get better quickly	Me and my family went to see a magic show for the first time today.	It was pretty cool! What was it about magic?"
"I didn't catch his name, but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat. Classic trick, but I'll never forget it!	It's so cool!"
"I have a job interview tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it.	That's great! What's the job about for you? I've been in the same job for over a year."
"Yes. It seems like a great opportunity.	That's good news. What kind is it for you to interview about?"
"I scored well on an aptitude test.	That's awesome! What did you get on it? Did it match up?"
"I had a few drinks. I felt good.	ohh wow that's good, good to hear."
"So today my mother brought over a whole week of meals to help me out.	That sounds like she is very kind."
"Yes, she's always helping me out! I am so thankful for her she's an amazing mother.	That's nice of your mother. I have a very loving mother who always puts others' needs before my own."
"So I moved away from my parents not too long ago. It's been a big change.	That's crazy. How long did you live there? How old are your parents now?  How do you miss moving away from them?"
"Out of state. I'm by myself now, so it's pretty quiet! I miss them a lot.	Oh that sucks. What are you moving to?"
"My oldest child needed braces but her health insurance wouldn't cover the expense. It was close to 4000 dollars and we did not have that kind of money at the time.	I am sorry to hear that.  That is a terrible thing.  Hopefully, they found something else to cover the cost."
"Yes they do. My aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn't has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help.	That sounds so sad. I am so proud that your child has an aunt who is so generous and caring. I am sure she was very sad too."
"I was sitting on the couch after a long day taking care of work and all the mommy stuff the other day.	That sounds like a stressful day. Did you get any rest at all that day?"
"It was! My family was happy and together. Chatting and watching tv. Everything just felt right.	That is nice to hear. I hope everything stays that way"
"My husband used to work out of town in a different state Sunday through Thursday.	I bet. How long did he stay away? Did you stay busy while he was away?"
"Yeah, he does work hard. Even thought my children were with me and we kept our usual routines, I was miserable when he was gone. I would cry after he left every Sunday. Luckily now, he has a job where he is home everyday by supper time.	I bet that makes it a lot better."
"We really are, he brings out the best in me.	I didn't have a car to get to and from work, so my parents actually let me just keep theirs for a bit!	That must've been really hard."
"Yeah it was so giving of them to leave it to me for so long and helped me a ton!	That must have been a really tough day for them! I bet! But I'm glad they could see that and help out.  Did they have a car again after a few days? I hope they have a good relationship with their kids now!"
"While driving today I went past my grandma's old house. She passed last year.	I'm sorry for your grandma. I'm sorry for you."
"Oh for sure. Good feelings, but I also miss her so much.	That's nice. I hope you enjoyed driving by her old house."
"I went outside to get my paper this morning. Someone had ran over my mailbox!	Oh, that must've been annoying."
"No, it's completely demolished! I'm feeling pretty annoyed.	Oh that sucks.  Did you report it to the police?"
"My sister is a journalist and she got her first big story published in the paper today!	That's so awesome. What kind is the story?"
"It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her.	That's great! What kind was the big story?"
"So my partner gave me the biggest surprise this week.	I love that! How big?"
"He got us a trip to Hawaii! I couldn't believe it, I am so elated!	oh wow. that's nice of your."
"I finally went and adopted a cat last month and go way more than I expected!	Oh that's so cute. I've always wanted to adopt. What kind of breed of cat is it?"
"Well it was only supposed to be her, but we found out she was pregnant! She popped out a whole litter of adorable.	That is so cool! I hope you have lots of cute cats!"
"I had to leave town last week and that meant leaving my pets who are my babies. I needed someone who could take care of them properly.	oh wow that is very sad"
"It is very hard! The only one who I'd let do it was my sister and she did an amazing job.	Oh no! I'm so glad she was your sister. I hope she'll take you up for a drink soon to make up for it though. I'm a sister myself and I can get a little jealous when I think someone took care of us better than I did. I feel your way. It was a lot of an easy way to repay her, and it made me realize I've been so focused on my own family that I forgot I need to be taking good care of mine."
"So I finally decided to take my dog for his first dog park visit.	I love dog park days!"
"It's hard to tell! He refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play.	I hope he didn't get into trouble at the park!"
"Im embarrassed to admit I forgot to pick up my brother from worth the other day after agreeing to	I remember you forgetting things."
"Ha ha, he was a little miffed. He got over it though when I stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! I felt like such a jerk.	That was funny. It's always hard to remember when you agreed to do something but you don't follow up on it. I think we all do that sometimes."
"I finally took the plunge and decided to go back to school this year.	I did that a year ago. I'm glad you're doing it. What school are you attending?"
"I start next week! I was super hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I'm making myself do it.	That's great. I hope you learn as you teach. What school are you going back for"
"I was going through some stuff and found a box of jewelry my grandparents had gifted me through the years.	That's really sweet. What kind was it?"
"Yeah, it really made me think of them and old times.	that was so sweet, how old were they when you found it?"
"I recently had a shop fix my car. They worked so fast!	oh wow thats so fast"
"I was able to go home, but I realize now that I didn't even have to	That's so awesome! It's always good when someone does that for you!"
"My husband is going through the process of quitting smoking on top of dealing with drama from his parents. He is having a hard time.	That's tough.  Do you think he will succeed?"
"They aren't being supportive at all, but that's not surprising, that don't support him very well in anything. I just wish I could make it better for him, but I can't	I'm sorry.  How long have they both been dealing?"
"I have some great friends. One of them drove me to the airport tomorrow	oh that stunk. what time was it?"
"Yes I am, they are great	That's good! Are they good drivers too?"
"We just found out the person working in our accounting department has been stealing money from our company for years.	That sucks.  I can see why you are so upset.  Was there a reason for it?"
"Yes, it just makes me sick to my stomach. You think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind. I don't get some people	You must feel betrayed. It is so wrong of people to cheat others."
"I miss high school. My girlfriend was the best	oh yeah high school is a nightmare"
"That's great. College was also fun	What did you do in high school"
"I recently bid farewell to a good friend. I miss her	I'm sorry! How long have you been apart for? Did they move away?"
"Thank you, that means a lot. I will see her again	That's so kind of you to be thinking of her. I'm sure it made your heart happy to think about."
"I lost my car keys. I'm such a fool!	Oh no! What happened? Did someone take your keys?"
"That's pretty funny, and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!	Yeah, you'd think it was funny but losing something you own like that would scare the heck outta me."
"I came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over. I've only seen him with a friend over once in my 3.5 years of living here.	I'm sorry, did your roommate invite the friend over or did it by accident?"
"Yeah I sure was, he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.	Oh, I see.  That is good.  He seems to be in a good place."
"One of my co-worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor. It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor.	That's weird, did you tell her about the supervisor?"
"Yeah I figured it was, so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.	That's good that you played dumb and let your supervisor know. It was probably just an innocent misunderstanding, so it's possible that it was just an innocent mistake by your coworker."
"Man there aren't many people I would give my last couple hundred dollars to, with one notable exception.	Yeah, there are so many people out here who are struggling financially."
"My buddy Stefan. He used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters. We sold them and netted $2000 a piece!	That's a lot. I'd want that too! What was it like selling them?"
"I finished first in a race. I feel like gold	That's awesome! What kind of racing was that for you to be talking like gold!"
"Yes! It was my first victory. All my hard work is paying off	that's great news, keep it up!"
"Some of my friends told me that they had a big surprise for me. They know I hate surprises, but I complied and let the blindfold me and drive me out to the location.	That's awesome! What was it?"
"They had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together. It was a flying lesson at the local airport.	that's really generous of them! did you have fun?"
"I found an old photo album at my grandma's house that had pictures of me when I was a kid	That's so cool! Did you show your kids those?"
"Yeah, it did. I really miss the 90s. Everything seemed a lot simpler in those days	I am sure it was a good time back in your childhood days."
"When I was in middle school, I had a friend come over to ride horses with me. After riding my mother pressured me to get on a horse bareback I wasn't comfortable riding. She made such a big scene that I got on to make her stop.	that's awesome, you're a brave person!"
"Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents, it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.	Yeah, that was really embarrassing. I would have just laughed it off and said something like ""Mommy, you're so crazy!"" but instead she just yelled at me for like an hour. It's like she thought she was the only one who could ride a horse or something."
"My friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him, but I haven't been rollerblading since I was a little kid. I didn't want to roll into a car.	I know right! It's like you're a rollerblading baby again"
"We went, but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.	I love rollerblading but I understand why it might be scary."
"My husband is on the road a lot, I hardley ever see him.	I bet, how often"
"Yes, its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.	That sucks. I have to go to a lot of work functions myself. But I understand the sacrifices your making. I just wish he didn't go so much. It's hard."
"I have an interview for a job that I don't feel qualified for	I know how you're doing, but you should really work hard on this interview"
"I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard	That can be nerve wrecking, especially when interviewing."
"I'm moving in a few months to a new state, I'm starting to feel nervous.	That is exciting! Where are you moving to in this state?"
"To my husband hometown so it'll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family.	That must be scary to start over, but it can also be a chance to start fresh and do new things!"
"I saw a dog get hit by car today on the highway.	I am so mad right."
"It was pretty tramatic, I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No, I was on my way to work, I couldn't stop :(	Yeah that's terrible. I can't believe people are driving so fast and they don't see animals in their way."
"I can't even begin to tell you how nervous I was about my first tattoo.	That must have felt bad"
"Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood, and my pain threshold was low at the time. It turned out great though, and now I have several!	Yeah tattooing sounds terrifying!"
"I love my husband! He has been so sweet this week!	I bet! What's he done recently?  I love when that type thing happens!"
"He knew I had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and Taco Bell! It's the little things :)	That's so kind of your spouse, it's so nice that you appreciate him for that! I'm so lucky that my spouse loves me back!"
"It's been a great week!	I love Fridays. What's the reason?"
"I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting!	That's great! Congratulations! What did they offer you in terms of pay?"
"Music is a powerful thing. Sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place. You know what I mean?	I agree, music has the power of transporting us. It is so unique"
"Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.	I am sure he will be in good hands. I hope so too. I know it can be tough. I hope so for you too. It will take time.  I remember my grandma passing away. I hope so too. It was a tough time for me."
"I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories.	That's nice, I like to have a stuffed animal around sometimes too."
"Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.	Oh man, I love those old stuffed animals! I used mine all the time when I was a little girl"
"My dog got hit by a car.	That's terrible. I hope he's okay. I've been in some terrible accidents."
"He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.	That sucks. I'm sorry for your loss."
"Some random guy was in my backyard, I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.	That's crazy! Was he there to do anything?"
"Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first.	Oh, that's a little too much to ask for permission, right.  I mean, I understand that you were busy, but maybe he could have just asked you first.  Maybe he was just a little too aggressive about his cable installation and thought that you didn't care.  I mean, I don't think I would have wanted to ask permission to enter my yard either, but that's not really what he did, right?"
"My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.	It's hard when people have to say their last words while they're still suffering from illness"
"My siblings and I are managing, and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.	I'm so sorry to hear that. It's been two years and I hope it's been a while."
"I've got a week off from work. Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.	That's great news! What shows are you binge-walking?"
"I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time	What shows is that about?"
"I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.	Oh wow. What kind were you in grad school in?"
"That is what I was thinking at the time, but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.	Yeah, it is tough."
"I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.	That's awful. Did anyone laugh?"
"It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.	That's terrible! Did you trip again on your way back?"
"My boyfriend is sick. He can't eat much so I made some soup for him	That sounds great.  Did he like it?"
"I made chicken noodle soup.	That is kind of gross.  I would rather he eat something else.  How long will it last him for?"
"I had a meeting last week where I gave a presentation over the wrong documentation and no one said anything until after the meeting.	That's a bumpy start to the meeting. I bet the boss was not pleased."
"After I figured out what I did, I sure was. Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.	That's frustrating, did they apologize to anyone?"
"I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend.	that's good!"
"It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.	That is awesome! Are you nervous about this meeting?"
"I caught my boyfriend texting his ex	oh, i see. I thought you said you caught him?"
"It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her	That's a good point, but also, maybe he was trying to get back together or something. I hope so!"
"I know I broke up with my ex, but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.	that's weird. I know it's weird when exes talk about other people. I think that's why."
"We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial, i think he does too.	That is good.  You guys are good friends."
"I can't wait to see my final grades. I think I got all A's this semester.	It's good that you worked hard."
"On Monday. I'm going to treat myself if I did well	That's a good thing. You should get them on Monday. You deserve it after all you've been through!  You're going to treat yourself and go get some cake!"
"I was very upset when I found my kitten today.	It is always sad when you find out something has happened that you thought was safe."
"No, I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.	I am sorry. I hope he is okay."
"I cried a bit, but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out.	I enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion.	I bet you do. Nursing homes can be fun places to visit."
"Not really, I take my daughter to see them, so many of them have no visitors at all.	it's a good experience. I used to be a bit of a shy kid but now I'm a big deal."
"She likes to bake, so we take them what she makes :)	That's so cool."
"She is pretty good for an eleven year old, better than I was.	That sounds like you guys like her baking a lot!"
"I had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her, as well as get off my chest. I know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her.	That's really sweet of you.  I'm glad you confided in your mom.  I have a secret too, but I'm too scared."
"Yes, I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!	Oh wow! That must've been very special for you. What was it?"
"My son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us. I was anxious and nervous waiting to see if he was accepted!	oh man that's so cool. what is he going for admission to?"
"He did! He's in his 3rd year, going to be an Aerospace Engineer, so we are very proud of him.	Wow that's great news! I hope he has a long career ahead of himself.  What major is he interested in?"
"My sister passed away several years ago. She took her life, and my mother and I found her right after she did it. This was very painful, traumatic and hard for us all.	That must've been really tough."
"It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile, she was in denial. But, it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile, as she was my only sibling and we were very close.	I'm sorry you had to deal through such a difficult situation.  It's always good for you though to go into a depression and then come out stronger.  You'll get through it.  It's not the end.  I know that."
"When my son first started college, I felt so much love and affection, but it was definitely hard to see him go! I was very proud though.	That's great! How old was he?"
"He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's focused on science, engineering, etc. He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer. It's great to see him go for his dreams!	That's great! I'm glad to hear. I'm happy you're so happy for him. He's going to do great things! I'm proud too! He's always been so focused on his studies. He's a smart one too! I wish I had been more supportive when he first came to college, but I'm happy I could be more supportive now when I can see the impact."
"We went on vacation a few weeks ago and went to the beach, It was so relaxing and great. I really enjoyed the time with my family.	Oh that's so nice! Where did you go?"
"That's great! I'm sure you earned it, just like we do. It's so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!	I'm sure you did, you deserve it too. I'm happy I could remind myself of the importance. I'm going to go back this weekend and spend time on the beach again!"
"I am looking forward to next week! My husband has been out of town on business for several weeks and comes home next weekend!	That's exciting! What is he doing?"
"I am going to cook a special meal and see if he wants to go out, just us two. I know he will like that.	That's so cool! I hope you two make up next weekend!"
"My husband has been out of town a few weeks for work but is coming back next weekend. I have a surprise night planned for just us. I am optimistic and sure he will really enjoy it.	That's really sweet of him. What are you having planned?"
"Thanks! We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.	I hope you both have a wonderful night and enjoy each other! I've been married 24 years and have to be careful not to spoil things!  I like to surprise the husband. It keeps him young at heart!  I love my wife, we've always been so good about keeping things fun and exciting."
"My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!	Oh yeah, time flies. I'm not sure I'm ready yet. I'm a bit of an old schooler myself. But yes, time really goes fast. It's nice to reminisce about the past."
"Yes, very. But, time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!	It's great that he's grown. I remember going back. I was so young."
"I was promoted to a Team Leader and I felt very secure I could do well at the job. I had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role.	I wish you were successful, that sounds good."
"Yes, thank you! I had worked very hard through the years, and I felt that I earned it, and would do well at it.	That's good to hear that! Congratulations!"
"There was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him. I was so mad, beyond angry!	That must have been scary! Did you call back the police?"
"Yes, and she had two children of her own, similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle, that made her mad! Can you believe that??	Oh man, that sounds terrible. I hope it was just an innocent mistake, and not something more sinister going on there"
"Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.	That's so exciting. What's your granddaughter like?"
"It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing.	It's okay, kids are worried all the time too. They're excited to go."
"I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!	That can be frustrating."
"I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.	Yeah i feel your pain, i always forget something and then have to scramble to buy it.  I once left my wedding rings in the car while we were driving to the wedding venue and they ended up getting stolen. I'm a little jealous of the rings. I'm going on a cruise in a few days so I will be sure to do everything in advance to avoid any mistakes"
"One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me, while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!	That's weird, did you guys not feel uncomfortable with it?"
"I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....	I bet she felt betrayed."
"The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.	That's so scary! Did you call 911 or call the police?"
"No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.	That's a bit scary, did you ever see anyone else?"
"I was trying to ignore the fact that my 50th birthday was coming up but my family decided to throw me a surprise party.	That's awesome. What a surprise. Did you get the gift you asked for?"
"It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more	That is awesome! Did anyone bring cake or balloons?"
"A few weeks ago, my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things, and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.	That's terrible, did you both work out of it?"
"Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later.	That's terrible, did he say anything?"
"One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.	That would have scared you, right?"
"Yes, and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But, luckily, it turned out to be my shadow!	I am sorry but I think you might have had something else there instead. I would have noticed it."
"There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	That was very honest."
"Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it.	That's very kind of you, to think that."
"When my children were born, it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.	That's awesome. What were their ages when they were born?"
"Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.	That's great to have two children. I hope you are enjoying them."
"I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.	its tough"
"Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.	I agree completely with you there."
"They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!	I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.	That's crazy! What kind was that car?"
"Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.	Yeah, traffic in LA can be pretty bad. But, at the end of the day, you're gonna drive anyway.  It's your job."
"I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.	that sounds great. What did they do to help you lose weight?"
"It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them	That sounds like it is really helpful to have support, especially when you are trying to change your body.  Do you have any tips on how they help with losing weight?"
"A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!	I would be too."
"I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!	I'm glad you were successful."
"Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!	I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.	That's great! Christmas memories can bring back such wonderful times. What kind did the old cards hold special for?"
"It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?	I don't know, but I like throwing cards away, but then I think about the people."
"That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!	That sounds like a lot!"
"I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.	Yeah, they were like a bunch of wild animals."
"When I was entering the store it was really slippery.	I know that. It was a bit icy."
"It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.	I bet that hurt! Did you hurt yourself too bad?"
"I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.	I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.	I do, what's it about?"
"I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.	I understand.  You should probably call her."
"Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.	I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.	Oh. I hope everything goes okay."
"I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.	Oh no, that's terrible."
"It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.	I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!	That's really cool!"
"She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.	that makes sense.  i used to be the nervous type when it comes driving.  but over the years, it gets easier and easier.  the important thing is to stay safe and follow the rules of the road."
"Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.	That's nice that you're taking care of her and trying to help her. I'm glad to hear!"
"I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!	Yeah that's great news! You and her are going to be great driving together soon"
"My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.	That can happen to us too."
"I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*	I hope everything gets cleaned.  I hope everything gets put back.  I hate mess"
"My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.	That's so kind of him. He's really good at that. He always looks out for me."
"We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.	that sounds good"
"We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.	it's so nice that they've been friends for that long."
"Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)	I completely understand that. I've been there too. But, at the same time, sometimes it takes a while. I'm happy for you. I wish you and your friend well."
"My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.	That's great! I'm glad to hear that. I've always been proud to be the parent of a smart kid.  I'm glad he's going where he wants. It's not every kid who is going on a good path. You must be so happy to hear this.  I'm sure it's going well for you."
"I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!	I'm sure they do. They're smart and talented young kids. It's good to appreciate them when they're young."
"Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.	That sounds like fun! Where are you going? Are there new foods you are trying out on the job?"
"I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.	That's great! Are you nervous?"
"I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.	It is very sad.  I have heard stories of people losing their family in different countries."
"Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.	I'm sorry to tell. I hope you were able to cope with your grief. I know I did. I hope you too."
"Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!	It really isn, not. We had to get her to the church early and get her to the funeral."
"She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!	emy grandparents helped me get to the US airport and to New York airport"
"I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before	That's awesome! What game are it?"
"I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.	that's cool, I bet you can play it on the go now!"
"My father passed away 2 years ago, but my mother lives in my neighborhood now. I'm so thankful she lives close by and still here with us. She's such a wonderful mother.	That must be tough.  I have a few family that live close by me and it's hard.  It seems like everyone has their own."
"I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.	that is such nice of you to think that. I know it's hard. I'm just trying to be there for her as much as possible. I'm not sure she knows I know, but I think she knows. I know how hard this life can be. I know how much I miss my mom."
"I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!	I know how you feel. My neighbor's dog is getting a new dog walker!"
"The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...	What video games do they have up there?"
"Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!	My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it	That's so cool! Where did he or she come from and when was the visitation period?  Did you have any good time together?"
"We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor	That's pretty rare! Did you guys hang out for a long time or just for an hour or so? What kind of things do you guys do in your free time?"
"I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten, with no collar, in a window well.	That must've been scary. Did you try to save it?"
"We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!	kes of doubt, i was scared!"
"I felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself	I bet that felt very lonely."
"I did not, I was little but I think I put it back into a tree	Oh wow that's really sad.  What happened to the baby bird?"
"Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving	It's normal to have some anxiety about graduation, though."
"Yep, had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out	oh thats so bad, how old are u?"
"I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!	I forgot a few times too.  What did you tell your mother in?"
"I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :(	Yeah, that's why you have to make it a habit to remind each of them every month or something."
"You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???	I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party, not my greatest moment	That's okay, you did what everyone else did.  It is what you wear to the party that matters, not what you wore to the party."
"I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret	That is so cool. I wish you could go on more of these."
"I had some trippy nightmares as a kid, now I don't really have dreams	I bet they were creepy. Do you remember what they said?"
"Yeah, it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me, pretty weird	Oh, that's cool, I used to have nightmares about being chased by animals"
"I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards	That's terrible! How long were they stealing from?"
"No, I was scared to get charged, but I stopped after that	that's good to know that you know what's right and what's wrong with stealing"
"I was at a meditation retreat last year for 10 days and I can say that I experienced a better feeling there than I could ever remembe	Oh wow! What was the theme of your trip?"
"Yeah, thankfully there's an app for that - Headspace (no I am not sponsored)	That's really interesting. I think meditation is one thing you have to try out for yourself to believe it. It takes a lot of willpower to try to mediate."
"I am really looking forward to going away for the holidays.	It's always fun to get a break from school/work/etc"
"I want to go see the Harry Potter land at Universal, the kids will love it.	I love the parky too!"
"They love the films, plus getting to ride Hogwarts Express, score!	I'm really hoping my acceptance letter shows up in the mail soon.	I bet! Are you a college major?"
"Law School, I'm pretty sure I got in to my first choice, but you never know.	That's great news! I'm so happy for you!"
"Thank you, fingers are crossed.	I just ordered a new cookery book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. I want to delve in and try lots of new recipes!	That sounds exciting! What kind is it about cooking?  Do they have any tips for beginners or do you already cook a lot of dishes yourself?  I'm always looking to try new things out!"
"I'm vegetarian and cook all sorts of different cuisines - Indian, Italian, American. The only cuisine I'm not good at is Chinese. How about you?	I am not much of Chinese food either. I do know that I have a lot of different cultures to explore, and I am eager to try out the new cookery."
"Have you heard of Mark Bittman's book How to Cook Everything Vegetarian? That's the book I'm waiting impatiently for!	I witnessed the most epic bottle flip in the history of bottle flips at my school	That's pretty cool, what kind did you witness?"
"Yee yee, it landed on this little ledge that was super high up.	Wow that is a great way of putting it.  Did you feel like a rockstar watching?"
"My little grandson just came home from the hospital. He was born premature and weighted under 2 pounds.	That must be so exciting!  What's he looking like?"
"He is doing well, thank you. And we are so thankful everything is ok. It was touch and go for awhile	That's great!  I'm sorry his mom and baby are going to have to go back to the hospital soon.  I've heard those are the worst.  I hope he stays healthy!"
"I love my girlfriend. She would never cheat on me	That's so true. She's always there for you, and that's what matters."
"I hope to make her my wife some day!	That is a very optimistic view of the world. I think a lot of people are very pessimistic about love and relationships nowadays."
"My sister spilled some milk on me. It set me off!	That's the worst. Did you go back for it? I don't think that's the right way to handle it"
"It was indeed a mistake. My clothes are fine now.	Oh, that was funny."
"I recently did not pay my rent. My land lord has been terrible at providing services	I would have called and spoken to someone."
"He decided to start caring and doing his part.	I know that feels good to not pay rent"
"I'm thankful that I was able to repair my tire before it went flat on my car	That must've saved you a lot of money."
"Right, I caught it just as it happened and brought it to the shop, didn't cost as much as I thought it would either.	That is so lucky you caught it right on the way you did it."
"I love my friend. She just drove me to class	Oh wow. What kind is she driving?"
"I think I am getting her a gift soon!	Yeah, that would be so kind of your bestestestest friend"
"I stole from my friends when I was a child. I feel terrible about it now	Oh, that is terrible! What did they take from you for it?"
"It was some Pokemon cards!	Oh, that is terrible. I would have done something the other night if I was in a similar situation. I hope your friendship is stronger than your actions. I would say that is the most regretful part of life, the regret over your actions."
"My father almost passed away last year. It was very tough on everyone	I'm sorry, I hope everything worked well for him.  I know how much I wish my dad would still with us."
"Yes, he has made a full recovery! It's been a journey	That's great to hear.  I'm sorry for your family.  I know you can handle tough times."
"I remember when I was a young one. I loved life.	That was the good old days. When people actually talked to each other."
"I do, but maybe not with he same flare as before	Oh, yes, life was better then. I miss the good times."
"I helped find my friend's cats. She's glad they're back now	That must have been hard for you to deal with. How did they do once you got back them?"
"Yes they both just wandered off when the door was open!	What cats?"

I don't know much about it but I know some friends have been taken advantage by some fake religious organizations"
